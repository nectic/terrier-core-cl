 The mother of a newborn baby apparently discarded shortly after birth and 
killed by pit bulls in the back yard of a house in Pomona was arrested and 
booked for investigation of murder, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police withheld the name of the 20-year-old woman and details about the case 
pending an afternoon news conference.But Police Lt. Ron Frazier confirmed that 
the mother was arrested Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The newborn boy was killed by pit bulls Friday, apparently shortly after 
birth. "It appears to be a home birth that ended in the death of the infant 
boy," Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy determined the newborn was alive when he was abandoned in the yard 
and was mauled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pit bulls were in the yard when police found the body. The boy was missing 
an arm and genitals and had head wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators and the Humane Society will determine the fate of the dogs.

SCOTT HARRIS: A STREET PERSPECTIVE ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been very worth it. All of us are on this planet to do good for somebody. 
-- Mike Huffington, on spending $28 million of his own money in his 
unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate She was bundled up against the night chill, a 
familiar figure waiting strategically between Times Mirror Square and the 
biggest employee parking garage. She wore a white baseball cap and a friendly 
smile. She extended her hand. Her voice was a raspy whisper, but it was 
impossible to make out the words. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to be a soft touch for panhandlers, but the years have made me more 
circumspect. These days, I'm more wary that my loose change supports a crack or 
liquor habit. Trial and error has taught me that to ignore a beggar, to walk 
past this woman as if she didn't exist, would insult both her dignity and mine. 
So I usually say no, or at least shake my head. 
</P>
<P>
 This time I reached into my pocket. Why I'm not sure, but a few minutes 
earlier, I watched Gov. Wilson on TV, aglow with victory as he praised 
California's generosity of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave the woman a few coins. Felt like two quarters and a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless you," she rasped, giving a tiny bow of her head. "God bless you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her name is Jamilah. She is 46 years old and black. In Downtown L.A., most 
street people are African Americans, the descendants of the only group of 
immigrants who came to this land against their will. 
</P>
<P>
 I was nearly to my car when it occurred to me that, especially on Election 
Day, everybody has a certain expertise. Some spin doctors get paid big money to 
talk on TV. It seemed fair that Jamilah's was entitled an extra dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 We exchanged names and pleasantries. Jamilah said she lived in San Francisco 
for years before and owned "a bead store" before coming south for a change of 
scenery. She arrived in Los Angeles two years ago, and on her first night in 
town, somebody broke into her room down by the Greyhound station and took 
everything she had. Jamilah said she's been homeless ever since, relying on 
strangers she regards as friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six thousand people work here," she said, looking up at the edifice of Times 
Mirror Square. "Everybody here knows Jamilah. Everybody likes Jamilah. They're 
real nice to me." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she doesn't collect welfare, but gets by on handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I sleep around the corner, in the alley with the rest of my 
comrades," she said, still smiling. "Sometimes I get enough money to get a 
room." A girlfriend, she explained, lives at the St. George Hotel. For $7, the 
manager lets Jamilah stay with her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Her eyes were watery. There was no tell-tale smell on her breath, but it was 
still my duty to ask the pertinent questions. Jamilah assured me that, no, she 
doesn't have a problem with liquor or drugs. Her only medication, she said, is 
for asthma. Jamilah laughed when asked whether she had a history of mental 
problems. "You're talking to me. Does it seem like I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 No, it didn't. In this superficial encounter, Jamilah just seemed eccentric. 
In any case, I just wanted her insights, her opinions, on Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamilah didn't vote, but she was glad to hear that Proposition 187 was winning 
big. "There are a lot of people here that need medical help and schooling," she 
said. "I feel they should vote yes and send them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many people, Jamilah equated "illegal immigrants" with Mexicans, and she 
blamed them for taking jobs from African Americans. Mexicans, she said, are 
willing to work for lower wages. But even at equal pay, she said, employers 
would prefer to hire Mexicans "because they're a lighter color." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamilah's platform, not unlike President Clinton's, calls for welfare reform 
too. That way, she explained, "people would get jobs and the women would stop 
having so many babies." 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't going to solve all of America's problem this night, but Jamilah had 
a suggestion on how to start: 
</P>
<P>
 "Treat everybody equal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fate, of course, doesn't treat everybody equal. Nobody gets to pick their 
parents. Some are blessed by accident of birth and some are not. Some have $28 
million to pursue their own ambitions and some scrounge for $7 to buy a roof 
each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamilah didn't know much about Mike Huffington, perhaps because she doesn't 
see much TV. She was rooting for Kathleen Brown and especially Dianne 
Feinstein. "She was a good mayor of San Francisco when I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at this point that Jamilah spotted an intruder. He was about 25 years 
old, able-bodied and black. He said he needed 75 cents for the bus. Jamilah lit 
into him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you are really disrespectful!" she scolded. "I'm begging here myself! I'm 
begging here!" 
</P>
<P>
 The young man shrugged and went on his way. She didn't ask, but I gave Jamilah 
another dollar.

ENTITLEMENT CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Bromides That Cause Headaches," editorial, Oct. 25: 
</P>
<P>
 The only medicine that will cure the tax and/or spend debate is the bitter one 
of telling senior citizens, government retirees and others who receive 
entitlements that they are going to get less.Seemingly, no politician wants to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
 If those of us in the above groups, and I assume we're in the millions, would 
each take, according to the amount of our benefits, a small cut or pay a few 
dollars more yearly for Medicare, I bet we could save Social Security, etc., 
for future generations.  
</P>
<P>
 Give us the bad news. I'm ready to vote for someone who does.

DEMOCRATIC WIPEOUT, VOTER ANGER AND CALIFORNIA'S CHALLENGE; THE ELECTION 
APPARENTLY MARKS A NEW ERA IN POLITICS, AND ONE THAT DEMANDS A NEW INTEGRITY IN 
POLITICAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The political aftershocks continue, from the halls of Capitol Hill to the 
State House in Sacramento. Nov. 8, 1994, marked the back-to-the-future 
election, the biggest change in Washington since Dwight D. Eisenhower was 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Old Party, typically affiliated with the status quo, became the 
party of change. President Clinton was dealt what could only be charitably 
described as a slap in the face as most of the candidates he personally 
campaigned for fell in defeat. Senate Democrats Edward M. Kennedy of 
Massachusetts and Charles S. Robb, who was facing Iran-Contra prevaricator 
Oliver L. North in Virginia's race for the Senate, were among the exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans now hold majorities in the Senate and the House of 
Representatives, and a majority of the 50 governors is now Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 National Democratic stars such as Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and Gov. Ann 
Richards of Texas are out, replaced by relative GOP unknowns like George 
Pataki, as well as by GOP royalty like George W. Bush, son of the former 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats took body blows at every level. Even the House majority leader, 
Democrat Thomas S. Foley of Washington, couldn't win a seat in Congress 
Tuesday, though Republican Sonny Bono (late of Sonny and Cher) could. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters were in an exasperated and surly mood. Plainly, Americans want 
government to deliver, even if they are not always clear on exactly what they 
want delivered. Let the new GOP majority be warned: Everything in Tuesday's 
vote indicates that if voters don't get satisfaction, the electorate will seek 
more vengeance at the polls two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 WILSON'S HUGE CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE: Here in California Gov. Pete Wilson has 
won reelection, and he won big. His significant victory over Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown has fueled speculation that Wilson already is running for a bigger 
political prize, the White House. However, he must face a more immediate 
concern -- governing California after an election season that clearly revealed 
the deep fissures along the state's ethnic, racial and class lines.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the challenge that confronts Wilson: Will he put campaigning behind 
him now and govern as the moderate leader of all Californians or will he 
continue in campaign mode, which can only deepen the scars left from the 
divisive campaign for Proposition 187? Wilson's words on Wednesday were right: 
" . . . there is no room in California for bigotry, discrimination. We will 
continue to condemn intolerance. We will continue to protect individual rights. 
This is a commitment we make to all Californians without regard to ethnic 
origin or skin color. It applies regardless of whether the English they speak 
is with an accent." 
</P>
<P>
 But the actions Wilson took early Wednesday were not nearly so encouraging. He 
issued an executive order to begin implementation of the measure that will cut 
off social services to illegal immigrants, including an immediate cutoff of 
prenatal health care. He also attempted to define what under Proposition 187 
would be a "reasonably suspect" person: one who fails to provide documentation 
of legal residency. But what exactly does that mean? Would a driver's license 
with an address be enough to satisfy law enforcement officials?  
</P>
<P>
 The Times strongly opposed Proposition 187, for the wrongheaded way it 
attempted to "Do Something" about illegal immigration. The inherent unfairness 
of Latinos being targeted as "reasonably suspect" for no reason other than 
ethnicity, the unanswered questions about how it would be implemented and the 
lawsuits expected to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court were just three 
of many reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 passed with large support, by a 59% vote, a strong measure of 
just how much voters are demanding that politicians focus on the very real 
problem of illegal immigration. The measure received a majority vote only from 
whites but was astoundingly close among Asian Americans (54% against to 46% 
for) and African Americans (56% against to 44% for). Among Latino voters, the 
measure failed big, 78% to 22%. That disparity reflects one of those fissures 
Wilson must now address -- constructively, as the governor, not as a candidate. 
For instance, California's population is at least one-quarter Latino, but only 
8% of those who voted Tuesday were Latino. That fact is distressing and serves 
no one's long-term interests. It is a question for Wilson and all of 
California's other political leaders: how best to register more Latinos and 
thus encourage greater participation -- and power -- at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RAZOR-CLOSE SENATE RACE: Sen. Dianne Feinstein apparently is the winner in 
a race that, based on her record and her opponent's lack of one, should never 
have been close. It's a measure of the power of negative television and radio 
ads that this race came down to the wire. In the final days of the campaign, 
charges from both camps about employing illegal immigrants (Rep. Mike 
Huffington admitted hiring an illegal immigrant, in violation of federal law), 
not policy issues, dominated the debate. For all the public bemoaning of 
negative campaigning, candidates -- unfortunately -- resort to it for a good 
reason: It apparently works. Feinstein, once the state's most popular 
politician because of her solid record of achievement, sank in the polls once 
Huffington, a relative political unknown before this campaign, began spending 
heavily, attacking her at every turn in paid ads. A laugher race became a real 
horse race. More than 500,000 key absentee ballots are still uncounted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 STATE ISSUES: Besides Proposition 187, another daunting problem looms: the 
state budget. Wilson and the Legislature, which also gained several 
Republicans, must come up with a responsible plan for long-term financing in 
California. The serious budget problems facing this state will only be 
exacerbated by the passage of Proposition 184, the "three-strikes" crime 
measure that is expected to increase the cost of corrections by a crushing 
120%, adding about $5.5 billion to an already overburdened state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, thankfully, a glimmer of good news: the resounding defeat of 
Proposition 188, the pro-smoking measure masquerading as an anti-smoking 
measure. The measure, bankrolled primarily by Philip Morris, the tobacco maker, 
started out as popular in the polls, and no wonder. It was billed as offering 
"tough, statewide" smoking restrictions, but it turned out Proposition 188 
would have thrown out the much tougher restrictions already passed by the 
Legislature. The word got out. The voters got it. The deceit failed. The 
message is as clear as the air in a smoke-free restaurant: The Legislature had 
best not tamper with the stringent smoking law due to go into effect in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT NEXT?: What will the GOP do with its newfound power? Is it a recipe for 
more gridlock between a Democratic President and a GOP Congress? For the 
moment, at least, putative Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich promise to work with the President on behalf of the national 
interests. Although he certainly had precious little choice, a conciliatory 
Clinton extended the olive branch Wednesday, vowing to work with Republicans on 
free trade, welfare reform, reducing federal spending and other issues on which 
he and the GOP naturally converge. Given the events of the California election, 
immigration reform also probably will make its way onto the national agenda, 
which is exactly where it belongs. Feinstein, who already has worked diligently 
on increasing law enforcement at the border, should be helpful in pushing 
immigration reform in a sensible and fair-minded way. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of tax reduction, too, was big in Washington Wednesday. It's going to be 
a neat trick to see exactly how Congress and the President achieve that without 
cutting what amount to huge middle-class entitlement programs -- Social 
Security and Medicare.  
</P>
<P>
 In Washington the air is thick with pledges of bipartisan cooperation and 
moving ahead. What Washington must do first is get a clear reading on just what 
voters want it to move ahead on. Here in California, the air is thick with 
unanswered questions as the state and the nation wait to see how California 
will handle the passage of a Draconian anti-illegal immigration measure. 
Passage of Proposition 187 carries the potential to either galvanize positive 
reform in Washington or, if handled badly, tear the state apart. Gov. Wilson, 
which shall it be?

REAGAN'S DISCLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Americans must be shaken, and saddened, by news that former President 
Ronald Reagan is battling with Alzheimer's disease (Nov. 6). And to those 
feelings, they must add admiration and respect. With characteristic courage, 
Reagan has openly acknowledged his illness and the burden that it inevitably 
places on his wife, family and other loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this disease still has no effective treatment, and no means of 
prevention. But to borrow one of President Reagan's favorite metaphors, the 
dawn of discovery in neuroscience is beginning to lift the darkness of this 
dread disease. Progress has been so rapid and promising that we may be 
permitted to hope that some of its first benefits may come in time to lighten 
Reagan's journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of 1992, 133 of America's preeminent neuroscientists, under the 
aegis of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives, publicly stated their 
conviction that, by the year 2000, neuroscience could expect to have discovered 
the defective genes in familial Alzheimer's disease and have developed new 
drugs and other measures to alleviate the symptoms of all versions of 
Alzheimer's. Recent progress strongly confirms their confidence. Just last 
year, for example, the first major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's was 
uncovered -- the E4 version of the APOE gene. Now that at least one marker for 
genetic risk has been identified, scientists are able, for the first time, to 
do comparative studies on people who carry that risk marker, as well as studies 
within the population of those who already have developed the disease. The 
ultimate target of this research: discover methods to delay onset of the 
illness; formulate medications to enable patients to live longer, more 
functional lives; and perhaps even correct defective genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that longed-for day, all Americans should pray for the President and his 
family. He has served us once more.

NATIONAL HISTORY STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a secondary school history teacher for 38 years and the author of more than 
30 history books for high school and middle school students, I heartily commend 
your editorial praising the new national standards for United States history 
(Oct. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of perpetuating the boring practice of asking students to regurgitate 
isolated names, events, and dates, the new standards challenge youngsters to 
apply historical evidence and critical thinking to understanding what has 
happened in the past and what is happening today. These standards are rigorous 
and demanding; students first must acquire a broad base of related information 
before they can meaningfully investigate major historical themes, trends and 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The political tone of the standards is moderate, as might be expected since 
their validation was the product of a consensus reached by hundreds of 
historians and secondary school teachers -- both Republicans and Democrats.  
</P>
<P>
 One great strength of the standards is their inclusive approach to our 
history. The roles played by women and minorities are at long last properly 
recognized as significant factors in weaving the multifaceted fabric that we 
call the American experience.

 * I strongly disagree with your editorial. As a high school student 10 years 
ago, I learned about Harriet Tubman and Robert E. Lee. However, the recommended 
standards mention Tubman several times without mentioning Lee once. How can any 
truly serious history of our nation possibly gloss over the name of a man whose 
tormented soul gives such insight into the secession of the South and the 
bloodiest war in our history? 
</P>
<P>
 I also remember learning about the plight of black slaves, women and their 
fight for suffrage, and the brutal treatment of Native Americans. Additionally, 
I learned about the hundreds of thousands of white and black male Union 
soldiers who died on American battlefields, at least in part so that black 
slaves would be freed. Were these Americans not all "common," and the very 
people your editorial suggests were excluded from history books until now? 
</P>
<P>
 History is a time line of recorded events in which human beings interacted; we 
study it so that we might learn more about the human experience. It is true 
that American history has been disproportionately guided by white males. But is 
this a reason to rewrite lopsided history books which teach kids about the 
bravery of Tubman, but de-emphasize great (white) men like Ulysses S. Grant and 
Thomas Edison, and overplay the role of the KKK and McCarthyism? 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Cheney, former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and 
Rush Limbaugh are right: These "standards" should be "flushed down the toilet."

PROP. 187 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to thank the students of the Los Angeles Unified School District for 
deciding my vote on Proposition 187. I was fully convinced that I should vote 
no because I felt that the issue was unjust until I saw all of the students 
marching in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 I realized that my tax dollars were being spent to keep these student in 
school and here they were not in school but out on the streets protesting a 
political issue! That made me realize that if 187 passed, this situation would 
not be occurring in the future and I decided to change my vote to a yes!

things and go home.

PERSPECTIVES ON ELECTION '94; IT'S REHAB TIME FOR THE DEMOCRATS; LET THE 
CONSERVATIVES GO, EMBARK ON A PARTYWIDE SOUL-SEARCHING -- AND CULTIVATE A 
LIBERAL NEWT GINGRICH. 
</P>

University and the author of House and Senate (Norton, 1989.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawrence of Arabia once mused that "there could be no honor in a sure success, 
but much might be wrested from a great defeat." This is a precept that 
Democrats might want to embrace in the aftermath of Tuesday's cataclysm. As 
they sift through the ashes of their party and search for items of value that 
might be salvaged, the one sure thing that can be plucked from the debris is a 
matchless opportunity for a top-to-bottom examination of what the Democratic 
Party is and ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
 What needs to be done is not some post-election assessment that focuses on the 
mechanics of campaigns, such as fund-raising or advertising, but a searching of 
the party's soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a catharsis is not simply necessary; it is long overdue. It needed to be 
done in the aftermath of the Reagan victory in 1980 when the fortunes of the 
party sunk with the loss of the Senate majority and effective control of the 
House. That opportunity to define what the nation's oldest political party 
actually stood for never took place because the surviving Democrats were 
fearful of alienating their brethren in Congress. When certain liberal members 
did attempt to invoke the legacy of Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Johnson in 
the House Democratic Caucus' strategy sessions, a chorus of pragmatists cried 
that clarifying the party's principles would send the conservative Democrats 
into the arms of the Republicans, and with their departure would go the party's 
majority, and with it the chairmanships and other emoluments of majority 
status. Gillis W. Long of Louisiana, caucus chairman at the time, announced 
that his job was "to unify, not purify," and that basically ended the 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The party's fortunes improved in the 1982 elections and nothing more was heard 
on the subject. Indeed, the most tangible outgrowth of the period of bleak 
party fortunes was the birth of the Democratic Leadership Council, which was 
dedicated to the proposition that the party could be turned away from a 
leftward course. But the DLC welcomed all Democrats and became less a centrist 
force than a classier and more cerebral alternative to the party's national 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The election on Tuesday virtually wiped out the party's philosophical center. 
The Democrats' right wing had long ago disappeared. What remains is the most 
liberal collection of Democrats since 1974, perhaps even 1964. These are the 
people who must man the disaster team, along with a President who has yet to 
establish precisely where he stands philosophically or with which ideological 
coordinates he hopes to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the apparent bleakness of the picture for the Democrats, there has 
never been a better opportunity to probe the party's essence precisely because 
the stakes have decreased so dramatically. There are no more chairmanships to 
fret about. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement by Alabama's reelected Sen. Richard Shelby that he is 
converting to the GOP is probably only the precursor of many more such 
decisions. As those Democrats who are not indelibly liberal shrink in numbers 
and become political curiosities, the defining lines of the party will become 
neater. Soon, the soul-searching can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is not whether this self-examination should take place, but 
rather where it should happen and who should participate. Ideally, this autopsy 
ought to involve all of the significant Democratic players: the President, the 
Democratic members of the House and Senate and elected officials from the 
states -- a kind of midterm convention such as the one that took place at 
Philadelphia in 1982, but this time specifically not for the purpose of 
showcasing candidates or offering seminars in the latest campaign software. It 
should be done sooner rather than later. Democrats are demoralized, and at the 
very least a gathering of this sort would apply some much-needed grief therapy 
-- the kind of thing that is done for victims of natural disasters to reassure 
them that they are not suffering alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A national convocation to debate the future of the party would also be helpful 
to the surviving leaders in Congress: a new Senate minority leader yet to be 
chosen, House floor leader Richard Gephardt and caucus chairman Vic Fazio of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing the Democrats also need to do: find themselves a Newt Gingrich, a 
figure who has both the intellectual reach to produce a strategy for a party so 
impoverished in vision and the tactical skills to implement it. Democrats might 
bridle at the idea of emulating the approach of the presumed Speaker-to-be on 
the grounds that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but they must 
hold their revulsion in check. After all, one secret of waging effective 
warfare is to make use of what worked for the hated enemy, adapting his 
successful weapons and tactics to your own purpose: beating him.

PERSPECTIVES ON ELECTION '94; AMERICA ISN'T COLORED WHITE; PROP. 187: 
ETHNOCENTRIC EUROPEANS DON'T DEFINE THIS MULTICULTURAL, MULTIRACIAL LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUS FRIAS, Gus Frias is a criminal-justice specialist with the Los Angeles 
County Office of Education.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the root of Proposition 187 is an attempt to institutionalize the white 
European definition of who can be classified as an American. Proponents are 
determined to exclude anyone who resembles dark-skinned illegal immigrants. 
Consequently, we dark-skinned Native Americans join our brethren in defying the 
immoral, racist conspiracies of these confused lunatics, and we are committed 
to teach them a lesson in respect and love for America. 
</P>
<P>
 We wholeheartedly refuse to let a few confused ethnocentric Europeans dictate 
the meaning and perception of Americanism. Because America existed prior to the 
arrival of their ancestors and the establishment of their legacies of hate and 
violence, they do not have a patent on or a copyright to America. As foreigners 
and invaders, they will not be allowed to dictate America's fate and reality. 
America is not a mono-ethnic, white country; it is a diverse multiethnic and 
multicultural society. Accordingly, Native Americans are as American as any 
white European who arrogantly exploits America's symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 The passage of Proposition 187 is unconstitutional. Its essence goes against 
the law, as established by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1982 decision in Plyler vs. 
Doe, which held that the denial of public education to undocumented children 
violated the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 must be attacked and defeated in court because it is an 
expedient lie that fosters American apartheid -- a racist system that divides 
and discriminates against people based on race and immigration status. In 
particular, it makes all nonwhite Americans suspect of being illegal 
immigrants. In addition, it challenges the legitimacy of those who are here 
legally; even if they produce proper documents, racist suspicions could render 
them worthless. As in ancient times, great social pressures will attempt to 
seduce all ethnic nonwhites into accepting three options: assimilation, 
isolation or extermination. Despite these challenges, the true American spirit 
of faith, tolerance, freedom and justice will continue to motivate us to ensure 
our children's God-given rights to a free public education -- one that provides 
a safe and healthy learning environment to foster the expansion of knowledge 
and the realization of great American dreams.

PERSPECTIVES ON ELECTION '94; CALIFORNIA MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT A VISIONARY BROWN; 
GOVERNOR'S RACE: SHE OPTED FOR CAUTIOUS CONSENSUS WHEN THE ELECTORATE WAS READY 
TO BE LAUNCHED OUT OF THE DOLDRUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BRADLEY, William Bradley writes the New West Notes electronic 
newsletter. He was a senior adviser to Kathleen Brown for the primary and to 
the state Democratic Party for the general election. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's obvious that the Brown campaign was outthought and outfought. But the 
fatal flaw of the Brown candidacy was deeper than that. It reflects the crisis 
of conventional Democratic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown and her husband, Van Gordon Sauter, are longstanding friends of 
mine. As journalist and sounding board, then as her senior adviser for strategy 
and communications during the primary campaign, I had many talks with Brown 
about California's politics and its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Program flows from perspective. During the 64-day state budget impasse in 
1992, her perspective was one of fiscal managerialism. 
</P>
<P>
 When I formally joined her campaign last April, she was unclear on the role of 
ideas in politics. Speaking of her brother, she mused: "He focused on the power 
of ideas. That isn't what's going to do it now." Echoing new campaign manager 
Clint Reilly, who in turn echoed Michael Dukakis, she said the election would 
be about effectiveness, not ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in April and May, she asked me to write her campaign book, laying out 
her vision for California. I declined, fearing that it would be an artifact to 
be pointed to rather than a message to be run on. When she finally released her 
book last month, it was only a collection of policy speeches she had given many 
months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown opted for a cautious elite consensus, offering little contrast with her 
opponent. Her candidacy was a major missed opportunity to define a new politics 
for a challenging time. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused by change and disgusted by corruption, the electorate presents as 
complex and nasty a setting for the doing of politics as has existed since the 
1930s and the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 California is in the midst of a difficult passage to the 21st Century. It's a 
center of accelerating global change: in the cross-border flow of capital, 
goods, ideas and people; in radical new technologies; in complex environmental 
challenges; in the end of the Cold War; in the rise of the Pacific Rim; in the 
shape of the work force and of society itself. The anxiety and dislocation 
caused by this multiplicity of change disrupts communities, drives 
anti-immigrant hysteria and clouds the economic picture. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage, Job No. 1 in reinventing the faded California Dream for the new 
century is to drive change to serve broader goals, not just the narrow 
interests of connected corporate managers, fortunate entrepreneurs and clever 
speculators. 
</P>
<P>
 The technocentralist paradigm of broadcast television (controlled on the other 
side of the box) is giving way to the techno-populist paradigm of personal 
computing and communication (increasingly controlled on your side of the box). 
</P>
<P>
 Why not pursue a politics of techno-populism that acknowledges the dominant 
reality of radical technological change and turn it to the common good? This 
politics would promote technologies that can serve as cornerstones for new 
industries and expansion of existing industries, affirm the value of individual 
choice at a time when more and more people feel powerless, and foster a sense 
of stewardship of community and ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't allow the creation of pariah populations. The Wilson campaign was all 
about walls, not bridges. In our mosaic society, there can be no one whose work 
is valued and whose welfare is not. If aggressively countered from the start, 
Proposition 187 would have been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there is no inherent good in bureaucracy, we should promote not Big 
Government but Big Bang government. There was a glimpse of this two weeks ago, 
when Brown finally proposed a radical consolidation of environmental regulatory 
agencies devised by three ecological strategists. Unfortunately, the unveiling 
came six months after the San Francisco luncheon at which she privately 
embraced the idea. The only "reinventing government" portion of her book was a 
silly claim of a performance review generating $5 billion in savings. Not that 
the public employee unions that funded her campaign cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Brown's 1992 presidential campaign was prescient in recognizing popular 
contempt for a fixed system. With Sacramento in the grip of what Tom Hayden 
calls the "special-interest state," there can be no substitute for confronting 
corruption through political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time of political heavy weather, Kathleen Brown, the best-funded Democrat 
ever to seek an American governorship, hunkered down with what she herself 
described as "laundry lists" of safe policies. And lost badly to the least 
popular governor in California history.

PERSPECTIVES ON ELECTION '94; AN AWAKENING OF OUR MORAL SENSE; PROP. 187: THE 
ISSUE OF IMMIGRANTS IS ENERGIZING OUR TRADITIONAL LEADERSHIP.

 White voters overwhelmingly supported 187; minority voters overwhelmingly 
opposed it. That whites vote, and most minorities -- blacks excluded -- don't 
is not a new story. What changed was the passion of the mainstream community 
leadership opposing the mainstream voters. If there is any hope for a 
turnaround -- a future when we are either so angry and adamant for change that 
we consistently turn out incumbents, or when we calm down and stop letting the 
negativism of campaigns destroy our confidence -- it rests with the traditional 
leaders in the community: the clergy, educators, organized labor and health and 
social-service professionals who have greater contact with constituents than do 
politicians or their advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 did something for California we have not seen in 30 years: It 
energized the traditional institutional leaders who have not been in the 
forefront on a moral issue this way since the peace and civil-rights movements. 
</P>
<P>
 True, they lost Tuesday, but they lost for a long time when they began 
opposing the Establishment on civil rights as well. It took time for Americans 
to recognize the moral consequences of the Vietnam War abroad and racism at 
home. It took the clergy and the educators time to tap into the hearts of their 
followers and motivate them enough to go into the streets and work for change 
in the less dramatic but more effective corridors of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony was the most audible voice of opposition on 
Proposition 187, but he was hardly alone. Religious leaders at all levels and 
all denominations throughout the state spoke out with a depth of sincerity that 
made the vote a clear moral choice. Saying we are "sending a message" is a way 
of saying we are angry and a way of saying we didn't really mean it. It is a 
sidestep on the issue of whether we are still the same old racist society we 
used to be. It is a way of avoiding the clear moral imperative from the pulpit, 
but it will not be sufficient because, while the campaign is over, the leaders 
who opposed 187 still have their platforms available to them every week. 
</P>
<P>
 There were others who were mobilized -- particularly the young -- and their 
teachers will also be around. The young are notoriously poor bets for electoral 
contests because they rarely vote. But they will march, and they did march in 
the peace and civil-rights movements. They can have an impact, especially when 
their teachers focus their activities on the pressure points in the political 
process. Proposition 187 affects them directly, and that will keep their minds 
on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Battles waged on moral issues are all but impossible to compromise. But just 
as we have seen the awakening on the right, so too has this election awakened a 
moral sense in the liberal mainstream. It will take some time, but the 
sustaining leaders of California have only just begun to fight.

 For the first time, the Norris brothers will defend world titles on the same

 Two other losers of the George Foreman-Michael Moorer fight might have been 
Riddick Bowe and James Toney. . . .

<P>
 Bowe, who fights Larry Donald on Dec. 3 in Las Vegas, was trying to secure a 
title match against Moorer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The longshot possibility was Moorer vs. James Toney, who balloons to 200 
pounds between fights. Of course, Toney will have more than enough to handle 
when he defends his International Boxing Federation super-middleweight title 
against Roy Jones Jr. on Nov. 18. . . .

 Foreman would like to make his first title defense at the Astrodome in his 
hometown of Houston against a hand-picked opponent. . . .

 If Terry Bradshaw and Joe Theismann debated, who would get the last word in?

STENSTROM OUT

 Coach Rich Brooks says the Oregon coaching staff is proceeding as if Stanford 
quarterback Steve Stenstrom won't start against the 15th-ranked Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford officials still list Stenstrom as questionable for Saturday's game at 
Palo Alto.He has not practiced and doctors reportedly are considering surgery 
that would end his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom broke the little finger on his throwing hand in last week's 46-28 
victory over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Scott Frost came on in relief and was extremely effective, especially 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon (7-3, 5-1) can advance to the Rose Bowl for the first time in 37 years 
with a victory over Stanford and a win the next week at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said that Oregon's team doctors believe that if Stenstrom plays, "his 
effectiveness would be restricted because of the finger." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that Frost will probably start at quarterback," Brooks said. "In 
so doing, we're looking more at his running threat. Whether that's a mistake 
only time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, a sophomore, carried the ball 11 times for 88 yards against Washington. 
He completed two of eight passes for 31 yards.

BULLETS' REX CHAPMAN STILL A SHARP SHOOTER; PRO BASKETBALL: IN HIS SEVENTH 
SEASON, BOTH THE GUARD AND WASHINGTON ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY BEMBRY, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entering his seventh pro season, Rex Chapman has endured the growing pains of 
NBA expansion with the Charlotte Hornets, the struggles of losing with the 
Washington Bullets and the frustration of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet through it all, Chapman has never lost his confidence as a shooter -- 
never more clear than on opening night, when, with time running out, he 
launched the game-winning shot with the Orlando Magic's Horace Grant draped all 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might not have looked like an open shot," Chapman said, shrugging his 
shoulders at his heroics. "But for me, I can get to that spot and get the shot 
off. If it's there, I'm going to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the type of mentality you want from your starting shooting guard. And 
Chapman's confidence is why the Bullets are 2-0. It's Washington's first 2-0 
start since the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman followed his game-winning shot in Friday's opener with seven points in 
overtime of Washington's 100-99 win over the Chicago Bulls. He has scored 47 
points in two games and has helped give long-suffering Bullets fans a ray of 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We accomplished, I'm sure, something nobody thought we would by beating 
Orlando and Chicago," Chapman said after yesterday's practice. "If you go back 
a week, I don't think the media or anybody would pick us to be 2-0. We were 
able to hang in both games, putting us at the end with a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's all Coach Jim Lynam has asked of his team in his first year with 
the Bullets. The Bullets were 1-9 against Orlando and Chicago last season, and 
hadn't won in Chicago since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to legitimately be able to say to ourselves we've improved to a 
point where we have a chance to win every night," Lynam said. "I'm not ready to 
say we've reached that goal based on two games. After we've put ourselves in a 
position on a consistent basis, the second goal is to cash in on some 
percentage of those opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 He likes his chances with Chapman, who has impressed him defensively and 
offensively since the first day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is a big-shot guy who's oblivious to the pressure. I couldn't say 
enough good things about him," Lynam said. "I think he's done a great job in, 
for the most part, taking high-percentage shots. One of the knocks against him 
before was he sometimes took bad shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Another knock against Chapman was that, as a professional, he never quite 
lived up to the potential he demonstrated at the University of Kentucky where 
he starred before being selected by Charlotte in the first round (eighth pick) 
of the 1988 draft after his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bullets drafted Calbert Cheaney with their first-round pick in 1993, 
Chapman began an off-season workout program intended to save his job and prove 
his critics wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here has ability, but what separates the good from the great 
players are the ones who work at it," Chapman said. "Over the past three years 
I decided to work at my game. I always had the ability, it was just a matter of 
working at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season the work paid off so well that Chapman was playing at an All-Star 
level. But dreams of wearing an All-Star uniform were shot when Chapman 
dislocated his right ankle on Jan. 17 against the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every now and then I wake up, just thinking about coming down on Dennis 
Rodman's foot," Chapman said. "It was good for me to go back and play last year 
(after missing 21 games) just to put the injury out of my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the ankle is probably a little stronger because of all the work I put 
into it," he said. "I wanted to work that hard just so that I would never think 
about it once I stepped on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that Chapman may once again make an All-Star push. "To be 
honest," said Chapman, demonstrating the same confidence he has as a shooter, 
"I've always known I had the ability to be that type of player."

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: NOW, FOR OUR NEXT TRICK . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't easy to grab the limelight in the self-conscious, self-promotional 
world of fashion -- unless you are startlingly beautiful or tremendously 
powerful. Being neither, we've decided to experiment with an unorthodox 
strategy we call "fame by humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest installment of our master plan occurred in New York last week at a 
party hosted by New York magazine at Barneys New York: One minute we were 
analyzing American fashion trends with a husky-voiced French stylist. The next, 
we were gazing at the floor, where our Adrienne Vittadini knit skirt had fallen 
into a crumpled heap around our ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me," we said casually. "My skirt has fallen off." We discreetly pulled 
it back up and, after a brief, humiliating moment, carried on. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, most party-goers were too preoccupied with their own clothes to 
notice the deconstruction of someone else's. But those who did witness this 
triumph of gravity demanded an explanation. How could a skirt simply fall off? 
"With very careful planning," we said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Politics of Fashion: Never mind if it's nippy. You'd better not show up 
wearing a fur on Sunset Boulevard, where the anti-fur forces are broadcasting 
their messages loud and clear. The Friends of Animals stapled fur coats to its 
billboard. On the backs of the coats, a simple question: "Get the Message?" 
Just down the street, the Humane Society's anti-fur billboard takes the cute 
and fuzzy approach by showing the animals themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, over on Rodeo Drive, Fendi -- the Roman fashion house founded 
nearly 70 years ago with furs -- just opened for business. Although it carries 
the Fendi signature handbags, ready-to-wear (designed by Karl Lagerfeld), 
fragrance and accessories, the store has already done well with its famous furs 
-- selling five in the first two days of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Furs are coming back very strongly and there's a big request for them," says 
Irwin Tauber, president of the Condotti Shops USA Inc., owner of five Fendi 
shops in the United States, including the Beverly Hills site. But the customers 
have been primarily Japanese. "There's no fur controversy in Japan," Tauber 
explains.

 It Pays to Have a Wife Who Works Out: What to do when you are confronted with 
large goody bags that weigh a ton? Hand them to your supermodel wife who's used 
to working out, or at least hefting the kids. That's what Rod Stewart did at 
the recent Carousel of Hope Ball when confronted with big Guess and Revlon gift 
bags. The Mrs., Rachel Hunter, obliged and they both laughed all the way to the 
car. 
</P>

 Fragrance Free: The University of Minnesota's School of Social Work has 
prohibited its 250 students from wearing perfumes, colognes and other scented 
products, reports the Associated Press. The ban is a response to a puzzling new 
affliction called multiple chemical sensitivity-environmental illness, in which 
even a whiff can cause temporary paralysis. "We're not the smell police," said 
Jean Quam, director of the school. "When people get educated about it, they 
still may think it's crazy but they also realize perfumes can physically make 
people sick." 
</P>
<P>
 But a perfume-industry representative sniffed at the ban. "I don't think 
that's fair," said Regina Kulik, director of public relations for Christian 
Dior Perfume. "Even furniture polish has a scent because people like it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Straight Up: Speaking of fragrance, Rei Kawakubo, designer of Comme des 
Garcons, will make a rare appearance at Barneys New York in Beverly Hills today 
to launch her first fragrance. Kawakubo, writes Deyan Sudjic in "Rei Kawakubo 
and Comme des Garcons" (Rizzoli, 1994), "works hard and finds the social 
aspects of the fashion world an unwelcome chore." But the iconoclastic designer 
is making an exception, with appearances here and in New York. Like Donna Karan 
and Sonia Rykiel, Kawakubo produced her perfume in-house rather than license it 
to a beauty company. The result is refreshingly unorthodox -- from the whiskey 
flask-shaped bottle, which lies on its back, to the scent itself, which has no 
top note and so goes directly to the heart of the fragrance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Support System: Good things do come in threes. Just ask David Dart. After 
winning California Designer of the Year and the Dallas Fashion Award, his 
company, Force One, has been acquired by Kellwood, a St. Louis-based apparel 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dart retains full creative control, he gets to share the business 
headaches with someone else, he says. Not to mention the sweetest part of the 
deal: worldwide access to large-scale production sources through Melrose, a 
division of Kellwood in Chatsworth. "We'll be right up there with DKNY and 
Calvin Klein," Dart promises.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: FANGS WITH A FLOURISH 
</P>

<P>
 The Movie: "Interview With the Vampire" 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Vampires Lestat (Tom Cruise, pictured at left) and Louis (Brad 
Pitt, pictured at right) embark on two centuries of night-prowling 
bloodsucking, based on Anne Rice bestseller. After a few decades, a "daughter," 
Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), joins in their ravenous escapades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: London-based Sandy Powell, whose credits include 
"Orlando," "The Crying Game" and "Caravaggio." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Extravagant flourishes of the 18th-Century kind -- deep, rich 
fabrics embellished with embroidery, gold thread, sequins. Without the fangs, 
Lestat and Louis would pass for two ordinary fops. "Sequins, actually little 
bits of metal, were definitely worn by men then," Powell says. The feminine 
frills not only magnify the story's homoerotic elements but also play a 
practical role. Because the vampires hunt at night, the film had to be dark -- 
literally. (Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot worked entirely with Chinese 
paper lanterns.) Sparkly decorations, velvets, shot silk -- two-tone fabric 
that changes color with the light -- and silk brocades reflect what little 
light there is. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: Halloweenish cliches and "vampiric" imagery a la Bela Lugosi, 
as Powell puts it, were avoided. A red-lined cape obviously would have been far 
too corny, but Lestat and Louis also shun black. The only exception: Louis 
attends an opera in a black top hat, tails and, yes, cape -- the standard 
evening dress for opera-going men of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "Tom, Brad and (Kirsten) had to look like people who happen to be 
vampires. It's not the Hammer house of horror," Powell says, referring to the 
British company that produced low-budget horror movies in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Dressing for evil is nothing new. Powell came across a creepy insect 
cravat pin from the period for Lestat, and Victorian fabric depicting skulls, 
crossbones and poison ivy, fashioned into a waistcoat for Santiago (Stephen 
Rea). "I also made a fabulous vest for Lestat from a piece of old fabric 
embroidered with bees, but it disintegrated before we could use it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: For the New Orleans sequences, paintings by Jacques Louis David 
and Jean August Ingres; for those in Paris, James Joseph Tissot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Principals' clothing and undergarments were custom-made from new and 
antique fabrics at the production's workshop at Pinewood Studios in London. 
Painter Mathilde Sandberg embellished many pieces with hand-dying techniques.

BOOK REVIEW / HUMOR; WHEN IT'S TOO IMPORTANT TO BE SERIOUS; ALL THE TROUBLE IN 
THE WORLD: THE LIGHTER SIDE OF OVERPOPULATION, FAMINE, ECOLOGICAL DISASTER, 
ETHNIC HATRED, PLAGUE AND POVERTY BY P.J. O'ROURKE ; ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS 
$22, 340 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KINKY FRIEDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing more unpleasant than a well-versed liberal is an intelligent 
conservative. In the case P.J. O'Rourke and "All the Trouble in the World" we 
have an intelligent conservative who's also effete, sartorially smug, in a 
state of perpetual preppiness and somewhere to the right of Judge Robert Bork, 
traveling to Haiti, Somalia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, what used to be Yugoslavia, 
what used to be Czechoslovakia and what used to be a pristine rain forest 
before he got there. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of these meanderings O'Rourke faithfully reports to us in 
great and jaundiced detail all of his daily observations, interactions and 
movements, including, occasionally, bowel. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the result be merely a tawdry travelogue roughly similar in spiritual 
timbre to Rush Limbaugh walking his pet stomach over the airwaves of America? 
If you suspect the answer is yes , you'd not only be wrong, you'd be in serious 
danger of missing one of the funniest, most insightful, dead-on-the-money books 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Trouble in the World" is O'Rourke's indefatigable, not to say 
quixotic, effort to show us "the lighter side of overpopulation, famine, 
ecological disaster, ethnic hatred, plague and poverty." It is work that 
succeeds, quite possibly in spite of its author. Indeed, O'Rourke is probably 
at his best when he steps outside the casino of politics and shows that rare, 
seemingly unconscious glimpse of himself and, God help us, ourselves as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Trekking through the Amazon rain forest, O'Rourke asks the metaphysical 
question: "Why do the eco-tourists have neon-blue hiking shorts? And 
fluorescent-purple Windbreakers? Caution-signal-yellow sweat socks? Craps 
table-toned fanny packs? HoJo tinted luggage? T-shirts the hue of sex dolls?" 
He ponders the connection between the love of nature and the colors not found 
therein. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who live in the rain forest also come in for close scrutiny. "Most 
of the locals seem to make their living in the open-air market," he asserts, 
"selling each other the same enormous catfish." 
</P>
<P>
 As he leaves the Amazon, the author provides us with some concluding thoughts 
about what the world might be like without the rain forest. "I gather that, if 
the rain forest disappears, we'll have to get our air in little bottles from 
the Evian company, and biodiversity will vanish, and pretty soon we'll only 
have about one kind of animal, and with my luck that will be the Lhasa apso. . 
. . Furthermore, we'll never discover all the marvelous properties of the 
various herbal treasures that are found in the rain forest, such as Ben & 
Jerry's Rainforest Crunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally entertaining and enlightening are O'Rourke's accounts of his travels 
in Vietnam, Somalia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Bangladesh, from which one 
can learn things that a lifetime of watching CNN may not reveal. Of course, as 
the author makes clear at one point during a visit to a particularly horrific 
slum in Haiti, "you can't smell television." 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly because Haiti seems to be the flavor of the month, O'Rourke's 
observations of his sojourn there appear to be all the more compelling. 
"Haiti," he says, "is integrated in a way not seen in the United States except 
in soft-drink television commercials." He describes a certain section of 
Port-au-Prince as burned out and boarded up almost like the downtown area of an 
American city. The author also refers to one of Haiti's former dictators as 
"Roseanne Arnold with infantry." 
</P>
<P>
 Much impressed with the spirit and charm of the Haitian people, O'Rourke, 
after an all-night voodoo celebration, proposes this trade to them: "You sail 
north. And we'll get a bunch of crabby families in Winnebagos, drug smugglers, 
Disney executives, Palm Beach divorce lawyers, 2 Live Crew, Burt and Loni, 
time-share condo salesmen, Don Johnson, Miami Beach aerobic instructors, 
William Kennedy Smith, kvetching retirees, teen-age gang members, and wounded 
German tourists, and we'll send them back to Haiti on the same boat." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke may well take a measure of '90s microwaveable heat for this 
provocative book but, as he well knows, some things are too important to be 
taken seriously. And I also suspect that somewhere in his travels he's heard 
the old Turkish proverb: "When you tell the truth, have one foot in the 
stirrup." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy trails.

 A Modigliani Bright Spot: Amedeo Modigliani's "Portrait of Jeanne Hebuterne," 
which went to a private collector for $5.9 million, was the top seller at 
Sotheby's disappointing New York auction of Impressionist and modern art on 
Tuesday. The Modigliani was a rare highlight in the sale of 46 works, 17 of 
which went unsold. In all, the auction house brought in $25.9 million, about $6 
million less than its low pre-sale estimate.

 Mozart, Armani Style: Italian fashion is joining with an Austrian opera on the 
British stage. Giorgio Armani will make his first venture into opera by 
designing costumes for an updated version of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Cosi 
fan Tutte" at London's Royal Opera House. The opera, to be directed by Jonathan 
Miller, will open Jan. 18.

 London Looks at North America: London's British Museum has finally found a 
home under its roof for its collection of native North American ethnography -- 
thanks to $1.6 million from the Chase Manhattan Bank, the largest corporate 
gift ever received by the famed institution. The collection represents all the 
native peoples of North America -- from the Inuit and Eskimos of the Arctic to 
the Navajos of the American Southwest. The 20,000 artifacts include wampum, 
scarves, combs, dresses, bison robes, weaponry, eating utensils, basketry, 
potlatch clothing, headdresses with eagle feathers, war- and peace-pipes, 
moccasins, totem poles and sealskin parkas, including many from California 
Native American tribes. The Chase gift will enable the North American 
collection to be permanently housed in one gallery in the British Museum; it 
has previously been scattered in other London museums and in storage. The 
collection is scheduled to go on view in 1997. POP/ROCK

 Blood Donors Called: Musician David Crosby remained hospitalized awaiting a 
liver transplant at UCLA Medical Center on Wednesday, and in anticipation of an 
organ being located, his representatives put out a call for blood donors. 
Crosby has type-O blood, and could need as many as 100 units during a 
transplant surgery. Los Angeles County currently has a shortage of type-O 
blood. Donors 17 or older, who are in good health and not at risk for the AIDS 
virus, are requested to contact the UCLA Blood and Platelet Center to schedule 
an appointment.

CLUB REVIEW; GLAM ROCK REARS ITS GLITTERY HEAD IN WEST HOLLYWOOD

 L.A.'s always changing club world operates like a litmus test for hip. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner than disco has taken a back seat to punk all through Hollywood 
clubs, the new Cherry club is reviving glam rock.Cherry, which takes place at 
West Hollywood's Love Lounge every Friday, is a suitable venue for the glameroo 
musings of "Ziggy Stardust" era David Bowie and Gary Glitter. The lush, 
spacious room features a dance floor smack in the center of the club, which can 
lead to an irresistible urge to ham it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's best feature is a record mix just alternative enough and just 
mainstream enough to appeal to virtually all tastes. Deejay Mike Messex, a 
marvel on the local club scene for his ability to always keep one step ahead of 
the trends, mixes in glam's old school without ignoring the contemporary. Thus, 
you're as likely to be enticed onto the dance floor by T. Rex as by the latest 
from Luscious Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the 3-week-old club, which will offer a live performance by Extra 
Fancy this Friday, isn't wearing its hipness factor on its sleeve. Although 
last week found Perry Farrell singing and pogoing his way around the dance 
floor to his old "Been Caught Stealing," no one gawked. They simply joined him. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cherry, Friday nights at the Love Lounge, 657 N. Robertson Ave., West

MOVIE REVIEW; PLENTY OF DRAMA IN MALLE'S 'VANYA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Vanya on 42nd Street" (opening Friday in Orange County at the Port Theatre) 
is an afterthought to be thankful for. A movie version of an exploration of 
Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" that was not originally intended for an audience, 
let alone film, it is that rare melding of cinema and drama that does honor to 
both disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 If movie stars fantasize about Oscars, theatrical actors dream of playing 
Chekhov and inhabiting his sensitive and complex characters. The Russian 
dramatist, who died in 1904 at age 44, wrote four remarkable plays in the last 
decade of his life: "The Sea Gull," "The Three Sisters," "The Cherry Orchard" 
and "Uncle Vanya." 
</P>
<P>
 Theatrical director Andre Gregory (known to film audiences as the title 
character in "My Dinner With Andre") decided in 1989 that he wanted to work on 
a production of the play using a contemporary adaptation by David Mamet. 
</P>
<P>
 After gathering his cast, which included "Dinner" co-star Wallace Shawn as 
Vanya, Gregory and company worked on and off on the piece for four years, first 
in a New York loft space and then, in 1991, before small invited audiences of 
20 or 30 in a decaying movie theater near Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the company's oldest actress, 89-year-old Ruth Nelson, died, and the 
performances stopped. Then, a year later, there was an urge to begin again, 
and, with Nelson's Group Theater colleague Phoebe Brand joining the cast, Louis 
Malle, the director of "Dinner," agreed to film it. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the spirit of the original workshops, Malle and Gregory made a 
number of smart choices. They reproduced the atmosphere of the invited 
performances by filming in front of a small audience in the crumbling interior 
of Times Square's once-glamorous New Amsterdam Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone ambles into the theater, director Gregory and the audience exchange 
greetings, the actors chat as they gather on the stage and, unless you've read 
the text the night before, the opening lines of the play blend so seamlessly 
with the conversation that it takes a minute or two to realize the action has 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many of Chekhov's plays, "Vanya" concerns an extended family, and is 
set on the estate of Serybryakov (George Gaynes), a retired professor who 
gained control of the land when his first wife died. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past Serybryakov has been an absentee landlord, content to live off the 
revenues and allowing his daughter, Sonya (Brooke Smith), and his 
brother-in-law, Vanya (Shawn), to run the place for him. But now, at the play's 
opening, financial difficulties have forced him to return to the estate, 
bringing with him his young and alluring second wife Yelena (Julianne Moore). 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of this couple stirs up a lifetime's worth of resentments not 
only for Vanya, who is in love with Yelena and has begun to fear his years of 
toil have been for nothing, but also for the local doctor Astrov (Larry Pine), 
whom young Sonya has innocently had her eye on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To watch this "Vanya" is to marvel, as always with Chekhov, at his insights, 
at how rigorously and effortlessly non-judgmental he is, at how much empathy he 
has for all his characters, for the resentments they feel at being trapped by 
the frustrations of their idle, often squandered lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Gregory's and Malle's direction, the actors captivate. Shawn is strong 
as the prickly, ironically self-deprecating Vanya, but the surprise of the 
production is Julianne Moore's Yelena. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who got her role in Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" after the director saw 
her in one of the "Vanya" run-throughs, shows us that the Raymond Carver 
adaptation used only a thimbleful of her abilities. Here the actress utilizes 
all the opportunities this role provides, and her Yelena understandably 
intoxicates and frustrates every male she encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 Malle has used his documentary background to unobtrusively serve and enhance 
the production. "We all want to talk," Vanya says at one point, and this 
version of the play underscores once again how sublime it is when Chekhov's 
characters unburden their souls and do just that. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEW; CHANDOS BAROQUE PLAYERS IN U.S. DEBUT IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College presented the U.S. debut on 
Tuesday of the Chandos Baroque Players in the ornate Viennese Room of the 
Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. And, hardly for the first time in 
its 20-year history, Da Camera came up winners, as did the large, appreciative 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member British ensemble, playing on period instruments, didn't give 
us style by the numbers but an evening of music-making richly varied in 
performing styles. 
</P>
<P>
 The program bookends were works in the French manner by German composers: 
first, the handsome "Paris" Quartet in E minor of Telemann, and finally, the 
hyper-familiar B-minor "Ouverture" of J.S. Bach, sounding fresher than usual 
not only for being played one instrument to a part, but for the intense, 
French-with-a-vengeance double-dotting of its first movement and the aerial 
grace of the ensuing dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Corelli's noble Trio Sonata in A was a showcase for the agile fiddling of Maya 
Homburger and Sarah Bealby Wright, and the full string ensemble -- further 
including violist Rosemary Nalden, cellist Daniel Yeadon and bassist Barry Guy 
-- gave us Purcell's mighty Chacony in bold colors and with tremendous rhythmic 
urgency, rather than as the respectful dirge less perceptive executants tend to 
make of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of Bach's Fifth "Brandenburg" yet again on a program hardly makes 
the heart leap. But, to coin the cliche, the Chandos players' crisp, lively, 
unjaded delivery made it sound unexpectedly fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep, respectful bows here to the liquid grace and unfazable dexterity of 
flutist Rachel Beckett and to harpsichordist Malcolm Proud's dramatic and 
flawlessly controlled execution of the vast first-movement cadenza. HERBERT

JAZZ REVIEW; COMPLEX WORKS FROM HOLDSWORTH, FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BURK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something lovable about four guys who come out in their wood-shop togs 
in a small club, as they did Tuesday night at Catalina Bar & Grill, and play 
the most complicated music in the world for the relatively few folks born to 
listen to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s, when Allan Holdsworth's guitar mightily fused the jazz-rock 
of Gong, Jean Luc-Ponty and Tony Williams, the axman has found that, despite 
five consecutive best guitar synthesist awards from Guitar Player magazine, the 
music world has de-progressed to a state where most guitarists play fewer notes 
in a set than he flicks out while tuning up. This has not deterred him from 
recording (his latest is "Hard Hat Area" on Restless records) and touring 
regularly to propagate his complex instrumental and compositional style, which 
is something like a less flip Frank Zappa or a 78 r.p.m. Jeff Beck laid atop 
lurching accents and unaccountable time signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Holdsworth has no use for the usual progressive bombast; both his solos and 
his songs display a rare if distant beauty -- Bach comes to mind more than Yes. 
What he lacks is a frame of reference that would connect him to the common 
bloodstream of human feeling -- he's a bit of a computer geek, alone and 
obsessed with the bright sparkings of his own internal programs. Of course, 
that's practically the definition of an artist, and Holdsworth isn't so far 
into the circuitry that he's unable to find musicians who can keep up with him: 
faithful keyboardist Steve Hunt, bassist Skuli Sverisson and drummer Joe Taylor 
certainly can and do. 
</P>
<P>
 And they plainly dig the hell out of it -- eyes closed, heads nodding on the 
same string as the audience's. The musicians have a tightness that comes from 
simpatico, not from being flogged through Sisyphean rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 Holdsworth has a moorless freedom that comes from following your own light. 
Problem is, most of us need special glasses to see the glow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allan Holdsworth at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. 
(213) 466-2210. $12 cover tonight and Sunday; $15 cover Friday and Saturday;

ART REVIEWS; 'CREMASTER' DRAMA EXPLORES IDEAS OF SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorcyclists in full racing leathers, female bodybuilders decked out like 
fairies and a gentlemanly satyr with a fondness for tap dancing are the main 
characters in Matthew Barney's "Cremaster 4," a 40-minute video shot on the 
Isle of Man against a backdrop of bagpipes, tartan patterns, four-horned rams 
and the tailless Manx. 
</P>
<P>
 At Regen Projects, 25 crisp C-prints in icy-white frames depict the 
protagonists in Barney's hip, mythological drama. At once archaic and 
futuristic, his fictitious portraits fuse the hyper-refinement of biogenetics 
with the raw impact of ancient rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic prowess and uncanny androgyny mark the corporeal territory where 
these seemingly contrary impulses and attributes dovetail. Imagine what the 
offspring of Pygmalion and Dr. Frankenstein's creations would look like, and 
you get a good picture of the complex creatures who come to life in Barney's 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 His mutant hybrids belong to the next generation of modern self-love run amok. 
Good old-fashioned narcissism gets turned inside out so many times that it's 
impossible to draw boundaries between subjects and objects of affection. 
Obsessions spiral back on themselves, picking up speed as their orbits tighten. 
</P>
<P>
 Barney's charged, symbolic drama ranks among the best video-based art being 
made today. His work insists that viewers rethink what it means to be human. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than proposing that people are creatures who need the recognition of 
others, "Cremaster 4" contends that the deepest satisfactions result when 
self-generated obsessions are realized -- when passions that cannot be traced 
back to external influences produce selfish, anti-social pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the synthetic frames of Barney's photographs, made from self-lubricating 
plastic usually used for ball-bearings and the joints of prosthetic 
bone-replacements, evoke a self-sufficiency so extreme that it borders on being 
hermetic. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of Barney's project strengthens the link between bodies and 
machines. Cremaster refers to the muscle that stabilizes the temperature of 
testicles, causing them to ascend or descend, depending upon circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing on this automatic human thermostat, Barney rejects a popularized 
version of Freud. His work suggests that if bodies are self-regulating systems, 
genitals are no more important than any other organ. The fantasies that attach 
themselves to all parts of the body prove to be more gripping than do strictly 
biological factors. 
</P>

 L.A. Abstraction: A diverse array of paintings, drawings, collages and prints 
by Lorser Feitelson (1898-1978) and John McLaughlin (1898-1976) at Tobey C. 
Moss Gallery outlines important connections and differences between the two Los 
Angeles abstractionists. This historically minded exhibition is most engaging, 
however, in its presentation of rarely seen pieces -- curious experiments the 
artists undertook and rejected, as they struggled to discover their mature, 
signature styles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earliest works, McLaughlin and Feitelson clearly crossed paths. Two 
small paintings from 1949 look as if they belong to the other artist's oeuvre: 
McLaughlin uncharacteristically explored colors and curves, and Feitelson 
limited his picture to straight lines and a black-and-white palette. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of McLaughlin's inquisitiveness abound. A compact still life from 
1946 reveals the magnitude of his leap to non-representational images in the 
mid-1950s. An actual tabletop from 1959, painted in a clunky, computer-graphics 
pattern, and an all-over, interlocking pink-and-green gouache from 1960 reveal 
two approaches he momentarily flirted with, but wisely did not pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Feitelson is the more consistent, less inventive artist. Early 
sketches containing figure studies and preliminary designs for larger linear 
compositions suggest that his abstract canvases are meant to be seen in 
relation to bodies twisting and turning in space. 
</P>
<P>
 A single, vertically oriented stripe painting from 1953 stands out as 
Feitelson's quirkiest work. Its odd combinations of burgundy, lavender, orange 
and lime green bands create a queasy, aggressive rhythm absent from his more 
graceful paintings of curved forms and flowing lines. Unlike McLaughlin, whose 
minimal paintings break free of their sources, Feitelson's images refer back to 
their roots, suggesting similarities to popular graphic designs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobey C. Moss Gallery, 7321 Beverly Blvd., (213) 933-5523, through Dec. 31. 
Closed Sundays and Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 Intuiting Meaning: Based on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," Christopher 
French's abstract paintings on pages printed with Braille propose that 
incomprehension is an essential component of knowledge. At Mark Moore Gallery, 
his six modestly scaled images refuse to let the viewer read them, instead 
insisting that you undertake a more drawn-out and participatory process of 
intuiting (or actively inventing) their meanings. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, a musty aura of schoolbooks and classrooms hangs over French's 
illegible paintings. They recall the long, painstaking process all children go 
through when they are dramatically transformed from impulsive, illiterate 
creatures into disciplined, literate beings. 
</P>
<P>
 French's mute art puts some viewers off because it invites us to relive the 
struggles suffered when we learned to read. Looking at his work has the 
remedial, sometimes humiliating feel of sounding out words a letter at a time 
and trying to put them together into sensible sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, submitting your attention to French's pictorial translations of 
Lewis Carroll's darkly hilarious text pays off handsomely. The artist's loosely 
structured abstractions never convey meaning as precisely as words, preferring, 
like the children's story, to leave willing viewers with plenty of room for a 
more open-ended give-and-take.

WESTSIDE WATCH: PARENTS SAY BILLBOARD FOR ANGELYNE BEDEVILS STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The would-be starlet who goes by the name Angelyne has long been accused of 
shameless self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some of her detractors have added a new criticism -- they say she is 
corrupting children. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelyne, a voluptuous blond model who gives her age as between 28 and 34, has 
sold herself over the past decade as a show business icon by plastering her 
image on L.A. billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The candy-colored ads have become such a Los Angeles landmark that tourists 
can frequently be found snapping pictures of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest billboard -- a full-length shot of Angelyne wearing a revealing 
swimsuit and reclining on the hood of her Corvette -- has drawn fire from a 
group of parents at the Oaks, a grade school near Highland and Franklin avenues 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's disgusting," said Eileen McMahon, whose son is a fifth-grader at 
the Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon said she was especially angry because one of the billboards is right 
across the street from the school. "I really feel it gives children the wrong 
message about women." 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon said she has collected about 50 signatures on a petition asking the 
sign company to remove the billboard and has complained to the office of Los 
Angeles Councilman John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached through her manager, Angelyne defended the ad, which went up last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it is the parents who are sending the wrong message to their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids adore me," she said. "They think I look like a Barbie doll. They don't 
think of me as a sex object. . . . The parents are really going off the deep 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelyne said she might try to smooth things over by paying a visit to the 
school in her pink Corvette. 
</P>

 ON-TIME ARRIVAL: Trailing by less than a hundred votes, Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills) is hoping a count of last-minute absentee votes will put her 
over the top against Republican challenger Susan Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 If she wins by one vote, she can thank her daughter, son and Continental 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's daughter, Hilary, a sophomore at Princeton University, was hoping to 
vote in her first election this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was late in submitting her application for an absentee ballot, and it 
did not arrive at her New Jersey residence until Tuesday -- Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was going to be a major disaster, as far as her mother was concerned," 
Harman told supporters at her campaign party. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Hilary marked her ballot and had it shipped to Los Angeles on a 
cross-country flight. Harman's son Brian picked up the ballot at Los Angeles 
International Airport and, in accordance with election rules, dropped it off at 
a polling place at 7:47 p.m., 13 minutes before the polls closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Harman ask Hilary how she voted? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to ask," she said.

DECISION '94; HARMAN-BROOKS RACE UNCERTAIN; BEILENSON IN SQUEAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First-term Rep. Jane Harman was in danger of losing her seat to Rancho Palos 
Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks in Tuesday's elections, but Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson apparently fought off a tough challenge and two other Westside 
Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, a Republican, and Harman (D-Rolling Hills) each had about 48% of the 
vote at last count Wednesday. Brooks led by 93 votes, 82,415 to 82,322, with 
all the precincts counted, but an unknown number of absentee ballots remain. 
County officials do not expect to update the tally before Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman and her weary supporters left her campaign party early Wednesday 
morning when she had a small lead over Brooks, but her advantage vanished as 
the votes continued to roll in. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, meanwhile, encouraged her supporters to stay hopeful until the 
absentee ballots are counted. "We have to keep the faith," she said. "We have 
to keep positive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman strategist Roy Bahr was optimistic Wednesday morning that the 
absentee votes would put Harman back on top. Regardless, Harman performed 
better than many of her incumbent Democratic colleagues across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had established a record as an independent," Bahr said. "It's pretty 
clear that anyone who wasn't independent was getting swept away." 
</P>
<P>
 If Harman does prevail in the race, she said she would likely retain her two 
key committee assignments -- including a seat on the influential House Armed 
Services Committee -- when Republicans take over the House leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have bipartisan government," she said. "I'm ready for that. I 
operate that way. I don't think that hurts my ability to help the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 During the pitched campaign, Harman drew on the support of political allies 
from Washington and the endorsement of local aerospace executives and police 
chiefs. Brooks, who was almost unknown before the Republican primary, also drew 
contributions and personal support from Washington. She criticized Harman for 
supporting President Clinton's defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration in the 36th District, which includes Venice, Westchester, Marina 
del Rey and the South Bay, gave neither candidate a decisive advantage, as 43% 
of voters were registered Democrats and 42% Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The election won't be resolved until the county finishes counting 100,000 
absentee ballots. It's unclear how many of the ballots are from the 36th 
District, said Grace Romero, spokeswoman for the registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in another Westside race are also keeping a close eye on the 
absentee votes. With all precincts reporting, Beilenson won 49% of the vote 
against 47% for Republican challenger Rich Sybert in the 24th District, which 
includes Malibu, Calabasas, Thousand Oaks and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert did not concede defeat Wednesday morning, but Beilenson said he appears 
to have won narrowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beilenson was discouraged at the Republican wins elsewhere in the 
country, he said Wednesday that he would have no trouble working with his new 
Republican colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President and the Republican majority in the Congress are going to be 
forced to relate to each other and work with each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many Democratic incumbents nationwide, Beilenson touted his support for 
Clinton Administration initiatives such as the crime bill and economic package. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson and president of a Santa 
Barbara-based toy company, criticized Beilenson for supporting Clinton and 
campaigned on his own business experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration in the district is 50% Democrat and 37% Republican, but analysts 
considered it a swing district because the Republican voters were seen as more 
likely to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other incumbent Democratic congressmen breezed to victory over political 
newcomers in the Westside. Rep. Henry Waxman was elected to his 11th term with 
a decisive win over businessman Paul Stepanek, while Rep. Julian Dixon easily 
defeated businessman Ernie Farhat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon won his ninth term by topping Farhat 78% to 17% in the reconfigured 32nd 
district, which includes Crenshaw, Culver City, Exposition Park, Mar Vista and 
Palms. The district's registration of 77% Democrat and 13% Republican 
overwhelmingly favored Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman needed little campaigning to defeat Stepanek, 68% to 28%, in the 
affluent 29th District, which includes Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Santa Monica 
and West Los Angeles. Registration in the district runs 59% Democrat and 26% 
Republican.

DECISION '94; DEMOCRATS IN LEGISLATURE FEND OFF DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Escaping the Republican tide that swept away many of their colleagues 
elsewhere, Westside Democrats seeking a place in the California Legislature 
made a clean sweep of one Senate and four Assembly seats in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Area Democrats chalked up a couple of significant firsts with the victories. 
Feminist lawyer and former actress Sheila James Kuehl won in the 41st Assembly 
District to become California's first openly lesbian or gay legislator. Kevin 
Murray's victory in the 47th Assembly District gives the state its first 
father-son legislative duo. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a year when incumbents fared poorly, state Sen. Ralph C. Dills -- 
perhaps the ultimate incumbent at age 84 -- beat off a young challenger to 
return to his 28th Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other Assembly races, incumbent Debra Bowen beat back a Republican 
challenger in the beach cities of the 53rd Assembly District, while Wally Knox 
easily defeated his Republican opponent in the open race for the 42nd District 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by a throng of well-wishers crowded into her Santa Monica home late 
Tuesday, an ebullient Kuehl credited "fabulous grass-roots support" for her 
victory over Republican challenger Michael T. Meehan, a law student and reserve 
sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a victory for hope and for what can happen when people work 
together for positive values," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41st District stretches from Santa Monica to the Ventura County line, 
encompassing such disparate communities as Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Calabasas 
and Hidden Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl is unapologetically liberal, a feminist and a law professor who, after 
graduating from Harvard Law School at age 37, became a women's rights attorney 
and nationally recognized expert on domestic violence. But she is perhaps best 
known for her role as the brainy Zelda in the old TV series, "The Many Loves of 
Dobie Gillis." 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan, a mainstream, law-and-order Republican, had sought to portray Kuehl as 
too liberal for a district that includes such suburban enclaves as Calabasas 
and Hidden Hills. But unlike Kuehl, 53, who benefited from a campaign war chest 
that exceeded $400,000, Meehan raised less than $50,000, receiving little help 
from GOP heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Dills, the octogenarian state senator who advertised himself as 
"Too Old to Quit," retained his 28th District seat by defeating Republican 
David Barrett Cohen, a Redondo Beach attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about it. I feel that I have proven that you can be an 
octogenarian and still do the job for four more years," Dills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills managed to squeeze a victory out of a reformulated district that 
includes the heavily Republican beach cities as well as his traditional 
Democratic strongholds of Carson, Compton and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning the 47th Assembly District with 70% of the vote, Kevin Murray joins 
his father, Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount), who coasted to reelection in 
the 52nd Assembly District, which includes Compton, Gardena, Lynwood and Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Murray will represent an area in which he grew up. The district includes 
parts of Baldwin Hills, the Crenshaw district, Culver City, Palms and 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed that the rest of our (Democratic) ticket didn't do 
so well, but I'm looking forward to representing my neighborhood," Murray, an 
attorney in Windsor Hills, said after the polls closed on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 42nd Assembly District, Knox coasted to victory over Republican 
opponent Robert Davis. Knox, 47, a labor attorney and board member of the Los 
Angeles Community College District, saw his win as defying a nationwide trend 
toward the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on, outside of my race, is a massive disillusionment with the 
ability of government to deliver services we thought it could deliver," Knox 
said from the Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles, where his supporters held 
a victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 53rd Assembly District, Bowen, 38, beat insurance agent Julian Sirull 
to win reelection. The district stretches from Venice to Marina del Rey, 
Westchester and the South Bay beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen ran her first reelection campaign with the traditional perks of an 
incumbent -- name recognition, political allies and a campaign war chest far 
larger than her opponent's. Registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by a 
narrow 43% to 41% in the district. 
</P>

James Benning, Scott Collins, Mary Moore and Susan Woodward, contributed to

DECISION '94; 3 POLICE-BACKED CANDIDATES WIN SEATS ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three police union-backed candidates were elected to the Santa Monica City 
Council on Tuesday in the wake of a campaign that centered on public safety and 
homeless-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Robert T. Holbrook, with 16.3% of the vote, ran first among a field 
of 11 candidates competing for three seats. His slate-mate, Los Angeles Deputy 
City Atty. Ruth Ebner, came in second with 15.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The results made for a bad night for Santa Monicans for Renters Rights, whose 
candidates have long controlled the City Council. Only one of its candidates -- 
urban planner Pam O'Connor -- was elected, shaving the group's control of the 
council to one seat, 4 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook and Ebner were supported by Citizens for a Safe Santa Monica, which 
was outspent about 3 to 1 by the renters rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election results point out we were in step with what Santa Monicans 
needed and wanted," Holbrook said. "We had the right issue." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor won the third council seat with 15.6% of the vote. Along with backing 
by the renters group, O'Connor was endorsed by the Santa Monica Police Officers 
Assn., as were Holbrook and Ebner. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of incumbent Tony Vazquez, the first Latino elected to the Santa 
Monica City Council four years ago, was especially painful for the renters 
group. Vazquez was considered a rising political star and his backers predicted 
last summer that he would become the first Latino mayor of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez blamed his loss on "the racism that still exists in our city. . . . 
The racism that came out in this campaign was just unbelievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez was targeted for defeat by the police officers association, which 
attacked his public safety record with repeated campaign mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The association also took out ads reminding voters that in 1991, Vazquez 
proposed allowing non-citizens to vote in local elections. Although the ads 
said Vazquez proposed letting illegal immigrants vote, he said that he had 
sought voting rights for legal immigrants who were not U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the cornerstone of the police attack revolved around public safety. 
Bucking the recent tide in Santa Monica on crime and homeless issues, Vazquez 
voted against nearly all enforcement measures brought to the council, such as 
closing the parks at night. As alternatives, he favored crime prevention 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That placed him in the minority even among the council members elected with 
the backing of the renters group.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Vazquez came in fourth place with 14.4% of the vote, despite a 
hard-fought campaign during which he took a month off work to walk precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Bruria Finkel, another candidate backed by the renters group, finished 
fifth with 14.2% of the vote. The third member of the Holbrook slate, Matthew 
Kanny, was sixth with 11% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Santa Monica results, voters passed a school bond issue and a 
cost-cutting measure that will allow a summary of proposed ordinances to be 
published instead of the entire text. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook predicted that the reconfigured council will ensure that the recently 
enacted public safety measures will be enforced and will demonstrate more 
concern for the needs of the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 The election represents the first time in almost a decade that the renters 
group couldn't pull a last-minute victory out of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook and Ebner's one-two finish also reversed another trend. Council 
candidates that have not had the renters group's support haven't been the top 
two vote-getters since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the renters group blamed their setback on rental units lost in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake and on further loss of units from a program allowing 
apartment buildings to be converted to condominiums. Nancy Greenstein, 
co-chairwoman of the group, said Vazquez was engulfed by a wave of statewide 
anti-crime sentiment and suffered by being "villainized" by the police union. 
"I just didn't see him as anti-public safety," Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he usually votes against Vazquez on public safety and homeless 
issues, Councilman Paul Rosenstein expressed regret about his colleague's 
defeat, saying: "It's unfortunate there's little tolerance for a councilman who 
voted his conscience."

DECISION '94; SCHOOL OFFICIALS DELIGHTED WITH OVERWHELMING APPROVAL OF PROP. K 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica and Malibu school officials were elated Wednesday after voters in 
the school district linking the two communities overwhelmingly agreed to 
increase the local parcel tax to $68 a year from its current $58. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition K received 74% of the vote in Tuesday's balloting -- well over the 
two-thirds' majority needed to pass the measure, which is expected to boost 
school revenues by $300,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when we knew it would be a struggle, given the economic 
climate," said Neil Schmidt, the Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District 
superintendent. "I had hoped to get 65%, but we didn't expect 74%." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's voting also decided four seats on the Santa Monica/Malibu school 
board and four on the Santa Monica Community College Board of Trustees. But 
perhaps the most closely watched local school decision was the vote on the 
parcel tax, which would have expired had Proposition K not passed.  
</P>
<P>
 The results, Schmidt said, underscore the importance local residents place on 
high-quality schooling -- and the district's duty to provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So often, people say public education is so critical, but you rarely see 
action," he said. "With the passage of Proposition K, the responsibility is now 
placed on the school district to follow through." 
</P>
<P>
 The new parcel tax will be levied on Santa Monica and Malibu property owners 
for six years starting July 1, 1995. Schmidt said new revenues from the $10 
increase will be used for school maintenance, library improvements, and 
purchases of computers and other technology for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Pam Brady, who was reelected to a second term, said at one 
point she was concerned that Proposition K would fail. She said she was amazed 
that the parcel tax measure passed by such an overwhelming margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is to be commended for understanding where priorities are," 
said Brady. "The community came together for these kids, and that's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Monica/Malibu school board race, both incumbents running for 
reelection -- Brady and Brenda Gottfried -- won new four-year terms. The other 
two seats on the ballot were open to newcomers because board incumbents 
Patricia Hoffman and Michael Hill chose not to seek reelection. Those seats 
were won by Julia Brownley, a management consultant, and teacher Terri L. 
Cohen.  
</P>
<P>
 Gottfried and Brownley were backed by Santa Monicans for Renters Rights 
(SMRR). A third candidate supported by SMRR, Harlan Dorin, finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Brownley said one of her priorities is to see that the district completes its 
ongoing school rebuilding program, which has fallen behind schedule. The 
project is being financed by a $75-million bond issue passed in 1990. 
Televising board meetings, Brownley said, is another goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the passage of Proposition 187, Schmidt, the superintendent, 
said the district has been advised to "hold tight until we get direction from 
the courts and the state." Schmidt added that he's confident that student 
unrest won't be a problem in the Santa Monica/Malibu schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we'll have angry students," said Schmidt. "But this will also be 
an opportunity to learn how to challenge that frustration and take political 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some of the board members elected Tuesday expressed dismay at the 
passage of Proposition 187, which would deny public education and non-emergency 
health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand people were trying to send a message, but inadvertently hurting 
children is wrong," said board member Brady. "I recognize there is a problem 
(with illegal immigration), but it isn't our job to become the immigration 
enforcers. We have enough to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the contest for the Santa Monica Community College board, only one of the 
two incumbents seeking reelection -- Carole Currey -- won a new four-year term. 
Incumbent Ralph R. Villani finished sixth in the race for four seats. The two 
other incumbents whose seats were up for election -- Alfred Quinn and Colin 
Petrie -- decided not to seek new terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The three newcomers to win seats on the board were Nancy Cattell and Dorothy 
Ehrhart-Morrison, both retired educators backed by SMRR, and Herbert Roney, a 
former administrator at Santa Monica College.  
</P>
<P>
 The three new trustees said they all agreed with Currey on the board's primary 
task: finding a new college president to replace Richard Moore, who recently 
became president of the Community College of Southern Nevada.

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; STREETS STAY CALM AFTER PROP. 187 WIN

<P>
 Law enforcement agencies reported that the Los Angeles area was quiet after 
Tuesday's election, despite earlier concerns that passage of the controversial 
Proposition 187 could trigger civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officials reported no election-related incidents 
on the Westside as of Wednesday morning, although the department called in some 
officers who were scheduled to be off and planned to remain on maximum 
deployment throughout the day Wednesday, said Officer Lorie Taylor, a 
department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday morning, opponents of Proposition 187 had held only one 
protest in the area. Between 75 and 100 students conducted a peaceful walkout 
at Hamilton High School in West Los Angeles, Taylor said. However, the LAPD 
reported two bomb threats possibly related to the election Wednesday, one at 
Parker Center and another at the federal building in Van Nuys. Both turned out

 Proposition 187, which seeks to deny public education and health services to 
illegal immigrants, was overwhelmingly passed by voters Tuesday. The 
controversial ballot initiative had prompted thousands of protest rallies in 
Southern California, primarily in high schools, before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD had been on tactical alert Monday because of the number of 
demonstrations in opposition to Proposition 187. The tactical alert was 
downgraded to the maximum-deployment designation on Tuesday, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported no election-related 
incidents occurring immediately before or after the election. A sheriff's 
spokeswoman said there had been no indication that anything out of the ordinary 
would take place, and the department was not on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica police said the city was calm Tuesday, and the department 
continued with normal levels of staffing on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any indications or heard any rumors that demonstrations are 
planned," said police Lt. Bill Brucker. There had been two peaceful protest 
marches in Santa Monica preceding the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City police said they remained on modified tactical alert, with extra 
officers in the field. Beverly Hills police reported no election-related 
incidents and officers were not on alert.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; DRAMA LOOKS AT VIOLENCE, GUNS, YOUTHS

 Al Garrett's mother told him she would shoot him if he ever joined a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 That threat -- and his mother's support -- has kept the 19-year-old out of the 
swirl of violence that has claimed some friends in his Inglewood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the same kids who were approaching me to join the gangs dying. Even 
those who tried to leave the gangs would get shot a couple of months later by a 
rival gang who didn't care whether they were in or out of the gang," Garrett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, now a professional actor, plays the lead character in "POW!!" (Power 
Over Weapons), a two-act drama performed by the Theatre Rascals in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, with a cast of 28 performers ages 12 to 21, is a hard-impact drama 
about guns, violence and youngsters, based on the experiences of youths like 
Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "POW!!" centers on the Chamberlins, a family of three teen-agers and their 
mother, who raises them after their father's death. The teen-agers struggle 
with the pressures of growing up in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the father dies, the family is disintegrated because they no longer have 
a father figure, so they fall victim to the outside vices. But in the end the 
family comes together. So the solution is that we all have to come together to 
conquer this problem over weapons," said producer Felecia Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 The pow of gunshots on high school campuses has become all too familiar. 
Playwright Deirdre Weston included a key scene about one of the Chamberlin boys 
who totes a gun to school to boost his low self-esteem. His gun accidentally 
goes off and kills a student. 
</P>
<P>
 "POW!!" will be performed at the Richard Pryor Theatre, 1445 N. Las Palmas 
Ave., Hollywood, through Nov. 20; at 8 p.m. Fridays; 3 and 8 p.m. Saturdays, 
and at 3 p.m. Sundays. Tickets are $15 for adults, $7.50 for 12 and younger. 
Information: (213) 466-1767.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; ARMY WIDOW SEEKS MEDAL, COMPENSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than six months after her husband's death in "friendly fire" over Iraq, 
Culver City resident Kaye Mounsey says she still has hope that the military 
will pay her husband, Erik, the respect she feels his memory deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Army will fly a helicopter missing-man formation in tribute to Erik 
Mounsey during a tree-planting ceremony in Culver City on Friday, Kate Mounsey 
said the military has ignored her plea for $94,000 in additional death benefits 
and a posthumous Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
 In what appears to be a case of mistaken identity, Erik Mounsey was killed by 
American F-15 fighter pilots when his Black Hawk helicopter shot down over Iraq 
a day before his 29th birthday. Mounsey was one of 26 passengers, including 11 
foreign military personnel, aboard two Black Hawks that were flying a routine 
mission in a no-fly zone. The fighter pilots say they thought the helicopters 
belonged to the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States government paid $100,000 in compensation to the 
families of the French, British, Turkish and Kurdish soldiers who died, Kate 
Mounsey, who has a 2-year-old daughter, has received only the normal $6,000 
death benefit paid by the Army. The military contends that there are laws 
preventing it from increasing that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Mounsey and the families of the other American soldiers who died in the 
crash have started a letter-writing campaign. Backed by Rep. Julian C. Dixon 
(D-Los Angeles), they are requesting more money, and Mounsey says she will 
continue pushing until she gets some results. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to be fair and offer American families the same, or not offer 
anyone anything," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Her efforts to secure a Purple Heart for her husband have been slightly more 
successful. Dixon has included in the defense appropriations budget a request 
to award the Purple Heart to Mounsey and the other Americans who died. The 
military must respond to the request by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought, 'The Purple Heart, it's just a medal, it won't bring him 
back,' " she said. "But it would at least show that the government acknowledges 
what he did."  
</P>
<P>
 Culver City will pay tribute to Erik Mounsey during the city's Veterans Day 
activities. The city will plant a tree next to the entrance to Culver Park and 
erect a monument in Mounsey's memory. MARY MOORE

WATER GARDEN: NOT A WATER TREATMENT PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The main architectural impression you get from the Water Garden in Santa 
Monica (Westside, Oct. 30) is that the Soviets won the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 But, its name notwithstanding, this Gargantuan object is not a water treatment 
plant. And those huge, curved green pipes on the side -- they are not water 
conduits, but arches and arcades!

VENICE: PLANNER'S INTENTION FOR THE OCEAN FRONT WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The original deed for my Ocean Front Walk property from Abbot Kinney and his 
partners declares that no cesspool, goats, cigar stand, candy store or other 
enterprise could be put on the property. Further, the house that was to be 
built had to be set back from Ocean Front and the public.These conditions point 
out a fact that all the articles (Westside, Oct. 23, etc.) miss: Kinney and his 
partners planned a community in which the commerce and entertainment were 
confined within about a two-block radius of the piers and the rest of the Ocean 
Front Walk was for residences and a few attendant neighborhood services. They 
understood that the beauty of the beach as a physically and mentally 
rejuvenating natural resource was what drew the crowds. The Ocean Front was 
planned for the fortunate few who could build homes and the thousands who could 
escape the heat and stress of the city and come for a stroll; expected, of 
course, to end up at the piers. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbot Kinney's dream crested long ago. Today's tidal wave of entrepreneurs 
should understand that the beach is our prize! Silly cosmetic make-overs will 
not redress the fundamental demise of the Ocean Front Walk because it was never 
intended to support a commercial zone.

REGIONAL REPORT: PORT OF LOS ANGELES; $43 MILLION TO BE SPENT ON WATER 
RECYCLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles will spend about $43 million to convert the Terminal 
Island waste-water treatment plant into a water recycling facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant treats sewage from Wilmington and San Pedro and then discharges it 
into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, the city has been unable to prove that the quality of discharged 
water meets state guidelines, said Jerry Gewe, water resources engineer at the 
city Department of Water and Power. In 1985, the California Regional Water 
Quality Control Board ordered the city to improve water quality.  
</P>
<P>
 Gewe said three options were considered by the city, including using pipes to 
discharge the waste water into the ocean past the breakwater, where water 
quality standards for discharge are lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council agreed on the water reclamation plan in July and the 
water board approved the plan Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1999, the plant will produce five million gallons of reusable water a day 
for industry. Eventually, all effluent will be recycled, Gewe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was better to get a resource we could utilize instead of just 
putting it out into the ocean," he said. SUSAN WOODWARD

 STREAKING COMETS 
</P>
<P>
 The Westchester High football team is headed in the right direction entering 
the final week of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets (8-1, 6-0 in the Coastal Conference) have clinched at least a tie 
for the best record in the conference and have won eight games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 If Westchester wins today at Manual Arts, they are expected to be seeded among 
the top four teams in the City Section 4-A Division playoffs when the selection 
committee announces the 16-team brackets Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Comets lose, they could finish in a three-way tie with Manual Arts 
(6-3, 5-1) and University (6-3, 5-1), which plays at Hamilton (1-8, 1-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Would the Comets still get an automatic playoff bid because they have the best 
overall record? 
</P>
<P>
 Comets Coach Larry Wein said there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I know is that the conference champion is guaranteed a playoff 
spot," Wein said. "I don't know what happens in case of ties." 
</P>
<P>
 Wein is not the only coach confused by the new playoff format. For the first 
time, the City did not predetermine whether a team competes in the 3-A or 4-A 
divisions. Instead, the City Section chose to wait until the end of the season 
to select the 16-team brackets for each of the two divisional playoffs. Only 
the six conference champions receive automatic bids to the 4-A playoffs. The 
selection committee will chose the remaining 10 at-large teams for the 4-A 
playoffs and 16 at-large teams for the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the confusion is that two perennial 4-A playoff teams -- defending 
4-A champion Carson and Locke -- have losing records because they forfeited 
games for using ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Carson make the playoffs with a potential 2-5 Southern Pacific 
Conference record and 2-8 overall record? Without question the Colts are one of 
the City's top six teams and compete in the toughest conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Wein says no. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, the record should determine who goes to the playoffs," he said. 
"How can you justify any team going to the playoffs with a 2-8 record?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets have played the past four weeks without tailback Kaaron Conwright, 
who sprained his right ankle, and the past three weeks without tight end Tony 
Griffin, who strained a ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester has proven to have plenty of depth with 5-foot-1 running back 
Darryl Dennis carrying the ball. In a 20-0 win over Palisades Friday, Dennis 
had seven carries for 112 yards and a touchdown. He also had another touchdown 
called back because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl is kind of fun to watch," Wein said. "He started the season as a 
fifth-string running back on the scout team and worked his way into the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably one of the best running backs in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 During Griffin's absence, Comet quarterback Damion Ward has spread his passes 
around to William Reed, Courtney Brown and Louis Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Comets will have a difficult time against the Toilers, who beat 
City 4-A finalist Dorsey during a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can determine our own fate," Wein said. "We need to play good ball at this 
point of the season." BRAGGING RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Coach Robert Moore knew his team would not need to hold homecoming 
during the final week of the season because the Centaurs would be playing 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always draw a big crowd for Beverly Hills," Moore said. "They play us 
tough every year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centaurs (8-1, 6-0 in the Ocean League) can expect a capacity crowd for 
tonight's game against the Normans that will determine the Ocean League 
championship. With a victory, the Centaurs win the title outright. If they 
lose, they share the league championship with the Normans (6-3, 5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the Centaurs won a share of the title with a 31-13 win over 
Redondo. Centaur quarterback Damon Williams completed 11 of 17 passes for 323 
yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Jasiri Rodell had five receptions for 162 
yards and two touchdowns. Running back Jahmal Wright rushed 11 times for 71 
yards and two touchdowns and caught two passes for 62 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that the Centaurs are ranked second in Division VII, Moore 
considers his team to be underdogs against the 10th-ranked Normans. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I hear, they are pretty pumped up about the game," Moore said. "I 
would say we're six-point underdogs." SEEKING REVENGE 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Coach Carter Paysinger scoffs at the idea of the Normans being 
favorites against Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're 6-0 in league. What does that tell you?" Paysinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paysinger has not had a lot of success against Culver City. He lost twice to 
the Centaurs when he was a receiver/defensive back for the Normans in 1972 and 
1973 and is 1-2 as a coach. His only win came in 1991 when the Normans rallied 
for a 22-21 victory to claim the Ocean League title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beating Culver City has always been a top priority," Paysinger said. "This 
year or any year. We want to go to the playoffs, win our league and beat Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting calls every day from alumni about this game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans will be strengthen by the addition of linebacker Jeff Greenberg, 
wide receiver Larry Bavra and linebacker Mike Levy, all of whom have been out 
for extended time because of injuries. COSTLY TURNOVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for the Camino Real League championship, St. Monica got lost in the 
emotion of the game and made some crucial mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners committed four turnovers in the first half, including two inside 
their own 10-yard line, and lost to Harvard-Westlake, 23-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave it away in a number of ways, me included," St. Monica Coach Norm Lacy 
said. "I got emotionally involved as an offensive coordinator and it affected 
my play-calling. You can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading 6-0, Lacy called for an option play at the St. Monica three-yard line. 
Jason Jones mishandled the pitch from quarterback Steve Pulley and Wolverines' 
Nick Chang recovered the fumble. Three plays later, Harvard-Westlake tied the 
score, 6-6, on a Abed Abusaleh's one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 On St. Monica's next possession, the Mariners snapped the ball over the 
punters' head and the Wolverines took over at St. Monica's nine-yard line. 
Abusaleh scored his second of three touchdowns on a six-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them two scores inside the 10-yard line," Lacy said. "You can't do 
that against good teams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners fought back to take a 20-16 lead with 10 minutes 30 seconds left, 
but the Wolverines came back with a 16-play, 74-yard drive with Abusaleh 
scoring the winning points on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Monica plays host to Cantwell-Sacred Heart Saturday at Santa Monica 
College in a game that will determine second place in league and a possible 
home site for the first round of the Southern Section Division IX playoffs. 
COACHING CHANGES 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Aronin, former Notre Dame Academy girls' basketball coach, has accepted a 
similar position at West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronin, 50, had resigned from Notre Dame to accept a position at St. Anthony 
of Long Beach in June. When St. Anthony threatened to drop its girls' program, 
Aronin was given his release to pursue other job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronin compiled a 66-13 record in four seasons and guided Notre Dame to the 
Southern Section Division IV-AA quarterfinals three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've received unbelievable support from the school administration and the 
players," Aronin said. "This is the type of program that I've been looking 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame named Nancy O'Sullivan as its new girls' basketball coach, 
replacing Aronin. O'Sullivan was the women's basketball coach at Citrus College 
from 1989 to 1993. NET WIN 
</P>
<P>
 The Notre Dame girls' volleyball team completed a perfect 10-0 record in the 
Sunshine League, defeating Marymount, 16-14, 15-10, 15-13, last Thursday at 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle blocker Lisa Sweeney had 16 kills and 16 blocks to lead the Regals. 
Outside hitter Kim Adams and setter Debbie Callari also played key roles. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh league title in 15 years under Coach Tom Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our team's ability to keep the ball in play is what kept us 
successful during the season," Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (12-2) was seeded fourth in the Southern Section Division II 
playoffs. They played Glendale Wednesday night at Notre Dame. SEAN WATERS

RECREATION; ROLL PLAYING; GALVANIZED BY THE POPULARITY OF IN-LINE SKATING AND 
SEEING THE PROS ON ICE, STREET HOCKEY IS GROWING AS A HOBBY AND ORGANIZED 
RECREATIONAL SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In 1988, Bryan Garland took over a recreational foot-hockey league in Buena 
Park. The sputtering organization was not in good shape. After attracting a 
high of about 30 adult teams in the mid-'80s, the 10-year-old league had 
dwindled to just 15 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, Garland and his partner, Gil Morrison, can scarcely believe 
that this same league -- since moved to Garden Grove -- consists of more than 
85 foot- and 190 roller-hockey teams. (Ann Victor, director of public relations 
for the Anaheim Bullfrogs of the professional Roller Hockey International 
League, said the duo's California Street Hockey Assn. may be the largest 
organization of its kind in the country.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought we could run a successful league (back in '80s)," said 
Garland, who operates the league full time in conjunction with the city of 
Garden Grove. "There were a lot of East Coast transplants from (hockey hot 
beds) Boston, New York and Chicago living in the area. But I don't think any of 
us predicted it would become this popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Galvanized by the recent popularity of in-line roller skating and professional 
ice hockey, street hockey is among the fastest rising recreational sports in 
Southern California. There are more than a dozen adult and/or youth street 
hockey leagues in and around the Orange County area. While a few of these 
leagues have foot-hockey divisions, the majority of them are upstart 
organizations catering solely to the burgeoning number of roller-hockey 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of whom are obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Hitt plays hockey about five days a week and is in three roller 
divisions in the Garden Grove league. Her Black Widows team takes part in both 
the all-women and adult rookie divisions. In the latter category, her unit goes 
up against male dominated teams. She also plays on a co-ed team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach resident said she has participated in a multitude of sports 
from volleyball and softball to skiing and mountain biking. Yet she's given 
them all up since she took up roller hockey about two years back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no other sport that compares," she said. "It uses everything you've 
got. You have to use your physical and mental (abilities). I love it. It's an 
addiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Jamison of Cypress may be the ultimate roller-hockey mom, with five boys 
age 8 to 15 participating in the Garden Grove league. And her in-line-skating, 
6-year-old daughter is eager to join a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamison doesn't find her children's passion for roller hockey difficult to 
fathom. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like the movement. They can use their talents as good skaters as well as 
their other physical skills. They want something that's fast-paced. It's not 
like golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamison also finds comfort in the fact that roller hockey is set up to be much 
safer than ice hockey. The vast majority of recreational street-hockey leagues 
have non-checking rules that penalize players who deliberately use the rough 
body contact allowed in ice hockey. The plastic pucks used in adult and teen 
roller hockey are also lighter than the hard-rubber pucks used in ice hockey. 
(Many foot and preteen roller leagues use soft plastic balls instead of pucks.) 
</P>
<P>
 The rabid response to the game so impressed Garden Grove officials that the 
city recently built a $90,000 outdoor playing facility for the local league and 
community. The rink is scheduled to open Saturday. The Garden Grove Roller 
Hockey Park -- which contains the rink, a playground and several baseball 
diamonds -- sits on Chapman Avenue, just east of Harbor Boulevard. The 
180-by-85-foot street-hockey rink is longer by about 40 feet than the Garden 
Grove league's two mid-size rinks at the Chapman Sports Complex, at Chapman 
Avenue and Knott Street. (The Garden Grove league plans to run games at both 
sites.) 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the rinks at the Chapman Sports Complex, the playing facility at the 
Garden Grove Roller Hockey Park is a Cadillac operation, including plexiglass 
walls, players' benches, penalty boxes and a grandstand. It's sure to rank as 
one of the most attractive outdoor roller-hockey rinks in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For league moguls Garland and Morrison, the Garden Grove Roller Hockey Park 
arrives at an ideal time. Their league added more than 60 teams this year in 
new roller divisions for children under 6, women, high-schoolers and college 
players. The organization already had firmly established categories for adult 
foot hockey and youth and adult roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County communities and budding street-hockey entrepreneurs have 
also found themselves scrambling to satisfy a public demand for organized 
leagues and rinks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, starting a youth street-hockey program was a matter of 
"self-preservation." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kevin Evans, the recreation superintendent there, "We found that 
a lot of our tennis and basketball courts were being utilized for makeshift 
hockey rinks. We were also getting complaints from the community about kids 
playing roller hockey in the middle of the streets. So we had a (small, 
120-by-60-foot) roller-hockey rink built in our tennis court earlier this year 
and away we went." 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine last year, volleyball coach Gary Coffey decided to start a summer 
roller-hockey league "just for the fun of it." His sons had started to play, 
and there was space for two small rinks in an indoor facility where he coached. 
</P>
<P>
 The response to his Orange County Roller Hockey organization was so great that 
he now runs three eight-week seasons during the year. About 50 teams 
participate in youth and adult divisions. Coffey is negotiating to move his 
league into a more spacious building to accommodate larger rinks. 
</P>
<P>
 This upward spiral of street hockey in Southern California began when Wayne 
Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the Edmonton Oilers in August, 
1988. Widely considered ice hockey's best player, The Great One helped give the 
sport a strong identity in an area where it had long been treated with cool 
detachment.  
</P>
<P>
 And during the past several years, the birth of the wildly popular Anaheim 
Mighty Ducks in the National Hockey League and the Anaheim Bullfrogs and Los 
Angeles Blades of the fledgling Roller Hockey International League helped make 
street hockey even more alluring. Last season the Mighty Ducks averaged 16,989 
fans and the Bullfrogs 10,100 per game at the 17,174-seat Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has perhaps been the widespread popularity of in-line skating -- 
particularly among kids -- that has given street hockey its biggest boost. 
Young skaters often acquire an interest in roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started in-line skating first with friends when I was 13," said Mario 
Cueva, 16, who participates in an indoor league operated by Stuart's Roller 
World in Fullerton. "I also did some ice skating. Then I saw some hockey 
leagues. Since I could skate and I liked hockey, I decided to join." 
</P>
<P>
 For many adults and youths, in-line roller hockey is attractive because it 
encompasses many of the characteristics of ice hockey without that sport's 
relatively high costs and inconveniences. Because there are so few ice rinks in 
Southern California, ice hockey players can find themselves paying higher fees 
to play late at night or early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to play ice hockey, but I lived in Corona, where there is no 
ice rink," said Garland, a longtime foot-hockey player. "I would have had to 
practice in Brea at 5 a.m. a lot of times, and then I would have had to drive 
all over the place to other rinks to play other teams. You'll see a growth in 
ice hockey because of the popularity of the Kings and Ducks. More ice rinks 
will get built. But it will always be an expensive sport." 
</P>
<P>
 It can cost two to four times more per game to play ice hockey than roller 
hockey in Southern California. A roller player can join a league for as little 
as $60 for a 10-game season. One youth roller-hockey organization run by the 
city of San Juan Capistrano even offers scholarships and lends equipment to 
financially challenged families. Garland's Garden Grove league also offers 
registration discounts to some low-income families. Roller leagues usually 
require players to purchase their own playing gear, but some organizations 
provide jerseys and the more expensive goalie equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the players are outfitted and ready for the faceoff, they'll find the 
game's emphasis is more on skating ability than physical play. The non-checking 
rules and use of four skaters and a goalie per team (as opposed to ice hockey's 
five skaters and a goalie) in many teen and adult leagues can make for a fast 
and high-scoring game. 
</P>
<P>
 When roller hockey is played indoors on a hard, plastic-tile surface called 
Sports Court, the action can be even more fevered. Stuart's Roller World in 
Fullerton and Orange County Roller Hockey in Irvine are two leagues that offer 
this faster playing surface. Most roller facilities have concrete or wooden 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
 But just because you're playing on squatty little wheels instead of precarious 
steel blades doesn't mean the sport is as easy to master as an empty-net goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Most roller-hockey players warn it requires much time and practice to become a 
proficient in-line skater. Because the wheels are in line, some participants 
say skating can be as difficult to master as ice skating. The major difference 
is that in-line skates don't allow for the quick stops that can be made with 
ice skates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than taking the edge of your blades and biting into the ice like you 
do with ice skates, you do quick turns. You do circular motions (to stop)," 
Garland explained, adding that in-line skates have made roller hockey a more 
enticing game because they offer players more speed and maneuverability than 
the old four-wheel jobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 As for foot-hockey players, most are adults who took up the sport before 
in-line skating helped make the roller game all the rage. Many of these players 
remain staunch supporters of foot hockey, which generally requires better 
conditioning than the roller version. 
</P>
<P>
 But just about everyone agrees that the tide of street hockey is quickly and 
most definitely turning toward the roller game. Even some long-time foot hockey 
players are turning in their tennis shoes for in-line skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Tuckman's team, the Barbarians of the Garden Grove league, recently moved 
over from the foot soldiers. The Lake Forest computer-chip salesman underscores 
how tough the transition can be. He spends several nights a week just 
practicing skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make the commitment to learn how to skate well if you're going to 
play roller hockey," said Tuckman, a transplanted New Yorker. "It's worth it. 
It's so much more fun on skates. It's more like real hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how popular roller hockey will become is uncertain. But it's clearly off 
to a blazing start in Southern California. Even the National Hockey League's 
current work stoppage hasn't slowed roller hockey's momentum. And there's 
serious talk of elevating it from a club status in high schools to a California 
Interscholastic Federation sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of parents come up to us and say, 'My kids are only playing 
roller hockey now. We can't get them back into baseball,' " Garland said. "It's 
such an addictive sport. Its (growth) is going to be amazing. You can see it 
now. Two years ago you didn't see anyone playing it. Now you see kids on every 
block playing it." Primer to Roller Hockey 
</P>
<P>
 Roller hockey, the sport in which players lace up in-line skates and joust on 
indoor and outdoor rinks, is booming in Orange County. A look at the game, the 
garb and the ground rules: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 (Not-So) Rink-a-Dink 
</P>
<P>
 The typical rink is at least 180 feet long and 70 feet wide. Roller Hockey 
International, the sport's governing board, recommends 200 feet by 85 feet. The 
surface must be surrounded by at least a four-foot wall to keep the puck in 
play. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Goal 
</P>
<P>
 Penalty bench 
</P>
<P>
 Player Roles 
</P>
<P>
 Teams have four skaters -- a center, winger and two defensemen -- plus a 
goalie.

<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rules to Roll By 
</P>
<P>
 * Playing time: Four 12-minute quarters, 15-minute halftime; two-minute breaks 
between quarters. Home team chooses goal; teams change at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Game start: Faceoff at rink center. After a timeout: Game resumes at the 
faceoff spot nearest where play ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shootout: Game cannot end in a tie. Five players on each team take one shot 
each at guarded goal, alternating sides until all have shot. Team with best 
score wins. Shootout repeated until tie is broken. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Game Gear 
</P>
<P>
 Even though players skate softly and carry a big flat stick, protective gear 
is a must. Here's what they need to get rolling: 
</P>
<P>
 Skate Close-Up 
</P>
<P>
 The in-line skate is the most important tool of roller hockey. Main rule: 
Never buy for the wheels -- they'll quickly wear out and need replacing. Look 
for a snug, comfortable fit and durability. Other factors: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wheels: Larger strides mean larger wheels. Sizes range from 72 to 76 
millimeters. Relative hardness of a wheel is measured in durometers. Choose a 
soft wheel (78A) to grip surfaces better. A hard wheel (85A) is great for 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frames: Make certain frame can fit 76-millimeter wheel. Nylon frames are 
less expensive, good for beginners. Faster, power players will want to try 
light, aluminum frames. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boot: Look for a flexible yet stiff boot to prevent ankle injuries. Nylon 
provides immediate comfort and removable liner (for laundering). * Note: Goalie 
can wear five-wheel skates; all others must wear four wheels. Helmet: Vented, 
light plastic 
</P>
<P>
 Elbow pads: Molded to fit contour and movement 
</P>
<P>
 Gloves: Thick rubber covers fingers and forearms 
</P>
<P>
 Hip pads: Thick padding worn under uniform 
</P>
<P>
 Kneepads: Lightweight foam and nylon for snug fit 
</P>
<P>
 Stick: Wood, carbon composite or aluminum; no longer than 60 inches 
</P>
<P>
 The Floor: Basic roller hockey surfaces: concrete, plastic-interwoven tile and 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Puck: A roller hockey puck, made of plastic, is lighter than an ice hockey 
puck. Beveled runners work best on smooth surfaces, flat runners on a textured 
surface. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hockey Faceoff 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are similar, roller hockey and ice hockey do have basic 
differences: 
</P>
<P>
 Roller Hockey 
</P>
<P>
 Players: Four skaters plus goalie 
</P>
<P>
 Periods: Four 12-minute quarters with a halftime 
</P>
<P>
 Final Score: Shootout breaks ties 
</P>
<P>
 Contact: Body check constitutes a foul 
</P>
<P>
 Ice Hockey 
</P>
<P>
 Players: Five skaters plus goalie 
</P>
<P>
 Periods: Three 20-minute periods 
</P>
<P>
 Final Score: Game can end in tie 
</P>
<P>
 Contact: Body and hip checks allowed 
</P>

Times Hockey Basics 
</P>
<P>
 These basic drills can hone hockey skills. To improve passing and shooting 
skills, players should practice snapping their wrists and sweeping, not 
slapping, the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 Stick-Handling Drill 
</P>
<P>
 Place 10 small obstacles in a row. Straddling the row, push puck between 
obstacles. Repeat, skating backward. Tip: Key is to avoid obstacles while 
moving puck around them; do it with head and eyes up rather than watching the 
puck. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating Drill 
</P>
<P>
 Standing with knees slightly bent, push out to the side until leg is fully 
extended. Repeat on same side until reaching end of rink; repeat on other leg. 
Tip: Skating in a straight line on same leg for a few hundred feet will develop 
muscle strength and good form. 
</P>
<P>
 Deke Drill 
</P>
<P>
 Tip: This basic drill helps perfect faking. Use it on goalies to make them 
move laterally, creating a shooting zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Guide puck to cone at comfortable pace, lean shoulders and head one direction, 
then hit puck opposite way. Source: Anaheim Bullfrogs; Researched by APRIL

 Hip terms for happening hockey players: 
</P>
<P>
 Biscuit: Puck 
</P>
<P>
 Bread and butter: A player's favorite move 
</P>
<P>
 Go coast to coast: Puck handler skates rink from end to end and gets shot off 
or scores goal 
</P>
<P>
 Pull a Savard: Turn a complete circle as a move on an opponent, named after 
ice hockey star Denis Savard 
</P>
<P>
 Put it in the cookie jar: Scoring at top section of goal 
</P>
<P>
 Saucer pass: Passing puck in air over an opponent's hockey stick 
</P>
<P>
 Score in the five-hole: Put puck between the goalie's legs for a goal

ODD SQUAD; AT FIRST, JOE ELY AND PAUL KELLY SEEM NOTHING ALIKE, BUT LOOK CLOSER 
AND YOU'LL SEE SIMILARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The names Joe Ely and Paul Kelly make for an imperfect rhyme, but their mutual 
presence on the bill Friday at the Coach House promises many perfect examples 
of the song-crafter's art. 
</P>
<P>
 If one considers only their stage personalities, Ely, the fiery Texan from 
Lubbock, and Kelly, the quiet, unassuming Australian from Melbourne, are two 
completely different types. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath the surface, similarities pop up. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the two performers, who will play separate solo acoustic sets, 
are responsible for two of this year's best albums. Ely and a bunch of his 
friends from the fertile Texas singer-songwriter scene collaborated on "Songs 
From Chippy," an album of music written for a play based on the real-life, 
Depression-era diaries of a West Texas prostitute. Few albums have better 
captured a sense of time and place -- and timelessness, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Incorporating country, Western swing and cabaret music, "Songs From Chippy" 
sounds like a ghostly echo, 50 or 60 years removed from its origins. Ely, who 
has been making rockin,' twangin' albums that cross back and forth between 
country, rock and folk since 1977, weighs in with "Goodnight Dear Diary," the 
wistful waltz that frames the album, "Cold Black Hammer," a dire-sounding work 
song, and "Whisky and Women and Money to Burn," a country sing-along that 
Waylon and Willie should be just itching to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's new album, "Wanted Man," is the latest in a series of strong records 
that goes back to his auspicious 1987 U.S. debut, "Gossip." Like Ely, Kelly 
doesn't limit himself stylistically. The new album begins with a fervent love 
ballad constructed with piano and strings, then proceeds to rippling folk-rock, 
tense reggae rhythms and a swaggering rockabilly-blues. 
</P>
<P>
 While his mild-mannered exterior doesn't mesh with commonplace notions of 
what's hot, Kelly writes some of the most accomplished erotic love songs in 
pop. There's nothing tawdry or reductive about "Just Like Animals" and "We've 
Started a Fire," both from his new album. They sizzle with physical passion but 
are more concerned with the eruption of feeling between sex partners than with 
the mechanics of clasping and grinding flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's subject matter is hardly limited to sex. "Everybody Wants to Touch Me" 
portrays a celebrity spitting out the bad taste that comes with being turned 
from a person into an object. "You're Still Picking the Same Sore" is a song 
that many listeners may want to send to warring couples who insist on drawing 
their friends into their battles. It's as biting as a gentle folk-rock tune can 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes Kelly distinctive is his ability to write direct, easily understood 
songs that avoid the obvious through subtle strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nukkanya," the tender, aching ballad that ends "Wanted Man," is a sad 
vignette about two parting lovers. It's also a moving commentary on poverty and 
the general tragedy of living -- rendered not with inflated conceits or barbed 
rhetoric, but in the natural-sounding words of an everyday working man who must 
leave his impoverished home to find work. In one line, "My land was once a 
river, I hate to see it slowly bleeding dry," Kelly gives his love song its 
political dimension. With a sighing couplet, "Nukkanya, don't it go to show 
what a man don't know/Nukkanya, baby, I really don't want to go," he elevates 
it to universal tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely and Kelly both have been able to put together excellent touring and studio 
bands over the years. Both have done commendable work as patrons of their own 
art. During the long years that Jimmie Dale Gilmore was in a self-imposed exile 
from the music business, Ely, his friend since their teens, performed Gilmore's 
songs and kept them in circulation. Then, when Gilmore re-emerged, Ely helped 
him land an independent record deal that proved to be the first step in 
Gilmore's ascent toward the hero status he now enjoys among fans of 
progressive-country music. Kelly, similarly, has helped Archie Roach, the 
superb aboriginal singer-songwriter, gain exposure both in Australia and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely and Kelly also have cult status in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely's rough-hewn combination of country and heartland rock has always been a 
hard sell to the mainstream, although it is not inconceivable that he could 
catch a break one day with one of his trademark, wild-eyed anthems. On "Songs 
From Chippy," a side-step from his solo career, Ely obviously was working for 
the fun, friendship and glory of it on an album destined for critics' Top 10s, 
but not Billboard's. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's intelligence, diversity and lack of overt flash have made him a 
candidate for life on small labels in the American market after an initial run 
on a major label, A&M. His 1992 album, "Comedy," was released in the States on 
Orange-based Doctor Dream Records, and the new one is on Vanguard, the revived 
imprint that was famous during the '60s folk boom. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 496-8930. MORE POP 
</P>
<P>
 IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO: WAR 
</P>
<P>
 With an album of new material, "Peace Sign," and a just-released double-CD 
retrospective, "War Anthology 1970-1994," it has been a busy year for the L.A. 
band, which mixes R&B, Latin music, rock and jazz. War plays the Coach House 
tonight, Nov. 10. (714) 496-8930. 
</P>
<P>
 IN ANAHEIM: BAZOOKA AND STANDARD FRUIT 
</P>
<P>
 "Blowhole" is the new album by Bazooka, the local rock-jazz instrumental power 
trio that's always good for a fun, energetic set. The group plays Sunday, Nov. 
13, in the Firecracker Lounge at Cattleman's Wharf restaurant, with Standard 
Fruit, a top local pop-rock attractions. (714) 502-9827 (tape). 
</P>
<P>
 IN IRVINE: ARLO GUTHRIE 
</P>
<P>
 If we could get anything we want, it would be for this former young upstart, 
now a frosty-maned folk patriarch, not to serve up "Alice's Restaurant" in 
concert. Other than that, Arlo is dependably good company. He plays at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre on Saturday, Nov. 12. (714) 854-4646.

 Dixie Dregs 
</P>
<P>
 "Night of the Living Dregs" (1979) 
</P>
<P>
 Polygram  
</P>
<P>
 During their heyday in the '70s, Dixie Dregs sometimes were lumped together 
with the era's many progressive rock bands. Even though most of its songs were 
shorter and less grandiose than those of, say, Yes and ELP, the Southern 
quintet displayed the sort of dazzling musical virtuosity that was one of the 
progressives' key trademarks. "Night of the Living Dregs," a collection of 
studio and live concert tracks, is a sterling example of why the Dregs were 
considered musicians' musicians by those in the know: On such tracks as 
"Country House Shuffle," they skillfully navigated intricate arrangements and 
tricky tempo changes that simply were beyond the reach of most groups. 
</P>
<P>
 A purely instrumental unit, the Dregs revolved around the fleet-fingered 
guitar work of Steve Morse and the violin wizardry of Allen Sloan, a formidable 
combination that helped shape a unique sound. In the full-tilt boogie "Punk 
Sandwich," the two hotshots exchange symbiotic runs like two longtime 
soul-mates headed straight for a musical nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Dregs never came close to scoring a hit record, Morse never 
achieved the widespread notoriety afforded such '70s guitar heroes as Steve 
Howe of Yes, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. But his ability to launch searing 
electric leads -- and to pick cleanly on the acoustic guitar -- made him one of 
the most accomplished instrumentalists in rock. (Morse has released numerous 
albums on his own and has won best overall guitar honors from Guitar Player 
magazine an astonishing five times.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Night of the Living Dregs" puts the group's versatility on proud display. 
"The Bash" is a foot-stomping hillbilly track; country elements color 
"Patchwork"; a funky bass part anchors the rocking title tune, and the old 
world acoustic song "The Riff Raff" can take you back to the Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dregs broke up in the early '80s; reunited several years ago, they 
released a live album, "Bring 'Em Back Alive." But of the group that recorded 
"Night of the Living Dregs," only Morse and drummer Rod Morgenstein remain. 
Sloan is a doctor in North Carolina. JON MATSUMOTO

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

 The Bobs 
</P>
<P>
 "Cover the Songs Of . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Rounder  
</P>
<P>
 How deep do the Bobs' talents run? They're almost bottomless. 
</P>
<P>
 For proof, look no further than the first tune, a version of Cream's "White 
Room" that nails Eric Clapton's wah-wah guitar sound while simultaneously 
quoting his famous solo in the Beatles' "While My Guitar Gently Weeps." 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case you're new to this Bay Area quartet, they do it without so 
much as a guitar string. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the baker's dozen songs here are vehicles that carry the Bobs on their 
mission of celebrating the human voice, which seems capable of just about 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultra-cool sound of a muted fluegelhorn colors their swinging rendition of 
Ray Charles' "Unchain My Heart," and they conjure up the spooky aura of 
Hendrix's "The Wind Cries Mary" with nary a whammy bar in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-field choices provide the most fun. Who ever would have thought to do 
the Trammps' "Disco Inferno" a cappella? And if they owe much to Big Daddy for 
the way they reinvent Leonard Cohen's "Bird on a Wire" in the mold of the 
Rivingtons' "Surfing Bird," it reduces the joy quotient not a whit. 
</P>
<P>
 The one original is an ersatz country tune titled "Mess Me Up Again" that is 
one of the few instances where the group sounds like it's slumming, though the 
vocal approximation of a haunting steel guitar in the middle is a treat. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other anticlimactic moment is the album-closing performance of the 
Beatles' "Strawberry Fields Forever," in which a couple of the Fab Four's 
kaleidoscopic chord progressions get smoothed over. But with their vocal 
re-creation of the tape-loop experimentations of the original recording, the 
Bobs pull off the musical equivalent of a last-second, game-winning field goal.

THEATER; FILLING PECK'S BIG SHOES; BRUCE DAVISON DOESN'T MIND SUBURBAN 
'MOCKINGBIRD'; IT'S THE EXPERIENCE THAT COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few hours before the premiere of "To Kill a Mockingbird," now on the boards 
at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, the star of the show got a 
telegram from Gregory Peck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Bruce," it said, "With every good wish and a trace of envy that this 
time you will be playing Atticus. He's such a great character. Good but not too 
good to be true . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from the man who is indelibly associated with the role from his 
Oscar-winning performance in the 1962 screen version of "Mockingbird," the 
message had more significance for Bruce Davison than the usual show-biz boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "That movie is one of my all-time favorites," says Davison, a note of awe in 
his voice for "the impossible mantle" he must carry on the La Mirada stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The telegram from Peck, whom he barely knows, is the second time Peck 
surprised him with an unsolicited vote of confidence. The first was the night 
of the 1990 Academy Awards, when Davison was an Oscar nominee for his 
supporting role as a middle-aged homosexual in the AIDS movie "Longtime 
Companion." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd lost, and I was standing in the parking lot waiting for my car," Davison 
recalls in an interview over the phone from his home in the Hollywood Hills. 
"He came up behind me and put his arm on my shoulder, and I heard this voice 
say, 'I had to come here six times before they gave it to me. You'll be back, 
too. ' "  
</P>
<P>
 A return engagement would be nice, of course. And given his recent track 
record in such prestige pictures as "Short Cuts" and "Six Degrees of 
Separation," the blond Philadelphia-born actor might very well land the sort of 
role to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 One independent new movie he has made with Blythe Danner, now being edited, 
especially excites him. "It's Mark Medoff's latest," he says of the 
dramatist-screenwriter best known for the Tony Award-winning play and movie 
"Children of a Lesser God." "I play a sleazy lawyer. It's about what I call the 
first morally bankrupt generation and the parents and teachers who hatched it." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Davison, 48, has other, more mainstream movies coming out -- "Yellow Dog" 
(about a shipwrecked father and son) and "The Cure" (about a raft trip down the 
Mississippi seeking a miracle antidote to AIDS). 
</P>
<P>
 But for the moment he is content to work far from the Hollywood limelight at a 
suburban theatrical venue, which is overhauling its artistic identity with a 
new subscription series of professional productions from McCoy/Rigby 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "To Kill a Mockingbird," adapted for the stage by Christopher Sergel from 
Harper Lee's novel, is the inaugural offering in the series. The others are 
"The Wizard of Oz," starring former gymnast Cathy Rigby (who co-owns the 
production company with her husband); "The Belle of Amherst," starring Amanda 
Plummer, and "Forever Plaid." 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it doesn't matter that I'm in a suburban theater," Davison says. "I've 
had good and bad experiences on Broadway and Off Broadway and everywhere else 
across the country. It's the experience of doing the work that counts. It never 
ceases to amaze me that the things that come out of nowhere sometimes give you 
the greatest treasures." 
</P>
<P>
 As Atticus Finch in "Mockingbird," set during the Depression in a small 
Alabama town, he plays a self-effacing widower raising his two young children 
to be morally upright despite the racism that surrounds them. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only half the tale. The other half is that Atticus is a deeply 
civilized lawyer, and he has just been assigned to defend a black man unjustly 
accused of raping a white woman.  
</P>
<P>
 Atticus knows that the jury, made up of white townspeople who are racists bred 
in the bone, will convict no matter what he proves. Yet he performs the 
exercise with all his skill and eloquence and an unshakable belief in human 
decency. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than anything I think the play is like a bedtime story," Davison says. 
"You can be told it a thousand times and still want to hear it again. I find it 
invigorating."

NIGHT SHIFT: READING ROOM-CAFE CATERS TO THE GYPSY IN YOUR SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the mythical lifestyle of the Gypsy -- nomadic and embracing Middle 
Eastern, Indian and Spanish influences -- that inspired partners Catherine 
Graziano, Joe Ongie and Tina Shilve to open the Gypsy Den cafe and reading room 
in March.  
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, this narrow room at the Lab anti-mall in Costa Mesa looks as 
though it was the dumping ground for furnishings from a Gypsy caravan that 
stopped traveling in the early '70s. No two chairs are alike; ditto the funky 
lamps. Most of the items would probably be considered ugly castoffs 
individually, but together they add a comfortable, groovy charm to the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of old Oriental and Persian rugs cover the floor, and a few hang on the 
walls, which are painted avocado, burnt orange and purple. Those walls also 
showcase a variety of paintings, a few by Ongie. 
</P>
<P>
 Another collection that adds to the Bohemian flavor is the oversize colored 
glass vases and decanters so prevalent in fashionable homes of the late '60s. 
They sit atop shelves over the two French doors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a reading room -- but not the kind devoted to fortune-tellers, as some 
have assumed. Once in a while, says Graziano, a friendly psychic does visit, 
giving readings to interested patrons over a cappuccino. But most times, 
readers focus on the more mundane materials they bring along or on the 
selection in the cafe. (It's no surprise that college and high school students 
find the environment fit for homework.) 
</P>
<P>
 Music is paramount to the experience, say the partners, so tunes by everyone 
from Chet Baker to the Jesus and Mary Chain find time on the CD player. On a 
recent Sunday, patrons went on an international trip of Indian and African 
beats mixed with New Age, Renaissance and early jazz sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of live music can enjoy every imaginable genre, at no cover, Friday and 
Saturday beginning at around 8:30 p.m. On these evenings, closing time 
(normally 11 p.m.) sometimes runs later, depending on the crowd. On weekend 
afternoons, patrons get a dose of entertainment from acts featured on the Lab 
stage right outside of the Den. Plenty of tables and chairs are always set up 
cafe-style out front. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gypsy Den also features an open poetry session every Tuesday; sign-ups 
start at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu here is not typical coffeehouse fare, meaning there are more than 
pastries to satisfy hunger pains. Breakfast is served at all hours and includes 
bagels piled high with cheese, scrambled eggs and tomato ($3.95), or a flour 
tortilla with black beans, cheeses, scrambled eggs, homemade salsa and sour 
cream ($4). Local execs stream in at lunch to munch on an inspired variety of 
sandwiches and salads.  
</P>
<P>
 There is also a wide selection of cool libations, including banana mocha or 
fresh fruit smoothies ($3) and Italian sodas ($1.50). 
</P>
<P>
 * GYPSY DEN

KID STUFF: GO AHEAD -- IT'S ALOUD; YOUNG READERS ARE INVITED TO GET AN EARFUL 
FROM STORYTELLERS DURING NATIONAL CHILDREN'S BOOK WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Children and books are natural companions, but, as author James J. Trelease 
points out in his essay, "The Power of Books," the union is best served when a 
third party steps in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is in (childhood) that our minds are most open and innocent, when we are 
ready and willing to believe that animals can talk, lost children can fly, 
houses can be made of gingerbread," writes Trelease, author of "The New 
Read-Aloud Handbook."  
</P>
<P>
 But, he continues, "books and people do not have Velcro sides . . . there must 
be a bonding agent." And parents, grandparents, teachers and librarians are the 
most likely candidates for the job. Trelease cites several widely known authors 
whose love for books was influenced by their elders: Hans Christian Andersen's 
impoverished shoemaker fatherread to him from the "Arabian Nights" and acted 
out the stories in a homemade toy theater; Langston Hughes' Kansas grandmother 
raised him on a steady literary diet of the Bible and tales from the Brothers 
Grimm. 
</P>
<P>
 If you'd like to strengthen the bond between youngsters and books in your 
home, the 75th anniversary of National Children's Book Week is a good time to 
do it. The event, which begins Monday, is sponsored by the Children's Book 
Council Inc. in New York but will be marked locally by libraries, bookstores 
and others. Programs include professional storytellers spinning folk tales, 
preschoolers' story times and dramatic readings from "The Pagemaster,' a 
fantasy by David Kirschner and Ernie Contreras, which inspired an upcoming 
Hollywood film. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the following programs are offered free or for a small charge; times 
and dates are subject to change, so it's a good idea to call ahead. (By the 
way, many of these sites offer readings and story times on a regular basis.) 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are not required, and laps, preferably those of the warm parent 
or grandparent variety, are encouraged.

DO IT!: TUSTIN ADDS DASH WITH ITS DINOSAURS

 The medals and other awards handed out to division winners at most 5K and 10K 
events are fine, but the awards that runners will be competing for Sunday at 
the fourth annual Dinosaur Dash in Tustin have a little more personality. 
</P>

 Each is handmade by a youngster in the Tustin school system. The ceramic 
dinosaurs are glazed and mounted atop wooden trophy stands. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5K Dinosaur Dash (and its companion event for youngsters, the 2K 
Brontosaurus Blitz) drew about 2,000 runners last year and raised $25,000 for 
the nonprofit Tustin Public Schools Foundation. This year, according to event 
co-chairwoman Diane Winn, there are almost 2,000 runners already signed up, so 
race-day registrants should ensure a much bigger turnout than in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen Olympic athletes, including high-jumper Dwight Stones and 
swimmer John Naber, will be on hand to meet the public and sign autographs. 
There will be a post-race breakfast at 8:30 ($4 per person, at Red Robin in 
Tustin Marketplace) and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a run, but also we make it a community event for all of Tustin," Winn 
said. "It really pulls people together." 
</P>
<P>
 The race, Winn said, is one of the fastest-growing in the region. It starts at 
Tustin Marketplace, heading west on El Camino Real and then north on Browning 
Road. From there it turns east on Irvine Boulevard and south on Jamboree Road 
back to the mall. It's flat and has relatively few turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "As 5K road races go, it's a super-fast course," said Herb Massinger of Race 
Pace Promotions in Dana Point, the event's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual twist last year, a Placentia couple won the men's and women's 
divisions. Kevin Broady finished the run in 14 minutes, 37 seconds (a course 
record), and Marilyn Broady clocked 17:47. The women's course record, set by 
Tracy Gold in 1992, is 17:20.

 Many miles ago, bicycles were fairly straightforward contraptions, but these 
days, most of us might as well be working on Lamborghinis when it comes to even 
the simplest repairs and maintenance. But it pays to know how to do some of 
these things ourselves, especially if we ride regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, REI in Santa Ana is offering a hands-on maintenance workshop 
Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m. Participants will learn how to do a complete tuneup. 
REI provides the tools and expertise; you bring the bike. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $60 for REI members, $70 for non-members (about the cost of a 
complete tuneup). Road bikes and mountain bikes will be covered. Information: 
(714) 543-4142. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Dinosaur Dash 5K and Brontosaurus Blitz 2K. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Sunday, Nov. 13. Registration opens at 6:30 a.m.; the 5K starts at 8 
a.m., and the 2K (for children up to age 12) begins at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Tustin Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit north on Jamboree Road. 
Tustin Marketplace is on the left. 
</P>

SURFING: JIM BLEARS, OLD MAN OF THE WAVES, WAXES NOSTALGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Indonesia and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scene: Hawaii, the U.S. Bud Tour surfing championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcers: Rockin' Fig and, ahem, Lord (Tally Ho) Jim Blears, a 71-year-old 
fixture in Hawaii after a pro wrestling career on the mainland. He's also a 
former senior men's surfing champion in Hawaii and still hits the waves. He 
spent the whole contest salting Fig's brain with old surf stories. The Tally 
Ho, by the way, stems from his trademark greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Bud Tour's final contest, Oct. 24-29, Fig also checked in with some 
other top Hawaiian pro surfers, including Sunny Garcia (who won the contest), 
Johnny Boy Gomes and such older Hawaiian surfers as Dane Keoloha. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Fig, what did you think of Blears? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh , man, he had more stories than anybody. He told me that when he was 
growing up, he knew guys like Buffalo (Kealana, a living surf legend). He 
remembered that Buffalo used to live in a house right above Makaha. But a big 
hurricane washed the house out to sea , and now none of the earlier homes are 
on the beach there. It's just a parking lot now. But a long time ago, they had 
homes there.  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't Blears the patriarch of a famous surfing clan? 
</P>
<P>
 Right. His sons surf. And Buffalo's son, Rusty Kealana, is the defending 
two-time world long - board surfing champion.  
</P>
<P>
 I hear Chris Brown of Santa Barbara got waxed early in the contest but managed 
to become the overall Bud Tour champion anyway because he had so many points 
going into the last contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Yup. The pressure was pretty much off him, and he was guaranteed the 
championship because of the points he had racked up going into the last 
contest. But it didn't slow Jeff Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach, who finished 
second on the tour. "J.D." made it to the finals in Hawaii, which can be tough 
because of that Hawaiian strategy.  
</P>
<P>
 What do you mean? 
</P>
<P>
 They flooded the early trials of the contest with , like , a million hot 
Hawaiians, guys who were used to surfing out on the reef when it's good-sized 
surf. It was head-high to a couple feet overhead.  
</P>
<P>
 Did they dog surfers in the water in the heats? Like, surf so close, they 
annoy competitors, especially in four-man heats when one Hawaiian is ahead on 
points and the second Hawaiian in the heat bird-dogs non-Hawaiians so they 
don't advance? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, although Brown took the tour title with Deffenbaugh second, Richie 
Collins of Newport Beach took third. I take it Garcia was surfing pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny was just in a league of his own. He grew up surfing there, on the 
western side of the island. The Hawaiians were dominating out there and getting 
help with some coaching from local legend Ben Aipa.  
</P>
<P>
 Figgy, I've heard a lot about Oahu's notorious "Westside." Tell me about it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of like the hard - core side. You don't see too many tourists. It's 
mostly Hawaiians. And it's a lot sunnier and drier because the clouds come over 
the north shore, where they generally dump the rain before going over the 
mountains. A lot of times, the north shore has these big, outta-control storm 
swells, and they wrap around the island and bring waves on the Westside that 
are a lot cleaner.  
</P>
<P>
 And Sunny is like The Man. He's like the biggest thing that ever happened on 
the Westside, and all the brothers over there are pulling for him. All the boys 
respect him and protect him. At Makaha, he had his wife and kids at the beach 
and had set up two trucks together like a mobile camp. When he went into the 
water, they all cheered for him. It's just his place.  
</P>
<P>
 He also entered the long - boarding contest, and I saw him do a "straight up," 
like totally vertical. I've never seen anybody do that on a long board.  
</P>
<P>
 I hear he's making good money, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Right, I heard he makes, like, $10,000 a month from a wet suit/clothing 
company and other sponsors. And that's his base.  
</P>
<P>
 Did you see Johnny Boy? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I stopped by Johnny Boy Gomes' home and spent about three hours with 
him. His knee is still screwed up. He said he tore some ligaments surfing. But 
he's weight training and said he wants to come back next month for Hawaii's 
Triple Crown. We call him the Power Master!  
</P>
<P>
 Fig also saw Dane Keoloha, another famous Hawaiian surfer, who owns a surf 
shop called the Boardriders Club. Fig says Dane has mellowed a bit, now that he 
has to deal with retail sales! 
</P>
<P>
 I also saw Bird Mahalona. He's the guy who used to do barrel rolls inside a 
wave while surfing. He would go off the lip, grab the board with his hands, and 
do a barrel roll in the air!  
</P>
<P>
 Fig said Mahalona is older now but was still getting the set waves at Makaha, 
where it was rumored that the Fig was seen taking some late takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos: Top junior amateur Kalani Robb of Hawaii plucked another honor when he 
was selected the Bud Tour's Rookie of the Year. Making it even more special is 
that this award normally goes to a pro. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the Kudos: For reasons yet unclear, pro surfers Vince de La Pena of 
Laguna Niguel and Shane Stoneman of San Juan Capistrano, after traveling to 
Hawaii in a quest for ratings points and money, failed to show up for their 
heats in the islands. Ooooops.

VIDEO REWIND; 'I VITELLONI' REMEMBERS TENDER AND CALLOW FELLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's not much action in "I Vitelloni," one of Federico Fellini's earliest 
and finest films about coming of age in southern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the ever-present narrator tells us at one point that the only news 
worth reporting in the lives of the five young men at the center of Fellini's 
1953 movie is this: "In the next few months, the most important things that 
happened were that Riccardo grew a mustache and Alberto grew sideburns, while 
Fausto shaved his mustache off." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that bit of info is pure irony, for in "I Vitelloni," Fellini is 
actually looking closely at what makes Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini, the 
director's brother), Alberto (Alberto Sordi), Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), Moraldo 
(Franco Interlenghi) and Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) tick. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture, whose title loosely translates into "The Big Loafers," is an 
insightful and gently sarcastic take on men in perpetual adolescence -- doing 
nothing out on the corner, chasing girls and avoiding as much responsibility as 
they can. They don't work, and you wonder if they'll ever grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 We first see them cruising down a town square. The narrator lets us know that 
Fausto is the group's "leader and spiritual guide," a snide crack, considering 
that the womanizing Fausto is, at the moment, trying to pick up a woman. Fausto 
eventually gets another girl pregnant and they have to marry, causing assorted 
complications. He still chases other women, though, often with his pals at his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 The imagery is, as usual with Fellini, colorful and more than a little sexy. 
An especially wild scene at a carnival foreshadows Fellini's later fascination 
with anything circus-like. It also shows just how foolish these boys can be; 
the actors, although relatively inexperienced, are all first-rate at being 
callow. 
</P>
<P>
 But even when having fun with who they are, Fellini is rarely cruel. We go 
along with him in this casual dissection, realizing that they may all be a bit 
ridiculous, but they're also likable and genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Vitelloni" (1953), directed by Federico Fellini, 104 minutes. Not rated.

 Pedro Almodovar is a junkman of urbanized romance. In most of his many movies, 
this Spanish hipster has tried to show the dirty glory of all manner of 
relationships, from the straight to the not-so-straight, against a tense city 
backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Male with female, male with male, female with female, not-so-sure-exactly-what 
with not-so-sure-exactly-what, they've all been placed on pedestals (however 
pressurized and tottering) by Almodovar. He fancies himself a purveyor of human 
truth and a peddler of fringe fancies, and Almodovar has worked hard providing 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 In "High Heels," his 1991 release screening Friday as part of UC Irvine's 
"Cinema Potpourri" series, Almodovar looks at the edgy familial love between a 
mother and daughter, and at the passion they both have for the same man. Toss 
in another character -- a transvestite who woos the daughter while 
impersonating the mom in a cabaret show -- and you have the type of spicy, 
improbable gazpacho Almodovar is known for. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset, "High Heels" has to come with a qualifier. It's not on the 
level of Almodovar's more satisfying work; it doesn't have the haphazard but 
oddly defining euphoria of, say, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown." 
Almodovar's impulses this time are more flagrantly poignant, and that 
diminishes the giddy the-facts-of-life-can-be-found-in-the-small-surprises 
quality of his best pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, I have to disagree with critics who were vastly disappointed (the 
movie received mixed reviews) when "High Heels" came out. It's far from a dud. 
In fact, the film is worthy if only for a handful of bold, unexpected passages 
and the expert acting of Almodovar's cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "High Heels," unfortunately, does have careening problems with the plot. 
Unlike his better movies, which go off in strange, sometimes boggling 
directions but maintain an equilibrium that adds to their effectiveness, this 
one has a forced randomness. Almodovar tacks on elements for shock value, and 
they tend to subvert the gentleness at the film's core. 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny when a dance number breaks out in the exercise yard of a women's 
jail, but it doesn't connect with anything that has come before. And the 
convolutions of the transvestite (Miguel Bose) and his role in the story are 
both confounding and predictable when they're supposed to be amazing and 
insightful. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, revealing more about that would undermine Almodovar's trickiness, 
whether it clicks or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot finds the celebrity mother, Becky (Marisa Paredes), a performer along 
the lines of an aging Madonna, reuniting after several years with her daughter, 
Rebecca (Victoria Abril). Rebecca is a successful news anchor married to a 
womanizing TV executive (Feodor Atkine), who was once involved with Becky. 
</P>
<P>
 After he's murdered early on, everything gets sticky for Rebecca and Becky, 
with the police and with their complicated relationship. Almodovar loses his 
grip in presenting these elements, but scenes like the one where Rebecca breaks 
down over the killing during a live newscast give "High Heels" patches of 
brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's no faulting Abril's performance; she's a lost kid in a grown-up's 
body, trying to be brave but barely making it through. Paredes is almost as 
good. Her Becky is all about the self-absorption of a star, someone who loves 
being a pop hero but doesn't much like what she's given up emotionally to get 
there.

KIDS ON FILM: 'STARGATE' ADMITS THOSE WHO LOVE ACTION, SPECIAL EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In "Stargate," a dweeby Egyptologist (James Spader) deciphers instructions to 
an ancient space travel machine, then joins a suicidal commando (Kurt Russell) 
and his team to explore a distant planet, where they meet up with the evil Sun 
God, Ra, and the desert people he has enslaved. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You have to really like explosions and shooting and lots of high-volume 
digital sound to enjoy this movie. Obviously, many people do, since the film 
continues to draw the largest audiences, last weekend raking in $12.5 million. 
And that includes kids, especially boys in the 7 to 11 range. 
</P>
<P>
 As Scott Tipple, 14, explained it: "Kids now like that kind of stuff -- guns, 
shooting people and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids also liked the Egypt stuff, the hieroglyphics, the animal headdresses and 
the ancient language spoken by the villagers, transported eons ago from Egypt 
to a planet in another galaxy.  
</P>
<P>
 The kids were impressed, too, by the special effects -- a space-travel tunnel, 
Egyptian armor that deconstructs on demand, hydraulic architecture and a 
camel/mastodon with a big, slobbery tongue.  
</P>
<P>
 Their favorite effect of all was, naturally, the "stargate," a stone ring 
first discovered by archeologists in 1928. It produces a watery doorway when 
twisted in the proper combination -- not unlike a high school locker. 
</P>
<P>
 But those outside the target group of school-age boys found a few flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Older kids said that though they liked the movie, it reminded them of too many 
other sci-fi movies, including "The Abyss," "Star Trek" and even "Star Wars," 
which was released before most of them were born. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it a lot," said Shawn Rusich, 15. "I didn't like the helmets, though, 
how they just disappeared into nothing. It was too magical to be science 
fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's brother, 12-year-old Ryan, diligently tried to comprehend the details 
of the plot but wound up confused about who Ra was, how he got to the planet 
and what sorts of powers he had over people.  
</P>
<P>
 "I understood it, and I explained it to him," Scott said, "but I can see how 
it might be confusing to somebody younger." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I got it completely. Ra was dying, searched the galaxies for an 
atmosphere similar to Earth's, took a human form because the bodies were easy 
to repair and all the villagers were there because, uh . . . oh, well. The 
special effects were great. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger set had problems, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year-old Kris Gilman had a problem with the "being mean" part. The 
violence quotient is high. Ra likes to shake the life out of transgressors' 
brains with a high-voltage hand buzzer. He sends stealth bombers out to crush 
villagers who help the Marines. For their part, the Marines share their 
civilization's great achievements and teach the villagers how to use automatic 
weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the actors, kids said Spader overshadowed Russell who, Shawn observed, 
"was trying to go with the usual gung-ho mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 Girls were noticeably sparse in the audience, perhaps because they were also 
sparse in the film. The only women in the film were two token scientist types 
in the beginning and the requisite love object -- an attractive and helpful 
village maiden who winds up with the only member of the expeditionary force who 
can communicate with her.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though Scott and his brother could give the film no higher than 3 1/2 
stars out of five, they said it was a satisfying enough sci-fi action flick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good. And it was worth seeing on the big screen," Scott said.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's hear it for the special effects.

 As Thanksgiving gets closer, thoughts turn to copious quantities of food and, 
for many people, going home. Thoughts also turn to those without food and a 
home. In coming weeks, local restaurants are among those doing something to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, West Coast Restaurant Ventures -- which operates Bistro 201, 
Kachina, Saddlerock Ranch, Topaz Cafe and Diva -- kicked off a Donation 
Exchange Program. Now through Dec. 24, lunch and dinner guests can exchange 
canned foods, toys and clothing for a dessert of their choice with their meal. 
Donated items will benefit local agencies, including Laguna Shanti AIDS Clinic, 
Share Our Selves and S.W. Community Kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Diva will also host the second of five "FOCIS on Dining" gourmet dinners 
sponsored by Friends of Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter on Monday. The 
three-course meal includes an entree of grilled salmon on a lima bean and 
spinach ragout with Cabernet sauce and crispy fried leeks. The series continues 
Jan. 17 at Gustaf Anders; Feb. 13 at The Ritz and March 15 at the Center Club. 
Each dinner is $90 a person. The shelter feeds, houses and counsels more than 
2,000 people each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Mango in Newport is putting on a "Little People's Art Sale" Nov. 19 and 
20 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The parking lot sale will feature works by Southland 
artists, and proceeds will benefit Little People's World, a Santa Ana shelter 
for abused children. Complimentary coffee and pastries will be served Nov. 19 
from 10 to 11 a.m., and vegetarian appetizers will be offered at times both 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Last and definitely least as far as cuisine's concerned, Antonello Ristorante 
will underwrite and serve up a "No-Lunch Luncheon" for community and business 
leaders Nov. 22. Guests will experience a meal of bread, soup and water -- and 
what the heck, a glass of wine -- at the event, which is hosted by the Food 
Distribution Center to underscore the local hunger problem and seek 
contributions.

RESTAURANTS; BEYOND THE KINGDOM IS A REALM OF SEAFOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My 15-year-old niece blew into town last week, and, as night follows day, we 
made a pilgrimage to Disneyland. That gave me a chance to visit Shipyard Inn, a 
grown-up restaurant in the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 My niece, as it happens, was underwhelmed by that idea and proved it by 
ingesting about 2,000 calories' worth of churros, butter-almond toffee and Coke 
before we got 100 yards past the park's main gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the food available within the Magic Kingdom is fast food -- burgers, 
burritos -- or fancied-up regional fare, such as the Cajun dishes at Blue Bayou 
in New Orleans Square. However, there's always the option of saving your 
appetite for one of the six restaurants in the Disneyland Hotel, just outside 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville's Steak House is the hotel's premier dining establishment, a clubby, 
old-fashioned steak joint where the waiters roll up a cart full of raw meat to 
every table. It's the toughest ticket in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Shipyard Inn, the hotel's much-ballyhooed seafood restaurant. It, 
too, generally fills up to the waterline . . . when Disneyland is busy. But as 
we know around here, late fall is a quiet season at the park. These days you 
should be able to book a table without too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney people are masters at creating atmosphere, so it's fair to call the 
nautical decor at Shipyard Inn understated, even austere, given that the 
company could make this place look like the battleship Missouri if Michael 
Eisner so deigned.  
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant overlooks the hotel's artificial marina and features an oyster 
bar, an all-glass facade and the usual seafood restaurant design elements: 
brass lanterns, wooden beams, menus embossed with sailing ships. 
</P>
<P>
 It's comfy, thanks to high-backed, sea-blue tapestry chairs. It is a bit 
jarring, though, that the tables are glass-topped, more as you'd expect at an 
unpretentious mom-and-pop restaurant than in a place that charges Shipyard 
Inn's sort of prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, you'll feel shipshape as soon as the waiter brings out the bread. 
Everyone is served a basket of ciabatta , a hot, chewy, flattish Italian loaf, 
perfect for smearing with whole cloves of baked elephant garlic and the 
delicious cilantro butter. It's great stuff.  
</P>
<P>
 By the way, wine lovers should ignore the house wine list and ask for one from 
below deck -- the dining room directly downstairs called California Wine 
Cellar. You can order anything from that rather more sophisticated list, which 
is loaded with fine California and imported wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipyard Inn serves from an a la carte menu, and much of the best it has to 
offer can be found among the appetizers. From the oyster bar, the little necks, 
Pacific oysters and Alaskan king crab legs are all briny-fresh and sweet, 
unspoiled by the sort of nouvelle touches that often plague dishes here.  
</P>
<P>
 One creative appetizer that does work is lobster strudel Catalina, which I'd 
describe as closer to a lobster Napoleon. You don't get a strong taste of the 
lobster, mixed as it is with ricotta and shiitake mushrooms, but the flavors 
work well together, and the dish is quite delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a traditionalist, have the lobster bisque, a thick, almost jellied 
version intense with the tastes of both lobster and sherry. If you aren't, try 
the "shrimplings," fried shrimp won tons. This is true Pacific Rim fare and 
would work if the won ton skins weren't chimichanga-thick. Crab cakes Santa Fe 
are competent, with a pleasant red pepper coulis to dip them in, but the most 
interesting component of this dish is a tangy, interesting salad made from 
cactus, cilantro and a sprinkling of Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the entrees are seafood, which the kitchen rarely treats with the 
respect it deserves. For instance, a friend asked for his swordfish medallions 
to be undercooked. He got them on the well side of medium. My blackened catfish 
had an oily, slippery coating of blackening spices, as if the fish hadn't been 
seared at a high enough temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 The tiger prawns are impressively large, as big as money can buy, but they had 
been drowned in a sweet soy sauce, dusted with coconut and then broiled to a 
frazzle. The only dish everybody praised was the sauteed scallops, coated with 
panko (Japanese-style bread crumbs), and that was probably because it was the 
least flawed dish on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The chefs are good sauce-makers, at least. The baked halibut comes with a fine 
spicy shrimp sauce, and the creamy herb vinaigrette served on both the 
swordfish and the scallops is delicious. Another intriguing idea is jalapeno 
hollandaise, one of the best sauces from this menu. This sauce would be great 
with a plain piece of broiled fish. It's wasted, however, where the restaurant 
chooses to use it, on that already overspiced blackened catfish. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't quite have your sea legs, there are land-and-sea combinations, 
such as the Newport, a well-executed Australian lobster tail and charbroiled 
filet mignon at a stiff $35. The free-range chicken breast is also quite good. 
It hasn't been overcooked and the pico de gallo salsa it comes with has solid 
Mexican roots. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of oddball touches deserve mention. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is a between-courses lemon sorbet, delivered to your table in 
little cones fitted into the holes cut into a wooden paddle resembling a 
Japanese robata . At the Happiest Place on Earth, you get ice cream cones even 
in a fine dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, brings us to the forgettable desserts, the only indelible image 
being a plastic, hollow Mickey -- smack in the middle of the dessert tray -- 
waiting to be filled with ice cream. My niece looked almost wounded when the 
waiter offered it to her, as if she suddenly resented being treated like a kid. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I knew different. If it hadn't been for all those churros she'd put 
away, the ice cream mouse would have been a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipyard Inn is expensive. Appetizers are $5.50 to $10.95. Salads are $2.95 to 
$16.95. Entrees are $15.50 to $35.

PARKER'S PLACE: SILENCE IS GOLDEN . . . WHEN IT'S VOLUNTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I completely lost my voice at noon on a Tuesday a few weeks back. This was due 
to a surgical "procedure" -- I truly hate that word -- to remove a polyp 
growing on my vocal cord. (I truly hate the word "polyp," too.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I actually thought a polyp was something old Republicans got somewhere in 
the fanny area, so, following the diagnosis I looked up polyp in the 
dictionary. I learned to my horror that a creature with a "hollow cylindrical 
body closed and attached at one end and opening at the other to a central mouth 
surrounded by tentacles armed with nematocysts" was growing in my throat. No 
wonder my voice was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The ear, nose and throat surgeon assured me this was not the case and told me 
to read the second definition -- something about a "projecting mass of swollen 
membrane" -- a definition that sounded almost as bad as the first but far less 
dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 As the date of my procedure drew near, I grew peevish and baby-like. I angled 
for sympathy without shame, then thanked anybody sympathetic with a little 
macho slap: "I'll be fine. No worries." Then I'd sigh, gazing pensively into 
the distance, and add, "No, not that many people actually die from anesthesia, 
though death is listed as a possible side effect. If I don't make it, can you 
feed my dogs?" 
</P>
<P>
 I became alternately whiny, then manfully stoic about my chances on the table. 
Finally, I rode tall in the saddle, telling friends and family that "they'll 
just knock me out for an hour, hack it out with a chain saw, slap me awake and 
send me home." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, this is what I knew about what was to happen: 1) I would be in the 
hands of an experienced, much-respected surgeon who is also a very nice guy. 2) 
I would be knocked out for an hour at a hospital. 3) There would be little, if 
any, pain. 4) I would go home the same day. 5) I would need to "rest" my voice 
for a week. 6) Insurance would pay after my deductible was fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 What I didn't know was that as soon as I got to the hospital I'd be forced to 
strip completely naked -- not even my wristwatch, with which I had planned to 
monitor the last few moments of my life -- could stay. The watch, and 
everything else I had with me, all went into a plastic bag labeled "Patient 
Belongings," which sounded like a good title for a woman's 
love-hurts-but-I-still-have-my-cat kind of novel, and I wondered if I could 
write one under a pen name. 
</P>
<P>
 Shivering idiotically on a wheeled bed, dressed only in an Angelica brand 
smock, my toes as cold as frozen Snickers minis, I greeted my nurse's kindly 
"How are you this morning?" with the word "Miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, no. But this is sort of scary, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold this under your tongue." 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, I underwent the first physical trauma of the day -- the dread 
insertion of the IV catheter (I hate that word). But my nurse was deft and 
cheerful, and when she finally got the thing shoved into a wrist vein and taped 
down, it didn't hurt a bit. I gazed out the window with tears in my eyes as she 
found the vein, then felt like throwing my arms around her and hugging her when 
it didn't hurt, but I couldn't because I was tethered to a plastic bag of 
solution that hovered over my bed like some kind of transparent guardian angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here comes your I-don't-care' shot. It will relax you. It's kind of like a 
glass of wine." 
</P>
<P>
 I quipped that a bottle and a half might do the trick, and in went the drug. 
About a minute later it hit me, and I was then wheeled into the O.R. (I hate 
those initials). But at the moment, I was hating nothing. I felt jocular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read all your books and liked them," an O.R. nurse said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you'd read and hated them, I'd be a bit worried right now!" 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of thing. I was asked to take two deep breaths from this plastic 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I was awake and in the recovery room. The nurse told me everything went 
well. The surgeon came by to say that everything went well. I whispered back, 
and they told me to shut up. My brother was hanging around, hassling the staff 
-- quite a comfort. A nurse pushed me to the curb in a wheelchair, and Matt 
drove the truck. My head bobbed around like one of those hula dancer dashboard 
dolls, but I felt fine, wondering how to get my hands on a case of I-don't-care 
shots, then deciding the needles wouldn't be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the surgery, my doctor clarified his rest-your-voice suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't use it for at least a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So I didn't. My first two days of voicelessness went well, as all I did was 
lounge around in bed, reading books and passing an occasional note to Matt. My 
throat didn't hurt one bit. The dogs seemed mystified by my silence because 
normally I carry on a pretty much endless monologue with the brutes, but who 
cares what dogs think? 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, I had made out a list of all the people I was looking forward to not 
talking to. I rarely have anything to say anyway, much to the bewilderment of 
groups that bring me in to provide an evening's entertainment, local author 
style. No more small talk! No more opaque answer to "how's the new book 
coming?" No more heartless inquiries as to the status of some people's days! No 
more B.S.! 
</P>
<P>
 So I ventured into town, armed with a note that said:  
</P>
<P>
 "JUST HAD THROAT SURGERY -- CAN'T TALK FOR A WEEK." 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Mmmmnnn." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a drag." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mmmmnnn." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonsils?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nnnnmmm." 
</P>
<P>
 "Eat lots of ice cream!" 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the week, I really missed talking. I missed being able to crack 
wise, even though I rarely say anything funny. I missed the chitchat, the 
kibbitz, the bull, the breeze, the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 As of this writing, I'm about ready to dust off the now polyp-less cord and 
see how it works. I might even say words like procedure, polyp and catheter. In 
fact, I'll be glad to say any word. I love them all.

3-HOUR TOUR: CENTER YOURSELF, FEAST YOUR EYES AND TASTE SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Near South Coast Plaza, where the dollar is king, you can get your money's 
worth when it comes to the arts. And your time's really well spent -- as on a 
tour of the Orange County Performing Arts Center and self-guided Town Center 
art walk -- when you don't have to spend a cent. 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 11 a.m.: Docent-guided tours of the Performing Arts Center bring the 
facility center stage. And they bring you, at least briefly, backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some features of the building -- such as the red, gold and silver "Firebird" 
sculpture "flying" out through the facade's five stories of glass -- always 
seem new. But even those who often attend center performances may find that 
behind the curtain of familiarity hides a multitude of overlooked features and 
little-known facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know the granite out front is called "Napoleon red"? Or that the seats 
are "theater red," primarily because they don't reflect light back to the 
performers? Did you also know there's a basketball court backstage for the 
stagehands? 
</P>
<P>
 Look carefully at the carpet on the grand staircase and you'll notice that the 
first and last step of each flight are solid colors, the rest dotted; it's a 
safety feature. And there's a metal people catcher over the side of the balcony 
at the bottom of the Tier One steps for people who keep walking. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll learn all about acoustics on the tour. The hall was designed with 
"early lateral sound reflection" in mind, which, according to docents, means 
that sound bounces off the side walls early enough so that it reaches both ears 
at the same time. The shape of the seating "trays," or tiers, combines the best 
of "fan" and "shoe-box" theaters -- acoustically speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also learn all about pipe battens and counterweights and how scenery is 
"flown" up above the stage; there's a gridiron 10 stories high for storage. 
There's also a tunnel that runs from the sound booth at the rear of Tier One 
all the way backstage so the technician can run back and forth without 
disturbing anybody. Hey, maybe David Copperfield used that. 
</P>
<P>
 11 to noon: More than a dozen sculptures dot Town Center. Those in lobbies are 
visible even when the buildings are closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Performing Arts Center and Center Tower (650 Town Center Drive), 
where even the bushes are carefully sculpted, is Henry Moore's "Reclining 
Figure," the enjoyment of which is marred only by the distracting donor plaque. 
Nearby you can look down on the Center Club (how's that for a switch?). There 
are sculptures in the ponds below. Perched in the Center Tower lobby is a 
bronze by Joan Miro called "Oiseau," which means bird in French; to the 
uninitiated, it may also resemble a triceratops nursing twins. 
</P>
<P>
 I like rocks, so Jim Huntington's "Night Shift" (near Westin South Coast Plaza 
hotel), made from Sierra white granite and stainless steel, is very appealing. 
Alexander Calder's mobile "Pekin" (in the lobby of 611 Anton Blvd.) would be 
fabulous in any child's bedroom. Charles Perry's seven-ton, bright yellow "Ram" 
looked, well, ram-like.  
</P>
<P>
 Isamu Noguchi's endlessly stimulating and soothing "California Scenario" is a 
plaza unto itself, truly one of the jewels of Orange County and easily the 
crown jewel in this collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on your pace, you can also take a few minutes to cross Bristol 
Street on Unity Bridge, possibly named because it unifies two sets of 
Segerstrom properties. Once on the other side, pop into South Coast Plaza's 
Laguna Art Museum satellite and buy blown-glass teapots or such artsy mementos 
of your tour as Joan Miro coffee mugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: Claire Falkenstein's stained-glass wind screen, "Sun Ribbon," 
protects Amici Trattoria Italiana from the elements. The restaurant is also 
kind of artsy inside. Providing a nod to the visual arts are tubes of oil 
paint, paintbrushes and an artist's palette. In tribute to the performing arts 
are a violin, mandolin, guitar, sheet music, painted tambourine, trombone and 
trumpet, and comedian/tragedian masks. Even the culinary arts get into the act 
-- hanging garlic cloves and wine bottles line the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't call the insalate de mare art exactly, but it's pretty, and the 
baby calamari almost look like little flowers on the plate (seafood salad, 
$8.95). Crostini di polenta, served with either mushrooms or olive-stuffed 
squid, is only on the dinner menu, but a (highly recommended) request for 
either at lunchtime will be honored ($6.95). In fact, the chefs will make any 
Italian dish you request as long as they have the ingredients .  
</P>
<P>
 Tartufo amore ($4.50) is heart-shaped white chocolate ice cream with a heart 
of raspberry sorbet within. Amici serves 18 kinds of grappa, an Italian brandy, 
any one of which could quickly put you under the table. 3-HOUR TOUR

 Jennifer Capriati returned to tennis Wednesday night, looking much more like a 
young phenomenon than a troubled schoolgirl who was arrested for carrying 
marijuana. Capriati lost to Anke Huber of Germany, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, in the first 
round of the $750,000 Virginia Slims of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I played good," Capriati said. "It was really great to be out there 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati had not played a tournament match since Aug. 31, 1993, when she was 
eliminated by little-known Leila Meskhi in the first round of the U.S. Open. 
She left the tour and went through months of personal and legal problems.

 Schenectady, N.Y., will join World TeamTennis with an expansion team in 1995,

Other expansion candidates are Cleveland, Nashville, Omaha and Springfield, Mo.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: PAYOFF AT HAND FOR CHAPMAN'S PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than once, senior setter Christi Park has been close to quitting on 
Chapman women's volleyball, but now she's glad she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1992, about seven months after she joined the team as a walk-on from 
Olympia, Wash., Park learned she could not earn an athletic scholarship. The 
school was switching from NCAA Division II to Division III, meaning all 
athletic-based aid would be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision caused a two-season decline in the Chapman volleyball program, 
which had consistently been ranked among the best in Division II. One player 
left school, two others kept their scholarships, making them ineligible to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Park mulled transferring and giving up the sport, but decided to stay, and 
therefore was on hand for the forgettable 1993 season. Chapman was 4-20 in its 
final season in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated. I was depressed," Park said. "I was just ready to give up 
on the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But amid all the losing, the Panthers managed to build some self-respect and 
have fun, Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it doesn't compare with this season. Bolstered by strong new 
players, the Panthers finished the regular season 23-8 and will play in the 
postseason for the first time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Panthers, their first-round opponent in the West 
Regional Friday is host UC San Diego, the third-ranked team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego (25-6) has lost to only one Division III team this season and has 
beaten Chapman twice, including a 15-9, 15-12, 15-4 victory last Friday in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But Park isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know without a doubt in my mind that they can be beaten," she said. "If we 
play up to our abilities, we shouldn't have any problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman Coach Mary Cahill is also confident Chapman has a chance to knock off 
the top-seeded team in the region, despite recent struggles against the 
Tritons. 
</P>
<P>
 Cahill hopes San Diego has been lulled into a sense of security by its two 
three-game victories over Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to catch them on their heels and surprise them," Cahill said. "They 
are a strong team, but we are right there, and if we get one game off them or 
make it 16-14 we'll get more confidence and put a question in their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman is trying to buck a lot of history. UC San Diego has advanced to the 
final four in 11 of the 13 years a Division III championship has been held. The 
Tritons have won reached the title match 10 times, winning a record six 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman-San Diego winner will play the Occidental-Cal Lutheran winner 
Saturday in the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the Southern California College men's cross-country team finished 
third at the Golden State Athletic Conference meet Saturday and received an 
at-large bid to the NAIA national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the Vanguards were Jason Schaefer and Jon Bischop, who finished 11th 
and 12th, running the eight-kilometer course at Balboa Park in San Diego in 26 
minutes 38 seconds and 26:39. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC, which finished the season ranked 18th in the nation, received the last of 
five at-large bids and will be seeded 18th in the 38-team field. 
</P>
<P>
 The championships are Nov. 19 in Kenosha, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California College women's volleyball team received a break when 
it was seeded fifth in the eight-team NAIA Far West Region volleyball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards (17-10) received the Golden State Athletic Conference's sixth 
and final spot in the tournament, but because of a better power rating, they 
were seeded higher than Westmont and Cal Baptist, which finished in a 
fourth-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of playing at Fresno Pacific, Azusa Pacific or Biola, one of the 
top three seeded teams, SCC plays at No. 4 The Master's in the first round 
Saturday. The Vanguards twice beat The Master's in four games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Christian men's soccer team finished second at the National 
Christian College Athletic Assn. Division II championship, losing, 3-2, in 
overtime to Moody Bible of Chicago Saturday in Lakeland, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Mehr scored with two minutes left in regulation to tie the score, 1-1, 
for the Royals (14-3-2), but PCC Coach Rich Davis said his team, playing its 
second consecutive overtime game, ran out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, after Moody (18-4) scored the first two goals in overtime, James Oats 
scored in the 111th minute and PCC had several late chances to tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Bean, who scored 50 goals for the season -- including six in the 
three-game tournament -- and Mehr were first-team All-American selections. Jeff 
Lunz, Joey Bahash and goalkeeper Greg Gunderson were honorable mention 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jason Hall's contribution in the semifinal against Clearwater (Fla.) 
shouldn't be overlooked. Hall, usually a field player, stepped in the goal for 
the penalty-kick shootout and blocked Clearwater's sudden-death attempt. He 
then took PCC's next shot and scored, giving the Royals the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's football team finishes its season Saturday with a 1 p.m. game 
against Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks. . . . Southern California College and 
Concordia each had two players named to the second-team All-Golden State 
Athletic Conference men's soccer team. Selected were sophomores Peter Schumerth 
and Kevin Villar of SCC and seniors Dean Agnoletto and Brian Beaman of 
Concordia. Sophomore Jamie Gardiner and freshman Joy Pelletier of SCC were 
all-conference women's soccer selections. . . . SCC's basketball teams are 
holding their Blue & Gold scrimmages Tuesday. The women's game is at 6 p.m.; 
the men's is at 7:45. Proceeds will be donated to the Tomas Relief Fund, 
established to help the family of Tomas Mejia, the El Toro High cross-country 
runner who is recovering from a coma after an August auto accident.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; GOLDEN WEST WINS, SETS VOLLEYBALL RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Golden West women's volleyball team set a national community college 
record Wednesday as it extended its conference record streak to 100 matches, 
with a 15-7, 15-5, 15-10 victory over host Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Becca Foltz led the Rustlers (17-2, 10-0) with 15 kills.Teammates Vanessa Dahl 
and Jessica Redding each added 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West had shared the record for most consecutive conference victories 
with Eastern Arizona Community College, which had its streak of 99 in a row 
ended last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak started in 1986 in the South Coast Conference. Golden West moved to 
the Orange Empire Conference in 1988, and has compiled an 88-0 record in league 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuki Inagaki led the Dons (8-7, 4-6) with 12 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference women's volleyball matches: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 3, Cypress 1 -- Kim Degener had 23 kills to lead Fullerton (6-11, 
3-8). Teammate Christina Keleman added 13 in the 15-1, 15-12, 8-15, 15-15 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 3, Saddleback 1 -- With the match tied, 1-1, Orange Coast (11-8, 
7-2) battled back from a 14-6 deficit in the third game to win, 17-15, and then 
went on to win the match, 15-9, 10-15, 17-15, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Coast Conference wrestling: 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 39, Victor Valley 6 -- Jason Sparks pinned his heavyweight 
opponent in 1 minute 15 seconds for host Rancho Santiago.

A PLACE WHERE ALMOST EVERYTHING IS FAIR GAME; RESTAURANTS: THE MENU INCLUDES 
ALLIGATOR, ZEBRA AND MOUNTAIN LION, AMONG TAMER FARE. AND PEOPLE COME FROM 
CONTINENTS AWAY TO PARTAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You say you just can't find a restaurant that whips up a black bear dinner 
like Mom used to make? The menu at your favorite bistro lacks that thick, juicy 
elk steak you've been craving? 
</P>
<P>
 From A to Z -- alligator to zebra -- if it's wild, it's on the menu at Cecil 
Pritchett's, an improbable restaurant in an unlikely setting near Truman Lake, 
about 100 miles south of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't see it on the menu, just ask. Owner-chef Cecil Pritchett will try 
to track it down and cook it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a hippopotamus on order for a long time, but I just couldn't get it," 
he said. "I'm still trying to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett, 53, got some strange looks from this village's 750 residents when 
he opened his restaurant in an ancient brick building in 1992 and began 
boasting "the largest selection of exotic wild game food in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "People kind of laughed at me under their breath. I think they thought I was 
totally insane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But folks from as far away as Canada, England and France drop into his 
down-home cafe with black-and-white zebra decor to sample delicacies like quail 
in pecan-honey sauce, alligator in Hawaiian sauce, smoked antelope sausage, 
venison in curry sauce, and hickory-smoked mountain lion and zebra. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett's wild culinary skills date to his childhood in Nevada, Mo. With 10 
children, the family ate a lot of wild game such as rabbit, venison and quail, 
which he learned to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett worked in production for Hallmark Cards in Kansas City for 12 years 
before buying a restaurant there in 1981. He put a few wild game dishes on the 
menu and the next year won blue ribbons at a Kansas City food festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his celebrity, customers didn't exactly beat a path to his door, 
Pritchett said. He eventually sold out and took a job in advertising, then 
worked as a chef for several Kansas City-area restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 After working in restaurants in smaller towns, Pritchett moved to Osceola two 
years ago, bought a creaky but quaint brick building built in 1845, and fired 
up the grill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out selling broasted chicken and hamburgers, then slowly started 
introducing stuff I wanted to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett admits he sells far more chicken, steak, prime rib and standard 
breakfast and lunch fare than wild game at his restaurant. He declined to say 
how many wild meals he serves a week, but "we sell something on the exotic side 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 He buys most of the meat from Dale's Exotic Game Meat Co. in Denver. Manager 
Paul Beier said most of the animals the firm sells, including zebra, bear and 
African lion, are raised on game farms in the United States. The company 
imports venison, elk and moose but no meat from Africa, and it doesn't sell 
animals on the endangered species list, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett has never been picketed by animal-rights advocates, probably because 
he's in an area where hunting and fishing are popular. The one complaint he's 
heard was in 1983, from a woman at his Kansas City restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 She "tried to explain that some people out there didn't think I should be 
serving alligator," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett said he can understand that some people might find his menu 
upsetting. But he also noted that some of the animals he serves, like mountain 
lion, are dangerous and "so abundant in the mountains of Colorado that they 
often have to be shot by conservation people." 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett also serves up wild offerings at sports shows throughout the 
Midwest. Many of his customers pull off Missouri 13 just east of Osceola bound 
for Branson, the heartland music mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's usually not people from this area" who order the wild fare, said Sylvia 
Saysoff, a waitress at Pritchett's. 
</P>
<P>
 Governor and Senator-elect John Ashcroft stopped in recently. He ordered a 
shake (one of the tamer dishes) and posed for a photograph beneath the exotic 
menu above the grill. Hank Bauer, the former New York Yankee great now living 
in Kansas City, is a regular visitor and prefers the fried frog legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Naylor, the St. Clair County circuit court clerk, confided over coffee at 
Pritchett's that he had recently screwed up the courage to sample zebra. With 
each bite, Naylor said with a smile, images of a striped horse galloping across 
the African plain raced through his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tasted fine," he said hesitantly, not seeming totally convinced. "It was, 
I guess, probably like beef." 
</P>
<P>
 An independent taste test from an open-minded visitor: 
</P>
<P>
 * The pan-fried quail, farm-raised in Ohio and the top seller on the wild 
menu, was excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 * The alligator in Hawaiian sauce had a hint of fish taste.  
</P>
<P>
 * The deep-fried rattlesnake and frog legs tasted like chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody asks us what something tastes like, we say, 'Everything tastes 
like chicken,' no matter what it is," Pritchett said with a laugh. "Believe me, 
mountain lion and zebra do not taste like chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 He's right. Even the K.C. Masterpiece hickory barbecue sauce Pritchett uses to 
coat the meat didn't help. The zebra had a slippery, gamy taste. And the 
mountain lion was purrfectly awful -- tough and wild-tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 25 wild menu items, zebra and ostrich are the most expensive dinners 
at $29.95. Quail and venison dinners are $9.95, black bear $19.95, and a 
buffalo smoked sausage dinner is $11.95. Sample bites of mountain lion, bear or 
zebra go for $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Pritchett isn't done tinkering with his menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do kangaroo and elephant and hippo, those three for sure," he said. 
"I don't have moose on the menu yet or caribou. I just keep exploring things 
that I think should be there."

PICKENS MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS; CORPORATIONS: STILL NURSING HIS WOUNDS FROM 
FOILED OIL COMPANY TAKEOVER BIDS IN THE '80S, HE'S BUSY TRYING TO LIVE DOWN 
RAIDER IMAGE AND REVIVE NATURAL GAS FIRM HE DOES CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T. Boone Pickens spent the 1980s in the headlines, aggressively pursuing oil 
companies, earning millions of dollars from their stock, and angering some 
business circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boone Pickens of the '90s has a much lower profile. Instead of trying to 
take over someone else's company, he's trying to restore the financial health 
of his own, Mesa Inc., after a losing gamble on natural gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has some regrets about the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ehh, the '80s," he said in a recent interview. "I go back and look at that 
period, I wished it never happened. Because, you know, what you thought you 
were doing -- other people didn't agree with what you thought you were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickens unsuccessfully targeted several oil companies for takeover in the 
1980s. The most prominent were his 1984 bid for Gulf Corp., followed by plays 
for Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, particularly oil company executives, called Pickens a corporate 
raider. Unocal sued Mesa, charging Pickens' company made an illegal profit from 
Unocal stock, and won $42.8 million in a settlement with Mesa this year. But 
Pickens spurns the "raider" label and insists his offers were sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 At 66, Pickens still works out, stays busy with his eight children and 16 
grandchildren, and is a powerful Republican fund-raiser and sought-after 
personality. But he says he's too old for his cherished dream of a run at the 
Texas governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping his sometimes combative public persona, he admits there are things he 
would have liked to do differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had it to do over again, which you never get that chance, I would never 
have made an offer for a company after we had become Gulf's largest 
stockholder," Pickens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of Pickens' big moves ended in 1991. Pickens' Boone Co. purchased 26% 
of Japan's Koito Manufacturing Co. but was refused a seat on Koito's board 
during a two-year battle. Koito maintained Pickens was a front for a Japanese 
investor trying to shake down the firm, a charge Pickens denied. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Pickens buys shares of Mesa stock, now owning close to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 He's trying to build demand for natural gas and find premium markets for it, 
while decrying the nation's reliance on foreign oil. He served two terms as 
chairman of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition and recently reached a deal with 
SuperShuttle to use Mesa's natural gas for its van fleets at Los Angeles 
International and John Wayne airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickens also hopes to further ease Mesa's $1.2-billion debt load. In the 
summer of 1993, Mesa restructured $600 million in debt, deferring about $150 
million in interest payments over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa is expected to lose up to $90 million in 1994, its sixth straight year of 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debt, there's no doubt, it is the centerpiece of the problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We distributed $1.2 billion (to shareholders) over a period in 1986-90, which 
really gutted our equity, believing that natural gas prices would go up and 
everything would be fine. Natural gas prices went down and things weren't fine, 
is about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa hopes to be back in the market next year, or as soon as prices rise and 
interest grows in natural gas stocks, not with equity but perhaps with 
convertible debt or selling a royalty trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts see little to get excited about at Mesa these days. They say the 
company has good gas properties and quality reserves, but its long-term 
viability depends in large part on natural gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Dutt, oil and gas analyst at Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs in New 
Orleans, called Mesa a "wait-and-see-type story." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much they can do without restructuring their debt. They've got to 
sit and wait for higher natural gas prices. Talk about a natural gas engine is 
fine for the year 2000-plus, but it's not going to help them in the short 
term," Dutt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickens has mellowed in recent years, said Wales Madden, an Amarillo attorney 
and businessman who has known Pickens for 50 years -- since high school -- and 
served on the board of Mesa since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is more able to relax and enjoy the fruits of some of his labor," Madden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Boone has learned, as we all have as we reach this age, that not 
everyone's going to agree with us and not everyone's going to love us, and we 
relax and enjoy those things that are important to us, which are family and 
friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickens said he feels fortunate. "The last thing I am is bitter," he said. 
"I've had a great career as far as just the people and all the things we've 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got to make a lot of decisions, you're going to make some you're 
not going to like when you go back and reflect on them." 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest, Pickens said, was his analysis on natural gas prices. But no one 
could have predicted in the mid-1980s that prices would drop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did bet the farm. That was the mistake, is the bet was too big," he said. 
"I thought that natural gas was it."

D.A. FORCED TO BEEF UP HIS A-TEAM; SIMPSON CASE: FACED WITH AN IMPOSING 
DEFENSE, GARCETTI HAS COMMITTED 11 PEOPLE. LATEST WAS PROSECUTOR IN COWLINGS 
PROBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Responding to aggressive defense tactics in the O.J. Simpson murder case, the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office has assembled its largest 
prosecution team in decades and may continue adding lawyers between now and 
opening statements early next year, the county's top prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, speaking to reporters at a regular briefing, said he 
has assigned seven prosecutors and four law clerks to the case, more staff than 
have tackled any trial during his 26 years with the district attorney's office. 
The next biggest team, he said, was assembled for the McMartin child 
molestation case, which involved four prosecutors in a gruelingly long trial 
that ended in acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
 The large and growing Simpson prosecution effort, headed by deputy district 
attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman, is intended to keep pace with 
Simpson's formidable legal machinery, Garcetti said. Nine different attorneys 
have appeared for Simpson in court, forcing Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito 
to install a special table to accommodate the overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have nine lawyers cranking out motions," Garcetti said. The result, he 
added, is that Clark and Hodgman "have literally been killing themselves. . . . 
They have been working so hard. They have been sacrificing so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti defended the team's most recent addition, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Christopher A. Darden, who was added this week after completing his work as the 
lead prosecutor assigned to investigate Simpson's close friend, Al Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 Darden became the first African American to join the prosecution team, and the 
timing of his appointment, just days after a predominantly black jury was sworn 
in, prompted Simpson attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. to suggest that Darden's 
race was a factor in his transfer. Simpson, who is black, faces charges that he 
murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald L. Goldman, 
both of whom were white. Simpson has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, however, said that Darden had long been tapped to move to the 
Simpson prosecution once the Cowlings case was over and that it was coincidence 
that the shift took place just after a jury was picked. Darden is one of the 
district attorney's office's most respected lawyers, in recent years working as 
part of its Special Investigations Division, which investigates police officers 
and other public employees accused of criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of our senior prosecutors on this case," Garcetti said of Darden, a 
13-year veteran of the office who has handled a number of sensitive police 
investigations, including a recently concluded probe into the fatal police 
shooting of a woman on a hospital rooftop. "He's going to take a significant 
management role. We want to use his talents as a trial lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Garcetti said, he believes Darden's ethnicity could be as much a 
drawback as an advantage in front of the predominantly black panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could very easily backfire," Garcetti said. "There could be a juror who 
asks himself: 'Are you just bringing him in because he's black?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The trial has been delayed several times by the long jury selection process, 
and Garcetti said the postponements could force another shift in the 
prosecution team. Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, the prosecution's designated 
DNA expert, is expecting a baby in late December. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the DNA hearing has not been concluded by the time she departs for 
maternity leave, Garcetti said that job may have to be turned over to one of 
two other DNA experts working with the prosecution, a pair of government 
lawyers from Alameda and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, jury selection in the case continued Wednesday, with the day's 
first prospect clearing questioning for bias despite stating that he agreed 
with the verdicts of the Ventura County jury that acquitted LAPD officers of 
most charges in the first Rodney G. King beating trial.  
</P>
<P>
 Cochran questioned that 35-year-old Pico Rivera resident at length, but the 
man repeatedly insisted that he could be fair and said he would consider it an 
honor to serve as an alternate juror. He acknowledged hearing something about 
DNA but added that it was while watching the movie "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark joked that she saw no problem with that exposure because "we're not 
making dinosaurs here." 
</P>
<P>
 Once both sides had finished questioning him -- a session that went on so long 
Cochran quipped: "If I stay up here any longer, I'll be in the 'Guinness Book 
of World Records' for longest voir dire of a juror" -- the man became the first 
alternate accepted for possible service on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 That man was allowed to remain on the panel, as was another despite his 
acknowledgment that he found it difficult to believe that Simpson could have 
committed the crimes with which he is charged. That man, a 56-year-old 
electrical engineer, insisted he could be fair, and Ito pointedly challenged 
him about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean this to be a sexist comment," Ito said, "but man to man, are you 
being straight with me on this? You can give both sides a fair trial?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," the man responded. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though those two men and four other jury candidates made it through 
Wednesday's questioning, they still could be removed by peremptory challenge 
when the candidates for alternate juror spots return Dec. 5. Tuesday's 
questioning of panelists was the first day that prospective alternates were 
grilled, and it ended with all nine of those questioned being excused. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, a jury consultant for Simpson said she believed that was merely a 
coincidence and did not reflect an overall problem with the remaining jury 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of alternates in this case has taken on special importance 
because both sides believe that some of the 12 jurors sworn in last week will 
not make it through the entire trial. The anticipated length of the trial and 
the extent of publicity surrounding it could result in some jurors falling sick 
or becoming exposed to media coverage, which would force them to be replaced by 
alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito is considering sequestering the jury, but has yet to make up his mind. 
Prosecutors strongly support that idea, but Simpson's attorneys are adamantly 
opposed. Many prospective jurors have said they would find it difficult to 
serve if they were taken from their homes and cut off from friends and family 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 As the selection of alternates has gotten under way, a number of panelists 
have been dismissed for harboring strong views about the case. Wednesday, one 
African American woman gave answers that convinced prosecutors she could not 
serve fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 That woman, a 35-year-old Windsor Hills resident, said she had watched 
Simpson's preliminary hearing and developed impressions about a number of 
witnesses who testified. For instance, she questioned the credibility of two 
store employees who said they sold Simpson a knife, and she used the word 
unsure to describe LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman, who testified about finding a 
key piece of evidence in the case. She also said Detective Philip L. Vannatter, 
one of the lead investigators, "appeared to be hiding something." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said her impression about Vannatter was based on "his demeanor" but 
said she did not have an opinion about what specifically she thought he was 
hiding. She also said that she was aware of allegations that Fuhrman was 
"prejudiced" and that he had planted a glove at Simpson's estate -- although 
she added that she had no firm opinions on these matters. Defense attorneys 
have raised those allegations on several occasions but have produced no 
evidence to support the notion that Fuhrman or any other officer planted 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 After Clark finished questioning that prospective juror, she asked Ito for a 
conference out of earshot of the woman. Ito and the attorneys for both sides 
conferred for more than 10 minutes, and then Ito excused the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank you for your candor," he said, explaining why she was being 
dismissed. "My concern is you've been poisoned by outside influences, and it's 
not your fault. It's the fault of the hysteria surrounding this case." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a theme that Ito has struck frequently through the long jury selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Ito found a new way to take aim at the coverage: As the session was 
about to begin, he proudly displayed to reporters in the courtroom a cartoon 
from the Orlando Sentinel. The cartoon depicts the media as a horde of jackals.

POLICE SAY BABY SLAIN BY MOTHER, THROWN TO DOGS

 A 19-year-old woman was arrested in Pomona on suspicion of killing her newborn 
son and throwing his body into the back yard of a neighbor's home where pit 
bulls were kept, police said Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
 Araceli Banda Garcia, who has two other children, was being held without bail 
at Sybil Brand Institute on suspicion of murder after her arrest Tuesday night, 
said Lt. Ron Frazier of the Pomona Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the suspect intentionally murdered the infant and have 
evidence to support a homicide charge," Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutilated body of the baby boy, whose arm was missing and whose testicles 
had been severed, was found Friday afternoon in the yard of a house in the 500 
block of Orange Grove Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially believed that one or both of the pit bulls mauled the 
nine-pound baby, but now believe that he was dead when his body was thrown into 
the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the dogs had been penned up and had no access to the baby, and the 
other was a puppy. Investigators said they doubted it could have mutilated the 
infant's body to such an extent. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Garcia may have been trying to hide the birth from her 
parents, who live next door to where the baby was found. When questioned, 
Garcia said she had been pregnant and that she was treated for a miscarriage 
Friday at a hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when police obtained a warrant and searched her parents' house, where 
Garcia lived, they said they found a full-term placenta in a trash container 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia then admitted that the baby was hers and that she had thrown it into 
the neighbor's yard, Frazier said, adding that the identity of the baby's 
father was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's other children, ages 2 and 3, also live with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors, who know Garcia as "Sally," said they were shocked that she had 
been arrested. "I couldn't tell she was pregnant," neighbor Richard Lepe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulda Worrell, 90, said Garcia was friendly and frequently brought over 
birthday cake and other treats. "I hope it isn't true," Worrell said of the 
allegation that Garcia killed her baby.

AL MARTINEZ: CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; IN THESE VIOLENT TIMES, FEAR FINDS A 
SCAPEGOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost three hundred years ago the French author Voltaire wrote that fear 
follows crime and is its punishment. I think that's why Proposition 187 won on 
Tuesday and why, if it is ever implemented, we'll all suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime has everyone living on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 We exist in a society vaguely out of control. Children are slaughtered by 
their mothers and old ladies are murdered in their homes. Terror blankets us 
like a funeral shroud. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't sit in a park or stroll down a dark street or do business at an ATM 
machine without the haunting awareness that these simple functions of ordinary 
life could invite disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Carjackers kill for a car they'll dump an hour later and gangbangers for no 
reason at all. Teen-agers, disoriented by drugs and booze, fight it out with 
AK-47s, kids pack Lugers in their lunch bags, and disgruntled employees express 
their rage with bullets sprayed through a workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools aren't safe, stores aren't safe, public transportation isn't safe, and 
God gets a little nervous in church on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 We've become a society of gunslingers, security gates, barred windows, car 
alarms, motion-activated spotlights, private cops, metal detectors, killer dogs 
and sirens that wail into the night like screams of despair. 
</P>
<P>
 What's all that got to do with 187? It represents what Voltaire was talking 
about, the fear that follows crime and ultimately becomes its punishment. 
Proposition 187 is the very embodiment of our terror. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 History teaches that nations caught up in fear seek scapegoats for their 
anxieties, whether they are precipitated by crime, national uncertainty or the 
supernatural. Jews, Asians, Indians and others have felt the sting of response 
to societal anguish. We tortured heretics and burned witches to combat the fear 
of things we couldn't see, then turned blindly on each other in an effort to 
destroy the dangers we thought we could see. 
</P>
<P>
 In the brief life of this nation, we have singled out a whole array of racial 
and ethnic minorities to hate, abuse and ultimately blame for every evil that 
has befallen us. And now, through the disquieting alchemy of social decision, 
it's the turn of illegal Latino immigrants to take their licks. They're easy 
targets and, we thought, they can't fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 We blamed them for the escalating crime rate, for deteriorating neighborhoods 
and, when the economy went to hell, for unemployment, rising taxes and the 
crushing burden of welfare programs. Another kind of fear was walking our 
cities, and it may have been the most insidious of all: the fear of finding 
ourselves jobless, hungry and in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The cry to "Save Our State" was the cry of decent people frightened by the 
cascading evils and uncertainties of our time. They're the same people who 
voted for the "three strikes" measure and who, in frustration, threw 
congressional incumbents out the door in an effort to right what seemed so 
terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their supporters were Latinos in this country legally who, conditioned 
by the same fears, turned on their brothers and sisters in order to protect 
their own islands of security in a sea of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 But 187 was an ill-conceived response to fear and despair, and, predictably, 
attracted pack dogs of hatred who sensed an acceptance of their malevolent 
ethnic phobias. 
</P>
<P>
 My mailbox was full of their invective-filled messages all during the 
campaign, and my telephone answering machine ran out of space to record their 
vicious, and frequently obscene, comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Their targets, contrary to Pete Wilson's expedient logic, had gone beyond 
illegal immigrants and had settled on anyone whose surname suggested their 
heritage was rooted in countries beyond our southern borders. 
</P>
<P>
 What I hope was my last telephone call from any of them came sometime after 
the projection of 187's sad triumph. It trumpeted the victory of white America 
over those of us who would pollute the cultural bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm afraid of crime too. I'm afraid for the safety of those I love dearly and 
for the welfare of the community in which I live. I'm also afraid that 187 will 
open the door to an erosion of humanity not witnessed in this country since the 
ugly days of black repression. Barring children from school due to their 
immigration status isn't a lot different than barring them from a restaurant 
because of their color. 
</P>
<P>
 I am also afraid that Latinos will respond with unbridled rage to a 
proposition steeped in the kinds of dehumanizing barriers that amount to a 
cultural insult. There is no guarantee that their rage will be confined to the 
courts, and not spread to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 has already succeeded in creating divisions that didn't exist. 
One can only hope we are not carried to disaster by the shrill rhetoric of 
those who sought easy answers in a hateful referendum. We have been punished by 
our own fears, and the impact of that punishment may linger for generations to 
come.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; UNFLAGGING CONTROVERSY; WHY DID SOME PROTESTERS AGAINST 
PROPOSITION 187 CARRY THE RED, WHITE AND GREEN INSTEAD OF THE RED, WHITE AND 
BLUE? TO LATINOS, IT WAS PRIDEFUL. TO MANY AMERICANS, IT WAS INSULTING. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a powerful campaign image: the red, white and green flags of Mexico, 
hoisted proudly over the heads of protesters making their stand against 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The flags were intended as a show of pride by people who felt their Mexican 
heritage under siege. Yet among non-Latino voters they were widely interpreted 
as a symbol of anti-American defiance, of suspicious allegiance to a foreign 
land -- a lightning rod that dramatically increased emotional support for the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the groping for common ground continued on both sides of the 
cultural gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it that so many people were upset by the sight of a Mexican flag?" 
wondered Latino activist Fabian Nunez. "It is just the expression of a search 
for identity . . . of cultural pride among a community that feels 
disenfranchised, but wants to integrate into the fabric of America. Nobody 
should be offended by that." 
</P>
<P>
 But they were. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's election, a rising tide of indignation 
registered on radio talk shows and in newspaper articles, as voters vented 
their anger over what they interpreted as a calculated spit in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to be part of this country, they should carry this country's 
flag," drugstore clerk Jarrod Holland complained to a reporter last week as he 
watched a cadre of Mexican-flag-waving students march through Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, from the window of his flag factory on National Boulevard in 
West Los Angeles, Howard Furst watched protesters from Hamilton High School 
carrying Mexican flags aloft, and once again felt vindicated -- and still 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pisses me off," said the former Marine, who owns eight flag stores across 
Los Angeles County. "You see these kids walking down the street with a Mexican 
flag and demanding that this country give them a free education. . . . It 
aggravates people." 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest mistake the opposition made was waving those green and white 
flags with the snake on it," said former Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Director Harold Ezell, who helped write Proposition 187. "They should have been 
waving the American flag." 
</P>
<P>
 As Election Day neared, some Latino opposition leaders tried to minimize the 
impact of the foreign flags by passing out Old Glory at anti-187 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Mexican flags continued to wave.  
</P>
<P>
 Some were bought for the occasion at roadside swap meets. Others had been 
saved after last summer's raucous World Cup festivities, or from recent 
celebrations surrounding the boxing victories by Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez -- 
all by people who clung to the flag more as a family crest than a political 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we carry American flags when this country wants to kick my friends 
out of school and send them back to Mexico?" demanded Mariela Flores, a 
15-year-old Huntington Park sophomore who marched in two student walkouts. "We 
carry Mexican flags because they give us pride in where we come from." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican flags were a "symbolic clinging to self-pride," said Lloyd 
Monserratt, an aide to Los Angeles school board member Vicki Castro and 
confidant to some of the protesting students. "There was an acknowledgment that 
there may be a backlash, but much of this was just a spontaneous expression of 
pride." 
</P>
<P>
 To many Californians, that pride felt like rejection.  
</P>
<P>
 "Flags are images that appeal directly to people's emotions, and patriotism is 
a fairly deep bond that people feel," said Brian Stonehill, who directs a media 
studies program at Pomona College in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with waving the Mexican flag is while it rallied people of 
Mexican heritage, it alienated the mainstream American voter. It was like 
preaching to the converts instead of reaching across to address the mainstream, 
whose votes they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican flag may be fine for a sports event, like the World Cup, but they 
should not have chosen that symbol when they were preparing for an election. 
This is not like a sports event -- it's decided by the emotions of the people 
in the stands, not on the field. And those people in the stands felt their 
sense of national pride was being violated." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA professor David Hayes-Bautista, who heads the Center for the Study of 
Latino Health, reached even deeper for meaning.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think what these people were expressing is the desire to maintain the 
values that Latinos use to define themselves . . . their connection on a 
cultural level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people are challenged as (the campaign for) Proposition 187 challenged 
the image of Latinos -- with its TV ads showing them sneaking across the border 
in the dark -- it pushes them in a corner, forces them to ask, 'Who am I, 
really?'  
</P>
<P>
 "I can see why some of them would wrap themselves in the Mexican flag. An 
unfortunate choice of a symbol, maybe, but people should not misread it as a 
declaration of separation." 
</P>

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HARBOR GATEWAY; BODY OF 
MAN FOUND HOGTIED, RIGGED WITH EXPLOSIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters discovered the body of a man hogtied and rigged with explosives 
in a Harbor Gateway apartment, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The body, covered and lying next to a material resembling dynamite, was 
discovered early Tuesday after firefighters extinguished flames in the walkway 
and living room of the third-floor apartment, said Los Angeles Police Detective 
Larry Kallestad. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities suspect that the man was murdered and had been dead at least a 
day. They have no suspects but believe that the incident was drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever rigged the man with explosives probably wanted to destroy evidence of 
the murder, Kallestad said, but the blaze was doused before flames reached the 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were called to the apartment in the 1500 block of West Torrance 
Boulevard about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday after neighbors reported hearing a 
"whooshing" sound and then watched as gasoline-fueled flames rushed down a 
walkway, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact cause of the man's death was unknown, Kallestad said. Police believe 
the man was about 30 years old and lived in the apartment, but they did not 
release his name. An autopsy is expected to be completed today, Kallestad said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-LAPD 
TRAINEE AWARDED $814,000 IN SUIT OVER FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury Wednesday awarded $814,000 to an Irvine man who filed an age 
discrimination suit against the Los Angeles Police Department after he was 
fired as an officer trainee at age 41.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Superior Court jury's damage award followed an eight-day trial 
stemming from the suit brought by Philip De Teresi, who lost his "recruit 
officer" job and was denied the chance to become a full-fledged patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the LAPD maintained that De Teresi was fired because he failed 
to meet physical requirements for staying on the force and being promoted to 
street patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his attorneys, R. Stephen Bolinger, said two police officers testified 
that they heard another officer make derogatory remarks about De Teresi's age. 
De Teresi alleged that the discrimination surfaced when a group of officers 
claimed he had not been able to pass part of an LAPD self-defense test. 
</P>
<P>
 The $814,000 award includes $95,000 for back pay, $124,000 for lost pension 
funds, $395,000 for "front pay" -- money he could have been making since his 
termination -- and $200,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 De Teresi, who now works for the U.S. Marine Corps, was fired Aug. 13, 1990, 
after working for the LAPD for eight months, his attorneys said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
LAST QUAKE-DAMAGED INTERCHANGE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With television cameras, video recorders, reporters and scores of onlookers 
witnessing the event, the last earthquake-damaged link in the region's vast 
freeway network was reopened at 11 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A lone California Highway Patrol car, lights flashing, escorted the first 
three cars onto the connector from the southbound Golden State Freeway to the 
northbound Antelope Valley Freeway in northern Los Angeles County, culminating 
nine months of work since the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration of the interchange was of more symbolic than real importance. 
Only 1,300 vehicles a day used the transition before the quake, compared to the 
287,000 cars and trucks that travel the freeways it connects. But its repair 
closed the final link in a chain of post-quake roadway projects that included 
the reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway in April and the Golden State Freeway 
above Gavin Canyon in May.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BIG 6 
ACCOUNTING FIRM HIRED AS SUBWAY ADVISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Mayor Richard Riordan's urging, transit officials Wednesday hired a firm 
that worked on the English Channel tunnel to serve as an adviser on the 
troubled Los Angeles subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 A Metropolitan Transportation Authority panel voted to pay up to $500,000 to 
the Big 6 accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Co., even though two other 
companies had offered to do the work for less than $483,000.One firm submitted 
a low bid of $298,000. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Riordan said the mayor favored Arthur Andersen because he wanted a 
firm that had no prior business with the MTA and "therefore, no vested 
interest." The contract was approved unanimously by a five-member committee of 
the transit authority board. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was the latest response by the local transit officials to the 
Federal Transit Administration's decision Oct. 5 to freeze $1.6 billion in 
subway funding until the MTA shows it can competently manage the project. 
Tunneling in Hollywood has been shut down since Aug. 18 because of ground 
sinkage of up to 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency recently approved a reorganization plan for its rail 
construction program and is expected to receive federal permission -- possibly 
as early as today -- to resume tunneling in early December.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; METROLINK 
OFFERS DISCOUNT OF 25% ON DECEMBER PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metrolink officials on Wednesday announced a 25% discount on December monthly 
passes, an offer aimed at increasing ridership of the regional commuter train 
network.  
</P>
<P>
 "This one-month promotion should serve as an unexpected bonus to our 
commuters," said Larry Walker, Metrolink's board chairman and a San Bernardino 
County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this holiday season, we want to encourage potential riders to give us a 
try," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The price has been reduced partly because there are fewer commuter workdays in 
December because of the holidays and partly to keep riders in the habit of 
buying monthly passes, Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 70% of Metrolink passengers ride five days a week and the same 
percentage use monthly passes, according to recent surveys.  
</P>
<P>
 The one-month pass savings range from $20 to $72, depending on the number of 
zones and distance traveled. For example, a three-zone December monthly pass 
from Santa Clarita to Los Angeles will be $110 instead of $144.  
</P>
<P>
 The pass prices do not apply to one-way, round-trip or 10-trip tickets.  
</P>
<P>
 Monthly passes are good for unlimited trips during the calendar month. They 
can be purchased Nov. 22 through Dec. 10 at any Metrolink station ticket 
vending machine or at the Los Angeles Union Station ticket window.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL; RENT CONTROL ADVOCATES SUFFER 
ANOTHER SETBACK; RIGHTS GROUP STILL HAS 4-3 EDGE, BUT VICTORY OF PUBLIC SAFETY 
CANDIDATES REFLECTS SHIFT IN VOTER MOOD. AND CHANGES IN THE LEGISLATURE MAY 
UNDERMINE LOCAL LAW. 
</P>

<P>
 Santa Monica, one of the most liberal cities in the nation, took a strong 
law-and-order stand Tuesday that does not bode well for the liberal rent 
control forces that have long dominated city politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of three candidates backed by the rent control political organization 
was elected to the City Council. Even worse for the group, Santa Monicans for 
Renters Rights (SMRR), its rising political star, Councilman Tony Vazquez, was 
turned out of office after being attacked as anti-public safety by the city's 
police union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election was a referendum on SMRR's public safety and homeless policies," 
said Councilman Robert T. Holbrook, the top vote-getter in a field of 11 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But SMRR co-chair Nancy Greenstein portrayed Vazquez as a casualty of the 
statewide tide of conservatism and predicted that SMRR would regroup and 
rebound two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Though SMRR still holds a 4-3 edge on the council, Vazquez's defeat is the 
latest in a series of blows suffered by the political group this year.  
</P>
<P>
 They include the loss of voters whose apartment units were knocked out by the 
earthquake in January and a nearly successful effort in the state Legislature 
to weaken the group's strong rent-control law, which will be renewed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the council election, Holbrook and second-place finisher Ruth Ebner, a Los 
Angeles deputy city attorney, won with support from a coalition called Citizens 
for a Safe Santa Monica. Their one-two finish is the first time since 1986 that 
non-rent control-backed candidates took the top two spots in a council 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook and Ebner were also endorsed by the Santa Monica Police Officers 
Assn. The police union's entire slate, including SMRR-backed urban planner Pam 
O'Connor, was swept into office. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory for the police slate, which emphasized public safety, culminated 
several years of political angst over the beach city's large homeless 
population and its effect on public safety and quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, a bloc of three SMRR-supported council members has voted to enact 
a series of public safety measures to address the problems, but the public was 
apparently unsatisfied by the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous outings, SMRR started its fall election effort in a weakened 
condition. The Northridge earthquake damaged or destroyed thousands of rental 
units, cutting into SMRR's voter base. About 1,400 units remain out of 
commission, with an uncertain future. Others have been fixed, but rents have 
been raised to pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 3,000 rental units have been lost over the past several years under a 
program that allows apartment buildings to convert to condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest threat to the long-range viability of Santa Monica's strict 
rent control group comes from Sacramento. There, landlords and real estate 
interests have been pressing for a measure that would weaken the local law. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a bill to that effect came within one vote of passing the 
Legislature. That measure, which would have allowed rents in vacated units to 
rise to market levels, was defeated by one vote in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee -- viewed as the only stumbling block to its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The deciding vote was cast by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who 
leaves office at the end of the year. State Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), 
a champion of rent control who has in past years killed the bill in the 
Judiciary Committee, is also retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow defeat of the bill, coupled with the changing face of the 
Legislature due to term limits, indicates that it may be only a matter of time 
until a measure that would weaken Santa Monica's law passes. 
</P>
<P>
 To forestall that, SMRR needed a strong showing by like-minded Democrats in 
legislative races across the state and the election of Kathleen Brown as 
governor. She was viewed as more likely to veto an anti-rent control measure 
than Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the vacancy decontrol measure say they plan to reintroduce it in 
the Legislature next year.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's our best shot ever," said Robert Sullivan, spokesman for the Apartment 
Assn. of Greater Los Angeles.

SON ARRESTED IN KILLINGS OF 3 IN FAMILY 
</P>

 A 21-year-old gas station mechanic was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion 
of killing his parents and younger brother, whose bodies were found in a family 
car that had been doused with gasoline and set on fire outside a La Mirada high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Charles Jr. was surprised by Fullerton police as he left his parents' 
house just after 8 p.m. with his girlfriend.Officers had surrounded the house 
and posted themselves at other homes in the neighborhood because they feared 
Charles might flee, Sgt. Danny Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles was under the belief that we were here to provide security for the 
family, and to keep the media from getting too close to the house," Becerra 
said. "He didn't anticipate being arrested. " 
</P>
<P>
 Charles told sheriff's investigators that he is innocent, said his lawyer, 
John J. Donovan of Fullerton. He would not discuss Charles' recent whereabouts 
and said Charles was too upset to comment publicly on the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine," Donovan said. "Obviously, he's distraught." 
</P>
<P>
 No motive was offered for the killings, which investigators believe occurred 
Sunday night, a day before neighbors of El Camino Continuing School reported a 
car fire in the parking lot about 10 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Edward Charles Sr., 55, a Hughes Aircraft electrical 
engineer, Dolores Charles, 47, a self-employed typist, and Danny Charles, 19, a 
singer and voice student at USC, were killed Sunday night and their bodies 
hidden in the car until it was set on fire.

 SUPER MEETING: Maybe you thought plans for that super-speed train from Orange 
County to Las Vegas were dead. Not so -- not yet. . . . The bistate commission 
behind it meets in Anaheim today, with its own survival the top agenda item. 
The commission, which has seen all proposals fall through so far, has until 
1996 to show the California and Nevada legislatures that there's reason to 
continue. . . . Says Las Vegas Councilman Arnie Adamsen, a commission member: 
"We're feeling some frustrations, but I know of no one yet ready to throw in 
the towel." 
</P>
<P>
 EARLY ORANGE: If you want to take a look at Orange County a few million 
seasons ago, a major display of fossil limbs and skulls opens at the Old County 
Courthouse in Santa Ana on Saturday for a two-month stay. . . . It's been put 
together by the county's Natural History Museum. Everything was unearthed 
during construction of the San Joaquin Hills and Foothill tollways in South 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSER LOOK: Almost all of these fossils were dug up by John Minch and 
Associates, Mission Viejo paleontologists. Included will be Waldo, the 
8-million-year-old walrus-like mammal, whose discovery created a stir last 
year. . . . But Minch says there's a lot more to get excited about: 
"Seventy-five percent of this stuff has never been seen by the public before -- 
elephants, camels, bison. We've got fossils from some animals whose existence 
had even been questioned by paleontologists." 
</P>
<P>
 DEJA VU? It's rare for a sitting judge in Orange County to be challenged for 
reelection. But Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher, who appears to have lost by a 
mere percentage point to prosecutor Caryl Lee on Tuesday (B1), knows something 
about such challenges. . . . Dutcher won his Westminster court seat away from 
incumbent Joanne Harrold 12 years ago. Harrold thumped him easily at the polls, 
but Dutcher won a court challenge over the legality of her residency, then won 
the seat she was forced to vacate.

MISSION COLLEGE CHIEF MAY LEAVE TO RAISE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mission College President Jack Fujimoto may soon leave the college to help the 
financially strapped community college district raise desperately needed 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fujimoto and Los Angeles Community College District officials stressed 
that the move would only be temporary, despite its coming at a time of 
expansion, decreasing enrollment and low morale among some faculty members and 
students. Also, Fujimoto recently has come under fire because of remarks 
published in a Times interview last month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Chancellor Neil Yoneji convened a special, districtwide meeting at 
the college, where he said it was likely that Fujimoto would be tapped for his 
fund-raising expertise. Yoneji mentioned the names of at least two vice 
chancellors who may fill the job during Fujimoto's absence, college officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto confirmed that he may be leaving Mission College -- the district's 
newest and smallest college -- but stressed that no final decision has been 
made and that his absence would probably only be temporary.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I leave, I'd like the status of my position to be reviewed every six 
months," said Fujimoto, who took over at Mission in 1989, one year before the 
college's expansion from a collection of storefronts in San Fernando to its 
present, 22.5-acre site adjacent to El Cariso Regional Park in Sylmar.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I'm asking for," Fujimoto said in a phone interview. "It's not my 
decision. It's up to the district."  
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto said the move could take place "anytime between now and February."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The potential personnel change comes as the district, the state's largest, 
focuses on generating outside sources of funding including federal grants, in 
the wake of state budget cutbacks and other financial stresses. Fujimoto is 
considered an expert at obtaining outside funding, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fujimoto is transferred Downtown, Mission College would be left without 
steady leadership during a year when enrollment is down nearly 19% from its 
peak in 1992. Enrollment dwindled to under 6,000 this fall, possibly a result 
of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipated change also occurs just before the college's 20th anniversary 
this February. Some faculty members said they are concerned that a personnel 
change might delay a planned 40-acre expansion of the college or slow down 
other projects -- like construction of an $11-million library and learning 
resource center that began in late September.  
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the news of Fujimoto's possible departure among faculty and 
student leaders was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much change going on right now, everyone is a little unsettled," 
said Gerald Scheib, chairman of the college's arts and letters cluster and past 
president of the Academic Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morale is kind of low right now," Scheib said. "We're very concerned about 
who the interim president will be, somebody from inside or outside the 
district. The school's vice president also took a job Downtown in the past 
year. It makes us wonder why all our top administrators are leaving."  
</P>
<P>
 Former college Vice President Victoria Richart left early this year to become 
the district's senior director of instructional student services.  
</P>
<P>
 A source inside the district said the names of at least two administrators -- 
both district vice chancellors -- already have been proposed for the job of 
interim president. 
</P>
<P>
 Some faculty members said Fujimoto had been criticized in recent weeks 
regarding comments he made about Mission's student body in a recent Times 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments, published Oct. 18, prompted the president of the college's 
Associated Student Organization to demand an explanation. In a letter to 
Fujimoto dated Nov. 2, John Sobanski, president of the student organization, 
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "From the students' point of view, we feel as though you actually believe that 
students' 'expectations are a little higher than what their abilities are' when 
in reality this can't be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto made the comment about students' expectations in response to a 
question from a Times reporter about the kinds of goals pursued by Mission 
College students after attending the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobanski wrote that the remark and a few other comments made by Fujimoto 
during the interview were "belittling to students attending Mission College." 
</P>
<P>
 Fujimoto acknowledged having to "explain why I said some of the things I said" 
to disgruntled students, but denied intending to disparage the student body. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoneji did not return repeated phone calls Tuesday and Wednesday. Fausto 
Copabianco, the district's public affairs director, said Wednesday that he did 
not know about the possible transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some Mission faculty members said the possibility of Fujimoto's departure 
was not new: "We'd had an inkling of it for some time," said Dale Newman, 
president of the Academic Senate and director of the college's learning 
assistance center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack has gone to bat for us with the politicians in Sacramento before," 
Newman said. "He's a fantastic asset and it's not really fair of us not to 
share him with the rest of the district. And he told me he's going only if he 
was assured of his return. I know that his feelings about this are mixed." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Li Wu, a member of the community college district's Board of Trustees, 
refused to comment on Fujimoto's possible transfer, saying it has not been 
finalized: "Dr. Fujimoto is very versatile and has good working relationships 
with many levels of government. That's all I can say about it."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; LOOKING BACK; VALLEY STUDENTS WHO FOUGHT PROP. 187 
REFLECT ON A BATTLE LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They were disorganized, often petulant, dressed in baggy clothes and too young 
to even vote. But San Fernando Valley students waged one of the most visible 
campaigns in the statewide battle over Proposition 187, staging school walkouts 
and mass demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 And after a loud and furious two weeks, most spent Wednesday in quiet 
reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after California voters overwhelmingly approved the initiative barring 
illegal immigrants from most government services, daily routines seemed to go 
on as usual, even at Valley clinics, welfare offices and schools -- 
institutions where the measure is intended to have its greatest impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many Latinos receiving government services -- whether prenatal care 
or a college education -- on Wednesday revealed a dispirited resignation to the 
prospect that life would very likely become more difficult. Even those living 
in the United States legally fear that the passage of the initiative will 
encourage bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 "First they will target illegal immigrants. Then they will target us -- the 
ones who look like we are immigrants," said Senia Calderon, 19, of San 
Fernando, a single mother and legal resident who receives welfare for her 
1-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Ruben Reyes, a legal resident who was awaiting immunization 
shots for his 11-month-old son at the Pacoima Health Center, predicted that 
little will change for illegal immigrants until authorities begin enforcement 
of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they see some kind of action, that's when people are going to stay 
away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Scott, speaking for the United Chambers of Commerce of the San 
Fernando Valley, said he and the majority of members celebrated passage of the 
initiative but oppose the expected use of public funds to challenge the law in 
court. He said he believes student protests were prompted by teachers and 
school officials opposed to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults were influencing the kids to do this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Student leaders in the Valley, meanwhile, spent the day assessing their 
tactics, wondering if they could have done more to defeat the initiative: 
Should they have just stayed in class? Waved American instead of Mexican flags? 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried as much as we could but maybe we didn't make our voices clear," said 
Mandy Evans, a 15-year-old Birmingham High School student. "What can we do? 
We're not old enough to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 But with a protracted legal fight over Proposition 187 expected, students said 
that in the not-so-distant future their loud opinions will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we can't vote but in four years we will be able to vote and we 
won't let people like Pete Wilson get in office and we won't let propositions 
like 187 pass," said Marjorie Garcia, a 17-year-old Sylmar High student. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The short but spirited student campaign to defeat Proposition 187 was for 
Marjorie and thousands of other Latino students a landmark political event. If 
they grow up to be the political force that demographers predict, they could 
make good on the threat against Republicans and others who supported the 
initiative, political experts and educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando High School Principal Philip R. Saldivar said despite criticism, 
the protests motivated his student body. "I want to keep their political 
interests going. These are our next voters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Aaron Diyarza, 17, a San Fernando High student: "One thing we learned . . 
. is that voting is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Others expressed the disappointment more typical of youth. "I was hoping it 
would make a difference, change people's minds," said Hector Estrada, 18, who 
joined the walkout last week at San Fernando High School. "It didn't really do 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three Los Angeles city schools reported walkouts Wednesday -- Venice High 
School, Hamilton High in West Los Angeles and Olive Vista Middle School in 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, about 200 mostly Latino students gathered for a noon 
rally, carrying a black coffin and posters with messages such as "What am I, 
Citizen or Suspect." CSUN student sophomore Vladimir Cerna, an illegal 
immigrant and an elected student body officer, said passage of the initiative 
marks "open season" on the undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it will be stopped in the courts," he said. "But even so, the 
atmosphere is there. If you assume someone is illegal, you can say or do 
anything you want to them." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, he cited vandals who painted "wetbacks out" and "illegals out" on 
the school's Chicano House the day before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 At the East Valley welfare office in Panorama City, several single mothers -- 
both legal and illegal residents -- said they were not concerned about the 
immediate consequences of the proposition because of expected legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, they said, state law already prohibits undocumented immigrants from 
receiving most forms of public aid, such as Medi-Cal and Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children. Their U.S.-born children are eligible for benefits even if 
they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 But the women said they feared passage of the measure would open the door to 
discrimination because of their accents and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Martinez, 33, said her five children are frightened that they will get 
into trouble at school because they speak Spanish and have brown skin. "I have 
told them not to be afraid because they were born here," said Martinez, a 
Mexican native and legal resident of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare workers were ordered not to comment. A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
County Department of Public Social Services, Carol Matsui, said the department 
was conducting "business as usual" until it receives instructions from the 
state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little evidence of the new law at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center and 
other county medical facilities in the Valley, despite a requirement that 
doctors and nurses report to authorities patients suspected of being illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials said they were instructed by county Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed not to begin checking patients' immigration 
status until the county receives guidelines from state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some illegal immigrants awaiting care said even if Proposition 187 is 
enforced, they would have no choice but to seek needed care, regardless of the 
risks. They also expressed anger at supporters of the anti-immigrant measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarita Castro, 26, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was seeking care 
for her infant daughter at the Pacoima health clinic, said she was angry over 
voters seeking to punish immigrants even though "We've been giving a lot by 
working more for less." 
</P>

 Teresa Lopez, another illegal immigrant from Mexico, said she was not worried 
that staff members at Olive View hospital -- where she gave birth to a girl 
Monday -- might turn her in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they deport me, I'll be back," said Lopez, 22, in Spanish. "In their 
hearts, someday they're going to pay for what they're doing."

PACT ON SOKA SITE CALLED A FAIR DEAL; CALABASAS: TENTATIVE ACCORD CALLS FOR 
CONVERTING 173 ACRES INTO PARKLAND, ALLOWS CAMPUS TO CONTINUE ITS EXPANSION 
PLANS.

<P>
 A tentative settlement between the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Soka 
University would turn 173 acres of the school's scenic Calabasas campus into 
parkland -- but only after Soka's expansion plans are approved and construction 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the conservancy would be required to drop its 2-year-old eminent 
domain lawsuit, which seeks to condemn 245 of Soka's 662 acres at Las Virgenes 
Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of settlement talks between Soka and the conservancy was leaked last 
week; details of a tentative agreement were obtained Wednesday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides described the agreement as a fair deal that would save public money 
and preserve much of the school's property as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a parks agency is presented with the opportunity to get 70% of what it 
wants, including the jewel of what it wants, in this environment, we would be 
absolutely foolish not to consider the offer," conservancy Executive Director 
Joseph T. Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that settling with Soka could save millions of dollars to buy other 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials have long coveted Soka's property as a site for a visitors 
center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. But Soka, which 
runs a language school for 200 students, wants to expand into a liberal arts 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Soka would move its proposed development to the east, 
away from Las Virgenes Road, and reduce its maximum proposed enrollment from 
3,400 to 2,500 over 25 years, school spokesman Jeff Ourvan confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy, in turn, would buy most of the property it is trying to 
condemn -- including the historic mansion built by razor magnate King Gillette. 
The price likely would be an average of three appraisals to be performed in the 
future, probably between $10 million and $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan and Edmiston estimated that the whole deal, from the title transfer to 
Soka erecting a new administration building, would take at least five years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact must still be approved by two parks agencies, Soka trustees and the 
judge hearing the condemnation case. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conservancy forsakes the deal and pursues condemnation, sources said 
the ultimate price of the property could be several million dollars more than 
the conservancy's appraised value of $19.8 million once attorneys' fees and 
courts costs are added in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan even said that the school likely would sue the conservancy for damages 
if the case goes forward, potentially adding several million more to the 
conservancy's legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of Soka's plans criticized the deal -- especially the condition 
under which no land would change hands unless the school's expansion plans were 
approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 They said such a provision would require the conservancy and other 
environmental groups to support a destructive project to get part of the 
school's property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of like a Hobson's choice," said Les Hardie, past president of the 
Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation. "It puts us in an impossible position." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Planning Commissioner Dave Brown agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will tear the community apart, that's for sure," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston said he understood anger over the deal because many opponents of 
Soka's plans consider the conservancy's condemnation efforts their best hope 
for stopping the school's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, a conservancy victory is in no way assured. And even if the 
conservancy were victorious, Soka would retain the right to apply to develop 
the rest of its property. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are no doubt angry because we did not put the silver bullet in the gun 
and try to fire it and hope there was some powder," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, an arm of 
the conservancy, will meet Monday night to decide whether to sign off on the 
deal. The full conservancy board will meet Nov. 21 to make a similar decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka and the conservancy had been scheduled to face off Nov. 23 in Los Angeles 
Superior Court to determine whether the conservancy has the legal right to take 
the school's property. Decisions on both sides must be reached before the 
hearing if the deal is to move forward. Park Deal at Soka Part of Soka 
University's scenic Calabasas campus would be sold to the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy under a tentative agreement to settle the conservancy's 
2-year-old eminet domain lawsuit to seize the school's land. Soka now operates 
a language school with about 200 students on the site. * 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the Deal * Conservancy would gain 173 acres at Las Virgenes Road 
and Mulholland Highway. * Soka would develop 75 acres as a 2,500-student 
campus. * Remaining Soka property would remain open space. * Conservancy would 
get historic Gillette Mansion. * Agreement is contingent upon conservancy 
dropping a condemnation lawsuit and Soka gaining permission from Los Angele 
County Board of Supervisors to expand.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; LOAN APPROVED FOR SENIOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the protests of nearby homeowners, the Los Angeles City Council on 
Wednesday approved a $2.4-million loan to a planned senior housing project on 
the corner of Ventura Boulevard and Woodman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8-million mixed-use project includes 84 apartment units and about 3,000 
square feet of retail space. The city loan will be used for land acquisition 
and site preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 In late July, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky struck a tentative deal -- aspects of 
which still need to be approved by the City Council -- with developer Oved 
Ovadia, under which the city would grant him the loan, as well as an exemption 
from the height and density limits outlined in the Ventura Boulevard Specific 
Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Ovadia agreed to drop a $10-million lawsuit challenging the 
Specific Plan. The rest of the project is to be paid for by Ovadia and through 
a combination of tax credits and bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky hailed the council's action as a step in the right direction 
toward removing a blighted block of buildings and replacing them with something 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This puts an end to what is a long saga on a block on Ventura Boulevard which 
has been a nuisance and a living hell for people who live and work there," 
Yaroslavsky said. "I hope the property owners move quickly to begin 
construction of this project. It's a very good compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 But some homeowners were upset by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very upsetting. We're outraged," said Rose Elmassian, a co-chairwoman 
of the Woodman/Ventura Committee of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., the 
chief opponent of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners are concerned that exempting the project from height and 
density regulations will undermine the Specific Plan. The homeowners say the 
city has not given them adequate time to review environmental and traffic 
documents related to the project, and that an environmental study indicates 
that soil at the project site is contaminated by pollutants, gas and oil leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky conceded that the project does not conform to the Specific Plan, 
but said the exception was necessary to settle the lawsuit, which had put the 
entire Specific Plan in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescalvo said the city has responded to homeowners' request for documents in a 
timely manner and even extended the public comment period in response to their 
concerns. The aide said that as far as she knows, the site is not contaminated.

 Legion Agrees to Improvements 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: American Legion building 
</P>
<P>
 Background: The American Legion post was closed for five months because the 
city denied it a conditional-use permit. The city demanded massive landscaping 
improvements and lights be added to the parking area. But property owner Dilip 
Parikh balked, saying he did not have the money. The American Legion got caught 
in the middle. Veterans, whose fund-raising activities were put on hold, felt 
that the city did not appreciate their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: A compromise was reached last month. The post agreed to beautify 
about 2% of the parking lot that faces its headquarters; the city originally 
called for 5%. Under the agreement, the American Legion will also replace 
lights on a pole in the parking lot, will stripe portions of the blacktop for 
compact cars and will plant bushes.

 Residents Pleased With City Services

 Issue: Community outreach program 
</P>
<P>
 Background: A year ago, city officials began a program to elicit residents' 
feedback by visiting neighborhoods. "It's just a reality check to get out of 
our ivory tower to talk to people and see what they think," said Deputy City 
Administrator Richard Barnard. Residents were asked to fill out surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: Residents who responded to the city survey said that they were 
generally satisfied with the quality of city services. Police, fire, paramedic 
and library services were rated at the top of the list of city services. When 
asked what they liked least about the city, residents cited overcrowding, 
traffic and redevelopment.

<P>
 Council's Wish-List Projects on Hold 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Excess city funds 
</P>
<P>
 Background: City Council members have a long list of favorite projects that 
are in limbo, waiting for funding. At a recent council meeting, Irvine 
officials said the city closed out the 1993-94 fiscal year with a $1.7-million 
surplus that can be spent on miscellaneous projects. Among the items on council 
members' wish lists were proposals for a community roller-hockey rink, 
community youth arts programs and $1.5 million in funding for the Narrows park 
project in Northwood Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said Irvine is in the enviable 
position of having a budget surplus due to higher sales tax and developer fee 
revenues combined with tightened city cost controls. But he advised council 
members to take a conservative approach to the excess money and delay spending 
decisions until January. "We're still in recessionary times," Brady said. The 
council agreed, postponing its consideration of proposed expenditures.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; HE'S BEEN CALLED GOOFY, BUT CAR HONORS MICKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One look at his 1989 Buick Le Sabre and people ask Fabio Rodriguez if he is 
crazy. But no one asks him if he has lost his marbles. 
</P>
<P>
 From bumper to bumper, more than 30,000 multicolored glass marbles adorn 
Rodriguez's four-wheeled "Fantasia," the latest of his offbeat projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have called me crazy so many times," the 48-year-old Rodriguez said 
Wednesday. "But they admire the artistic marbles and the patience, for you have 
to do it one by one. This is like a mural on wheels." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last seven months, Rodriguez has spent most of his time at his 
condominium/art studio in Van Nuys -- away from his Mesa, Ariz., home -- where 
he painstakingly glued the imported Mexican marbles on his Le Sabre. 
</P>
<P>
 If this seems madness, there is a method -- an ongoing dream to create 
one-of-a-kind cars. Rodriguez's previous creation, a 1969 Honda covered with 
27,000 dimes, was sold in 1991 for an undisclosed sum to Ripley's Believe It Or 
Not, which put the vehicle on display at its London museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The story behind Rodriquez's current project is almost as bizarre as the car. 
The inspiration for "Fantasia" came not from some childhood affection for 
marbles, which Rodriguez played growing up Colombia, but from a rodent. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mickey Mouse fanatic, Rodriguez has amassed more than 1,500 Mickey Mouse 
collectibles -- from watches to train sets. Rodriguez wanted to create a car 
that honored his hero, but knew that gluing a thousand Mickey Mouse figurines, 
pens, phones and other collectibles would look tacky, at best, and get stolen, 
at least. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't put $10,000 worth of collectibles on top of a car," Rodriguez said. 
"It wouldn't be a carjacking. It would be a Mickeyjack." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he took an idea from one of Mickey's films. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you remember the movie 'Fantasia,' it's the most colorful movie he made," 
said Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two years, Rodriguez searched for the marbles he needed to create 
a cruising cascade of colors, finally finding them in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a special mixture of three glues, Rodriguez spent at least 5 1/2 hours a 
day covering doors, hubcaps, fenders, etc. with the marbles, which more closely 
resemble oblong stones than the playground variety. The car also features green 
rhinestones and colored wooden sticks on the front grille. 
</P>
<P>
 To honor Mickey directly, each door carries a silhouette of Mickey's head, 
re-created in dimes and quarters. Known for his abilities as a "coin artist" -- 
he once covered a suit of armor with 6,258 dimes -- Rodriguez also glued more 
than 4,500 dimes around the windows and on the hood to create an eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Rodriguez is hoping to sell his creation. He works part time as a 
Spanish-language commercial and television announcer, as well as on cartoons, 
but he says it is not enough to support a wife and three kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the sale, Rodriguez just wants to keep from losing his marbles. So far, 
he's been lucky: "Fantasia" has been driven through three car washes without 
rinsing off a single dime or marble. And the car security system shrieks a 
wicked alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the youths who admired "Fantasia" on Wednesday at Balboa Park Lake were 
any indication, Rodriguez should not leave the car alone for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice," one 17-year-old teen-age girl from Reseda said innocently. "I'd 
like to steal it." JEFF SCHNAUFER

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; ANIMAL LOVER PUTS WILDLIFE 
ON WHEELS 
</P>

 With Ben, a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, sprawled at her feet, and Newton the 
goat closing in on an interviewer's notebook for a quick snack, Mimi 
Wood-Harris remembered with satisfaction that losing her dream job and being 
forced to move back to Los Angeles in 1979 was a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at things happening for a reason," said Wood-Harris, 38, the founder 
of Wildlife on Wheels and a lifelong animal lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on a one-acre ranch in Sunland, the group takes a wide variety of 
animals -- llamas, a monkey, an alligator, an American bald eagle, wildcats, 
foxes, etc. -- to schools and libraries to teach children about exotic animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood-Harris had been working at her ideal job -- assistant curator for 
education at the Atlanta Zoo -- for only a week when she was told she did not 
qualify because of a restriction on how much money a job applicant could have 
made in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, you come home to momma," Wood-Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experience led her to a master's degree at Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
where she wrote a thesis on the need for independent contractors to teach 
schoolchildren about wildlife. Her professor pushed her from theory to reality 
when he said, "OK, let's do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The professor became her business partner, and Wood-Harris drove a limousine, 
worked the door of a disco and took other odd jobs to support herself until 
they held their first animal demonstration in July, 1982. Her mother's back 
yard was used at first to hold the growing collection of exotic animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did come home from work one afternoon and a wolf came around behind me," 
said her mother, Jacqueline Wood, a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for 30 years and now an instructor at Wildlife on Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I don't tell her how much I appreciate what she has done for me," said 
Wood-Harris, who remembers one morning when she missed her bus to junior high 
school as she tried to help a puppy with a broken leg. "Why aren't you on the 
school bus?" her mother asked. But her mother understood her compassion for 
animals and drove her to school. "She knew that was me," Wood-Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1988, she joined the International Bird Rescue Response Team, based in 
Berkeley, and has helped save animal victims of several oil slicks, including 
the spill after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those experiences you will never trade for the world, but it 
was one you will never forget," said Wood-Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 But an earlier spill at Grays Harbor, Wash., which killed an estimated 4,500 
sea birds and affected many more than the Alaskan disaster, helped her develop 
a tough skin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grays Harbor spill lasted five weeks. At any one time, there were as many 
as 3,000 animals in the rescue center, she said. The sea birds developed joint 
lesions and sores as they sat in boxes in dry dock waiting for help. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Wood-Harris shows off Adak -- the bald eagle with an amputated wing 
that she found on a remote Alaskan island at the time she was there after the 
Exxon Valdez disaster -- she uses the experiences of her animal rescue work to 
"add that extra spice" and reach the children through her storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It encourages kids to feel what you feel and see what you have seen," she 
said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; SCHOOL IS 15TH IN U.S. IN AP TESTS TAKEN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Out of 10,800 high schools nationwide, Van Nuys High School ranked 15th in 
terms of the number of Advanced Placement tests taken during last school year, 
according to the College Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Placement courses are college-level classes taken by high school 
students.Once in college, students can receive academic credit for having taken 
the courses and passed the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Nuys, which boasts a math-science magnet program, one of the most 
popular AP exams is the calculus test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had so many students that they filled the gym completely," said Robert 
Scharf, Van Nuys High principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, which also houses a medical studies magnet program and another in 
the performing arts, offers AP courses in almost all subjects, Scharf said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It continues to reflect the high quality of students at our school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Scharf, Wade Curry of the New York-based College Board, which 
oversees the AP program nationwide, wrote: "The fact that so many of your 
students are taking the AP exams signifies that your school has attained a 
level of academic excellence for which you should be proud." MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CITIZEN SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM GETS $600 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has voted to give North Hollywood and Studio City 
residents $600 to buy walkie-talkie radios for use in a civilian anti-crime 
surveillance program. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recommendation of Councilman Joel Wachs, the council voted Tuesday to 
subtract the money from Wachs' public service account, which provides $10,000 
annually to fund communities groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Capt. Richard Wahler said the two-way radios will be used 
by residents who are participating in a police-assisted surveillance program to 
crack down on car thieves, graffiti vandals and other criminals in North 
Hollywood and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 He said residents and business owners have already raised about $11,000 
through T-shirt sales, corporate donations and other fund-raising events to pay 
for about a dozen radios for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The radios' reception is clear, Wahler said, because Texaco Inc. has paid to 
install a repeater tower on top of its Universal City office building to relay 
the radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The captain said he expects the group to stake out shopping mall parking lots 
during the Christmas holidays to target car thieves. The radios also can be 
used during special community events such as 10-kilometer races, he added. HUGO

 The city's Office of Emergency Services will hold an orientation tonight for 
residents interested in serving as volunteer disaster service workers in the 
event of an earthquake or other emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to recruit several hundred residents from across the city, who 
will be trained, registered and sworn in as official disaster volunteers.So 
far, nearly 100 people have enlisted in the program, which began in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a need for many more persons to become involved in this 
program, and we encourage all Glendale residents and businesses to consider 
becoming volunteers," said Gerald Shamburg, the city's emergency services 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 No special skills are required to become a disaster worker, but city officials 
said they are looking for people who can assist in the following areas: shelter 
workers to assist the Salvation Army and Red Cross; licensed amateur radio 
operators to help set up communications stations; people fluent in foreign 
languages to help with translation, and area leaders to help coordinate 
disaster training in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The orientation session is at 7 p.m. in the community room of the Perkins 
building, 141 N. Glendale Ave. For information, call (818) 548-2121. STEVE

 The Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station, which recently celebrated its 50th 
anniversary, started out as a net depot, repairing steel nets designed to keep 
Japanese submarines out of U.S. harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, it became a full-fledged weapons station where workers assembled 
part of the Saturn 5 rocket system used in the Apollo and Skylab space 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons station is now the only West Coast base that loads Tomahawk 
missiles onto ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure is called "Tomahawk in a can" because the Tomahawks are loaded 
into missile-firing canisters, which are then loaded below deck on ships. Today 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital auxiliary workers will hold their annual "Holiday Faire" to raise 
money for South Coast Medical Center in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will sell items such as antique jewelry, baked goods and Christmas 
decorations to benefit the not-for-profit hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that proceeds from the event will go directly to improve the 
medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 The boutique will be set up in the hospital lobby at 31872 Coast Highway.

<P>
 "HIV/AIDS in the Workplace," a seminar for employers, will be conducted by the 
Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross at its headquarters in Santa 
Ana. The free seminar is scheduled for 9 a.m. to noon today. 
</P>
<P>
 National statistics indicate that more than two-thirds of large workplaces and 
almost one-tenth of small companies have employees who are HIV-positive or have 
AIDS. In Orange County, there have been nearly 3,500 documented cases of AIDS, 
a Red Cross spokeswoman said. It is estimated that an additional 8,000 to 
12,000 people in the county are infected with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross seminar will explore both legal and humanitarian issues 
concerning employees with HIV/AIDS. Specific topics will include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Americans With Disabilities Act and the protections it affords 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * How to understand and support employees or co-workers who have the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * The availability of various workplace programs concerning HIV/AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Red Cross will preview a new video, "Preventing Disease 
Transmission." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross is at 601 N. Golden Circle Drive, Santa Ana. Seminar 
reservations are available by calling (714) 835-5381, Ext. 105.ALAN EYERLY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; DEADLINE LOOMING FOR RECALL MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With less than a month to go before the Dec. 7 deadline to gather the required 
number of signatures, the leader of a movement to recall the Agoura Hills City 
Council was predicting victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Murphy, an Agoura Hills resident who is spearheading the movement, 
predicted Tuesday that her group will get the 2,454 signatures -- or 20% of the 
city's 12,026 registered voters -- it needs by Dec. 7 to force a recall 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can get (the signatures), definitely," Murphy said. "Based on 
what we have now and where we have to be, we think we can pull it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy declined to say how many signatures the group has. "We definitely have 
more than half," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's group, Citizens Against New Local Taxes, began the recall process 
last summer, after the City Council voted unanimously to pass a 4% tax on 
electricity, gas and telephone service to help close a budget gap of nearly $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The group maintains that the city could have closed the deficit without the 
tax and accuses the council of allowing spending to spiral out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say they had no choice but to levy the new tax and scoff at 
the notion that they have spent carelessly. Council members say they worry 
about what will become of the city if they are thrown out of office. The recall 
supporters, they say, have no plan ready to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 In another recall attempt in 1989, a group made up largely of different people 
failed to get the required signatures to recall four council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene McBane, a former councilwoman who was targeted in the previous recall 
attempt, predicted that the latest attempt would also fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody I've talked to thinks this is silly," she said. "And even if they 
agree (that the utility tax is unnecessary), they think that three elections in 
one year is a bad way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 If the recall group is able to gather the required number of signatures, the 
city next year would have to hold a recall election, then another election to 
replace the council members, then the regularly scheduled elections in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Denis Weber said he has doubts that the recall supporters will be 
able to get the signatures they need. The council has meanwhile been picking up 
supporters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've probably got over 300 names, at least, and we publish our names," he 
said. "Yet I've never seen any of the signatures that they have." 
</P>
<P>
 The council members have been setting up tables each Saturday at a local 
shopping center, next to a petition-gathering table set up by recall 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few weeks, we got maybe three times as many supporters as they 
(the recall group) got signatures on their petitions," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current recall attempt, according to McBane and others against a recall, 
is backed by opponents of a city ordinance against commercial signs on poles. 
The council, they maintain, is being targeted because they support the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy denies that the recall supporters are motivated by the pole sign issue. 
She said she is personally opposed to the ordinance because businesses need the 
signs to attract customers. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: MONTROSE; STUDENT HOPES STAMP DESIGN WINS APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In April, 13-year-old Eun Young Seo of Montrose created an environmentally 
oriented stamp and entered it in a nationwide contest sponsored by the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't win -- yet. But of the more than 150,000 youngsters from 8 to 13 
who entered, Eun has qualified as one of 102 young students in the country who 
have received $100 U.S. savings bonds for their efforts and framed copies of 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
 She also will represent Southern California in the final judging to determine 
which four designs will appear on 200 million first-class postage stamps 
beginning in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Submitting a design that consisted of a frog, a waterfall, flowers and three 
children picking up trash and planting a tree near the border of a bare center, 
Eun's intent was to get people to appreciate the precarious state the 
environment has fallen into in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to show how pretty our environment still is and how we're 
messing it up," Eun said. "That's why the middle of the design is bare, with 
almost no foliage." 
</P>
<P>
 "I drew the children as an African American, an Asian and a Caucasian to show 
that it's everybody's responsibility to take care of the environment," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eun, a freshman at Crescenta Valley High School, has attended art school for 
the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In talking to her, I perceive Eun as a very mature young lady," said 
Crescenta Valley High School Principal Ken Bierman. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's celebrated by those who know her and is a competitive person, but I 
don't believe she has it set in her mind that she will necessarily win. I think 
she recognizes that you put your best effort into something you do and 
hopefully you gain recognition for it. But, if not, that's still OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Four students will be informed later this month that they are finalists and 
will be flown to Washington, D.C., with their parents or guardians to take part 
in a Nov. 17 ceremony to unveil 96 new 1995 U.S. Postal Service designs on 27 
different subjects. The student winners will receive a U.S. savings bond for 
$3,000. They each will have their designs on 50 million stamps next year. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Eun is concerned, that last prospect is almost inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised to have made it this far," she said. "I can't imagine how 
much 50 million actually is." ANTONIO OLIVO

 Officials from Cablevision of Orange and the city manager's office will hold 
an open forum tonight to hear complaints from residents who have received 
unscrambled adult movies on their television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Jim Evans and Cablevision General Manager Kristy 
Casasanta will be available to discuss solutions to the unwanted feeds at 7 
p.m. in the Council Chambers of Civic Plaza at 300 E. Chapman Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Casasanta said the unscrambling of the visual portion of movies from Playboy 
and Hot Choice channels has been resolved but that the unscrambled audio feeds 
are an industrywide problem. The cable company can trap the feeds on an 
individual basis. LESLEY WRIGHT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; GIFTS SOLICITED FOR SIOUX RESERVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The expressions on the faces of the children in the photograph range from awe 
to delight to outright disbelief at the strange sight they are witnessing. The 
children, who live on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota, are 
watching television for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Shapiro, an animal science professor at Pierce College, uses the photo -- 
taken in the late 1980s -- to illustrate a point he says many Americans fail to 
grasp: that, in this modern age, thousands of Native American children living 
on remote, isolated reservations are suffering from severe poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a simple thing like a toothbrush, something we take for granted," said 
Shapiro, "They don't even have them there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, who is part Lakota Sioux, is organizing a drive to collect Christmas 
gifts to give to children on reservations. The effort is one of several 
collection drives conducted throughout the region under the direction of the 
Irvine-based Red Cloud American Indian Society, which hopes to distribute 7,500 
gifts to children on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro says he hopes to collect gifts for 440 children. As of Wednesday, he 
said, he still needed 135 gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the frigid weather in the Northern Plains this time of year, the 
children are in dire need of such items as winter jackets and boots, said 
Shapiro. Toys and other gifts will also help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just collectively trying to bring a little joy into the lives of the 
children who are gripped with poverty and despair," said Phillip Stevens, 
president of the Red Cloud American Indian Society. "This is an especially 
difficult time of year for these people." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, Stevens said, will distribute the gifts onto the Oglala, 
Rosebud, Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, and Fort Peck Sioux Indian 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the donations, Stevens said, the children would receive no Christmas 
gifts at all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors can bring new toys and other gifts appropriate for youngsters between 5 
and 17 years old to the Agricultural Science Building office at 6201 Winnetka 
Ave. in Woodland Hills, between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 
Shapiro said. They can also be dropped off between 6 to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The gifts can be donated until Nov. 23, he said. For further information call 
the school at (818) 347-0551. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BOY SCOUTS BEGIN HOLIDAY FOOD DRIVE

<P>
 In anticipation of the winter holidays, the Boy Scouts of America has launched 
its annual canned-goods drive to collect food for the area's homeless and 
needy, including victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh annual campaign kicked off last weekend, when West Valley Scouts 
hung tags on the doors of 30,000 area homes requesting donations.This Saturday, 
the youths will return to collect what they hope will be at least 40,000 cans 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Scout troop councils throughout Southern California will repeat the 
process in their neighborhoods over the next two weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great program for everybody," said Western Los Angeles County Scout 
spokesman Del Hanks. "It helps those in need and teaches the kids to be 
sensitive to the needs of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a massive campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, more than 1 million pounds of canned goods were gathered by the Boy 
Scouts in the greater Los Angeles area alone, Hanks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, participating councils include the Verdugo Hills Council in 
Glendale and the Western Los Angeles County Council in Van Nuys. The councils 
consist of about 6,000 and 11,800 members, respectively, and plan to collect 
food items from designated neighborhoods in both the East and West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Major portions of the Valley not covered this time will be addressed in an 
identical program scheduled for February. 
</P>
<P>
 Once collected, the food will be delivered to local distribution centers, 
where volunteers will sort the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on how to contribute to the food campaign or for 
participating distribution centers in the Valley, call (818) 785-8700. ANTONIO

 Bill Auppelee, a machinist first mate who spent three years aboard a Navy 
destroyer during World War II, will be the featured guest when Burbank salutes 
its war heroes during Veterans Day ceremonies Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Auppelee, who served on the U.S. destroyer Ralph Talbot from 1939 to 1945, 
will speak about his combat experiences.While he was a member of the ship's 
crew, which entered war duty in 1942, the Talbot shot down 20 Japanese planes, 
including kamikaze aircraft, damaged five others and covered more than 20 
amphibious landings. The Talbot earned more than 14 operational and engagement 
stars, second only to the U.S. aircraft carrier Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will include a display of World War II memorabilia and pictures, 
including Navy and women's uniforms. There also will be a flyover by a military 
air squadron during the ceremony, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "ceremony of the rose," in which the names of all Burbank veterans who 
died in World War II, Korea and Vietnam are read by the members of the city's 
World War II Commemorative Committee, also will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony begins at 11 a.m. at McCambridge Park War Memorial, at the corner 
of San Fernando Boulevard and Amherst Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be a Veterans Day ceremony at 11 a.m. Saturday at Forest Lawn 
Memorial Park in Glendale, 1712 S. Glendale Ave. STEVE RYFLE

 Tucked away in a nondescript building on a side street near the Van Nuys 
courthouse is the place for lutefisk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutefisk? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a dish made from fish found in the frigid waters off Norway that is 
reputedly so smelly that, before it can be eaten, it must be soaked for a week 
in lye to counteract its pungency. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Norwegians will tell you it's as close as the non-Norwegians who complain 
about its stench will ever get to manna from heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 (Remember however, this is Norway, a place where skimmed milk cheese is eaten 
with syrup, and where cured mutton roll, headcheese and fish pudding are not 
imaginary names of foods you made up to gross out your little sister, but 
actual delicacies.) 
</P>
<P>
 The king of this hill of strange cuisine is lutefisk, a white and 
rubbery-looking dish created by soaking cod in salt, then lye, and serving it 
with butter or cream sauce -- though the purists prefer it plain. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's more than just a stinky fish. It's a matter of ethnic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either love it or you hate it," explained Dan Kubly, a Norwegian-American 
who is president of the local Sons of Norway chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife hates it, but then again, she's Swedish -- what do they know?" 
</P>
<P>
 We were discussing lutefisk at the Van Nuys lodge of the Sons of Norway 
Norrona Chapter No. 50, where the lodge cooked up 1,300 pounds of the stuff . . 
. er . . . delicacy last weekend for the hungry sons and daughters of Southern 
California's far-flung Norwegian community. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the "love it or loathe it" attitude toward lutefisk, the dinners have 
become so popular that the lodge has had to offer the family-style meals at two 
sessions of two nights each -- one in January, one in November -- to 
accommodate the 800 to 1,000 people who show up, driving from as far away as 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish itself comes from a bit farther away: by refrigerated truck from a 
place called Mike's Lutefisk in Glenwood, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota is the home of lutefisk (pronounced "lude-a-fisk") in America, a 
place lutefisk lovers revere, the land where lutefisk reigns. A couple of years 
ago, the town of Madison, Minn., had to cancel its lutefisk-eating contest 
because no one wanted to compete any more with the guy who could eat eight 
pounds in one sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the local home of lutefisk is Van Nuys -- where outside the lodge's dining 
room last Saturday night, Kris Oeland was neatly cutting the foot-and-a-half 
lutefisk filets -- which arrived frozen in plastic buckets -- into manageable 
portions. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves helping. Been doing these dinners since he was a child. Just don't 
expect him to partake, even if he is of Norwegian blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't eat it," he said with Nordic brevity. "I cut it, they eat it." 
</P>
<P>
 The fish gets its name (literally, "lye fish" in Norwegian) because it is 
soaked in lye for 10 days (no one at the lodge knew why, though some guessed 
because it smells so bad before that), then soaked in water (to get the lye 
out?), before it is eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's placed in hot water, but "only until the water just starts to boil 
or else it gets too mushy," cautioned a cook in the lodge's crowded kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't taste good mushy," said Kubly, the others nodding in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone seemed to have an anecdote about lutefisk in their youth: One man 
said he ate it almost every day as a child. For another, it was reserved for 
Christmas Day dinners only, no matter how much he craved it. Still another 
refused to eat it, "So I got to eat hamburgers instead." 
</P>
<P>
 But people come to the dinners not just to plunk down $12 ($5 for kids) to 
stuff themselves with all the lutefisk they can eat, but also to hang onto 
ethnic traditions that hold less and less attraction for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been successful in getting the young people, the people up to age 
35," Kubly said. "When people get into their 50s, then they become more 
concerned about their heritage. Getting the young people involved is very 
difficult for our organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if there's any doubt about the importance of the dinners, it should be 
noted that the committee boasts 10 members, more than double the number on any 
of the lodge's other committees. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you serve it, they will come, regardless of rain, traffic, or natural 
disaster. Two weeks after January's earthquake more than 800 people showed up 
for the lutefisk. 
</P>
<P>
 The diners are not expected to live on lutefisk alone. There are also boiled 
potatoes, a bread that looks like a corn tortilla ("but much better," the Nords 
say) called lefse; and for those who have no interest in Norwegian fish, 
Swedish meatballs -- 350 pounds of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most spirited show up in their bunads, traditional Norwegian formal dress 
fit to wear to a wedding or funeral. Though they vary in different regions, the 
most popular at last week's dinner was a men's version consisting of a white 
shirt, a red and black vest, dark blue knickerbockers and black shoes with a 
kind of elaborate silver-looking design on the buckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the shoes, a man done up in the regalia responded: "For $200 they 
better be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Others however didn't wear bunads from their ancestral region because their 
costumes would be boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family was from Valdres," Dan Kubly said, with a trace of what seemed like 
regret. "The bunads there aren't very colorful." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year an Orange County rock band gave themselves the name Lutefisk. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to name ourselves after a disgusting food," the lead singer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woe is lutefisk.

SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT SET FOR THE WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department will have a sobriety checkpoint beginning at 9 p.m. 
Saturday and ending at 3 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint, at an undisclosed location in San Clemente, is one in a series 
in South County cities of San Clemente, Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, San Juan 
Capistrano, Mission Viejo, Laguna Hills and Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven cities were awarded a $377,620 grant by the California Office of 
Traffic Safety for the checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 With the grant money, the cities have also been running special patrols in 
which deputies are assigned to only look for drunk drivers.

MAN THROWN FROM HOOD OF TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who climbed onto the hood of another driver's truck during a traffic 
altercation was critically injured Wednesday when he was thrown from the truck 
and landed headfirst on a freeway on-ramp, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Little, 22, of Canyon Country, was driving his mini-truck on Sand Canyon 
Road in Santa Clarita when he got into a shouting match with the driver of 
another mini-truck just before 8 p.m., said Sgt. Rick Doan of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told deputies that the two mini-trucks pulled onto the Sand Canyon 
on-ramp to the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway and Little got out of his 
truck and jumped onto the second truck that then sped off, throwing Little to 
the pavement, Doan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if Little is the suspect or victim in this accident," said 
Doan. 
</P>
<P>
 Little was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where he 
was listed in critical condition, Doan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation will continue, he said. Detectives were searching for a 
lowered red mini-truck with chrome wheels, he said.

1 CLAIM AGAINST BANK REJECTED; 2 OTHERS STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Both sides claimed victory after the first courtroom battle Wednesday between 
a Santa Clarita bank and its former president who said he was fired because he 
tried to collect delinquent loans made to board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Manley, the former president, filed a $2-million civil lawsuit against 
Valencia National Bank, which he co-founded in 1987. The lawsuit seeks damages 
on three claims: He was fired because he refused to give board members 
preferential treatment on loans, board members concealed their true feelings 
about him by giving him good job performance ratings and his reputation was 
defamed by his termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge William MacLaughlin ruled Wednesday that the 
first accusation was invalid, but denied a request by the bank to dismiss the 
latter accusations as well. Manley will be permitted to modify and refile the 
rejected claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraged the fraud and defamation causes of action were, in essence, 
endorsed by the court," said Richard Howell, Manley's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell said a modified claim on the rejected accusation will be filed within 
20 days and, even if it is ultimately rejected, "I don't see this impacting our 
damages request in any way, shape or form." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lou Garasi, chairman of the bank's board of directors, said that that 
claim is the heart of Manley's lawsuit, and that it has already been rejected 
and modified once before. In addition, Garasi said Manley "has not been able to 
substantiate" the other two claims. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the next hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials said Manley was fired earlier this year because of declining 
net earnings at the bank and disagreements about his management style. They 
admit that former board members defaulted on loans worth hundreds of thousands 
of dollars, but say no current board member has defaulted on a loan. The 
current board members say the loans had nothing to do with Manley's firing.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COMPLAINTS STALL PORTA BELLA PROJECT; 
DEVELOPMENT: SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL DECLINES TO CERTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
REPORT FOR THE AREA'S LARGEST HOUSING PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The largest housing development proposal in this city's seven-year history has 
been delayed by a flurry of paperwork from residents fearing it will generate 
too much traffic, force several businesses to relocate and pose a health risk 
by disturbing toxic contaminants from a former munitions factory. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members Tuesday night declined to certify the environmental 
impact report for the Porta Bella development after receiving 101 pages of 
letters, traffic documents and other written materials from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we have a new meeting, a whole new slew of issues come in," said 
Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would really like to see Porta Bella built," Councilman Carl Boyer said. 
But he conceded that the groundbreaking for the 3,238-home project will not be 
in the immediate future. "I think the problem is, before it is to be built, a 
lot has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by Northholme Partners, the project will be on a 996-acre site 
south of Soledad Canyon Road and east of San Fernando Road, adjacent to Santa 
Clarita's proposed civic center. The plans include 1,678 single-family homes 
and 1,560 condominiums and apartments for an estimated 9,200 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Planning Commission approved Porta Bella by a 4-1 vote in 
June after 15 public hearings and more than a year of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, the project's environmental impact report was submitted 
to the council for its certification. But 20 residents -- ranging from those 
living near the site to Saugus merchants on Springbrook Avenue, where a bridge 
proposed as part of the project would travel -- said that the document did not 
address their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "My entire resources and my life are in my business," said Leonard Long, who 
owns Leonard's Molded Products. He complained that the bridge could drastically 
affect his business. "Think of how many businesses and families this will 
ruin." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Veltri, project manager for Porta Bella, said the development will benefit 
the area by improving traffic conditions through road construction, cleaning up 
toxic wastes on the site and preserving open space. He reminded council members 
that the city Planning Commission found enough merit in the project to approve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, when a project advances to a public hearing, the focus is on the 
criticism," Veltri said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I stand before you tonight, I wonder what more we can do or what more you 
might require of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Placerita Canyon resident Christopher Townsley countered that the developer 
had not addressed the specific concerns of the project's critics. "Somehow, I 
think I've heard this speech and seen these slides before," Townsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental report for the Porta Bella project is scheduled to again be 
discussed at the City Council's Nov. 22 meeting.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ELECTIONS / CASTAIC LAKE WATER AGENCY; REFORM 
CANDIDATE OUSTS 13-YEAR INCUMBENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A reform candidate has toppled the president of the powerful Castaic Lake 
Water Agency board, but two incumbents held onto their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Research scientist Randall Pfiester -- who said during the campaign that the 
board didn't do enough to make the public aware of its actions -- won 54.9% of 
the vote Tuesday to beat 13-year incumbent Mary Spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfiester, who unsuccessfully campaigned for the City Council in 1992, said he 
had not expected to win the water board race. Spring was his only opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised," he said. "I'm not sure if because there were only two people 
in my race if that was better." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfiester vowed during the campaign to have future construction projects funded 
by the agency receive public review and approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The water board has 11 members, seven of whom are publicly elected and four 
appointed by water retailers. The agency, created by the California Legislature 
in 1962, provides retailers with water from the State Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Don Froelich and Richard Green both retained their seats, beating 
challengers who also called for a more open board. Froelich defeated engineer 
Mike Kotch and civil engineer Joe Daly. Green won against water resources 
engineer Peter Kavounas and former Santa Clarita Planning Commissioner Jack 
Woodrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfiester suggested that the anti-incumbent votes were split among the 
challengers in those races. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race between first-time candidates, water engineer Richard Balcerzak 
defeated business manager Paul Belli and will take over the seat held by board 
member Stephen J. McLean, who decided against running again. 
</P>
<P>
 A major contention of reform candidates during the race was that board members 
need not have direct experience, and should not have direct ties, to the water 
industry. But Froelich said he saw the results as an endorsement of candidates 
with industry ties, noting that even those who lost still garnered a few 
thousand votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this shows people want water folks on the board," said Froelich, the 
Glendale Water Department manager. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second consecutive Santa Clarita Valley water agencies election in 
which reform-minded candidates made inroads. Activists Ed Dunn and Lynne 
Plambeck won seats on the Newhall Water District board in November, 1993.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALUMINUM STOLEN FROM AIRPLANE MAKER IS 
RECOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About half of the $2.8 million worth of aluminum recently stolen from a 
Valencia airplane manufacturer has been found at a local scrap yard, said 
authorities, who also announced Wednesday that an arrest warrant has been 
issued for a suspect in the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldon Santizo, 20, of Los Angeles is being sought for his alleged role in the 
heist during which padlocks were cut off two storage trailers containing the 
metal pieces used in tooling airplane bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there were others involved and we're looking at those 
possibilities," said Detective John Mundell of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station. "We haven't identified anybody else at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 pounds of the small, aluminum pieces of tooling taken in the 
robbery were used by Jay-Dee Aircraft Supply Co. to build the frames of cargo 
planes. Police officials estimated a scrap dealer would pay 92 cents a pound 
for the pieces. As tooling, the metal pieces are worth about 1,000 times more 
than their scrap value, said Rusty Werth, general manager of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Police traced the airplane tooling to an unspecified Los Angeles scrap yard by 
reviewing the yard's receipts, Mundell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take a stereo into a pawnshop, you fill out a pawn slip and the pawn 
slip eventually makes it to the Sheriff's Department, so we know you pawned 
that stuff," he said. "Scrap yards fill out a similar slip, which goes to the 
Sheriff's Department or LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had expected the burglar to cut up the items before selling 
them to a scrap dealer so they would be harder to trace. But Werth said his 
recovered tooling is intact except for some steel pins removed from otherwise 
all-aluminum pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy they recovered some of it and we hope they'll eventually be 
able to recover the rest of it," he said, adding that the tooling will be put 
back to use immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The heist at Jay-Dee Aircraft was the largest of about 10 burglaries at 
various businesses in the Valencia Industrial Center during the past several 
months, including four at the aircraft company. The materials taken in the 
other thefts ranged in value from $150 to $30,000, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mundell said sheriff's deputies and Los Angeles Police Department officers are 
investigating to see if Santizo would be a suspect in any of the other 
burglaries.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 187; COUNTY VOTED DECISIVELY FOR INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unequivocal message drowned out all of the speeches and the slogans and 
the public protests: Ventura County voters are fed up with illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 They said so at the ballot box, where Proposition 187 won 65% of the vote, a 
margin six points greater than the initiative gained statewide. They said so in 
every city in the county, even in Oxnard, where community leaders mounted a 
door-to-door campaign to defeat the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 And they continued to say so on Wednesday, even as the initiative was 
bombarded by a flurry of court challenges that put implementation on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a message out, a message that we can't handle this anymore," said Ted 
Wheeler, 57, leaning up against his Simi Valley hot dog stand. "We're trying to 
send a message to President Clinton that we need help with our borders." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joe Davis, a cook at Nora's Bistro in Ojai: "This is my country and I'm a 
citizen here, and I shouldn't have to support people who aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 At the River Ridge Golf Course in Oxnard, golfers and employees said they 
weren't surprised that the measure passed by such a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it passed because I didn't feel I should have to support anybody 
else," said a maintenance worker who declined to give his name. "I've got 
problems of my own." 
</P>
<P>
 From Ojai to Oak Park, from Port Hueneme to Piru, Proposition 187 rode to 
victory on a wave of voter discontent. While students went on hunger strikes 
and walked out of school to protest the measure, supporters quietly showed up 
at the polls and voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the wave of discontent struck Ventura County, it hit some people like 
a thunderbolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The passage of 187 was like a social earthquake that hit California," county 
Supervisor John Flynn said. "We don't really know all of the ramifications as 
of yet, but we do know it was a significant event." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference on Wednesday, Flynn and other community leaders who 
worked to defeat the measure scrambled to dispel fears whipped up by the 
proposition's passage. They noted that no local school, health or law 
enforcement agency will immediately enforce the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department and other local police agencies also 
said Wednesday that until more information is available, they would not comply 
with provisions of Proposition 187 that require officers to verify the resident 
status of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, county officials said that there would be no immediate move to 
deny non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 And school officials said they would take no action until the courts decide 
the constitutionality of a provision that denies public education to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Korenstein, superintendent of the Oxnard School District, said he sent 
a letter home with students explaining that point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is going to be to do nothing," Korenstein said. "We will not be 
denying children the right to attend school." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's news conference also afforded community leaders the opportunity to 
showcase efforts to get out the vote on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In three of the five Oxnard precincts targeted in that effort, voters 
overwhelmingly opposed the measure, according to unofficial results. And even 
in the two precincts where the initiative won approval, the margin of victory 
was narrow and could be reversed when absentee ballots are fully counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, voter turnout in each of the five precincts was up compared to the last 
gubernatorial election in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a call to action," said Mario Brito, head of the United Farm Workers 
union in Ventura County. "In two years, those students who walked out are going 
to be registered to vote. In two years, we'll be stronger and we'll be united." 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders acknowledge that there is much work to do. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There was no city in the county where Proposition 187 was defeated -- 
including Oxnard, Santa Paula and Fillmore, all with Latino majorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure won by more than 13,000 votes each in Thousand Oaks and Simi 
Valley, 9,095 votes in Ventura and 6,351 in Camarillo. Those numbers, which do 
not include absentee ballots, represent voter approval ranging from by 64% in 
Ventura to 72% in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must not kid ourselves," said Oxnard activist Karl Lawson, who helped 
coordinate the voter drive. "A lot of people who voted for 187 were by no means 
racist and were by no means bigots. These were people searching for solutions 
to the breakdown of our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson said the goal of the voter drive is increased participation by 2% to 3% 
a year, a target that has been hit each election the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that can be fixed with couple of years of work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Lawson and others agreed that in the end, little could have been done in 
Ventura County, and across the state, to defeat Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a sentiment shared by Steve Frank, a political consultant who 
coordinated the Ventura County campaign in support of the ballot measure. Frank 
said that despite polls that showed the measure losing favor with voters, he 
never had any doubt that it would pass in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line to this is that the scare tactics, and the lies and being 
outspent 5-to-1 didn't matter," Frank said. "The people can cut through the 
baloney and get to the truth of the matter. And on Tuesday, the people spoke."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; COUNTY SCHOOL BOARDS; 2 CANDIDATES ENDORSED BY CONSERVATIVE 
GROUPS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Candidates backed by conservative Christian groups knocked two incumbents off 
the Ventura County Board of Education, giving the board a 3-2 majority of 
trustees endorsed by the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the newcomers voiced hope Wednesday that the new board will set an 
example for school districts statewide to reverse what she called the influence 
of liberals on public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a conservative majority, I entertain high hopes of our board being a 
leader in the state in putting the brakes on what the liberals have been doing 
to our children in public schools," Angela N. Miller said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county schools trustees have direct authority only over the 17 
county-run schools and programs for disabled and troubled youths, Miller said 
she hopes that the board will set "groundbreaking precedents" for school 
trustees across the county and state. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first issues Miller may take on, she said, is a proposed sex 
education program for severely disabled students. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller beat incumbent Juanita Sanchez-Valdez and educator Jeffrey Moss for the 
seat representing Ventura. The other new trustee is Marty Bates, a Thousand 
Oaks businessman who won over incumbent Doylenne Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bates said Wednesday that he is a fiscal conservative and not part of 
the Christian conservative movement, his election bid was endorsed by the 
Southern California Christian Times and backed by a local leader of the 
religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Bates will join Wendy Larner, a conservative Christian incumbent 
representing Ojai. The other trustees are Al Rosen, who won reelection Tuesday 
in Simi Valley, and John McGarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate who embraces conservative Christian causes won a seat on the 
county's college district board. 
</P>
<P>
 Orthodontist Norman J. Nagel narrowly beat university counselor Annette B. 
Burrows in the race for the seat representing Thousand Oaks, with psychologist 
Donald W. Kingdon and attorney Donald E. Stevens placing third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four candidates, Nagel was the only one to respond to a survey by the 
local Christian Coalition that was published and distributed to churches 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Christian," Nagel said Wednesday. "I feel strongly about family 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Nagel's victory, the board of the Ventura County Community College 
District will have one less conservative voice. Nagel won the seat being 
vacated by trustee Gregory Cole. And one of Cole's biggest allies was appointed 
trustee Karen Boone, who lost Tuesday to former Ventura College administrator 
John Tallman. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone's election bid won the endorsement of the Southern California Christian 
Times, a newspaper published in San Diego and sold locally; it also listed 
Miller and Bates in its roster of Ventura County candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tallman was backed by college employee unions. He also raised more money, 
outspending Boone by 2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallman said Wednesday that his first priority will be to address the 
district's $800,000 deficit. "The first item on my list is the budget," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone was not the only school trustee in the county to be tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 In races from Oxnard to Santa Paula, a total of seven incumbent trustees lost 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Lindgren, a 22-year trustee for the Oxnard Union High School District, 
lost to challenger Robert Q. Valles. 
</P>
<P>
 And Santa Paula voters ousted former mayor Joe Bravo from the board of the 
city's elementary school district, electing in his stead librarian Dan Robles. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula trustee Ben Saiz said he believes that Bravo suffered voters' 
wrath over a failed proposal earlier this year to change the name of Glen City 
School to Joe Bravo School. 
</P>
<P>
 Other defeated incumbents are Donald G. Barnes in the Rio School District and 
Ralph Ramos in the tiny Briggs district. 
</P>
<P>
 A local representative of the California Teachers Assn. said trustee elections 
are becoming increasingly contentious as various political factions come to 
view school boards as steppingstones to higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is school boards are an area of activism for all groups, 
from . . . minority representation to the radical-extremist right," John 
O'Looney said. "It's an entry level of activism."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; COUNTY SUPERVISORS; SCHILLO, MIKELS MAY SET NEW COURSE FOR 
ISSUES FACING BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The election of Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo and Simi Valley 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels to the Board of Supervisors could set a new course for 
the county on issues ranging from trash disposal to funding for law 
enforcement, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Mikels are also expected to add strong support for a plan to 
develop a commercial airport at Point Mugu Naval Air Base and could put off a 
longstanding proposal to train county firefighters as paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to have a more action-oriented board," predicted 
Supervisor John K. Flynn, who agrees with Schillo and Mikels on a number of the 
issues. "I think this is truly going to be a problem-solving board." 
</P>
<P>
 But outgoing Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said she is not convinced that a 
proposal to build a landfill at Weldon Canyon near Ojai and another plan to 
ensure that all sales tax dollars from Proposition 172 are spent on law 
enforcement will be carried out by the new board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make promises sometimes that you can't keep," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed out that while Schillo and Mikels have strongly supported the 
Weldon Canyon landfill, Flynn -- once the dump's biggest proponent -- has 
backed off his position. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Mikels said Wednesday that they continue to support plans for a 
new county dump. But Schillo said he is willing to listen to any alternative 
plans west county residents come up with to dispose of their trash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If people in the west county want to pay more to haul their trash away, 
that's up to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two newly elected supervisors said they also remain committed to directing 
all Proposition 172 money to the county's criminal-justice system and law 
enforcement agencies, unlike the current board, which shifted some revenues to 
the county's general fund. Flynn also pledged his support to put all the money 
into public safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we made a promise to the public to do what they wanted done," Mikels 
said. "We'll just have to find a way." 
</P>
<P>
 In other issues, both Mikels and Schillo said they are not convinced that the 
county should train firefighters as paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters have proposed starting a paramedic program to improve emergency 
response times around the county. But Mikels and Schillo said they have not 
seen any studies or reports that show that ambulance response times are 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The two also said they remain committed in their support for a proposed 
commercial airport at Point Mugu. The Navy has offered to share its runway with 
the county to help reduce its operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels and Schillo said they believe a commercial airport would help boost the 
local economy by luring new businesses to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, however, acknowledged that the only way the plan will work is if the 
county is able to attract enough commercial airliners to support the airport. 
"That's the big question," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the newly elected supervisors said they were elated with their showing 
at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Semiofficial election tallies showed Mikels leading her opponent, Moorpark 
Councilman Scott Montgomery, by nearly 7,000 votes.  
</P>
<P>
 Mikels will succeed Supervisor Vicky Howard, who is stepping down after one 
term. Howard's 4th District covers Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa Rosa 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the 2nd Supervisorial District, Schillo led Thousand Oaks 
attorney Trudi Loh by 1,500 votes in semiofficial returns. Although several 
thousand votes were still uncounted Wednesday, election officials said they did 
not expect any change in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo will replace VanderKolk, who also is leaving office after one term. 
Her 2nd District covers most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Loh together spent more than $200,000 on their campaigns, making 
their race one of the most expensive in county history. Both ran aggressive 
campaigns that took on an increasingly nasty tone in the final weeks of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Loh said Wednesday that she was contemplating filing a lawsuit against 
Schillo over a newspaper ad that ran on Election Day questioning her work 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said she believed the ad and a similar mailer sent to voters in Port 
Hueneme hurt her campaign because there was no time to issue a response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it shows that if you make untrue statements about people, it can have 
an impact," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo refused to comment on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 In other county races, Thomas O. Mahon sailed to victory over challenger 
Richard Morrisset to retain his post as county auditor-controller.  
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good," said Mahon, who was appointed auditor-controller last year by 
the Board of Supervisors. "It's sort of like, 'OK, now this is mine.' I can 
stop listening to those people who kept saying, 'You were appointed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 All three newly elected officials will be sworn into office on Jan. 3.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; WEST COUNTY; GROWTH PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN COUNCIL RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard voters kept the city on a pro-growth course in this week's council 
election, bringing back an incumbent and replacing an outgoing conservative 
with another like-minded businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 But the residents of Port Hueneme chose to take their city in a new direction 
while picking three new council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Camarillo's three City Council incumbents all won reelection and 
will continue to help developers move projects. In Ojai, on the other hand, 
three incumbents were returned to office to ensure that city's slow growth. 
</P>
<P>
 These were just some of the results Tuesday in west county elections that 
involved council races in half a dozen cities, as well as special ballot 
measures and one hotly contested harbor district race. The highlights: Oxnard  
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Harbor District, which governs the Port of Hueneme, has two new 
board members: Michael Plisky, the outgoing Oxnard councilman, and Jess 
Herrera, a representative of the International Longshoremen's and 
Warehousemen's Union, which represents the port's workers. Incumbent Raymond E. 
Fosse, a retired ship captain, was also reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council level, incumbent Tom Holden will return to office and Dean 
Maulhardt will fill the seat vacated by Plisky. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden's reelection practically ensures that the council will not veer from 
its current policy of cutting city departments while trying to maintain 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to continue that line," said Maulhardt, a descendant of two of 
the county's most prominent farming families. "With Tom Holden being reelected 
easily, I think the people of Oxnard showed that they agree with that 
approach."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Maulhardt and Plisky may share similar views, their way of dealing 
with city issues -- and their council colleagues -- will probably be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is more inquiring in his approach," Jane Tolmach, a former Oxnard mayor, 
said of Maulhardt. "My impression is that Dean will be quite a bit different 
from Plisky. Plisky is very partisan." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolmach said Maulhardt is bright and interested in Oxnard's affairs, but she 
wonders if he might be a bit naive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he was for the gambling casino," Tolmach said. "I think he's an 
honest person and doesn't realize how money can corrupt a government." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to the challenges," Maulhardt said. "I know I can't 
foresee everything that will happen, but I'm going to try and be fair about 
everything." Port Hueneme  
</P>
<P>
 In a race where three longtime incumbents decided not to seek reelection to 
the City Council, Robert Turner, Anthony C. Volante and Jon Sharkey topped the 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of three new council members is expected to bring a major shift to 
the council on sensitive issues, such as a plan to build a recreational vehicle 
park near the Port Hueneme beach. It might also result in a new approach to 
sustaining the city's tiny Police Department, now funded through a utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 New council members Turner and Sharkey vowed Wednesday to join forces with 
Councilwoman Toni Young to oppose the plan to build a 144-unit RV resort, still 
subject to approval from the California Coastal Commission and subsequently the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey and Volante said they will work to find another way to fund the city's 
Police Department. The council approved a 4% utility tax last week to raise the 
annual $500,000 needed to support the city's police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme's Measure C, an advisory measure that asked voters whether the 
city should change its park and beach maintenance taxes, showed support by 
residents for leaving current assessments in place. Camarillo  
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent council members Stanley J. Daily, Charles (Ken) Gose and Charlotte 
Craven all easily won reelection, and will probably keep the city on its 
pro-development path. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were returned to the council, in part because of their united 
opposition to the proposed joint civilian and military use of an airfield at 
the Point Mugu navy base. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to pick one issue, that would be it," Craven said. "People in this 
town just don't want a commercial airport built at Point Mugu." 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue that figured prominently in the reelection of the incumbents is 
a plan to realign a one-mile section of Calleguas Creek in the city's Mission 
Oaks area to make room for a development. The City Council supports moving the 
creek, but wants to preserve its surrounding wildlife. Santa Paula  
</P>
<P>
 Voters elected two new council members -- Don Johnson, the owner and publisher 
of a local newspaper, and law clerk Laura Flores Espinosa -- along with 
longtime Councilman John A. Melton. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said owning and running the Santa Paula Times and serving as a 
councilman do not create a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has no bearing on me whatsoever," Johnson said of the newspaper's City 
Hall coverage. "I'm separating myself from those issues. I would never change 
anything in a story (about the council)." 
</P>
<P>
 But Espinosa said she is not as comfortable with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a legitimate concern because there's a potential for conflict there," 
Espinosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another issue facing Santa Paula, voters decided to continue electing their 
city clerk. Measure B, which would have allowed the City Council to appoint a 
city clerk, was rejected by a nearly 2-1 margin. Fillmore  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Brewster easily won another term, while challenger Evaristo H. 
Barajas led Councilman Don Gunderson by 18 votes with some absentee ballots 
still to be counted. Ojai  
</P>
<P>
 The three incumbents -- Steve Olsen, Joe De Vito and Nina Shelley -- all kept 
their City Council seats in a race that centered on tourism, traffic and slow 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said one of the council's first priorities will be completing a 
revision of the city's land-use plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really trying to articulate our vision of what we want our community to 
be for the next 20 to 20 years," said Shelley, who will serve a fourth term. 
Ventura  
</P>
<P>
 Two Ventura ballot measures -- one to open the city's Poli Street during 
school hours, the other to revise the Ventura charter to allow for longer 
leases on city-owned waterfront property -- were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure E, which would have opened Poli Street near Ventura High School, lost 
by a 2-1 margin. Opponents of the street's closure were mostly hillside 
residents who complained of clogging and congestion caused by the roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure D, which would have allowed waterfront leases on city-owned property 
longer than the current 10-year maximum, was opposed by 55% of voters.

McDonald and Jeff Mitchell contributed to this report.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; YOUNG ARTIST DRAWS ON HIS FAMILY TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerald Sequeira calls his art show " Mi Familia y Yo ," or "My Family and I." 
</P>
<P>
 But nearly all of the 27 paintings and sketches in the exhibit at Ventura High 
School are self-portraits of the 17-year-old artist or pictures of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just do whoever's in the house," said Gerald, who has Ventura High's first 
one-person show. "I tell them to, 'Please, stand still. Don't move so much and 
please look at the same object for a while.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His father is the most agreeable subject, Gerald said. "He always falls asleep 
when I'm drawing him." 
</P>
<P>
 But his mother rarely stays still long enough, and Gerald's three sisters are 
often not home. When no one else is around, he paints himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet his self-portraits are so diverse that they seem to portray different 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 One brightly colored painting shows Gerald in a straw hat surrounded by a 
lush, jungle-like background that resembles the artist's native Nicaragua. Some 
sketches depict Gerald wearing glasses and a somber expression. In others, he 
is without glasses and relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time Gerald looks in the mirror, he said he sees himself in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the high school senior has some starkly divergent aspects to his 
personality. Although he loves painting and drawing, which he began as a 
freshman four years ago, he also excels at math and science. He plans to become 
a mechanical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the dozen self-portraits in the show, Gerald has 12 pictures of 
his father, one of both of his parents and two of his younger sister Elisa, a 
sophomore at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 He dedicated the display to his family because, as he wrote in a statement 
posted at the show, "my art wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them." 
</P>
<P>
 His devotion to his family springs partly from the difficulties they have 
faced since immigrating here six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was an attorney who got on the wrong side of the Sandinista 
government, which was then in power in Nicaragua, Gerald said. Fearful for 
their safety, the family moved to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For their first year in the United States, the Sequeiras, who had previously 
had a large home of their own, shared crowded rental houses with other 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved to Ventura 4 1/2 years ago and now have a place of their own. But 
Gerald's father works as a motel custodian, the best job he could find. His 
mother is a nurse's assistant at a convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been hard for them," Gerald said. "They just sacrificed their own life 
for mine. I adore them for that." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY WATER SUPPLY CALLED SUFFICIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura's existing water supply is sufficient for the next 15 years, so the 
city does not have to build an expensive desalination plant anytime soon, a 
City Council committee has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee report released Wednesday recommends that city officials monitor 
the water situation in coming years, but make no long-term decisions until the 
city's normal water supply begins to fall below demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding is the product of months of debate -- and analysis of an 
engineer's water study -- by the council's three-member Utility Committee, 
composed of Councilmen Steve Bennett and Jack Tingstrom and Mayor Tom Buford. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of Ventura County, the city does not get its water from Northern 
California via a State Water Project aqueduct. Instead, Ventura's supply comes 
from Lake Casitas and ground water wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a six-year drought that prompted strict water rationing, Ventura 
residents in 1992 backed construction of a desalination plant. But the measure 
was advisory, and the City Council has not yet decided what to do about its 
long-term water problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's new findings are based on a study, which found that because of 
conservation, an increased supply from Lake Casitas and more underground water 
banking, a desalination plant was not immediately necessary. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; REINSTATEMENT OF TEACHER FACES APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura school trustees have decided to appeal a state administrative panel's 
order to reinstate a teacher accused of inappropriately touching his students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District board voted unanimously Tuesday to ask the 
Ventura County Superior Court to overturn the state panel's decision on teacher 
Bryan Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision released last week, the panel voted 2 to 1 that the district 
retain Bowman as a full-time employee and return him to his previous position 
at Blanche Reynolds School. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman has been on unpaid leave since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state panel confirmed most of the district allegations against 
the teacher -- including that he held students on his lap for extended periods 
of time and confined one girl to her chair by stretching tape across her lower 
body -- it said none of the conduct was grounds for dismissal under the state 
education code. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman's attorney has refused to comment on the panel's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board member Velma Lomax said school officials believe they have a 
good case against the 39-year-old Bowman, considering that the state panel 
upheld most of the allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the protection of the children, we have to follow every remedy that we 
can to make sure something else like this won't happen again," Lomax said. MAIA 
DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; JURY URGED TO DECIDE MAN DIDN'T KILL WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney for an Oxnard man accused of murdering his wife during a birthday 
party urged jurors Wednesday to decide that a friend of the defendant fired the 
fatal shot and later lied about it. 
</P>
<P>
 While attorney Willard Wiksell told the jury it was illogical to believe Jose 
Santos Castaneda, 26, killed his wife, Deputy Dist. Atty.Patricia M. Murphy 
asked the panel to convict the defendant of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the closing arguments, the jury deliberated briefly and is scheduled 
to continue today. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda is charged with shooting his wife, Mina, through the head moments 
after returning to a Santa Paula birthday party April 2. Murphy said Mina 
Castaneda, 25, was angry at her husband for leaving the party and was wielding 
a baseball bat when he returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant left the party after a friend, Anthony Castillo, asked for help 
in committing a robbery so Castillo would have money to buy his daughter a 
birthday present, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda could not stand it when his wife humiliated him in front of Castillo 
after the robbery, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the ultimate insult to his control," Murphy told the jury. "His 
immediate response was to demonstrate he wasn't going to put up with that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wiksell told the jury it was Castillo who pulled the trigger. Castillo was 
the one who committed the robbery while Castaneda waited in the car, and his 
claims of having returned the gun to the defendant before the shooting do not 
make sense, Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda has two prior robbery convictions. He faces a life sentence under 
the "three strikes" law if he is found guilty of killing his wife, even if the 
jury rules that the crime is manslaughter rather than murder. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY HOPES TO RESUME COMPOSTING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being ordered to shut down a composting operation because of potential 
health impacts, Ventura city officials said Wednesday that they hope to resume 
the project next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter dated Sept. 29, the county Environmental Health Division described 
the composting project at Ventura Harbor as "basically unmanaged." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also said there was no documentation indicating that required tests 
were performed or that recipients of the material knew the restrictions 
attached to its use. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the county's action, the city has notified several dozen 
commercial agricultural businesses that the material they received, which was 
made from sewage sludge, is a Class B compost. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulations list a variety of restrictions for Class B compost. It 
cannot be used on land prone to flooding or where endangered species live. Food 
crops that touch the sewage sludge mixture cannot be harvested for 14 months, 
and crops that grow below the surface cannot be harvested for 20 months. 
Animals cannot graze on the land for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Public Works Director Ron Caulkins said the city is working with the 
county to improve its operation so that it can begin producing Class B compost 
again within 30 days. The goal of the project is to find a use for sewage 
sludge and avoid sending it to a landfill. The city produces about 1,000 tons 
of sewage sludge each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Caulkins said the city is investigating the process involved with producing 
Class A sludge -- a material that requires more intensive treatment but has 
fewer restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that are operating it and our operations people are moving into 
new territory, and so there's a learning curve people go through," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; WEATHER POSTPONES MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearing the arrival of the season's first powerful storm, agriculture 
officials called off a planned Medfly malathion spraying mission over eastern 
Camarillo Wednesday, pushing back the spraying operation to Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm, which weather forecasters are calling the first significant weather 
system of the winter season, also forced officials to push back a planned 
pre-Thanksgiving application of the pesticide to Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "From everything we can see, it appears that this storm will be raining on and 
off throughout the weekend," said W. Earl McPhail, Ventura County agriculture 
commissioner. "We have very strict conditions that dictate when we fly and when 
we will not." 
</P>
<P>
 Spraying was halted Wednesday because the storm presented a 50% or greater 
chance of continued rainfall for 24 hours after the application of the bait to 
the infested 16-square-mile area of eastern Camarillo where the crop-munching 
pest was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 McPhail said another reason Wednesday's spraying was halted was because the 
storm is expected to pack winds of 20 m.p.h. to 25 m.p.h. State regulations 
require the trio of helicopters that apply the pesticide to stay grounded 
whenever winds exceed 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our limit because anything faster than that causes too much drift of 
the bait," McPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather permitting, the now-familiar trio of helicopters will lift off from 
Camarillo Airport at 9 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service meteorologist Naeemah Cushmeer said the brunt of the 
Gulf of Alaska-bred storm was expected to hit Ventura County late Wednesday 
with intermittent showers lasting throughout today.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are expecting anywhere from .75 to 1.5 inches of rain with this storm," 
Cushmeer said. "It's a very unstable air mass and we should see significant 
amounts of rain." J. E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; AIDE SAYS HIS ACTIONS WERE 
MISINTERPRETED 
</P>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A male nurse's aide charged with molesting three female patients at Simi 
Valley Hospital told jurors Wednesday that his actions were misinterpreted by 
the alleged victims, who might have been confused because they were on 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Sumner, 47, also told the jury during a statement opening his Superior 
Court trial that he is being discriminated against because female patients do 
not like men to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A nursing assistant works directly on a patient's body, whether that patient 
is male or female," Sumner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner, who is acting as his own attorney, is charged with sexually battering 
two elderly women while they were institutionalized. He also faces a third 
felony count of sexually penetrating a 31-year-old mentally disabled person 
with his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged incidents occurred July 9, Sumner's first day as a temporary 
hospital employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig told jurors that Sumner was assigned to 
care for nine patients and molested two of them: a 72-year-old woman with a 
fractured hip and a 73-year-old woman who was seriously ill following heart 
bypass surgery months before. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the women thought that Sumner was touching her on doctor's orders and 
did not report it until she heard another patient complain, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner was found in the mentally disabled patient's hospital room twice and 
was sent away because the woman's family had specifically requested that she 
not be cared for by men, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner said he went to the patient's room to answer her call light. He said he 
did not know that male attendants were not to care for the woman, whom he 
described as a flirt who was lonely and wanted to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant is the unfortunate victim of sexual, gender and racial 
prejudice," he said. "I am not guilty." BARBARA MURPHY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; GRANT TO BENEFIT SUPPORT GROUPS

<P>
 More cancer patients and their families will be able to participate in free 
support groups, under a $25,000 grant recently awarded to the Wellness 
Community in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really wonderful gift," Wellness Community Executive Director 
Suzanne Wedow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedow said the grant, from the New Jersey-based Fanny and Svante Knistrom 
Foundation, will be matched by other donations and used to build offices and 
meeting rooms at the group's facility at 530 Hampshire Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the Westlake Village space only has one room that can be closed 
off for privacy, making it difficult to schedule more than one program at a 
time, Wedow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedow said construction is slated to begin in December on three meeting rooms 
and four offices where cancer patients and their family members can discuss 
issues related to the disease and consult with psychotherapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Open since June, 1991, the Wellness Community-Valley/Ventura serves about 125 
people a week, officials said. IRA E. STOLL

 Sheriff's deputies Wednesday were investigating an accident where a car struck 
and seriously injured two Westlake High School students walking near the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Altreche, 18, of Thousand Oaks was driving south on Lakeview Canyon 
Road near the high school Tuesday evening when her car drifted to the right, 
hitting the two teen-age girls, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers were taken to Westlake Medical Center. Bahar Amirian, 17, was 
treated for a knee fracture and released. Jeanne Nilsen, 17, was treated for 
multiple head injuries and remained in the hospital late Wednesday, deputies 
said. 
</P>

 No charges have been filed against Altreche. CHRISTINA LIMA

LOCAL ELECTIONS; SIMI VALLEY; VOTERS PICK STATUS QUO IN FILLING COUNCIL SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a ringing endorsement of the status quo, Simi Valley voters filled two City 
Council seats with familiar candidates who have pledged to clamp down on crime 
and beef up the city's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller topped the seven-candidate roster, 
with nearly 30% of the vote. Incumbent Sandi Webb pulled a close second with 
25%. Miller will replace Councilwoman Judy Mikels, who was elected to the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of Tuesday's election, which include the reelection of Mayor Greg 
Stratton, bring no real change to a council known for its unity and 
consensus-building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as a ratification of what the city has been doing," said 
Stratton, whose only opponent for a fifth term was a teen-age write-in 
candidate. "Sandi and I got reelected, Judy got promoted to supervisor, and 
Paul is certainly no outsider." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still savoring the glow of victory Wednesday, Miller said his most immediate 
concerns are boning up on city planning issues and improving the Police 
Department's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the voters have sent a clear message that they want this city to 
remain a safe, vibrant place to live," said Miller, who served as the city's 
police chief for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in office, Miller said, he hopes to persuade the council to hire an 
outside consultant to analyze the Police Department's unwieldy computer system, 
which he said has been plagued with problems since its installation last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is just not working properly," Miller said. "We need to get 
someone in there who really knows about computers, so we can use this tool the 
way it's supposed to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's campaign themes of crime reduction and an improved business climate 
were echoed by the rest of the council candidates. But in a city recognized as 
the safest of its size in the country, and where the lackluster economy has 
already begun to pick up speed, these issues did little to light a fire under 
the constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a low-key race," Webb said. "We didn't have any controversies 
or screaming and yelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with hotly contested council races in Thousand Oaks and Oxnard, Simi 
Valley candidates spent moderately on their campaigns. Webb amassed the largest 
campaign chest -- about $22,000. Miller raised about $16,000 by the end of the 
last reporting period, and Stratton spent just $912. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other five council candidates, former Chamber of Commerce President 
Michael S. McCaffrey got 17.2% of the vote and Ernest W. Federer, an 
administrator at a psychiatric hospital, received 11.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping into the single digits, Planning Commissioner Dean Kunicki got 9.4%, 
computer systems manager Joseph R. Vesalga received 3.8%, and salesman Douglas 
Dubin garnered 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin, who spent less than $100 on his campaign and staged a series of 
community forums, said he was heartened by the outcome of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I came in last, we got the vote of 1,600 residents," Dubin said. 
"I think that shows that in some small way, we did have an impact."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; THOUSAND OAKS; 3 CITY COUNCIL VICTORS VOW UNITY, SAY MARKEY 
MAY SUCCEED SCHILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brushing off a vicious campaign, newly elected Thousand Oaks council members 
Andy Fox, Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah on Wednesday pledged to cooperate on 
shared priorities: stamping out crime, preserving parkland and building new 
sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their first debate, however, will focus on a far more prosaic issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after their inauguration next month, Fox, Lazar, Zeanah and incoming 
Mayor Jaime Zukowski must decide how to fill the seat to be vacated by veteran 
Councilman Frank Schillo, who will be stepping up to the Ventura County Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city could hold a special election, at a cost of about $95,000. Or, the 
new council could appoint someone, most likely the fourth-place vote-getter in 
Tuesday's election, to serve the last two years of Schillo's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to avoid a bruising battle, Councilwoman Zeanah said she would vote to 
appoint fourth-place finisher Michael Markey, even though their views often 
diverge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I am willing to give in on this one," Zeanah said. "I would like to make an 
effort to start this new council off on a harmonious foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lazar and Fox said they are also leaning toward appointing Markey to 
Schillo's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the city is tired of campaigns," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey, Fox and Lazar all received strong endorsements from one of Zeanah's 
arch-foes, retiring Mayor Alex Fiore. If all three land on the council, Zeanah 
could again wind up on the short end of many 3-2 votes, her slow-growth stance 
outgunned by more pro-business views. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth council seat could provide a swing vote on several critical cases 
coming up in the next few months, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Seventh-day Adventist Church's proposal to build a shopping mall off 
Wendy Drive in Newbury Park, part of a complicated development scheme that has 
drawn fire from environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 * The possibility of rezoning a controversial property owned by developer 
Nedjatollah Cohan at the corner of Kimber Drive and Reino Road in Newbury Park. 
Previous councils have rejected several proposed developments on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 * The redevelopment of Thousand Oaks Boulevard, which is in line for a 
spruce-up of some kind. The new council must decide whether to plant more 
trees, build more sidewalks or develop a cohesive theme for the downtown strip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the land-use decisions will almost certainly spark lively debate in the 
council chambers, other issues seem likely to generate 5-0 votes over the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Fox and Markey built their campaigns around public safety, arguing for 
more police patrols, tougher loitering laws and stronger crackdowns on local 
gangs. Zeanah and Zukowski have also pushed for the city to hire 20 new police 
officers to bolster the overworked Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With such strong consensus, all four said they believe the new council can 
seriously boost crime-fighting efforts and turn Thousand Oaks into the safest 
city in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll get done," Markey, a police detective, predicted. "We'll find the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 The new council also appears ready to seek money for new sports facilities, 
especially in the Newbury Park area. All three victors have emphasized that 
Thousand Oaks needs to provide more recreational opportunities for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the council members agree on the need to vigorously defend Thousand 
Oaks' open space. 
</P>
<P>
 While they may differ on specific proposals -- such as the still-vague concept 
of building a municipal golf course on Broome Ranch -- they have all promised 
to protect ridgelines, parkland and the greenbelt surrounding the city. 
</P>
<P>
 As they savored their election victories Wednesday, Fox, Lazar and Zeanah 
pledged to halt the bitter bickering that has marred the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can put the last four years behind us, good, bad or indifferent . . 
. and really move on to the issues," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed in creating peace, however, all candidates must be willing to 
forget the nasty campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah blasted Fox, Lazar and Markey in a campaign flyer, and was herself the 
target of a vicious attack from other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In analyzing the election results, Zeanah said she believed the negative 
campaigning against her worked. Even though she won reelection, the two other 
members of her slate finished a distant sixth and seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 But others interpreted Tuesday's results as clear rejection of mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates who most often attacked Zeanah -- financial services manager 
Michael Friedman and mortgage broker Bill Williams -- did not woo many voters. 
Friedman finished 10th, and Williams came in last. 
</P>
<P>
 And the candidate who amassed the biggest treasury also fared poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentist Greg Cole loaned himself at least $22,000 and advertised heavily on 
cable television. Still, he finished ninth -- about 100 votes behind mobile 
carwash owner Lance Winslow, who spent less than $1,000 on the campaign.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; LEGISLATIVE SEATS; NEW CONGRESSIONAL CLOUT MAY AID GALLEGLY ON 
IMMIGRATION; POLITICS: OTHER AREA LAWMAKERS WILL ALSO UNDERGO DRAMATIC CHANGE 
IN STATURE. 
</P>

<P>
 After years of publicly condemning the unchecked tide of illegal immigrants, 
Rep. Elton Gallegly is poised to become a congressional leader in the campaign 
to rewrite the nation's immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once Congress comes under Republican control next year, Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) said he may have the seniority to become the next chairman of the House 
Judiciary subcommittee on international law, immigration and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, that subcommittee has bottled up his bills to create a 
tamper-resistant green card, end automatic citizenship to illegal immigrants' 
children born in this country and other tough measures to curb illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is right," said Gallegly, who easily won a fifth term in office 
Tuesday. "If nothing else comes out of Proposition 187, there should be a 
strong message to Washington that Californians want us to deal with this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly is not the only local lawmaker elected Tuesday who will undergo a 
dramatic change in stature and clout in Sacramento or Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who apparently was reelected by 
a slender margin to represent the Conejo Valley, will enter his 10th term 
stripped of his chairmanship of a powerful House Rules subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he has no idea what to expect after spending 18 years with the 
ruling party in the House of Representatives and the preceding 14 years as part 
of the Democratic majority in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have to see how our Republican colleagues in the House deal 
with us," Beilenson said. "I'm looking forward to helping get things done, if 
I'm allowed to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he will continue to try to line up federal dollars to purchase 
more parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains. Also, he said he was enthusiastic 
about working with Gallegly, who has become a close friend, on creating a 
tamper-proof green card and other immigration-reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson held a 3,201-vote lead over Republican challenger Rich Sybert, who 
received overwhelming support among Ventura County voters in a district that 
reaches deep into the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has not conceded the race, hoping that about 19,000 absentee ballots 
yet to be counted will turn the race around. Among the absentee ballots already 
counted, Sybert won by a 5% margin, far short of the advantage he would need in 
the remaining ballots to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state Assembly next year, Ventura County will be represented by three 
Republicans who joined in the GOP tidal wave that may yet take control of the 
Assembly from Democratic Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman-elect Brooks Firestone, a Santa Barbara vintner, handily defeated 
Democrat Mindy Lorenz to claim the seat being vacated by Assemblyman Jack 
O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone flew to Sacramento on Wednesday to meet with Assembly GOP leader Jim 
Brulte and was unavailable for comment. Firestone will represent the 35th 
Assembly District that covers Ventura, Santa Paula, the Ojai Valley and much of 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), who easily won reelection over a 
UCLA student, said she hopes to become the chairwoman of the Assembly Committee 
on Public Safety, should the Assembly fall into Republican hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Boland, now the top Republican on the committee, has spent much of her time in 
Sacramento pushing to toughen sentencing laws for sex offenders and other 
law-and-order measures. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brulte appoints her chairwoman, Boland said she will make even greater 
strides to crack down on criminals, such as ending conjugal visits in prison 
for some offenders. Boland's 38th Assembly District covers Simi Valley, 
Fillmore and portions of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) easily fought off a challenge from 
Democrat Dorothy Maron, his old nemesis from his days on the Oxnard City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he only won a second term, Takasugi hopes to be considered for a 
chairmanship of some committee, if Republicans take control. "I'll be 
considered a veteran," Takasugi said. "We are being primed for some leadership 
roles." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes to make additional progress in reforming worker's 
compensation laws and toughening penalties for violent crime, and bringing back 
a new version of the controversial CLAS tests that would be acceptable to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, who defeated Republican Steve MacElvaine, said he is excited about 
replacing Gary K. Hart as a state senator. He said he plans to use his position 
to make sure Ventura County becomes the home of a four-year state university. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now with Gary retiring, I'm going to carry the ball," O'Connell said. "It's 
going to be a major priority."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; EAST COUNTY SCHOOL BOARDS; WALKER WIN MAY REKINDLE 
BIRTH-CONTROL DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The election of a conservative Baptist school administrator to the Simi Valley 
school board could rekindle a long-running debate over sex education, some 
parents said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in east Ventura County, voters in Thousand Oaks elected two 
incumbents and a challenger to fill three seats on the board, while in 
Moorpark, only one of the two incumbents was returned to office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley race, administrator and pastor Norm Walker topped a field 
of six candidates seeking two seats on the board, while incumbent Carla Kurachi 
won her bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was one of several conservative challengers in east county races who 
pushed pro-family platforms and a back-to-basics approach to education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (voters) want a voice of leadership and they also want a conservative 
on the board," Walker said. His campaign was endorsed by conservative Christian 
groups, which cited his support of traditional family values. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents said they hope that Walker will be able to persuade the board to 
change its position on birth-control curriculum, from a policy that stresses 
abstinence to one that teaches abstinence only. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might well be able to educate them," parent Coleen Ary said. "I think that 
he will be able to articulate the data better. He's just God-darn sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a year, the board has wrestled over how birth control should be 
taught in Simi Valley schools. The new board will likely inherit the volatile 
issue since it is not scheduled to consider adopting textbooks and other 
materials for sex education classes until after Dec. 13, when the new trustees 
take office, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it probably should wait until the new board member can give his 
input," said Kurachi, who has been an opponent of abstinence-only education in 
the district's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The programs that I've seen that are abstinence-based are based on fear and 
guilt," she said. "But I'm going to be open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, homemaker Elaine McKearn outpaced a field of 10 candidates, 
winning a seat on the board of the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
Incumbent Richard Newman finished second, winning a second term on the board, 
while Mildred Lynch placed third and will begin her third term. 
</P>
<P>
 McKearn attributed her win to her "family-friendly" position during the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (voters) want local control and having parents involved was a big 
factor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said reelection of both incumbents to the five-member board reflected 
an overall satisfaction with how the district is run. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the candidates readily admitted that this was a good district," he said. 
"I think the return of the two incumbents indicated that there was not 
dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to push for new middle schools and creation of a fine-arts 
magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark school board member Gary Cabriales, an airline pilot, was reelected 
and David Pollock, a corporate planner, edged out longtime incumbent Pam Castro 
for the second seat. Candidate Ted Green Sr., an auditor, finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it would be close and it was," said Castro, who lost to Pollock by 
about 245 votes. "I'm glad at least that this was a clean campaign. Mr. Pollock 
was a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark district faces a projected $1-million deficit and is embroiled in 
protracted contract negotiations with its teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cabriales and Pollock said endorsements from the teachers union helped 
put them over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (union) endorsement has historically been important," Pollock said. "It's 
an especially big deal when the teachers' contract still has not been 
resolved."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; ABSENTEE BALLOTS; DECISIONS OF 26,000 AREA VOTERS STILL 
UNCOUNTED; ELECTION: OFFICIALS HOPE TO ANNOUNCE A FINAL TABULATION BY NOV. 18. 
BUT NONE OF THE MAJOR RACES IN THE COUNTY ARE EXPECTED TO BE AFFECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County election officials still have 26,000 absentee ballots to count 
over the next 10 days and warn that some of the tightest local races could turn 
around before election results become final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of the major races are going to be affected, there is too 
much distance between them," said Bruce Bradley, the county's assistant 
registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, sometimes absentee votes can alter the final outcome. "We are 
not advising anyone to light victory cigars or open bottles of champagne just 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley hopes to issue a final count by Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 After every election, county officials caution that the results are not final 
until certified weeks later by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 And the final count has been pushed back over the years, as absentee balloting 
has grown in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials estimate that 48,000 voters cast absentee ballots this time. 
About 22,000 of those votes were tallied on or before Election Day, Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Election office staff members were unable to keep pace with the growing number 
of absentee ballots, which accounted for about 24% of all ballots cast in 
Tuesday's election. Also, an estimated 8,700 absentee ballots were dropped off 
at polling places on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Absentee ballots take much longer to count because the signature on each one 
must be matched with the signature on file with the elections office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said his staff can process about 6,000 absentee ballots a day, unless 
staff members are tied up with interruptions such as answering questions from 
the public.

COLD AND WET WEATHER ON THE WAY AS STORM SWEEPS IN FROM NORTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County may be in for a preview of winter weather for the next few days, 
with rain and much cooler temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a fairly cold storm system coming in," said Curtis Brack, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said the rain, which was expected to start early this morning, could 
linger into midday Friday, dumping more than an inch of precipitation on the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The showers, the product of a trough of low pressure from the Pacific 
Northwest following on the heels of a cold front from Central California, 
should be fairly steady through this afternoon, tapering off to intermittent 
showers, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 In coastal areas, anywhere from one-quarter inch to an inch of rain may fall, 
with more accumulation in the mountains and canyons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures today should remain in the lower and middle 60s, with 
nighttime lows in the mid-40s to lower 50s. Friday could be even cooler, Brack 
said, with highs in the upper 50s and low 60s.

COUNCIL PANEL BACKS AWAY FROM PROPOSAL FOR HOMELESS CAMPGROUND; VENTURA: 
MEMBERS DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON HOW TO LEGALLY REMOVE SQUATTERS FROM THE 
POLLUTED RIVER BOTTOM. THEY AGREE HOUSING ALTERNATIVES NEED TO BE PROVIDED. 
</P>

<P>
 Catching some homeless advocates by surprise, the Ventura City Council's 
three-member housing committee shifted support from a homeless campground idea 
Wednesday, focusing attention instead on how to legally kick squatters out of 
the Ventura River bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could we . . . start now?" Councilman Jack Tingstrom asked City Atty. Pete 
Bulens. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, who championed the idea of moving Ventura's 
river bottom homeless into a new campground throughout the spring and summer, 
was among the first to back away from the idea Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures had earlier formed an informal task force of social service providers 
and Ventura police officers to study the campground idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was set up to devise a plan for cleaning out the polluted, crowded 
river bottom while providing those who now live there with reasonable, 
alternative housing and immediate access to crucial social services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, Measures said Wednesday, she realized that the city does not 
have the money to pull off the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it now as a long-range opportunity for the city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she told her committee colleagues, Ventura needs to offer the 
homeless some housing alternatives so the city will not be sued for forcing 
them to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that we have enough services," she said, "if we don't go too far." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one homeless advocate who has worked on the campground idea issued a 
call of warning following the morning meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think it would be unwise for the city to move in this 
direction," said Clyde Reynolds, executive director of the Turning Point 
Foundation, which provides services and shelter to the homeless mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it did, I think legal action would be something that has to be 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The housing committee -- made up of Tingstrom, Measures and Councilman Jim 
Monahan -- will eventually make a recommendation on the river bottom matter to 
the full council, which will make a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, committee members said, Ventura needs to do an inventory of 
all the housing available to the homeless countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Any available funds, committee members say, should be targeted at a police 
enforcement effort that would shut off the river bottom to the homeless once 
and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, Ventura Police Capt. Randy Adams laid out a 
three-phase plan for removing the homeless from the river bottom. The first 
phase, which includes advertising available services and notifying river bottom 
residents that they must soon move out, could begin as early as January, 
Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really see this as an outreach to the homeless," she said. "I hope this 
will inspire them to want to help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney warned the council members that they could face serious 
legal challenges if they are not cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to go on a substantial enforcement mission," Bulens said, "and 
disrupt all of these homeless folks down there in the river bottom, and 
provided some facilities but not enough, I think a court would look at that 
with some degree of skepticism."

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; THE REPUBLICAN EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by Robert A. Rosenblatt, Ralph Vartabedian and Jube Shiver

 Here's how Republican control of Congress is likely to affect key parts of the 
U.S. economy and the American consumer: AEROSPACE and DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 The defense industry is likely to benefit modestly from the Republican control 
of Congress, picking up stronger support for Pentagon budgets and a quick end 
to many of the acrimonious fraud investigations into weapons programs by 
Democrat committee chairs. However, the changeover in committee leadership 
could strongly affect specific weapons programs. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who 
will lose control of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been a strong 
supporter of the Lockheed F-22 and the Northrop Grumman tri-service missile. 
Conversely, the B-2 bomber may get a new lease on life thanks to the exit of 
B-2 critic Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland) as chairman of the House Armed 
Services Committee. FINANCIAL SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
 The new leaders of the congressional banking committees will be Sen. Alphonse 
D'Amato of New York and Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa. Both are sure to aggressively 
pursue deeper probes into the banking-related Whitewater scandal. Leach is also 
concerned about the impact of derivatives in financial markets and their 
possible threat to banks and mutual funds. He also wants to accelerate banking 
deregulation, breaking down the walls between banking and securities. But 
D'Amato, who has strong ties to the New York investment community and Wall 
Street, may not go along. As a result, major new banking legislation seems 
unlikely. Both are likely to unite in opposing Clinton Administration 
regulatory efforts to aggressively expand bank lending in poor communities. 
TAXES 
</P>
<P>
 Tax cuts are likely to be a major theme for the ambitious Republican majority. 
The prospective new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer 
(R-Tex.), supports a tax credit of $500 for each child in a family and promises 
to create new Individual Retirement Accounts that could be used for education 
or health care. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), who will be the new chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee, is a strong supporter of IRAs and wants cuts in the 
capital gains tax. Both favor additional tax incentives for small business. 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Leadership changes on the Senate Commerce Committee and its crucial 
telecommunications subcommittee -- both of which had been headed by Sen. Ernest 
Hollings (D-S.C.) -- could boost the chances of a telecommunications reform 
bill passing next year. The powerful regional Bell telephone companies blocked 
such a bill this year, but Hollings' replacements -- probably Packwood at the 
full committee and Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) at the subcommittee -- are 
likely to be far friendlier to the Bells' interests. Still, telecom reform 
revolves around conflicting industry interests rather than partisan issues, so 
the ultimate outcome is anyone's guess. TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's activist technology policy, which mobilized the 
government research and development establishment to boost the competitiveness 
of U.S. industry, is likely to lose big. For example, the Commerce Department's 
advanced technology program, which funnels money to promising new technologies 
that cannot get private backing, could be eviscerated. Efforts to shift 
military research to commercial ends will probably slow. And the rhetoric about 
the information superhighway will grow less loud -- though the federal 
government's longstanding support of basic science and military research should 
remain intact. HEALTH CARE 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that the country opposes any major health legislation, Archer and 
Packwood are unlikely to push hard for change. Packwood likes cafeteria-style 
health plans, in which workers pick combinations of benefits. He and Archer 
might embrace limited insurance market reform, making it easier for small 
businesses and individuals to buy coverage. Both should favor increased 
deductions for self-employed workers buying coverage. But they are 
unequivocally opposed to any form of mandates forcing employers to provide 
coverage.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; GOP SWEEP WILL 
TAKE A BROOM TO HIGH-TECH AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's ambitious agenda to make government an instrument 
of American high-tech competitiveness will not survive the Republican takeover 
of Congress. The electoral tide that swept away Democrats is sure to capsize 
the innovation initiatives the White House so ardently championed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to assume a scorched-earth policy when the Republicans come 
in," says a rueful staffer at the National Economic Council, the White House's 
economic policy arm. "We'll have a very, very hard time." 
</P>
<P>
 That could be an understatement. America's science and technology policy is 
about to be turned upside down and face right. Newt Gingrich, who is set to 
become the Speaker of the House, had already targeted the Commerce Department's 
Advanced Technology Program in his "Contract for America" as particularly 
worthy of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the Administration's effort to transform the Commerce Department's 
National Institute for Standards and Technology into a billion-dollar venture 
capitalist will be fast-forwarded to annihilation. Republicans have long 
objected to programs in which the government even appears to be picking winners 
and losers in the high-tech marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 As their rhetoric and records unambiguously reveal, the Robert Dole-Newt 
Gingrich perception of appropriate public-private partnership is radically 
different than that proffered by Bill Clinton and Al Gore. To be sure, 
Republicans have historically been supportive of federal science and technology 
funding, but they reserve a special circle in their political hell for anything 
that remotely smacks of "industrial policy." What the White House trumpeted as 
bold investment in America's innovation infrastructure seems certain to invite 
the budgetary scalpels and machetes of the New Majority. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that Republicans will turn Gore's "information superhighway" 
into a digital dirt road -- Gingrich, for one, is quite interested in new 
media. But there should be no doubt that the New Majority has little interest 
in the sort of "universal service" and "non-discriminatory access" public 
policy issues that have dominated the Democratic discussions. More likely, 
we'll see Republicans pushing for precisely the sort of deregulatory 
telecommunications legislation they gridlocked during the last Congress -- but 
without the allegedly onerous public service obligations contained in the last 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, as co-author of the influential Bayh-Dole legislation (which 
pioneered the transfer of government-funded technology to the private sector), 
new Senate Majority Leader Dole is intimately familiar with the controversies 
and conflicts surrounding the challenge of technology transfer from government 
research institutions to the private sector. He is now superbly positioned to 
rewrite the White House agenda on public-private partnerships in high-tech 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Republican leadership practices what it ideologically preaches, 
there's little place, for example, for the Pentagon's plan to spend $500 
million over five years to help American industry capture the global 
marketplace from Japan in flat-panel display technologies. Flat-panel displays 
are a prime example of how the Clinton Administration wants to fund dual-use 
technologies -- that is, technologies for national security that have 
commercial applications and commercial technologies that have military 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the entire issue of dual-use policy faces fundamental 
re-examination. The Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency -- which has 
pioneered many breakthroughs in computer science and in effect created the 
Internet -- has more than three-quarters of its budget tied up in dual-use 
funding. In many respects, ARPA is as much a vehicle for industry as armament. 
The Administration's $550-million Technology Reinvestment Program, which is 
designed to facilitate defense conversion efforts by creating new 
collaborations between industry, academe and local governments, is sure to be 
scrutinized -- though many elements of the program enjoy bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dual use is a powerful way to get the best of both worlds," says the White 
House staffer. "In theory, everyone gets better technology. In practice, 
appropriators often consider (dual use) to be leakage to the commercial 
sector." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, dual-use technologies and defense conversion seem likely 
candidates for bipartisan cooperation. There is just as clear a need to invest 
wisely in dual-use technologies as there is to ease the trauma of transition 
from a Cold War economy to a global one. However, it seems likely that 
Republicans -- who now control the Armed Services and Defense Appropriations 
committees in both houses -- will offer their own definitions of dual use.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, don't be surprised if the New Majority pushes for greater research 
and development spending in specialized defense technologies. The defense 
weapons laboratories may have been bought a little breathing space. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the single biggest impact of the Republican takeover is 
uncertainty: Which agency or research institution can intelligently plan for 
the future with so many unknowns now a part of Washington's innovation 
infrastructure? Is Republican control a two-year aberration? Or will it be a 
structural change? What kind of a business person would enter into a high-tech 
partnership with a national laboratory under such circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
 George Brown no longer runs the House Science, Space and Technology Committee; 
Ed Markey is now subordinate in Telecommunications and Finance, and John 
Dingell's huge shadow no longer looms over the critical Energy and Commerce 
Committee. All the new players are untested. They've never led before. 
</P>
<P>
 Given this uncertainty and novelty, it's easy to predict that the political 
battles surrounding science and technology policy over the next two years will 
be far more interesting than those of the last few.

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; POWER CHANGE IS CHEERED ON WALL ST.; STOCKS, 
BONDS STABLE; MARKETS: EARLY RALLY IN THE DOW FADES, BUT ANALYSTS SEE LONG-TERM 
INVESTMENT BENEFITS FROM SHIFT TO CONSERVATISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Streeters on Wednesday mostly embraced the Republican sweep of Congress, 
although with the usual caveat that any significant payoff for the economy and 
markets will be long-term in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 And offsetting some investors' optimism about continued low inflation and 
greater deregulation under Republican rule was the fear of a newly soaring 
federal budget deficit if tax-cut fever spins out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, the dollar and foreign stocks appeared to get a boost from 
the conservative shift on Capitol Hill, and many U.S. investors said it was 
easier to identify potential winners than losers in financial markets with the 
Republicans in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, defense stocks jumped, anticipating higher defense spending. Also 
rising were health care stocks and cable TV issues, spurred partly by 
expectations of less federal meddling in those industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. stock market began the day with a bang, with the Dow industrials 
surging 38 points at the opening bell. By midday, profit taking had the Dow 
down 20 points from Tuesday's close, but it struggled back to finish with a 
1.01-point gain, at 3,831.75. Losers outnumbered winners by 12 to 10 on the 
NYSE in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, interest rates mostly eased, though they closed above 
their lows for the day. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yield dropped as 
low as 8.08% but closed at 8.11%, down slightly from Tuesday's 8.12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although financial market performance historically has shown no pattern based 
on the party in control of Congress, Wall Streeters say the electorate's 
perceived message Tuesday supported what markets generally cheer: an economy 
less encumbered by regulation and taxes, which can limit enterprise and raise 
the cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is now a reduced likelihood of government interference in business that 
would otherwise threaten to lift the long-term rate of inflation," said John 
Lonski, economist at Moody's Investors Service in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Acuff, strategist at Smith Barney, put it this way: "You are not 
going to get any new regulation out of this Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The belief that less regulation would mean continued low inflation could be 
particularly good for the bond market, after a yearlong bear market that has 
pushed interest rates up sharply, Lonski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though rates have been reacting to the strong economy, he said the Republican 
win could convince more potential bond buyers that "yields will peak at a lower 
level in this economic cycle." In theory, inflation expectations dictate the 
trend in rates over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 The great risk is that the GOP's insistence on tax cuts -- possibly including 
a capital gains tax cut, a key Wall Street wish -- could have the opposite 
effect on the bond market, analysts warned. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wall Street begins to fear that Congress will allow the federal budget 
deficit to swell again by abandoning self-imposed rules that require spending 
cuts to offset tax cuts, bond yields could rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 But many analysts doubt that most Republicans would side with a plan that 
would mean bigger deficits. In fact, Lehman Bros. analyst Thomas Gallagher in 
Washington said that "a balanced-budget amendment is likely to come up early in 
both houses, and that will affect all other decisions they make" on taxes and 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board, which has been tightening credit to slow 
the economy, could threaten to lift rates even more significantly if it 
believes Congress is getting behind a runaway-deficit plan that threatens to 
spur too-fast economic growth and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan would fight Congress tooth and nail" on 
any increase in the deficit, Acuff said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Fed official signaled Wednesday that the Fed actually expects an easier 
time with a Republican Congress. Fed Governor John LaWare told reporters that 
"one effect (of the GOP sweep) will be to make it much pleasanter" to go before 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats on key committees have harangued Fed officials over their 
tighter-credit policy. But Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), a Fed defender, is expected 
to chair the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Another side benefit of the Republicans' takeover, some experts said, could be 
a stronger dollar. The dollar has tumbled against key currencies this year, and 
Wall Street has blamed President Clinton's weak image with foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 If those investors believe the new Congress will provide the promise of 
long-term economic stability that Clinton allegedly has not, foreign money 
could pour into U.S. securities, lifting the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the dollar rose to 1.529 German marks in New York from 1.510 on 
Tuesday, and to 97.88 Japanese yen from 97.18. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the euphoria in some quarters, Salomon Bros. strategist David Shulman 
noted that many Republicans have opposed the global General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. He said Congress' failure to pass GATT would be a major blow 
to markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said that any new long-term optimism about markets will quickly 
be tempered by the reality that the Fed's program of raising rates to slow the 
economy isn't finished. The next Fed rate hike is expected Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Health issues rising included Pfizer, up 1 3/4 to 76 1/8; Merck, up 1 to 36 
3/4; Amgen, up 2 5/8 to 56 5/8, and PacifiCare A, up 2 1/8 to 71. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bullishness on defense spending lifted Lockheed 1 1/4 to 73 3/8, Northrop 
Grumman 1 1/4 to 44 1/2 and Loral 7/8 to 39 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas, London's FTSE 100 stock index surged 35.8 points to 3,099.6, and 
Frankfurt's DAX index leaped 43.03 points to 2,096.47. Traders pointed to 
optimism in the wake of the American elections.

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; THOUGH NOT AIMED AT JOBS, PROP. 187 IS 
AFFECTING WORKPLACE; IMMIGRATION: MORE COMPANIES HAVE STARTED CHECKING JOB 
CANDIDATES' PAPERS, AND EMPLOYEES TALK OF RISING TENSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For all its toughness in eliminating many public services for illegal 
immigrants, Proposition 187 says absolutely nothing about taking away their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at workplaces around Southern California, signs were already emerging 
Wednesday that the code of conduct in a labor market that has long welcomed 
low-paid undocumented workers is changing -- at least in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employers who once freely hired workers without regard to immigration 
status have started checking job candidates' papers. Workers talk of rising 
tensions among colleagues with conflicting views on such issues as immigration 
and diversity in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road, immigrants' rights advocates fear that job discrimination 
against both legal and illegal immigrants will be intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the proposition attacking illegal immigration won overwhelming 
approval from California voters Tuesday, the measure -- and the mood it 
reflects -- hit home with Chico Trana, a native of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Since entering the United States illegally two years ago, Trana had worked as 
a painter for a Woodland Hills contractor. But that ended the week before last, 
when he and two other undocumented workers on the contractor's 12-man 
construction crew were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor, Trana explained, was concerned about Proposition 187, and "he 
didn't want problems with the authorities. He said he was against the law, but 
he was also worried about what would happen if it passed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Employing illegal immigrants was outlawed by Congress in the Immigration 
Reform and Control Act of 1986, and employers began requiring job applicants to 
produce proof of their legal status. But Proposition 187 does nothing to 
stiffen penalties for firms that hire undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if jobs are available, many experts and working people alike say, the 
proposition will do little to discourage illegal immigrants from entering the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 That is especially true for undocumented immigrants who make little use of 
public services they will be denied under Proposition 187, experts add. For 
instance, many illegal immigrants working as nannies or house cleaners left 
their children behind in their home countries, and they have little to lose 
from the provision barring undocumented children from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, in parts of the informal and formal labor market, practices seem to 
be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the immigrant day laborers who gather daily along Villa Avenue in 
Pasadena said more and more of those who cruise the strip looking for gardening 
and construction help seem to be demanding proof of citizenship or permanent 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they ask for papers," fretted Victor Manuel Peneda, a 45-year-old 
illegal immigrant from Honduras whose day jobs have included moving furniture 
and painting houses. "It's already hard to find work here." 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns were also evident to catering truck driver Monica Llauger, who 
said she found herself explaining the provisions of the law to many of her 
worried customers -- both legal and illegal immigrants -- at morning stops 
around Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the talk of everybody. People are concerned," Llauger said. "They even 
tell me, 'They'll ship me back now.' " Even some with more secure jobs say the 
atmosphere at work has darkened. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co. crew worker Salvador Peterson, 49, said he got 
into an argument about the proposition with a co-worker a few days ago. "There 
is going to be more tension," said Peterson, who emigrated from Mexico in 1954. 
"Everybody is going to be divided." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are found across a vast spectrum of industries and 
workplaces in California. The best estimates on this elusive segment of the 
labor market are based on a 1989 Immigration and Naturalization Service survey 
of illegal immigrants who applied for legal residency under the federal amnesty 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures extrapolated from the survey suggest that more than 800,000 
undocumented immigrants who applied for amnesty were working in California in 
the late 1980s, scattered throughout dozens of industries. The figure excludes 
those undocumented immigrants, presumably including many agricultural workers, 
who did not apply for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employers say they have followed immigration law scrupulously all along 
and that passage of Proposition 187 won't change their employment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "What am I going to do, hire a bunch of white guys?" asked Fabian Duarte, 
manager of a Santa Ana car wash who mainly hires Latino immigrants for $5 an 
hour. "I tried that before, and none of them were willing to work for what I 
could pay them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even if Proposition 187 has little impact on hiring practices, many people 
reason that the measure will drive away undocumented workers because their 
lives will become less pleasant here. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some native-born Americans and legal immigrants believe the 
passage of the proposition could open up job possibilities for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Count Julio Smirigilio among that group. The native of Argentina said he 
supported Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you talk to Latins who have been here for years and years, they support 
it," said Smirigilio, a route supervisor for Cater Craft Foods, a large 
catering truck operator. (Times exit polling found that 23% of Latinos voted in 
favor of the measure.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are legal think it will open opportunities for them," 
Smirigilio said. "And, of course, it will." Where Illegal Immigrants Work 
</P>
<P>
 Undocumented immigrants are widely scattered through the California workforce. 
The largest numbers are employed in the restaurant industry and private homes. 
But these obvious concentrations still represent just a small proportion of 
undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants and bars: 9.0% (72,832) Private household work (cleaners, nannies, 
etc.): 5.5% (44,530) Apparel Manufacturing: 5.1% (41,004) Construction: 4.9% 
(39,590) Horticulture (gardeners): 2.7% (21,901) Other: 72.6% (582,220) 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Percentages do not add to 100% due to rounding. Data are from a 1989 
survey of illegal immigrants who applied for legal residency under the federal 
amnesty program. The sample probably understates the presence of undocumented 
agricultural workers, many of whom are not eligible for amnesty.

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; PROP. 187'S PASSAGE THREATENS TO DISRUPT 
TIES WITH MEXICO; TRADE: WHILE SOME EXPERTS DOUBT LONG-TERM EFFECTS, OTHERS 
ISSUE DIRE WARNINGS FROM MEXICO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration ballot proposal 
approved by voters, threatens to disrupt Mexico's burgeoning trade relations 
with California and spoil some of the good will generated by the passage 
earlier this year of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 While several trade experts said they doubt the measure will have serious 
long-term effects on the state's business relationship with Mexico, others 
issued dire warnings from Mexico City. The measure has already led to 
recriminations against California trade representatives, who shut down their 
office in Mexico City for the day Wednesday as a precautionary move. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also unconfirmed rumors of possible consumer boycotts against U.S. 
products, shifts of Mexican investment and trade away from California toward 
other states, and other actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the Mexican business community is very interested in trade and 
investment in California, and U.S. companies continue to be interested in the 
same thing, very much," said Reinhold C. Schrader, the state's chief trade 
representative in Mexico. But, he added, "it's an emotional issue now." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there is little evidence of changes in the state's business dealings 
with Mexico, and Proposition 187 is likely to be tied up in litigation for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't protected Schrader or other U.S. representatives from becoming 
lightning rods. When a Mexico City cabdriver found out Schrader represented 
California, he stopped the vehicle and, in terms "that you wouldn't be able to 
print," told the Mexican-born Schrader to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Schrader and California businesses hosted a reception at the state's 
first major trade exposition in Mexico City last month, not one of the more 
than 100 invited Mexican government officials showed up, Schrader said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business officials hope the fallout is limited to such symbolic gestures. At 
stake is an expected $7 billion in state exports to Mexico in 1994, a nearly 
10% increase over 1993. But with emotions running so deep, some argued that the 
economic ties are fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel U.S.-Mexican trade may well become one of (the) tragic casualties," 
said a statement from the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City, which 
represents 85% of the billions of dollars worth of U.S. investment in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 One danger, said Gil Partida, president of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, 
is that California firms will suffer when bidding on the expected plethora of 
Mexican government contracts to expand and improve roads, telecommunications 
and other lucrative infrastructure projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to be in a position as competitive as companies from Texas or 
Arizona or Illinois?" Partida asked. "It's highly doubtful." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Schrader shut down the trade office to avoid trouble, such as 
earlier demonstrations at the nearby U.S. Embassy or the vandalism Tuesday at a 
McDonald's restaurant in the Zona Rosa tourist district. There were no 
incidents Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane H. Zobrist, chairman of the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and a Los 
Angeles international trade lawyer, had been arranging a January meeting in 
Mexico City between California chief executives and President-elect Ernesto 
Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are being asked to bring people from outside California as well," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zobrist said he spent most of Wednesday calming the fears of his Mexican

won't be able to distinguish between undocumented workers and legal workers of

 On Oct. 29 and 30, Mexican consumers boycotted U.S. products in Tijuana, 
Schrader said. But Wednesday it was business as usual at one of the two Tijuana 
McDonald's, said manager Gustavo Figueroa.

 In the long run, said economist Manuel Pastor at Occidental College in Los 
Angeles, "the tight trade relations between the two countries will persist. 
Trade, even if dampened, will resume, and probably so will investment, 
particularly U.S. investment in Mexico."

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; QUACKENBUSH'S ELECTION: A STARK 
PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT; INSURANCE: THE NEXT INDUSTRY WATCHDOG IS LIKELY TO ENTER 
OFFICE WITH A MORE HANDS-OFF ATTITUDE THAN GARAMENDI. 
</P>

 California voters, who six years ago enacted sweeping reforms that gave their 
new insurance commissioner some of the nation's strongest regulatory tools, 
have elected as his successor a man who pledged to wield those tools lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Cupertino), who handily defeated state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) on Tuesday, maintains that the $2 million in 
insurance industry contributions that helped him do it will neither affect his 
independence nor make him more likely to raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Quackenbush provides a stark contrast to his predecessor, Democrat John 
Garamendi, whose term as California's first elected insurance commissioner was 
marked by bitter legal and political clashes with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 While Garamendi sees insurers as inherently untrustworthy and in need of 
strong supervision, Quackenbush -- formerly a successful businessman in Silicon 
Valley -- counts on open competition and a lighter regulatory hand to deliver 
the best deal for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Republican message -- free markets, free enterprise, individual 
initiative -- is really resonating with the people," Quackenbush said in an 
interview early Wednesday morning, when his victory was clear. "I think they're 
rejecting central government planning for the economy, across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the anti-insurer wrath that fueled Proposition 103, the 1988 
rate-cutting initiative that made insurance commissioner an elected office with 
broad new powers? 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield said Wednesday that the virtual rate 
freeze Garamendi imposed for most of his four years has reduced voter concern 
over insurance issues. "There's no longer the outrage level of 1988," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Rosenfield added, Quackenbush steered clear of most insurance issues 
during the campaign, and devoted much of his money and attention to Torres' 
legislative record, particularly on crime-related measures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Quackenbush did promise to enforce Garamendi's Proposition 103 rate 
regulations, which were affirmed Aug. 18 in a unanimous decision of the 
California Supreme Court. He also said he will reallocate Insurance Department 
staff to improve anti-fraud efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quackenbush pledged publicly to continue the work we've done, and I take him 
at his word," Garamendi said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the tradition of the department prior to my arrival was to serve the 
industry, the laws of this state require the commissioner to serve the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates were skeptical Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Shames, executive director of the Utilities Consumer Action Network, 
said he is concerned that Quackenbush, in his avowed desire to expedite the 
rate-setting process, may limit the ability of consumer groups to intervene in 
rate hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 If Quackenbush "attempts to repay the insurance industry for electing him by 
raising rates and undermining Proposition 103, we will challenge his every 
illegal move with all the tools at our disposal," Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry, meanwhile, exulted in Quackenbush's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have a better chance of getting a real hearing," Steven Goldstein of 
the Insurance Information Institute in New York City said, adding: "We support 
the consumer too, but the industry has got to make a vital profit in order to 
pay shareholders and policyholders alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the country, Republicans, who Goldstein said tend to be more open 
to industry concerns than Democrats, have won the governorships of New York, 
Texas and Pennsylvania. Those governors will have the power to appoint their 
own insurance commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication as to whether the Republican landslide in 
congressional races would improve chances for passage of the federal disaster 
insurance program that the industry favors, but Jerry O'Kane, executive vice 
president of the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of California, said the 
group's representatives were already at work Wednesday contacting key committee 
staff members to let them know the legislation is "our No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
 In defeating Torres, Quackenbush exploited a crushing advantage in television 
advertising and managed to get out a mailing to his most likely voters in the 
last weekend before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month, Quackenbush surpassed Torres in fund-raising by more than 
2.5 to 1, thanks to the tide of insurance industry contributions. Torres took 
some money from elements of the industry not regulated by the commissioner, but 
they amounted to about 10% of what Quackenbush got from industry sources that 
are regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing those contributions Wednesday, Quackenbush said: "You have to 
have money to be credible, but I raised it from thousands of people across 
California. Individual small-business people. Individual agents and brokers. . 
. . I'm not going to reject money from legitimate members of our economy who 
fulfill such an important function."

 Times Mirror Begins Debt Tender Offer: The Los Angeles-based parent of The 
Times is buying back $399.5 million of its publicly held long-term debt as part 
of its previously announced plan to merge its cable television holdings into 
Cox Enterprises Inc. If the offer is fully subscribed, Times Mirror expects to 
record an after-tax charge of $15 million, or 12 cents a share, in the current 
quarter. The company plans to buy the debt using proceeds from a private 
placement of short-term debt securities. Times Mirror said it also plans to 
redeem later an additional $100 million of 10-year notes and to make an 
exchange offer for its remaining $250 million of long-term publicly held debt.

 For the first time since before the Civil War, the number of farms in America 
has dwindled to fewer than 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The total has fallen to 1,925,300, the lowest since 1850, the year Millard 
Fillmore succeeded Zachary Taylor as President, the Census Bureau reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number peaked at 6.8 million in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are fewer farms, the just-released report from the 1992 Census of 
Agriculture said more efficient methods boosted output to $163 billion. Between 
1987 and 1992, average farm size increased to 491 acres from 462 acres, the 
report says.

FARMERS ARE LIKELY TO SEE RECORD CROPS, LOWER PRICES; AGRICULTURE: IDEAL 
CONDITIONS WILL BRING 10 BILLION BUSHELS OF CORN, GOVERNMENT SAYS.

 Farmers are expecting a record corn harvest this year, but it will probably 
mean lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Agriculture Department is also forecasting new production records for 
soybeans and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 The department predicted Wednesday that corn production will total 10 billion 
bushels, breaking the previous record of 9.48 billion set in 1992. The forecast 
was based on field surveys conducted Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The corn-growing season was ideal in most areas this year, contrasting with 
the flooding and drought that held the 1993 corn harvest to 6.34 billion 
bushels. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the latest production forecast was up 4%, or 408 million bushels, 
from the October estimate and 58% above the 1993 crop. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increase resulted in a lower price estimate for the crop: down 5 cents 
a bushel to between $1.85 and $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The department forecast a soybean crop of 2.52 billion bushels, breaking the 
previous record of 2.26 billion set in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 While the forecast was 3% above the October estimate and 35% more than was 
harvested last year, foreign purchases drove the season average price forecast 
up about 20 cents. The November forecast ranged from $4.80 to $5.50 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says corn yields are expected to average a record 138.4 bushels an 
acre, up 4.6 bushels from the October forecast and seven bushels above the 1992 
record. Yields averaged 100.7 bushels an acre in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybean yields also are forecast at a record 41.5 bushels an acre, 1 bushel 
above Oct. 1 and 8.9 bushels above a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The soybean production forecast is 65 million bushels more than the 
department's October projection. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also forecast the cotton harvest at 19.5 million bales, up 1% 
from the October forecast and 21% more than 1993. Yields are expected to 
average 695 pounds an acre, up 5 pounds from last month and 89 pounds from last 
year.

 Edison, Kenetech Sign Deal for Wind-Generated Energy: In an agreement worth 
roughly $37.5 million to San Francisco-based Kenetech Corp., Southern 
California Edison Co. has agreed to buy 37.5 megawatts of electricity generated 
from wind turbines to be erected at an as-yet undetermined site. Edison could 
also return to Kenetech for another 420 megawatts of power should demand 
increase.A larger preliminary agreement -- for 500 megawatts of power -- had 
been announced in March. Edison hopes to persuade the California Public Utility 
Commission to accept the deal in place of a PUC-mandated auction in which 
Kenetech would win contracts for 495 megawatts, more power than the utility 
says it needs. Edison said the deal delivers power cheaper than the 5-cent to 
6-cent per kilowatt power of the auction. Kenetech cited the "certainty" of the 
deal over the still-disputed auction.

 The Los Angeles County coroner's office stuck its toe in show biz Wednesday 
night. Well, make that toe tag. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "World's Funniest Commercials" featured a public service ad for the 
coroner's gift shop, which sells chalk-drawing-emblazoned T-shirts and 
personalized toe tags to raise money for its anti-drunk-driving program.The 
30-second spot shows a sheet-draped cadaver reaching out to grab a coffee mug 
from a gift shop display. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial was produced by the Richmond, Va., advertising agency Arnold 
Finnegan Martin as part of a package that included print ads and in-store signs 
with such slogans as "Shoplifter's next-of-kin will be notified." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking to do a public service ad with a new twist," said Matt Smith, 
creative director for Arnold Finnegan Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads have been donated to the coroner's office, which has no immediate 
plans to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were kind of given to us," gift shop director Marilyn Lewis said. "We 
hate to discourage something like that." Lewis said she likes the commercial, 
though she finds it "a little far out."

 The market inched up Wednesday, showing no appreciable response to a 
conservative turn by the American electorate that could affect future trade 
issues. The Bolsa index added 7 points to 2,618.94. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the market was more concerned with competitive issues involving 
phone giant Telmex. The stock jumped early in the day on rumors that AT&T was 
planning a joint venture with Telmex. But shares fell when AT&T said its 
planned telecommunications venture is with Grupo Alfa -- which could provide 
competition for Telmex. Telmex's NYSE-traded shares fell $1 to $56.

 Lockheed Sees Possible Sunnyvale Cuts: The company said that if its 
$10-billion merger with Martin Marietta Corp. fails, it plans to "accelerate" a 
reduction of its missile and space operations in the Bay Area city.Lockheed, in 
its third-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said such 
a move would require a pretax charge of about $200 million. The Sunnyvale 
plant's employment has already plunged to 12,700 from 16,750 earlier this year 
because of defense spending cuts. Lockheed said it is also considering whether 
to close its commercial jet maintenance site in Tucson, where about 80 people 
work. That move would lead to a pretax charge of less than $40 million, 
Lockheed said.

 Computer Chip Orders Fall: The chip industry's book-to-bill ratio was 0.97% 
for October, down from 1.02% in September, the first drop in almost a year, the 
Semiconductor Industry Assn. said. That means semiconductor chip manufacturers 
got just 97 cents in new orders for every $1 of chips they shipped or billed 
during the month."The October book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 breaks a 10-month 
positive streak that stretched back to November, 1993, in the monthly 
tabulation of the North American semiconductor market," the association said. 
Using data collected by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, 
the SIA said October orders were $2.91 billion, based on a three-month moving 
average. That is down from $2.97 billion in September. But orders were still 
33% higher than a year ago.

 Judge Postpones Retrial of GM Pickup Case: A Georgia state judge has 
indefinitely postponed the retrial of a lawsuit against General Motors Corp. 
alleging that poor design led to a Snellville, Ga., teen-ager's death when his 
pickup truck exploded.Proceedings had been scheduled to begin Monday in Fulton 
County State Court. In the original trial last year, a jury awarded Thomas and 
Elaine Moseley $105.2 million after deciding that their son's pickup was 
unsafe. The Georgia Court of Appeals in June reversed the verdict, setting the 
stage for a retrial.

 Lloyd's Announces Plan for Individual Investors: The London-based insurer is 
reinventing itself with a plan to allow individual investors to participate in 
the market with limited liability.For the first time, individual investors, 
known as names, can transfer their underwriting to a limited-liability 
corporation so that personal assets will no longer have to be risked in the 
troubled insurance market. Apart from 25 corporate groups, which were first

AT&T ANNOUNCES $1-BILLION PACT WITH MEXICO'S ALFA; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE DEAL 
IS A MILESTONE IN THE WAKE OF TELMEX MONOPOLY'S PRIVATIZATION.

<P>
 AT&T Corp., seeking to cash in on Mexico's appetite for better communications, 
Wednesday announced a $1-billion venture with Mexican conglomerate Grupo Alfa 
to provide business and residential phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry of the giant U.S. telecommunications company in the market is one of 
the major milestones since the telephone monopoly Telefonos de Mexico was 
privatized in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement accomplishes a major corporate priority for AT&T: to expand 
our communications service throughout North America," AT&T Executive Vice 
President Victor Pelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to spread the investment out over four to six years, largely 
ahead of a government schedule to fully open Mexico's telecommunications market 
to foreign competitors in January, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the market in Mexico to grow dramatically over the next decade, and 
this is going to require an enormous amount of capital," Pelson said at a news 
conference with Alfa executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance is one of a handful of billion-dollar partnerships announced 
since last January's launch of the North American Free Trade Agreement by the 
United States, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were early and outspoken believers in NAFTA," Pelson said, noting that 
AT&T employs 8,000 Mexicans at manufacturing plants in Mexico and has handled 
long-distance traffic with the nation since 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a rapid and ongoing overhaul, Mexico has only eight phone lines for 
every 100 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's telecommunications market has been one of the world's 
fastest-growing since Mexico's Grupo Carso and minority partners SBC Corp. and 
France Telecom bought the phone monopoly also known as Telmex. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Carso is headed by Carlos Slim Helu, a major Mexican industrialist who 
also holds a 15% stake in Grupo Alfa. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI Communications Corp., GTE International Telecommunications Inc., Sprint 
Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp. have also announced plans to enter Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the market in Mexico to grow and grow dramatically," Pelson said. 
"Right now there is room for a lot of companies in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfa Chief Executive Dionisio Garza Medina said Alfa's share of the voting 
equity would be 51% and AT&T's would be 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said the alliance would combine AT&T's range of brands, products 
and services and its reputation, technology and network expertise with Alfa's 
broad customer base and local experience in high-growth industries.

 10-Year Note Yields Soar: Yields on the Treasury notes rose in Wednesday's 
auction to the highest level in more than three years as the government 
continued its $41-billion quarterly refunding. The average yield was 7.96%, up 
from 7.33% at the last auction Aug. 10.It was the highest rate since 10-year 
notes sold for 8.07% on May 8, 1991. The notes will carry a coupon interest 
rate of 7.875% with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,942.10. A total 
of $12.1 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling $27.7 billion. The 
refunding began Tuesday with the auction of $17.2 billion in three-year notes 
and ends today with the sale of $12 billion in 37-day cash management bills.

 Kemper Corp. Attracts New Suitors: Dean Witter, Discover & Co. and SunAmerica 
Corp. have expressed interest in a deal now that Conseco Inc. has proposed a 
change in the terms of its merger agreement with Kemper, a Long Grove, 
Ill.-based mutual fund and life insurance company.General Electric Capital 
Corp., a unit of General Electric Co. whose $60-a-share offer was recently 
spurned by Kemper, has also expressed interest, the Wall Street Journal 
reported. In June, Kemper signed a merger agreement that called for Conseco to 
acquire Kemper for $3.25 billion, or $67 a share. Conseco, believing 
shareholders would reject the deal, revised its offer to $60 per Kemper share, 
which would reduce the value of the total offer by about $290 million.

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; ELECTIONS ACCENT AN UPBEAT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK; 
RECOVERY: RETURNS SEEM TO ENDORSE STATE'S PRO-BUSINESS MOVES. JOB GROWTH IS 
ACCELERATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 California's business community, accustomed to bad news in recent times, took 
a measure of comfort in Tuesday's elections, and not just because of the 
results: For the first time in decades, campaign after campaign emphasized the 
need for jobs and economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Gary Heathcote, an architect in Westlake Village. 
"It's a little bit late -- but late is better than never." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection was heartening news to business executives who 
applaud his efforts to cut red tape and make the state a more congenial 
location so that companies will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great news for people who create jobs," said Wilford D. Godbold Jr., 
president of Zero Corp. in Los Angeles. He added that "the theme transcended 
party lines." 
</P>
<P>
 The election took place at a time when California's economy confronts powerful 
forces, both helpful -- such as the expanding U.S. recovery -- and harmful -- 
such as the budget woes in Sacramento. In this mixed picture, some business 
representatives reacted to the returns with tempered optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, said Wilson's 
victory reflects strong business support, but he still worried about the 
state's "very intractable" budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even as Wilson savored victory, California's troubled economy was not 
far from his mind. The Golden State, he vowed on Election Night, would be 
expanding faster than the nation as a whole within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 That view is backed up by an assortment of analysts who believe a long-awaited 
statewide recovery is slowly gathering momentum and that continuation of 
certain pro-business policies may help to a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, California's economic future is also being shaped by worldwide 
forces beyond the domain of state policy-makers, experts said Wednesday. 
Moreover, state issues that matter enormously to the economy, such as crime and 
education, are the products of trends that have lasted many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one person is responsible for all the bads or the goods in the economy," 
said Tapan Munroe, chief economist at Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Matters of great significance, such as the conversion of defense factories to 
peacetime uses and the emergence of new, job-creating industries, are largely 
determined by free-market forces, he added, noting, "Government doesn't do 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Other important policies are set at the federal level. For instance, the 
possibility of new tax policies emerging from a Republican-dominated Congress, 
such as a cut in the capital gains rate, could boost the fortunes of 
fast-growing firms in technology, trade and other fields important to 
California, said Gary Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 On this much the analysts agree: The state has finally begun producing jobs 
again. Official government statistics suggest the increase has been extremely 
modest -- perhaps in the range of a few thousand jobs a month -- while other 
analysts put the figure in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 jobs a month. 
</P>
<P>
 An ebullient Wilson on Tuesday night cited an Oct. 18 forecast from First 
Interstate Bancorp that said California will outpace the nation in the rate of 
job growth by 1996, when the state is expected to be gaining 20,000 to 25,000 
new jobs a month. 
</P>
<P>
 California was generating 30,000 jobs monthly during the strongest periods of 
the 1980s, said Adrian Sanchez, regional economist with First Interstate. 
During the darkest days of recession in the early 1990s, the state was losing 
jobs at an average rate of more than 27,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Californians have been fighting like junkyard dogs to turn this state 
around. And you know what? You are succeeding," Wilson told supporters. 
"Unemployment is down. Investment is way up. Three times more venture capital 
came to California last year than any other state." 
</P>
<P>
 In large part, California's job-growth rate can be expected to compare 
increasingly well to the nationwide rate because California's recovery is in an 
earlier stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, business leaders and economists Wednesday cited Wilson's efforts to 
keep employers and streamline red tape as examples of policies that can have 
some helpful impact on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez cautioned, however, that "there's probably still a lot to be done -- 
and I'm sure the governor would agree." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more fundamental level, one scholar suggested that the election results 
conveyed a message that could have significant long-term effects on the 
economy: Frustrated Californians are demanding a smaller public sector, a 
solution to the state fiscal woes and a reduced tax burden, said Frank C. 
Wykoff, an economist at Pomona College. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want the federal government to do more to help the state in return 
for the enormous taxes Californians pay, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, "California could be a hell of a place to do business," 
Wykoff said. "You could have very, very positive economic growth."

business generally follows Western customs. DO 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect a small, close-knit business community. Many business people may have

</P>
<P>
 * Expect business, accounting and legal practices to be similar to, but not 
exactly the same as, those in the United States.

 * Learn about Maori (Polynesian) culture. Maoris, the aboriginal inhabitants 
of New Zealand, make up about 9% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect relative ease in making appointments.

 * Don't be too familiar at a first business meeting. Although business in New 
Zealand may be conducted in a less formal manner than in many other countries, 
most New Zealanders are generally reserved during initial contacts.

<P>
 * Don't make your schedule too tight. One meeting can lead to unexpected 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be surprised if you are invited to a New Zealander's home for dinner 
or accommodations. Business entertaining often involves attending sporting or 
social events and frequently includes spouses.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: SPOTLIGHT ON NEW ZEALAND; KEEPING A TIGHT LID ON 
INFLATION IS THE GUIDING MONETARY CREDO; CENTRAL BANK: ADHERENCE TO POLICY HAS 
BOOSTED ECONOMIC GROWTH TO ABOUT 6% ANNUALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the complex world of monetary policy, the head of New Zealand's central 
bank, Donald T. Brash, works under a relatively simple rule: Keep inflation 
under 2% or get fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reserve Bank of New Zealand abides by a unique and controversial law that 
makes controlling inflation the central bank's No. 1 priority. Unlike central 
bankers in other nations, Brash doesn't have to worry about reducing the 
unemployment rate or meeting other often contradictory economic targets. Stable 
prices are his only goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monetary policy should be targeted at a single objective: Reduce the 
inflation rate," Brash said of his marching orders. 
</P>
<P>
 His tough stance on inflation reflects the hard economic times the country 
endured during the 1980s. Spiraling prices and growing government deficits were 
choking off economic development. In the mid-1980s, the government began a 
painful process to turn the economy around by privatizing state-owned companies 
and controlling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1989 law, the governor of the reserve bank is required to keep 
inflation within a range negotiated between the government and the central 
banker. Under the current contract, the annual inflation rate must remain 
between 0% and 2% annually through 1998, when Brash's current term as governor 
ends. The government can fire Brash if he fails to meet the inflation goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to have a pretty good damn reason (to let prices rise) or I risk 
losing my job," Brash said. Inflation was running at an annualized rate of 1.1% 
during the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But New Zealand's tough inflation law is being challenged by the Alliance 
coalition, a group of five minor parties that is gaining political strength. 
The coalition wants to abolish the law as part of a plan to rebuild New 
Zealand's former socialist government policies. Relaxing the bank's tough 
policy on inflation would fuel economic growth and create more jobs, the 
Alliance argues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brash said unleashing inflation would undermine policy that has boosted 
economic growth (to about 6% annually in the local currency), stabilized 
currency exchange rates and reduced the cost of long-term borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more important social and economic objectives than (low) 
inflation," said Brash, who has served as the bank's governor since 1988. "But 
what can pushing up the inflation rate do to reduce the unemployment rate? It 
cannot reduce unemployment in any sustainable way."

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: SPOTLIGHT ON NEW ZEALAND; THE NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For trade and commerce, this tiny country of about 3.5 million people has 
traditionally dependent on Australia and Britain, from which it gained 
independence in 1947. It recently began expanding its reach, aggressively 
seeking trade ties with and investment from North America and the booming Asian 
countries. The Economy 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s and early 90s, New Zealand experienced its worst recession 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The economy has picked up in recent 
years, although unemployment was about 10% last year. The government has 
radically changed economic policy in this decade, including slashing state 
spending and dismantling what was considered one of the world's extensive 
welfare states. The government also privatized state companies, deregulated 
many industries and ended government subsidies. Agriculture 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture, including forestry, hunting and fishing, remains an important 
segment, though it accounts for only about 6.8% of gross domestic product. But 
New Zealand is a major exporter of wool and derives significant export earnings 
from meat and dairy products. Other major crops are barley, wheat, maize and 
fruit (kiwi, apples and pears.) About 10.5% of the work force is employed in 
the sector. Manufacturing 
</P>
<P>
 This sector is about 17.5% of gross domestic product with food products the 
largest category in terms of the value of goods. Wood and paper products, 
chemicals, metals, machinery and transportation equipment are among other 
strong manufacturing segments. About 17% of the work force is employed in 
manufacturing. Trade 
</P>
<P>
 New Zealand's most important trading partners are Australia, Japan and the 
United States. The three nations receive nearly half of New Zealand's exports 
and are the source of more than half of the goods entering the country. New 
Zealand is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative and is seeking to 
expand trade with Pacific Rim states in East Asia and Latin America. Labor 
</P>
<P>
 The labor force is well educated, comparable to Western standards. The 
literacy rate is 99%, reflecting compulsory schooling for children aged six to 
16. The nation has a history of active trade unions, but the National Party, in 
charge of the government in 1984 banned closed shop agreements which permitted 
workers to choose whether to join a union. Average weekly wages were about $555 
last year.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: SPOTLIGHT ON NEW ZEALAND; 
AMERICANS SHOULD FEEL AT HOME DOING BUSINESS ON THESE ISLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New Zealand, generally considered the gentle cousin to its more boisterous and 
robust neighbor Australia, is a relatively easy country for business travel 
because its customs are similar to those in the United States and the official 
language is English. 
</P>
<P>
 Though known for its scenery, New Zealand has attracted interest recently from 
foreign investors, including Americans, lured by the well-established 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting There: Auckland on the North Island is the largest city and main 
gateway to New Zealand. Air New Zealand and United Airlines both have a daily 
nonstop to Auckland from Los Angeles. Qantas Airways flies nonstops on 
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, and it has one-stop flights on Mondays and 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonstop flights last about 13 hours. A few international flights go on to 
Wellington. And from Australia's major cities you can fly nonstop directly to 
Wellington. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't need a visa for business stays of three months or less. However, you 
may need to prove that you have sufficient funds for further or return travel. 
For more information, contact the Consulate General of New Zealand in Los 
Angeles at (310) 207-1605. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money: The New Zealand dollar is based on the same dollars-and-cents system 
the United States uses. Recently, $100 U.S. bought you about $164 New Zealand. 
You can exchange money at exchange bureaus, banks or hotels. Typical banking 
hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Airport banks in the 
international arrival and departure areas are always open for exchanging money. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one case where advance work may not pay off. "It can be time-consuming 
and difficult to get New Zealand currency in the U.S.," said Kim Wong, 
marketing director for the New Zealand Tourism Board in Santa Monica. "I 
usually use my credit card and exchange a small amount of currency when I get 
to New Zealand." 
</P>
<P>
 You can conceivably get by with less cash than in other countries because 
tipping is not expected in restaurants or hotels or for cabs, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Automated teller machines are becoming increasingly common, and some now 
accept international credit cards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most establishments accept major credit cards such as American Express, Diners 
Club, MasterCard and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Around: "All our cities are a bit like downtown San Francisco," Wong 
said. The cities are compact and public transportation is plentiful. But travel 
is on the left side of the road, as in Britain and Japan. You can walk almost 
anywhere or take local buses. You'll find taxis in central cities, but it is 
not common practice to flag them down, Wong said. Travelers should get cabs at 
taxi stands or call ahead for pickup.  
</P>
<P>
 You can take shuttle buses from the airport to the main downtown hotels, said 
Dennis McKinlay, who travels frequently to New Zealand for the Los 
Angeles-based New Zealand/Australia Reservations Office. Taxis are a more 
expensive choice, costing about $32 (New Zealand) from Auckland's airport to 
downtown, $18 from the Christchurch airport to downtown and $16 from the 
Wellington airport to its metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're considering renting a car, keep in mind that it will be more 
expensive than in the United States and that credit-card collision insurance 
from U.S. credit cards won't be effective in New Zealand because rental 
agencies provide full insurance after a $600 deductible. Collision-damage 
waivers are usually available for the $600, generally for a few dollars a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who travel on business find it's not necessary to rent a car, 
McKinlay said. "It's cheaper just to take taxis." 
</P>
<P>
 Two major domestic airlines provide long-distance service within the country: 
Air New Zealand and Ansett New Zealand. Flights from Auckland to Wellington at 
the southwest tip of the North Island take about an hour. Christchurch, the 
largest city on the South Island, is another hour beyond that. Flights leave 
hourly throughout the day, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 When planning your trip, it's helpful to avoid national and local holidays, 
when shops and offices are closed. National holidays include New Year's Day, 
Waitangi Day (Feb. 6), Good Friday and Easter Monday in April, Anzac Day (April 
25), the Queen's Birthday (first Monday in June), Labour Day (the fourth Monday 
in October), Christmas Day and Boxing Day (Dec. 26). In addition, Auckland has 
a local holiday on Jan. 29, and Wellington has one on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels: All the major cities have business-class hotels with complete business 
services, Wong said. In Auckland, for example, the Pan Pacific, Regent and 
Sheraton hotels offer business accommodations.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safety: According to the U.S. State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs, 
crime in New Zealand is minimal. Foreign visitors are not typically victims of 
crime, though they occasionally report thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 For updated security information, call the bureau's information line at (202) 
647-5225. You can also obtain updated information on travel and security by 
registering with the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in New Zealand. The embassy is 
in Wellington at (64-4) 472-2068. The consulate in Auckland is at (64-9) 
303-2724, and the U.S. consular agent in Christchurch can be reached at (64-3) 
379-0040.

 Election '94: Instant analysis from the nattering nabobs of humor: 
</P>
<P>
 National: "President Clinton vowed to stay up as long as it took for voters to 
send him a clear message. He was in bed by 8:30 p.m." (Terry Heath) 
</P>
<P>
 * "The White House spin doctors are saying that the demand for change actually 
began in 1992, so people weren't really voting against Clinton on Tuesday. They 
just weren't finished voting against George Bush. (Argus Hamilton) 
</P>
<P>
 * "The President just received the latest unemployment statistics. The good 
news: The number of unemployed politicians is down to 300. The bad news: He 
campaigned for every one of them." (Hamilton) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ted Kennedy compares himself to George Foreman: It makes sense. They're 
both old, they're both overweight and they're both always hitting on someone." 
(Conan O'Brien) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Republicans haven't been this gleeful since the invention of the tax 
loophole." (Albert Perrotta) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California: "Pete Wilson's reelection was the first statewide Brown-out that 
didn't involve air conditioners." (Tony Peyser) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Analysts say Sonny Bono's election to Congress was not so much an 
affirmation of his platform as it was a repudiation of Cher's last two albums." 
(Peyser) 
</P>
<P>
 * "I'm wondering where Mike Huffington is watching the election returns -- 
from his hotel suite in Houston? Or Dallas?" (Mike Nolan/KFI) 
</P>
<P>
 * "This just in from Costa Mesa: The Huffington campaign refuses to concede 
that the Beatles broke up." (Robert W. Morgan/KRTH) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Arianna's already demanding a recount: She can't believe Mike spent $28 
million." (Michael Connor) 
</P>
<P>
 * "One reason Huffington lost is that many of his supporters were John-Roger 
followers and therefore not registered to vote in this lifetime." (Peyser) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Huffington may have lost the election, but with all this talk about an INS 
conspiracy, he did get a job with Oliver Stone." (Larry Swerdlow) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chuck and Ollie Show: "Oliver North was so disappointed, he spent election 
night in the hotel bar, drinking and playing liar's poker." (Bob Mills) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ollie lost his Senate bid because his campaign didn't have a colonel of 
truth in it." (Eric Cocks) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ironically, if Ollie had won, he would have been assigned the same seat he 
testified in." (O'Brien) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Charles Robb said he would celebrate his reelection by taking his little 
lady dancing. It wasn't known how Mrs. Robb would celebrate." (Connor) 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 And speaking of politics . . . Carlsbad reader Philip Truex recalls when his 
brother Jamie was in kindergarten back in 1918. At that time, talk centered 
around the military maneuvers being employed in France at the time. One day, as 
the boys' parents hosted a formal luncheon party, Jamie came bursting out of 
the garden and hollered:

WILSON ACTS TO ENFORCE PARTS OF PROP. 187; 8 LAWSUITS FILED; IMMIGRATION: THE

<P>
 The battle over Proposition 187 shifted quickly from the ballot box to 
courtrooms, to government chambers and the streets Wednesday as Californians, 
in a resounding Election Day mandate, ushered in a new era of stern 
restrictions against illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting immediately to put the measure he vigorously campaigned for into 
effect, newly reelected Gov. Pete Wilson issued a toughly worded executive 
order directing health care providers to discontinue prenatal services and new 
admissions to nursing homes for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of California have passed Proposition 187, now we must enforce 
it," said Wilson at a morning press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson was already encountering resistance in the form of lawsuits. At 
least eight were filed in various state and federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon, a San Francisco Superior Court judge, acting on a lawsuit 
filed on behalf of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Unified School districts 
and the California School Boards Assn., temporarily barred enforcement of the 
proposition's requirement that illegal immigrants be expelled from California 
public schools. In a separate order, the judge extended the order to public 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a federal district judge presiding over a legal 
challenge brought by civil rights groups ordered that he be notified of any 
"substantive" enforcement of the initiative prior to a court hearing he 
scheduled for Wednesday. But spokesmen for Wilson and Atty Gen. Dan Lungren 
said they will proceed in implementing the non-education portions of the 
initiative because the judge did not directly order them to halt such actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the rapid-fire developments Wednesday after the measure's overwhelming 
passage by a 59%-41% margin: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles City Council voted 10 to 3 to direct city employees not to 
follow any provisions of the measure, except its crackdown on the sale and 
possession of fake identity documents, until legal challenges have been 
completed. The council also voted to pursue any and all legal action to 
overturn the initiative, which bans illegal immigrants from government funded 
non-emergency services and requires local officials to report those suspected 
of being illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton Administration officials said they will take no "precipitous" action 
to cut off federal funding to California for health, education and social 
welfare programs, saying they prefer to wait for the results of litigation 
aimed at thwarting the measure. Analysts have said that as much as $15 billion 
in annual federal funding is at risk because the initiative's requirement on 
reporting suspects runs counter to federal confidentiality requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Religious leaders and city leaders urged the community to remain calm and 
called on parents to continue sending their children to school without fear. "I 
urge all Angelenos to ignore rumors and to continue to express their opinions 
regarding this law in a peaceful manner," said Mayor Richard Riordan. Several 
small anti-187 rallies took place, including a gathering of 200 demonstrators 
outside the Downtown Reagan State Building, but they remained peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seeking to dispel fears that the initiative could lead to a public health 
crisis, Wilson announced that he would "take whatever steps are necessary" to 
continue to provide immunizations or any other measures needed to prevent 
communicable disease. 
</P>
<P>
 As dawn broke over California on Wednesday, there was little evidence of panic 
or immediate service cut-offs among the affected population. 
</P>
<P>
 In communities from San Francisco to South-Central Los Angeles, it was 
business as usual, as illegal immigrants who work as day laborers, kitchen 
employees and at other jobs went about their daily routines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be afraid, we have to confront this issue," said Juan Carlos, 30, 
the father of three, as he waited for work outside a Homebase store in Ladera 
Heights. "It is either this or starve." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos and fellow laborers said they did not believe sheriff's deputies who 
patrol the area would enforce the proposition. Under the measure, law 
enforcement officers can only question those already arrested for other 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Police Department's South Bureau, where there has been 
nearly a murder a day this year, overworked detectives said they cannot even 
keep up with the growing roll of homicides, let alone ask arrestees for green 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have enough detectives to check on my murders. So how am I going to 
keep track of that administrative lunacy?" asked Lt. Sergio Robleto, commander 
of the bureau's homicide detail. 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of depression and introspection swept over public school campuses 
Wednesday morning, where just a week before student protests hit their peak 
with more than 10,000 young people walking out of class in Los Angeles alone. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, there were only a handful of small protests involving fewer than 
500 students and school administrators grappled with ways to help students cope 
with disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just too stunned to do anything," said Luz Castillo, a 17-year-old Reseda 
High School student who just two weeks ago organized an anti-187 walkout and 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
 There were sporadic reports of students staying home from school for fear of 
deportation or of getting injured in post-election violence. But Los Angeles 
Unified School District administrators said that a spot check of attendance 
showed it was near normal. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's efforts to blunt the impact of the law's passage 
included establishing an information hot line, sending letters home to parents 
promising that their children will not be asked for immigration documents, and 
encouraging principals to hold on-campus forums about the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Even two of the larger walkouts staged Wednesday in Los Angeles attracted 
small crowds and ended without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Hamilton High School embarked on a five-hour, eight-mile odyssey 
that took them to four rally sites on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 At Olive Vista Middle School in Sylmar, about 50 students walked out in the 
morning, but were returned to school and suspended as part of a new district 
policy, announced Monday, to treat marchers like any other truants. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at Leuzinger High School, where a Proposition 187 protest sparked a 
racial brawl Friday, early morning rumors of violence remained just that: 
rumors. Instead, by afternoon, leaders from sparring African American and 
Latino groups ran a victory lap around the campus, some arm in arm, celebrating 
a truce hammered out during meetings with district mediators. 
</P>
<P>
 At one end of the spectrum, Long Beach Unified School District has vowed to 
uphold the new law, but asked the State Board of Education to postpone its 
initial implementation from January to next September, to coincide with the 
academic calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at a news conference shortly after classes began for the day, Los 
Angeles school board President Mark Slavkin, joined by representatives of the 
California School Boards Assn., announced they were lodging an immediate legal 
challenge to the initiative in the courtroom of San Francisco Superior Court 
Judge Stuart R. Pollak. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday morning, Pollak was also considering two lawsuits filed by 
students whose illegal status jeopardizes their ability to continue to attend 
public schools and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors and opponents of Proposition 187 have agreed that a 1982 U.S. Supreme 
Court decision that granted illegal immigrants the right to a free public 
education would have to be reconsidered before the initiative's education ban 
could take effect. Pollak, in handing down his temporary restraining order 
early in the afternoon, cited that decision, Plyler vs. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are serious legal questions here, to say the least, that need to be 
resolved," said Pollak, noting that the Supreme Court ruling "seems to prohibit 
and invalidate at least portions of this measure." 
</P>
<P>
 California Deputy Atty. Gen. Stephanie Wald, representing Wilson, opposed the 
order and argued that it was unnecessary because Proposition 187's education 
provision would not take effect until January. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for the plaintiffs pointed to provisions that appeared to take 
effect immediately and warned that some schools might try to prevent illegal 
immigrants from continuing in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 They also told Pollak that Atty. Gen. Lungren had issued a memorandum 
informing school districts to implement the proposition immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak set a court date for Nov. 28 for arguments on whether to issue a 
preliminary injunction. He said he expects to postpone the eventual hearing 
until Feb. 8 if all parties agree at the next court date. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. stopped short of 
formally and immediately barring implementation of the law, as a coalition of 
civil rights groups had sought. But he strongly indicated that he wanted 
enforcement of the entire measure held in abeyance until both sides have time 
to present legal arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the court to be notified of any firm -- not rumor -- indication of 
enforcement of (the measure) in this time," Byrne said, extending the order to 
attorneys for both the state and four groups of organizations and individuals 
challenging the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the impact on individuals that I'm concerned about," Byrne told Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Jon M. Ichinaga, who was representing state health agencies and 
Wilson's office. He ordered all parties to advise him in writing "of any 
substantive" action to enforce the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Byrne said state officials may proceed with "in-house" 
preparations for enforcement of the measure without "violating the spirit of 
what I'm attempting to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit by the civil rights groups charges that the voter-approved 
initiative unlawfully intrudes on federal jurisdiction over immigration and 
denies various constitutional rights partly by encouraging discrimination 
against persons who appear or sound foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have in effect is no implementation, no enforcement of Proposition 
187," Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, told reporters after Byrne's ruling. "The judge made it very 
clear the spirit of his concern was it not be applied to individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Mark Rosenbaum, a director of the American Civil Liberties Union, 
said the spirit of the judge's order applies to all agencies with any potential 
enforcement responsibilities under the measure. "If there is any denial (of 
services) we will bring it to his attention," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ichinaga interpreted the judge's words differently. He said Byrne clearly 
implied "he would raise a concern" if the measure was enforced in the next 
week. But Ichinaga added that Byrne "did not issue an injunction against the 
state. It seems to me he basically wants to know if it is implemented, but he 
didn't make any express ruling that it shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Byrne's ruling "doesn't affect what we're doing," said Sean 
Walsh, Wilson's press secretary, late Wednesday afternoon. "Our understanding 
is the drafting of emergency regulations at the departments will go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said it was not clear how long it will take departments and agencies in 
state government to develop the regulations necessary to begin implementing the 
measure and whether any would be completed before Byrne's hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Proposition 187 contains a severability clause, some sections could 
conceivably take effect while others were still being debated in court cases. 
But legal experts say suits could tie up portions of the measure for anywhere 
from two to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 At his dramatic morning press conference, Wilson made clear that he will do 
all he can to implement as much of the measure as he can -- as quickly as he 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting today, we insist that California be a state that can set its own 
priorities," said the governor, who used the illegal immigration issue as a 
cornerstone of his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In his executive order, Wilson declared that prenatal services for illegal 
immigrants "be discontinued as soon as legally possible" and that further 
admissions to long-term care programs be granted only to legal residents. 
Later, a spokeswoman for the governor explained that the state is required to 
give a 60-day notice before ending benefits under the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor added that the funds saved by terminating prenatal care be spent 
for such care for legal residents of California. He estimated that about 1,000 
working poor women a month could take advantage of the money, which would 
amount to about $84 million a year. Long-term health care services for illegal 
immigrants cost the state about $6 million a year for the limited number of 
patients usually in care. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ballot measure stated that illegal immigrants could no longer be 
served by publicly funded hospitals and health clinics, Wilson said he has the 
duty, as governor, to protect the health of the public. Therefore, he said, he 
will order all precautions be taken "to deal with any threat of communicable 
disease, whether through immunization or quarantine or other measures." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also took pains to say that his Administration would not tolerate 
bigotry in the enforcement of the initiative. He ordered state agencies to 
prepare emergency regulations that ensure "the rights of all legal residents 
are protected and the provisions of Proposition 187 are implemented in a manner 
that avoids discrimination on the basis of national origin." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Wilson sent a letter to President Clinton, with whom he has 
repeatedly clashed over federal payments for immigration costs, asking for his 
"full cooperation and assistance" in implementing the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trust that you will agree that the people of California, having exercised 
their right as voters to enact Proposition 187, should not as a result suffer 
any loss of federal funds," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made no direct comments on Proposition 187, having been asked no 
questions on the topic at his post-election news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, following a plan agreed on before Tuesday's 
vote, said they would make no immediate decision on how to act. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government relationship with states will remain the same for 
now," an Administration official said.

 Domino's Pizza invites children 12 years and under to write a Thanksgiving 
grace that explains why they and everybody should be thankful (although the 
term grace is used, Domino's adds, what the children write need not be 
religious). Each of the first 500 children who send in letters will be rewarded 
with a coupon for a free order of chicken wings. Send to "A Wing and a Prayer," 
924 Broadway, 4th floor, New York, N.Y. 10010. Must be postmarked by Nov. 23; 
one entry per person. Boneless Muffins

 Angels are making a big comeback, and angel recipes were probably inevitable. 
"The Angel Cookbook: Heavenly Light Cusine" (Strawberry Patch: Atlanta) is by 
Diane Pfeifer, author of the C&W cookbook "Stand by Your Pan," so expect her 
sunny mixture of health food and out-of-control punning ("Lentils We Have 
Stirred on High," "Heaven Only Nachos," "Thy Kingdom Kumquat"). In book stores, 
or order by calling (800) 875-7242.

Occasion" by Patricia Corrigan (Pocket Books). It too has lots of cartoon 
angels, but not so many puns. Also in book stores. The Skinny Nanny

<P>
 People who are allergic to cow's milk are familiar with the Meyenberg brand of 
goat's milk. Now it offers a 1%-fat version -- the first low-fat goat's milk

 Right about now, if we were in ancient Athens, it would be getting toward the

AMERICA'S BEST: CONFESSIONS OF A MAIL MADELEINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Morris doesn't own a television. He hasn't set foot in a restaurant in 
years. And the only newspaper he reads is the Patterson Irrigator, a small-town 
paper out of California's Central Valley. The guy is so stuck in his ways, he's 
been making the same cookies over and over and over . . . for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris and his wife, Susan, make madeleines, those shell-shaped, buttery 
French delicacies that Proust soaked in lime-blossom tea only to unleash seven 
volumes of memories.  
</P>
<P>
 First, the Morrises made them in their kitchen and sold them locally at 
Berkeley's now-defunct Pig-by-the-Tail, the first authentic French charcuterie 
in the area. When word got around how great they were, the couple was forced to 
rent a commercial kitchen. They began selling to Balducci's in New York, Neiman 
Marcus, Nordstrom and cafes and coffee shops around the country under the 
Donsuemor Madeleines label. The company now turns out more than 80,000 cookies 
a week (Starbucks alone buys 20,000 weekly). 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though my tax forms say baker , I don't think of myself as one," says 
Morris, who previously sold hand-painted A-line skirts to I. Magnin. "I don't 
think of myself as an entrepreneur , either. That seems to imply people who do 
fancy things. I identify more with tinkerer , because I kind of tinker around 
with equipment and stuff and try to figure out how to do things more 
efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 Donsuemor Madeleines contain only five ingredients: sugar, butter, flour, eggs 
and flavoring, which Morris refuses to identify. The company recently began 
dipping some of the madeleines in chocolate. "Two of my managers got together 
and started doing it," says Morris. "I won't say that it was done totally 
behind my back. I told them, 'Do what you want,' but I'm ambivalent about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Morris can't see what all the fuss is about anyway. "For me," he says, 
"Madeleines have always been a take-it-or-leave-it kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, unleashing memories does not come cheap. At Starbucks, Donsuemor 
Madeleines cost 90 cents apiece. The best way to buy them is by the dozen for 
$4.59 at Vicente Food, 12027 San Vicente Blvd., Brentwood, (310) 472-5215. Or 
they can be ordered by the caseload from the company. Fresh madeleines keep 
nicely for about a week when stored in an airtight container, or they can be 
frozen for extended periods with no loss of flavor.

 A crowd gathered at Lunaria on Saturday, Nov. 5, for the greening of America, 
French-style."When people go to a bar in France and don't want to drink 
alcohol," explained Josseline Tamers, publisher of the French-language magazine 
Aller Simple and organizer of the event, "they'll ask for a Perrier de menthe . 
They give you a glass with some mint syrup and ice cubes and a bottle of 
Perrier. It's very green, very pretty and very refreshing. You mix it and have 
conversation. It's a ritual like tea in England."

<P>
 Not everyone was as enamoured with the minty concoction. "Sure, it's pretty," 
said one taster, "but it tastes likes Kaopectate." KATHIE JENKINS

CAKE; HOW THE CROQUEMBOUCHE CRUMBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCHUYLER INGLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My grandfather, Neal Ledgerwood, grew up in, grew old in, and died in 
Colville, a county seat in northeastern Washington state. But he was born in 
Kettle Falls, on the Columbia River, and was just a little toad when his 
father, Kit Ledgerwood, moved the family to Colville on a horse-drawn sleigh at 
the onset of winter. A drive that today takes all of 20 minutes, regardless of 
road conditions, lasted several days back then, before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Kit Ledgerwood had been a teamster in the true sense of the word, hauling 
freight in wagons back and forth over Sherman Pass. He sold insurance and took 
a turn as a butcher. When he decided he was probably going to die of 
hemorrhoids, he left the family for six months and traveled to Kansas City for 
a cure that apparently worked. 
</P>
<P>
 He found his true calling when he was elected sheriff of Stevens County. It 
was a Democratic year. He was also deputy warden at Walla Walla State 
Penitentiary at one time, probably during a Republican administration. By all 
accounts, Kit Ledgerwood was a hard man, and both his boys, Neal and Creed, had 
mean streaks in them when they hit adulthood, the sting of which I felt more 
than once. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My grandfather attended a one-room school as a child and showed promise with 
numbers and baseball from the get-go. 
</P>
<P>
 The school stood off the main road into town, at the bottom of a long hill. 
Once a week, he told me, the stagecoach would crash down the hill and all the 
children would fly to the school windows to watch it thunder past. The 
stagecoach was owned by Gilbert Ide and was pulled by two matching pairs of 
bays. I have a photo of Gilbert Ide standing in front of his coach, and it 
looks like it has just rolled out of a John Ford movie. Gilbert Ide's grandson, 
my father, married Neal Ledgerwood's youngest daughter, Joyce, my mother. They 
moved to Chicago and from that day on only returned to Colville to visit the 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to high school in Los Angeles on a campus with more buildings than 
turn-of-the-centure Colville. The only coaches to pass in front of my school 
were buses and limousines. My grandfather had retired by then, selling his 
five-and-dime store, which he had nursed through the Great Depression, in the 
face of an encroaching mall. He would spend his winters with us, living in the 
same apartment at first, then finally getting an apartment of his own and a job 
as well. He handed out tickets and took in money through his 70s at a USC 
parking lot. People and money, Neal's true calling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adolescents being what they are, I wasn't inclined to enjoy much time spent in 
the company of adults, grandfathers included. Breakfast was the most trying 
time of the day. My grandfather had the habit of talking with his mouth full, 
usually starting up in mid-thought at high volume and at high speed and, if 
Republicans were on his mind, with some of the most remarkable expletives I 
have ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been kicked in the face by a mule when he was a kid and suffered a 
repair job at the shaky hands of the local veterinarian, a man rarely sober. 
</P>
<P>
 His lip had been split open by the kick, and when the vet sutured it back 
together, he left behind a scar that pulled down one corner of my grandfather's 
mouth and, in later years, the corner of his eye on that side as well. So when 
Neal got excited and talked with a full mouth, he tended to spray. Imagine, if 
you can, a surly adolescent sitting across from a mean old man carrying on 
about God knows what, spraying masticated shredded wheat across the table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I was married, all the meanness had gone out of Neal. He seemed to 
have shrunk a little as well. He talked more and more of how things had been, 
and gradually he became unsure about who he might be talking to, or where he 
was. It was an incremental slippage, an oncoming senility that left him sweet 
and confused and finally, there at the end, completely lost in his own frontier 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 My bride's grandfather was a dozen years younger than Neal, but an old man 
just the same, a Swedish immigrant of gentle disposition. Our wedding was held 
in a back yard in Seattle on a gorgeous September day. Tamara and I had decided 
that we would approach a circle of family and friends to the tunes of a fiddle 
player, accompanied by our grandfathers, walking at their pace, arm in arm, 
four abreast. I don't think Neal had any idea what this was all about, but he 
was cheerful and pleased to be the focus of a lot of loving attention. Despite 
my adolescent years of rage, I wouldn't have had it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 A short reception for the wedding guests followed the ceremony. About the time 
everyone started looking around and fidgeting and wondering when to head off to 
the family home for the grand reception, clouds rolled in and lazy drops of 
rain the size of golf balls helped move us along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We had chosen for our wedding cake a croquembouche , an elegant, tall pile of 
choux puffs filled with delicious cream, the whole thing dribbled with caramel. 
It sat on a platter before a sunlit window draining the passersby of all their 
desires. Tamara and I were to have our photo taken standing beside the cake, 
but weddings being weddings, and photographers being photographers, it took a 
bit of time to get over to that side of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 And who should be standing next to the cake, leaning on his cane, but Thomas 
Neal Ledgerwood, stuffing the topmost choux puff into his sagging mouth. He had 
no idea what that cake was, had probably never seen the like in his entire 
life. Our hearts fell. He wasn't all that certain who we might be, but he 
obviously registered our shock and dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goddamn good cream puff," Neal sputtered, his mouth full. He projected a fine 
spray of cream filling and crumbs in our general direction. "Damn good." 
</P>
<P>
 I was quite angry with him at the time, as only new bridegrooms can be. But 
whenever I bite into a cream puff, as he would call it, I can't help but think 
of him, and love him, and see him there in that radiant sunlight on so happy a 
day, and wish he were right here right now to squeeze me so hard my breath 
flies out of my lungs, to tickle me until I am crying and begging him to stop.

CAKE; I WANT MY BABA

<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, my parents and their Italian friends threw a weekly party that 
followed the same format: laughing and talking and singing, eating, and a card 
game that lasted until 1 or 2 in the morning. They would take turns; each week 
a different couple would host the party and prepare a lavish buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 I always looked forward to the parties at our house. My father would go to 
Capri Market and buy paper-thin slices of rosy prosciutto, large rounds of pink 
mortadella with big creamy flecks of fat (which I always ate around), slices of 
sweet provolone, shiny black and green olives, and giardiniera , pickled 
vegetables. My mother would prepare lasagna, something she'd never heard of in 
Sicily but learned to make in America. 
</P>
<P>
 My father was also in charge of the drinks, which over the years evolved from 
cocktails to an easy and delicious punch made with orange juice, ginger ale, 
Champagne and strawberries. My mother served it in our big cut-glass punch bowl 
with matching little cups, and later on, in a gleaming silver punch bowl, also 
with matching cups. The punch bowl was always quite a sight, the exterior all 
misted and beaded from the icy liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The last marketing stop on the day of the party was the Gambino bakery. They 
moved their bakery around to various locations in the San Gabriel Valley. We 
were delighted when they opened in Covina, where I grew up, and sad when they 
moved again, to a town that involved a long drive. Even then, my father would 
take the time to drive there to buy Italian bread, the kind we liked with a 
sesame seed crust, and pastries: Napoleons, eclairs, cream puffs, cannoli, of 
course, and my very favorite, baba al rhum , or rum babas. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rum babas were truly special, swollen with so much rum syrup that 
another drop would probably have caused them to collapse into a puddle. I loved 
the smell, very sweet and rummy, and the shape, like a hat or a mushroom made 
out of the tenderest brioche. Hidden within the brioche was a shot of pastry 
cream and, crowning the confection, a bit of candied cherry. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the friends arrived, the house was clean, fragrant and luminous, 
the chandeliers glowing. I think we were the only people in our neighborhood 
who had chandeliers (most of the neighbors in our suburban town furnished their 
homes in Early American). We had three chandeliers, one of which was so large 
and elaborate that you had to be less than 5 feet 4 inches tall to be able to 
walk underneath it! For parties, my mother would arrange flowers from the 
garden -- camellias, calla lilies, roses -- in vases on the dining room table, 
in the living room, and in the bathrooms, where there would also be neatly 
arranged fancy towels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone would arrive -- my uncle Franco and aunt Louise, Rosie and Louie, 
Lina and Dick, Ester and Eddie, Alda and Mario, and various other friends who 
would weave in and out of my parents' lives over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew the party was in full swing when the house started to fill with 
cigarette smoke, a fragrance that in those days I associated with conviviality. 
It was a smell that made me happy. It was a smell that conjured up their 
voluble and happy conversation in Italian, a mysterious, beautiful-sounding 
language I understood only in a general sort of way, but not a word of which I 
could speak. I loved the sound of it and would listen for hours, lost in a 
happy reverie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saturday night ritual involved first socializing, with some spirited 
joking, singing of Italian songs, and drinking of punch -- not that this group 
needed punch to have a good time. They would talk about different foods they 
remembered from childhood and talk about the war, shared memories that never 
dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The buffet would be served at around 8 p.m., followed by pastries and coffee. 
By the time the pastries were brought out, I usually had managed to eat at 
least half of one very large rum baba. Something about the flavor and texture 
of the sweetened-rum-soaked brioche and the luscious pastry cream fascinated 
me. I was less interested in the napoleons, eclairs and cream puffs, but always 
in the cannoli. In a refrigerator bursting with party food and drinks, there 
would be those unmistakable pink pastry boxes, double-tied with string, wedged 
between bottles of ginger ale and trays of lasagna, impossibly difficult to get 
to, which made the rum babas that much more tantalizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then began the sometimes serious, more often comic business of playing poker, 
which would go on for hours. Looking back, it amazes me that these women, who 
also worked and had children to care for, could put together elaborate parties 
and find the energy to keep going until the early hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years I've tried to find rum babas like the ones made at Gambino's 
bakery. They never seem to have a strong enough rum flavor, or they're not 
tender enough, or the brioche isn't drenched in enough syrup. But maybe it's 
just the taste of pink punch, the sound of laughter and Italian songs, the 
coffee and smoke and late-night snacking on leftover lasagna that I'm missing.

CAKE; THE SLICER'S TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some people find great pleasure in cake decorating, and the apex of this art 
is surely the wedding cake. I have found equal pleasure, however, in 
dismantling and, so to speak, demolishing wedding cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 I still remember the day, early in my career as a banquet waitress, I learned 
how to cut wedding cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman brought a wedding cake she'd made to the country club where I worked. 
Before she would relinquish the cake to us, this woman insisted on showing us 
how to cut it. She was sick, she said, sick and tired of seeing her cakes 
mutilated by bad cutting. The most popular method at that time -- cutting the 
cake into concentric circles and then subdividing the circles into slices -- 
was ridiculous, she claimed, for several reasons: It involved a constant 
turning of the cake, each slice was cut on an angle, and it did not, as 
promised, eke the most slices from the cake. In fact, the slices tended to be 
chunky and uneven, and many broke apart -- from their own ungainliness, it 
would seem. 
</P>
<P>
 We waitresses knew what this woman was talking about, because this was the way 
our boss, the banquet manager, cut all the wedding cakes that came within her 
purview. Constant turning, countless uneven slices. In fact, the slices that 
fell from our boss' knife often looked like small piles of cake scraps, chunky 
and unappetizing. During the cake-maker's demonstration, we all avoided looking 
at our boss: Clearly, she was one of the great cake mutilators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our self-appointed teacher had a different cutting method, guaranteed to 
produce the most and most uniform slices from a round cake. Instead of cutting 
up a series of concentric circles, she divided the cake into a series of 
horizontal bands, working from the front of the cake to the back, and then cut 
them into slices. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked with a spatula in her left hand, a knife in her right. In easy 
reach was a container of hot water wrapped in a napkin. Periodically, she'd dip 
the knife and spatula in the water and scrape off excess frosting on the 
container's lip. She said if a helper was right in there, holding plates to 
catch slice after slice, you could serve cake to hundreds of people in a matter 
of minutes. No turning. No angles. Only beautiful, uniform slices that lay on 
the plate like elegant little flags.  
</P>
<P>
 This demonstration made a great impression on me -- I was taken with the skill 
and rhythm inherent in the method -- but my boss barely noticed. As a devout 
practitioner of the circular chunk-and-crumble method, she had grown 
indifferent to the appearance of her slices. She continued to perform her 
ritual mutilations on all wedding cakes that came into the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I moved to a different country club, where the banquet manager also 
reduced her wedding cakes to crumbs. This boss, however, had no particular 
attachment to cutting the cakes, and was delighted to turn the task over to me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the wedding couple made the first cut and slammed it into each others' 
mouths, I'd step in. First, I'd take the top cake off, the one with the 
figurines on it, and box it up for the couple to freeze and unpack, God 
willing, on their first anniversary.  
</P>
<P>
 After that, what I did was a form of controlled mayhem: I pulled tiers of 
cake, extricating a framework of sticky columns and flat plastic discs hidden 
under blankets of frosting. Next, I removed all the wooden dowels baked into 
the layers to lend internal strength. These dowels you had to locate and pull 
out with your fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 All this went in a messy, sticky snarl into a garbage bag under the table, 
concealed from the customers by special skirts or linen boxing. (In a few days, 
the baker or the bride's mother would come calling for this bag of unwashed 
tricks.) Once every piece of plastic and wooden scaffolding was removed, I'd 
smooth the disturbed frosting over the tops of the largest cake and begin to 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 I always had an audience -- usually a circle of excited children who staked 
out rosettes of frosting and sugar bells as if their lives depended on it. The 
first few slices, from the frosted edge of the cake, generally went to them. 
Then the servers and I swung into gear. One waitress fed me plates to fill and 
then passed them on to servers who added forks and could carry seven plates of 
cake apiece out to the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, waitressing is rarely a smooth or easy job. Between customers and 
kitchens, there are so many variables that any kind of well-oiled rhythm is 
seldom reached. Cutting and serving cakes, however, gave us a moment of 
control: We could get going so quickly and smoothly and hypnotically, it was 
often a disappointment when word came back that everyone was served.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a good day, most of my slices were beautiful little flags. But much 
depended on the crumb of the cake. The best-cutting cakes were those that were 
a few days old. The frosting could be fresh, but too-fresh cake crumbled, tore 
and otherwise refused to cooperate. Occasionally, I'd be out on the floor at 
some strangers' reception and I'd be cutting into a particularly fine specimen 
-- a dense, aromatic devil's food, a nutty homemade carrot -- and it became an 
act of self-control not to pop a chunk into my mouth or lick a swirl of butter 
cream off my knuckle. At those times, cutting cake became a kind of torment. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, however, people don't eat much wedding cake, no matter how 
beautifully it's cut -- and who can blame them? A lot of it is stale mix cake 
and sugary, whipped Crisco made all the more brackish with food dye. Often, two 
thirds of the cake we served went untouched. Wedding cake certainly lost much 
of its allure to me in the handling. By the time I retired from the banquet 
racket, I had cut close to 200 cakes, many of which were not worth tasting.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though I've stopped cutting cakes in any professional capacity, I still cut an 
occasional cake for friends who marry. I remember in particular a very 
expensive and beautiful small cake with fresh raspberries and French butter 
cream filling and whipped cream frosting. I was cutting away, exercising every 
drop of self control not to burrow into it face first, when I suddenly 
remembered that I wasn't at work. The people around me weren't customers. If I 
licked a finger, I wouldn't be fired, or even scolded.  
</P>
<P>
 My knife came to a standstill. "Sorry," I said to the line of people waiting. 
I then cut myself a beautiful, shapely, perfect slice of cake. And while other 
guests waited for their servings, I ate the whole thing. With my fingers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In reaction, no doubt, to all those wedding cakes, my favorite cakes today are 
dense, unfrosted, not-too-sweet cakes that are as good for breakfast as they 
are for dessert. Almonds give this citrus cake a good weight and subtle crunch.

CAKE; AN EARLY FROSTING

 The only aspect of the great cake taste-off at which I didn't offer a choice 
was frosting. By the time the girls got to frost little rounds of cake at the 
end of the tasting, they were in no position to be critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, there are some times when mother does know best, and when it comes to 
butter cream I've known the truth for years. The best butter cream around is in 
Nancy Silverton's book, "Desserts." It is absolutely, unequivocally luscious; a 
single teaspoon will undo a week of cruciferous vegetables, but you'll be so 
sublimely happy you won't care. The basic recipe is vanilla, but you can add 
fruit purees to it and come up with a whole rainbow of flavors. NANCY 
SILVERTON'S BUTTER CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 7 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 cups unsalted butter, well softened 
</P>
<P>
 In 2-quart stainless-steel saucepan scald milk, vanilla bean and 1/2 cup 
sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in electric mixer or with wire whisk, beat egg yolks with remaining 
sugar until mixture is thick and pale-yellow and forms ribbon when beater is 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour about 1/3 of hot milk into egg yolks, whisking constantly. Return mixture 
to saucepan to combine with remaining milk. Cook over high heat, whisking 
constantly. Stop whisking briefly as soon as mixture reaches boiling point, to 
allow it to bubble. Strain through fine-mesh strainer back into mixing bowl and 
beat on medium speed until mixture is thick, mousse-like and doubled in volume. 
Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Using paddle attachment of electric mixer, beat butter on medium-high speed 
until it whitens, holds soft peaks and makes slapping noise against sides of 
bowl, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour egg yolk mixture down side of bowl into butter in 
steady stream, beating continuously on medium speed. Mixture may separate but 
will recombine as you continue beating. Beat until underside of bowl is cool 
and butter cream is smooth and shiny. Butter cream can be used immediately or 
can be kept refrigerated up to 10 days or frozen up to 3 months. Makes 1 quart 
butter cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 1/4-cup serving contains about:

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: A SENSE OF HUMMUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marouch is probably the best-known Middle Eastern restaurant in Los Angeles, 
an East Hollywood mini-mall storefront with a clean '80s look, TV sets blaring 
belly-dance videos and large photographs of cedars plastered in niches. 
Mercedes Benzes and stretch Rolls-Royces mingle with primer-colored B-210s in 
the parking lot out front -- the prices are what the kind of people who have 
too much money (but not the rest of us) call "practically free." If you go to 
parties in Silver Lake a lot, you've probably eaten Marouch's rice-stuffed 
grape leaves and baba gannouj (eggplant dip) a few more times than you realize. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, I suppose, I stopped by Marouch at least twice a week: 
mid-mornings for a piece of baklava and a thimbleful of Turkish coffee, late 
afternoons for a bowl of dense lentil soup, Tuesday nights for the special 
stuffed eggplant, Thursdays for baked kibbeh . When I didn't feel like cooking, 
sometimes I'd take home a whole roasted chicken, wrapped like a giant burrito 
in a soft, oil-stained sheet of the Armenian bread lavash and accompanied by a 
white, blindingly powerful garlic sauce that had the consistency of mashed 
potatoes. If you sat down for just a Lebanese beer, the waiter brought out a 
plate of carrot sticks and soaked almonds to nibble with your tiny bottle of 
Almaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the whirling towers of beef on the shawarma spits, the crisp-skinned 
quail on the charcoal grill and the platters of pounded raw veal, Marouch's 
salad-heavy menu is vegan-friendly, making the restaurant one of the best 
places in Los Angeles to go for lunch with somebody who doesn't eat meat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years there started to appear plush places with a dozen kinds 
of hummus and Casey Kasem as a steady customer -- Middle Eastern grills more 
specifically Moroccan or Russian-Armenian than Marouch's familiar 
Lebanese-Armenian blend -- and it has been a long time since anybody I know has 
been a regular. But maybe the problem was overfamiliarity: Marouch is as good 
as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Order the meza , essentially a combination dinner consisting of everything on 
the left side of the menu, and out comes smooth, cool hummus , dressed with a 
splash of olive oil and garnished with a pine nut or two; the tart Lebanese 
thickened-yogurt "cheese" labneh garnished with sprigs of mint; the pounded 
paste of veal and bulgar wheat kibbeh served both raw, as kind of a Lebanese 
steak tartare, and formed into vaguely Sputnik-shaped capsules and deep-fried 
around a ground-beef forcemeat. The bitter, herbal bite of tabbouleh , chopped 
parsley tossed with soft kernels of bulgur, is sharp contrast to the richness 
of baba gannouj , essentially hummus with roasted eggplant in place of the 
garbanzo puree, or the earthy power of the fava stew fool . Fattoush , the best 
version in town, is a salad of sweet peppers, onions and tomatoes, spiked with 
crunchy chips of toasted pita bread, sprinkled with tart ground sumac berries 
and tossed with a lemony vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Sujuk are pretty good here -- sliced, fried Armenian sausages flavored with 
cumin and hot pepper -- but I'd been to Marouch maybe a hundred times before I 
discovered the wonder known as makanek : fat little beef links half the size of 
your thumb, sweetly seasoned with cinnamon and cloves, crisped in a frying pan 
and served in a ceramic bowl of lemon and oil, pretty much everything you hope 
for when you order an unfamiliar sausage.  
</P>
<P>
 On the meza there are turnovers stuffed with tart spinach puree and fried 
pastry rectangles; borek stuffed with cheese; hot-pink pickled turnips and 
chile-red slices of the cured beef basturma . It can be overwhelming facing 
down a dozen plates of food and realizing that grilled quail, kebabs, stuffed 
lamb shank may be yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The best dessert at Marouch is a tricky, soft pastry available only at Easter, 
but there is rice pudding that tastes like a rosewater-sweetened version of 
panna cotta , and knafeh , what a waiter describes as "cheesecake" . . . a 
square of syrup-soaked pound cake sitting on a lake of salty melted cheese. 
Even at a restaurant as familiar as Marouch, it is possible to be surprised.

BACK TO BASICS: CAKE; THE PERFECT ANGEL FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel food belongs to the family of foam cakes -- those that depend on a 
beaten egg foam for leavening, rather than an agent such as baking powder. It's 
not surprising, then, that preparation of the egg whites is crucial to the 
success of this delicately textured and flavored cake. The goal when beating 
the whites is to trap air within the walls of the protein, so they reach 
maximum volume. There are several keys to doing this successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, use a bowl made of unlined copper, stainless steel, ceramic or 
glass. Not recommended are aluminum, which will tint the egg whites gray, and 
plastic, because with plastic it's almost impossible to remove the traces of 
fat that have accumulated from previous uses. (Fat prevents the whites from 
reaching full volume.) 
</P>
<P>
 A deep, round-bottomed bowl is the best shape. It must be large enough for the 
egg whites to expand six or seven times their original volume. The bowls and 
beaters must be absolutely clean and free of fat and moisture for the egg 
whites to whip properly. 
</P>
<P>
 The eggs should be separated while still cold from the refrigerator, then set 
aside for about an hour before beating, until they reach room temperature (65 
to 75 degrees). Care must be taken when separating the eggs because the whites 
won't whip if even a speck of yolk is present. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts claim you get better volume if egg whites are beaten by hand with 
a balloon whisk in an unlined copper bowl because the acidity of the metal 
helps the whites to rise and then retain their stability. This may be true, but 
beating them in a stainless-steel or glass bowl, with a small amount of cream 
of tartar to supply the acidity, is a lot easier on the cook. We'll let you 
decide. CLASSIC METHOD 
</P>
<P>
 Before each use, the copper bowl needs to be cleaned with salt slightly 
moistened with white vinegar. Scrub the inside thoroughly with this mixture, 
using a sponge or soft cloth. Rinse with hot water and dry thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bowl cools to room temperature, add the egg whites and begin beating 
with a balloon whisk in a slow, circular motion. Bring the whisk down on the 
far side of the bowl and up toward you. 
</P>
<P>
 First the whites will lose their yellowish translucence and appear bubbly, but 
still be very fluid. As they begin to whip, increase the speed and beat in a 
figure-eight motion -- down the middle of the bowl, under and up one side, then 
down and away toward the opposite side. 
</P>
<P>
 When peaks form but fold over if you lift the beaters, begin adding sugar 
(Step 1). Continue beating until stiff peaks form and a rubber spatula pulled 
through the bowl leaves a trough (Step 2). ELECTRIC MIXER METHOD 
</P>
<P>
 It takes only a few seconds of beating egg whites on low speed of an electric 
mixer to reach the foamy stage. This is the point to add cream of tartar, which 
helps stabilize the whites. If it's added too early, the foaming action will be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Increase mixer speed and continue beating. Before long, the egg whites will 
reach the soft-peak stage and you can begin adding sugar. Continue beating 
until the whites stand upright in peaks when the beaters are removed. 
</P>
<P>
 When beaten properly, the whites will have a glossy appearance and be stiff, 
but not dry. If over-beaten, they appear curdled, don't combine well with the 
other ingredients and won't hold air. 
</P>
<P>
 Next the flavorings are folded in, followed by more sugar, which has been 
sifted together with the flour and salt. Cake flour is used because it has less 
protein, but due to the fine texture, it needs to be combined with the other 
ingredients to get well dispersed during the folding process. 
</P>
<P>
 One quarter of the dry mixture is gently folded in at a time, using a rubber 
spatula (Step 3). Fold just until the flour mixture disappears, about 15 
strokes, rotating the bowl a quarter turn after each stroke. Keeping the 
folding operation to a minimum prevents too much reduction in the volume of the 
egg whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The batter structure is fragile, so angel food cakes must be baked in a pan 
with a center tube. This design helps the batter pull itself upward during 
baking and also lets heat reach the core of the cake. The pan is not greased so 
the cake can cling as it rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically the pans are 10 inches in diameter, have four-inch sides and a 
nine-cup capacity. Most are made of aluminum; some have non-stick coating. 
Because angel food cakes are cooled upside down, the pans sometimes have small 
metal feet spaced around the rim, or the tube is higher than the sides. Those 
with a bottom and tube portion that lift out make it much easier to remove the 
baked cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Once placed in the pan, cut through the batter with a rubber spatula to 
eliminate any large pockets of air (Step 4). Bake the cake in a preheated oven 
on the lowest rack to allow plenty of space for it to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Resist opening the oven until the minimum cooking time has elapsed, because a 
rush of cool air may cause the undercooked cake to shrink or fall. The cake is 
done when the top is browned and springs back when touched with a finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove the cake from the oven and invert immediately. If the feet or tube 
don't allow enough space for air to circulate under the cake, place it over a 
funnel (Step 5) or the neck of a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool completely in this inverted position, about two hours. Keeping the cake 
suspended allows it to gain enough strength so it won't collapse when removed 
from the pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Run a metal spatula around the tube and sides of the pan to loosen the cake 
(Step 6). Lift the cake (Step 7), then remove the bottom and tube portion and 
place the cake on a serving platter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut the cake with a divider (a tool with long prongs) or gently saw with a 
serrated knife. Serve with flavored whipped cream, ice cream or fresh fruit 
such as berries. 12-EGG-WHITE ANGEL FOOD CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups sifted cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 3/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 12 egg whites, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, optional 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl sift together flour, 3/4 cup sugar and salt. Re-sift 3 times. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar and continue to beat until 
soft peaks form. Gradually beat in remaining 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons at 
time, until mixture holds stiff peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fold in vanilla and almond extracts. Add 1/4 flour mixture at time, folding in 
gently with rubber spatula. 
</P>
<P>
 Gently spoon batter into ungreased 10-inch angel food cake pan. Cut through 
center of batter 2 or 3 times with spatula to remove large air bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees 40 to 45 minutes or until top springs back when touched 
with finger and wood pick inserted near center comes out clean. Invert pan over 
bottle or inverted funnel and let stand until thoroughly cool. 
</P>
<P>
 When cool, loosen sides and center with metal spatula and turn out onto 
platter. Makes 10 to 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 10 servings contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 204 calories; 209 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 0 fat; 46 grams carbohydrates; 5 
grams protein; 0.03 gram fiber.

CAKE; CAKE COLLEGE

<P>
 Baking a cake from scratch is definitely not a piece of cake for most people. 
It is, in fact, becoming a lost art. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Aqleh and Jim Ward, partners in Perfectly Sweet bakery in Eagle Rock, 
are determined not to let that happen. This spring, Aqleh and Ward inaugurated 
classes for the "baking impaired." 
</P>
<P>
 They keep the classes small -- 10 is the maximum -- so participants can have 
hands-on experience. Ward demonstrates the techniques; Aqleh provides 
commentary, then assists the students as they practice. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cozy scene as the students assemble, coffee in hand, around the big 
marble-topped work table that dominates the cheerfully decorated small bakery. 
The classes take place at night, so working folks can attend. Perfectly Sweet's 
first class of men and women included an attorney, an accountant, a legal 
secretary, a caterer who wanted to learn about desserts and a homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get really nervous when they think of scratch baking," says Aqleh. 
"What we do is take the mystery out of it. We have a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The first class learned to make a basic yellow cake. This they turned into a 
fancy pate a choux cake, strawberry cake with basket-weave whipped cream 
frosting and a caramel-walnut roulade . 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like presenting a cake to guests and knowing that you created 
it," Aqleh says. "It tastes delicious. It smells real." 
</P>
<P>
 In her eyes, failure is impossible. "There are no mistakes," she says. "It's 
just learning." The key to cake success is to follow a good basic recipe 
carefully and understand the importance of each step. For example, if a recipe 
calls for eggs at room temperature, don't use them straight from the 
refrigerator. Cold egg whites won't beat to the proper volume. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate the fact that we are losing our techniques," says Aqleh. "We are 
trying to bring that (knowledge) back to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Aqleh and Ward gave a pastry class that covered pie doughs, pate a 
choux (cream puff dough), rolled cookie dough and puff pastry. Their next cake 
class is scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 16. Call the bakery at (213) 257-6963 
for further information. Here are recipes from their first lesson. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 "If you break it down into steps, this cake is very, very simple," says Mary 
Aqleh. Pate a choux, otherwise known as choux paste, is cream puff dough.) 
PERFECTLY SWEET'S PATE A CHOUX GATEAU 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature

 Place water, sugar and salt in saucepan over moderate heat. Add butter and 
bring to boil, stirring until butter is completely melted. Add flour all at 
once, stirring constantly. Lower heat and stir vigorously. Cook until mixture

CAKE; RED CAKE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD

<P>
 I sat in front of Debbie's house in my idling 1961 Comet. It was a beautiful 
sunny afternoon in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "Debbie, get back in this house!" Debbie's mother was leaning over their 
porch, railing and screaming. "John, I forbid her to get in your car." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, you're embarrassing yourself." Debbie, holding a red, heart-shaped cake 
out in front of her, walked as fast as she could. "Hurry, John, before she gets 
her shoes on. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 We'd gotten good at quick getaways, pulling out before her mother could grab 
onto the car door handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Once we were halfway down the block, Debbie lifted the cake off her lap and 
offered it to me. "Happy anniversary, John." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie and I were 17. We'd been going together for two years and had decided 
to start being really nice to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got stuff for you too, Deb." I handed her a package I'd wrapped in the 
Sunday comics, something I'd seen done in a movie about hippies. Inside were 
two eight-track tapes: Steve Miller's "Fly Like an Eagle" and George Harrison's 
"Crackerbox Palace." 
</P>
<P>
 Two blocks from her house, we parked under a huge, bare oak tree that was 
tipping the sidewalk next to us. Debbie put the cake in my lap. It was the 
reddest cake I'd ever seen, and the icing was swirled just like cakes on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Crackerbox Palace!' " Debbie was ecstatic. "John, I've wanted this so bad, 
I can't believe you got it!" She didn't even mention not having an eight-track 
player -- probably because there was one in my car and she knew she could use 
it whenever she wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got stuff for the cake," she said and pulled a knife and two big plates 
out of her gigantic purse. Our plan to treat each other really good was 
working. Already, this was the best anniversary we'd had. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The inside of the cake was even redder than the outside. "I used too much food 
coloring," she said. "I think it kept the cake from rising, so I made a third 
layer." 
</P>
<P>
 We tapped our pieces of cake together like Champagne glasses. As I bit into 
mine, it felt like my teeth were sliding into Play Doh. It was even salty like 
Play Doh. "It's, um, really good, Debbie." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling into each other's eyes, we took another bite. This time, my tongue 
curled up and I let out what I thought was going to be a little chuckle, but it 
turned into a gag, and then a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie started laughing so hard she couldn't close her mouth. "Oh, John," she 
said with red cake sticking all over her front teeth. "This is dees-gus-ting !" 
</P>
<P>
 We decided to run the cake over with the car. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We drove for an hour on wet mountain roads, with Debbie playing "Crackerbox 
Palace" loud and all the windows rolled down. We stopped on a long stretch of 
road that ran between empty fields. I set the cake down on the wet blacktop. It 
looked nail-polish red. I backed the car up until we could see just a tiny red 
dot in the distance. Debbie cued up Steve Miller singing "Fly Like an Eagle" 
and I hit the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 That cake was so dense, I swear it made the front end swerve. 
</P>
<P>
 We parked and got out to survey the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The cake had a tire mark cut straight across it. You could read the treads. We 
were laughing so hard we had to lean on each other to stay standing. Only one 
rounded corner of the heart was unhurt. I wanted to turn the car around and 
finish it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's leave it for somebody else, John." Debbie turned away from me. "I don't 
want to run over it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Miller sang about wild mountain honey as we drove off. In the rearview 
mirror, I watched that corner of my heart cake sticking up in the road until it 
disappeared. Even after Debbie and I kissed goodby a block from her house and 
she loaned me her new eight-tracks, I couldn't stop thinking about that last 
piece of unflattened cake. I still wonder who finished it off.

CAKE; CALAMITY CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cake-baking is disaster-prone, and that's why mixes are so popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Even these don't guarantee success, though. I'm one of those rare bakers who 
has failed with a mix. The occasion: a friend's birthday party. The recipe: a 
composition of cake, wine and nuts that had worked beautifully for the person 
who gave me the recipe. My result: catastrophe. The moral of the story is, 
don't throw that awful mess in the garbage. There just might be a way to save 
it. By the time my failure came to the table, it actually looked gorgeous. This 
is what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 When the cake came out of the oven, it was scarred with a hideous, lumpy 
growth, as if the leavening had collected in one spot and burst through to the 
surface. If I had used a Bundt pan, the cake could have been inverted, hiding 
this flaw and presenting a nicely fluted exterior. But the recipe specified an 
angel food cake pan, and I didn't want to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 After the cake cooled, I sliced off the protuberance with a sharp knife. Now 
the cake was level, with a broad yellow path slashed across the brown top. To 
cover this, I would have to frost the cake, which I had not planned to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to make powdered sugar frosting, only I had no powdered sugar on 
hand, and no time to go to the market. So I checked the vintage cookbook that 
was my mother's kitchen bible and found a recipe that called for granulated 
sugar. You cook the sugar with milk to the soft-ball stage, then cool this and 
beat it to spreading consistency.  
</P>
<P>
 I used a candy thermometer so I would know for sure when the mixture reached 
the soft-ball stage. Only the thermometer didn't work. It would rise to a 
certain point, then drop, then rise again. So I did a manual test, dropping a 
bit of frosting into a cup of water until it formed a soft ball. 
</P>
<P>
 What I had hoped for was a frosting that would coat the cake like a thin 
glaze. But when I beat the mixture, it seemed awfully thick. And when I spooned 
it onto the cake, it congealed on the top, forming a hard, rough crown that 
looked like a coral reef. Only this coral reef was bright-yellow, because I had 
added food color to make it pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My solution was to melt the glob until it flowed nicely down the sides of the 
cake. How would I do this? With hair dryers, of course. My nephew, who 
volunteered to help, and I worked side by side with two dryers set on high. But 
the frosting was stonily impervious. Not a drop softened. 
</P>
<P>
 There was still a bit left in the pan, so I remelted that and tried to patch 
the cake, only the color had changed, so now I had concrete topping in two 
shades of yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if I put the cake in a hot oven for a few minutes, the frosting would 
soften enough to spread. Instead, it began to burn, and some of it dribbled 
off. The rest turned sugary, dry and very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I tried to transfer the cake back from the baking sheet to its serving 
dish, a big chunk broke off. I pushed this back into place. Now the cake looked 
really terrible. But it would have to do. The guests would arrive in moments, 
and there was nothing else for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Camouflage was the answer. First, I sifted powdered sugar heavily over the 
top. Then I rushed out to the garden and plucked sprigs of pretty green leaves. 
Arranged like a wreath, the leaves would cover part of the bare sides. A 
bouquet of daisies would fit in the hole formed by the tube pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner went smoothly. Now the embarrassing moment had arrived. It was time to 
serve the cake. Unfortunately, the wreath of leaves had started to wither. So I 
turned off the dining room lights, leaving only the candles in the centerpiece 
for illumination. When I brought out the cake, the guests gasped 
appreciatively. It looked so snowy and pretty, with its daisy centerpiece, the 
yellow birthday candles and the hint of a wreath, barely visible in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the honoree blew out the candles, the powdered sugar flew off the dry 
surface, stenciling designs on the tablecloth around the flatware and glasses. 
Keeping the lights off, I quickly whisked the cake back to the kitchen so the 
guests couldn't watch the brittle frosting chip off as I sliced it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cake itself was just fine, fortunately. One guest commented, not 
unflatteringly, on the interesting, crackly texture of the icing. Three asked 
for second helpings, and after giving the honoree a slice to take home, I had 
only one left for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The guests never learned what happened. When I tried to tell them, I laughed 
so hard I couldn't talk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ill-fated birthday cake was based on a recipe from Beringer Vineyards. The 
original called for Malvasia Bianca, a sweet wine that Beringer no longer 
produces. Wine writer Dan Berger, who provided the recipe, likes to use a 
medium - dry Sherry, and it was his idea to mix sliced almonds into the cake. 
Instead of Sherry, I added Almondoro, a very rich, sweet almond wine made by 
San Antonio Winery, and served the same wine alongside the cake. Incidentally, 
the recipe worked perfectly in The Times Test Kitchen.  
</P>
<P>

CAKE; IN THE KITCHEN; THE DISSENTING BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am not a baker, and a baker I will never be. 
</P>
<P>
 This has to be attributed to nurture rather than nature. Though my mother was 
not a kitchen-type person, as much as she was any kind of a cook she was a 
baker, and I grew up around snickerdoodles and chocolate chips, Grandma Smith's 
hickory nut cake and julekake , and the occasional loaf of homemade white 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, when I seriously began learning to cook, I lived at almost 6,000 feet 
above sea level. At that lofty clime, baking is not for the light-hearted. That 
is the land of "decrease amount of baking powder by one-third at 3,500 feet, by 
one-half at 5,000 feet and by two-thirds above 5,000 feet . . . raise the oven 
temperature by 25 degrees . . . do not beat eggs quite as much as usual. . . ." 
You get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, there's no guarantee things will work out. I vividly remember 
making a half-dozen heavier-than-lead spice cakes in one day before finally 
deciding the whole thing was just one big pain in the epice.  
</P>
<P>
 That's not to suggest that my not being a baker is strictly a matter of 
atmospheric pressure. More to the heart of the situation, I believe I am 
constitutionally unfit for baking. Bakers are recipe followers, the good 
soldiers of cooking. If you see a recipe that takes three pages of instructions 
to use five ingredients, you can bet it's a cake. Bakers like instructions, the 
more detailed the better. Tell them exactly what to do and they'll obey without 
question. I think there's a certain security in this -- if things don't work 
out, they can claim they were only following orders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for myself, I'm a messy cook, direction-wise. Give me a recipe and I 
immediately start breaking it down, figuring how to change it, altering the 
procedures and ingredients in my head to come up with just the result that 
pleases me. This process continues through the actual cooking. In the kitchen, 
I'm a dabbler and a dipper, tasting and adjusting as I go along. For me, a dish 
isn't finished until it's on the plate . . . and even then it's not safe from a 
little last-second tucking and tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Give bakers a sturdy stand mixer and a measured set of ingredients and they'll 
have something in the oven without so much as stealing a lick. Can you imagine? 
</P>
<P>
 Bakers tend to be decorators. They're icers and fussers, and they make things 
like sugar roses and basket-weave cakes. It's not that I don't like attractive 
food, it's just that I don't think there's much you can do to make anything 
more beautiful than the bronzed fruit and dark, crumbly crust of an apple crisp 
-- certainly not painting chevrons on it. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is not to suggest that bakers are bad people. Some of my best 
friends are bakers. And some of them are even pretty good cooks. In fact, 
probably the best cook I've ever known started out as a baker. I will happily 
admit that there is something about the meticulousness and almost religious 
discipline of a good baker (it's no accident that professional bakers usually 
begin the workday at about 3 a.m.) that can make for an inspired cook . . . 
provided they can get past the whole baking thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is this to suggest that I don't, myself, bake. In fact, from time to 
time I'll get on a streak of baking and pop out cakes (though usually topped 
only by a dusting of powdered sugar, or a drift of whipped cream) and cookies 
(usually the ones that fit the Italian description "ugly but good") like a 
regular Barney Crocker.  
</P>
<P>
 It never lasts, though. When it comes right down to it, I'm one of those 
oddballs who would rather have fruit than chocolate. While I'm perfectly happy 
having my cake, in all honesty, I'd just as soon eat a peach. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the cakes that I tend to make most frequently are rather plain 
things that serve as bases for other ingredients. This almond cake from Lindsey 
Shere is a perfect example. While it's delicious by itself, with an extremely 
moist, almond-y crumb, it's best when served with fruit of some sort -- 
apricots and peaches in the summer, poached pears in the fall, maybe a dried 
fruit compote in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My contribution to this recipe is simply converting the whole thing to the 
food processor. It comes out a little denser this way, but in my book, that's 
an attribute. Besides, the whole thing comes together in less than 10 minutes, 
before baking. It's a cake even a non-baker can love.

CAKE; A BAKER'S SECRETS: BE SWEET, BE RUTHLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of intensive cake-baking, I have found the secrets of success. 
Now I bake cakes that are lighter and purer than any I can buy. You will too -- 
I promise. This is what you must do. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrange things so you'll have no interruptions. Air is the crucial 
ingredient in cake; the instant you stop beating the batter, the incorporated 
air begins to escape. This means time is of the essence, so be sweet, but be 
ruthless. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the best ingredients. That means the freshest. Replace spices and baking 
powder every six months, flour and cream of tartar annually. Use unsalted 
butter. Although salt, a preservative, can disguise the fact that butter's been 
in storage, it will never have the quality of got-to-be-fresh sweet butter. And 
cake flour, made from soft wheat (bread flour is made from hard wheat), lets 
you produce an incomparably delicate crumb. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have the ingredients at their optimum temperatures when you add them. The 
effect of softening butter to the consistency of mayonnaise (short bursts of 
half power in the microwave work well) was one of my most exciting discoveries 
-- it lets the butter whip to maximum airiness. Egg yolks and whites must be 
warm for whipping too. Warm them by covering the eggs (still in the shell) in 
hot water before you light the oven. Unless specified, all other ingredients 
should be at room temperature, about 70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Measure with care. Measure liquid and soft solid ingredients in transparent 
measuring pitchers. For dry ingredients, use a nested measuring cup set, which 
has separate cups for measuring a half or quarter cup, rather than trusting the 
marks on the side of a whole-cup measure. Set the appropriate cup over wax 
paper and lightly spoon the dry ingredients into the cup (dipping the cup into 
flour, for example, compacts it). Sweep the top even with a chopstick or 
pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mix at the appropriate speeds. Next to temperature of ingredients, I've 
found this to be the most critical element. Faster is not better. Follow 
indicated speeds precisely. (Speeds are given for portable mixers. If you're 
using a stand mixer, use one notch slower.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't overbake. Begin testing for doneness five to seven minutes before the 
recipe indicates. If your baking times are often at odds with the recipe's, 
have your oven recalibrated by the utility company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Serve the cake at the optimum time. Butter cakes are by far at their 
lightest on the day of baking. If you can't make and serve a cake the same day, 
bake a chiffon or sponge cake rather than a butter cake.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One last note: Turning a cake out of its pan can be scary. Do this: Run a 
table knife around the sides of the pan. Lay a cloth on the cake, then a rack 
or big plate over the cloth. Turn the whole thing over, lift off the pan, 
gently pull off the lining paper and lay a second rack, feet up, over the cake. 
Then turn over again, and the cake will drop top-side-up onto the rack. Remove 
the cloth and cool the cake away from drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're ready to present a cake, don't fret about fancy decorations. A 
pretty platter, perhaps with a paper doily, and a wreath of edible or silk 
flowers and/or leaves around the base of the cake are all you need to make a 
heart-stopping presentation.  
</P>
<P>
 The three cakes that follow are models for their types. If you have a favorite 
cake flavor but a recipe hasn't lived up to expectations, apply these 
techniques to the ingredients. Then, if the cake isn't heavenly, look for a 
recipe in a trustworthy source with a different balance of ingredients and try 
again.  
</P>

 This model butter cake recipe is perhaps the best you'll ever eat -- three 
sumptuous chocolate layers. To mix a non-chocolate butter cake, simply leave 
out the chocolate. For a two-layer cake, just use two thirds of the 
ingredients. Remember that butter cakes should be served within 12 hours of 
baking.

<P>
 OLD-FASHIONED MILK CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH MILK CHOCOLATE FROSTING 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/2 cups sifted cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 tablespoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 tablespoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped into 1- to 2-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup unsalted butter, softened to consistency of mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup light-brown sugar, lumps crushed, packed 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 6 extra-large eggs, warmed in shells  
</P>
<P>
 1 cup buttermilk or soured milk (set 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice at bottom 
of measure and fill with sweet milk, let clabber), at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 Milk Chocolate Frosting 
</P>
<P>
 Unsprayed or silk leaves, such as rose, geranium or strawberry, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In medium heat-proof bowl over (not touching) barely simmering water, melt 
chocolate in water, stirring occasionally until perfectly smooth. Remove from 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl, beat butter on medium speed until creamy. Continue 
beating while sprinkling in granulated and brown sugars, 1 tablespoon at time. 
Add vanilla and beat until very light. Add eggs singly, beating until 
thoroughly blended after each, then beat until very light and creamy. Blend in 
chocolate. Add flour in 3 parts by sprinkling over bowl. Alternate with 
buttermilk in 2 parts. Beat on lowest speed manageable just until each addition 
disappears. Fold batter with large flexible rubber spatula just until 
thoroughly blended.  
</P>
<P>
 Divide batter among buttered 9-inch round cake pans with bottoms lined with 
wax paper. Smooth tops, then push batter slightly up against sides. Bake 2 
layers on middle oven rack and 1 layer on lower oven rack at 350 degrees. 
Stagger so top pans are not directly over bottom pan. Bake until wood pick 
emerges clean from center of cake, 30 to 35 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Cool in pans on racks 15 minutes. Then turn out onto racks, top sides up, to 
cool completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 6 hours before serving, set thickest layer on platter, bottoms up. 
Spread with 2/3 cup frosting. Repeat with second layer. Place last layer top 
side up. Frost top and sides, making decorative sweeps in frosting with knife. 
Keep cool. Do not refrigerate. Just before serving, wreathe leaves around 
bottom of platter. Makes 16 servings.

 Chiffon cake, silky with oil instead of shortening or butter, caused a 
sensation when it was popularized in the '40s -- it was the first new cake in 
generations. This cake causes a stir for its exquisite lightness, flavor and 
charm. The method for beating egg whites in the recipe is to be noted. Chiffon 
cake may be wrapped airtight and stored on the cool side of room temperature 
for one day before serving.  
</P>
<P>
 LEMON CHIFFON CAKE WITH HONEY GLAZE AND THYME LEAVES 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup cool water 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups egg whites (8 to 9 extra-large), warmed in shells before separating 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
 Finely shredded zest 1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Honey Glaze 
</P>
<P>
 Rounded 1 teaspoon herbs such as fresh thyme, mint or chamomile, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Into large mixing bowl sift flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder and salt. 
Beating on low speed, in slow steady stream, add oil, yolks, water and lemon 
juice to flour mixture. Beat just until mixture is smooth. Do not overbeat. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 With clean beaters, beat whites in large mixing bowl at low speed until 
frothy. Sprinkle over cream of tartar and beat on medium speed until soft peaks 
form. Beat on high speed while sprinkling in 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon 
at time. Continue beating just until, when beaters are lifted, peak in bowl 
holds, then flops. 
</P>
<P>
 Add 1/3 whites to yolk mixture and blend in with flat wire whisk or large 
flexible rubber spatula. Add remaining whites and sprinkle over lemon zest. 
Fold batter with large flexible rubber spatula just until thoroughly blended.  
</P>
<P>
 Smooth batter into buttered 10-inch tube pan, bottom lined with ring of wax 
paper, gently pushing batter up against tube and sides. Bake in middle of 
325-degree oven until wood pick or thin metal skewer emerges clean from center 
of cake, about 60 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 At once invert pan and stand on feet or hang from neck of bottle until cake is 
cold. Turn out and wrap.  
</P>
<P>
 Up to 6 hours before serving, set cake on rack over baking sheet. Spoon warm 
Honey Glaze over cake, let dribble down inside center and outside. If desired,

 Old-fashioned sponge cake is timeless. Because it can be baked in any number 
of shapes and b ecause it lends itself to any number of finishes, sponge cake 
may become the most useful in your repertory. A drift of sifted powdered sugar 
is all that's needed to finish sponge cake.  
</P>
<P>
 However, you can glaze it with warmed marmalade or jam (perhaps with the 
addition of a few drops of kirsch or rum). You can split the cake and fill it 
with preserves. You can slather it with whipped cream or your favorite 
frosting. Or blend just enough fresh lemon juice into granulated sugar to make 
it pourable and smooth over this sparkling glaze. Or cloak the cake in 
chocolate -- beat an equal weight of softened, unsalted butter a tablespoon at 
a time into the melted chocolate, then let the glaze cool until thick enough to 
spread. Finally, if you have them, a strewing of rose petals would be in 
keeping.  
</P>
<P>
 To cover the cake with glaze or frosting, you'll need 3 to 4 cups for the 
tube; 1 1/2 cups for each loaf; 2 1/2 cups for top, sides, and filling for two 
layers or the top and sides of the oblong; about 2 cups for cupcakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Wrapped airtight and set in a cool place (not the refrigerator), this sponge 
will stay fresh up to five days.  
</P>
<P>
 SPONGE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup sifted cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup (6 extra-large) egg yolks, warmed in shells before separating 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/3 cup lukewarm water 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 tablespoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup (7 extra-large) egg whites, warmed in shells before separating 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
 Sifted powdered sugar, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch unsprayed rose petals, optional 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl sift flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt together. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl beat yolks at high speed until fluffy and creamy. Continue beating 
while slowly drizzling in water, lemon juice and vanilla. Beat until frothy and 
increased in volume. Then continue beating while sprinkling in 3/4 cup sugar, 1 
tablespoon at time. Beat until, when beaters are lifted, batter mounds up on 
surface 1 to 2 seconds before sinking. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately with clean beaters, beat whites at low speed until frothy. Add 
cream of tartar and beat on medium speed until soft peaks form. Beat on high 
speed while sprinkling in 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon at time. Continue 
beating just until, when beaters are lifted, peak in bowl holds, then flops. 
</P>
<P>
 Add 1/3 whites to yolk mixture and blend in with flat wire whisk or large 
flexible rubber spatula. Sprinkle flour mixture evenly over yolk mixture and 
fold until almost completely blended in. Add remaining whites and fold batter 
with large flexible rubber spatula just until thoroughly blended. 
</P>
<P>
 Smooth batter into buttered 10-inch tube pan, 2 (9x5-inch) loaf pans, 2 
(9-inch) cake pans, 1 (13x9-inch) baking pan (all bottoms lined with waxed 
paper), or about 24 (2 1/2-inch) cupcake pans lined with cupcake papers. Gently 
push batter up against sides and tube, if used. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake in middle of oven at 350 degrees until wood pick emerges clean from 
center of cake: 35 to 45 minutes for tube pan, 35 minutes for loaf pans, 30 
minutes for baking pan, 20 to 25 minutes for cake pans, 20 to 23 minutes for 
cupcakes.  
</P>
<P>
 At once invert pans. Stand tube pan on feet or hang from neck of bottle. 
Support loaf, layer, and baking pans by supporting corners with cans. Or cool 
cake in pans upright on rack. Cool cupcakes in pans on racks. When cake is 
cold, turn out and wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 2 hours before serving, set cakes on platter, best side up. Sift over 
powdered sugar or fill and frost as desired. Decorate cake and platter with 
rose petals. Slice with serrated knife. Makes 12 servings.

<P>
 The cooks in The Times Test Kitchen have seen plenty of cake recipes through 
the years. They know cake. That's why we asked Test Kitchen director and food 
stylist Donna Deane and food stylist and tester Mayi Brady to come up with two 
great cake recipes. We had a great time tasting their nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Donna Deane first tasted this meringue cake at Il Fornaio, she knew she 
had to have the recipe. She got it and adapted it for home use. It's rich and 
fabulous tasting, a wonderful cake for the holidays.  
</P>
<P>
 * MERINGATA ALLA FIORENTINA 
</P>
<P>
 12 egg whites 
</P>

<P>
 1/2 cup almond flavored liqueur 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart whipping cream, whipped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup amaretti cookie crumbs  
</P>
<P>
 Beat egg whites in bowl to soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon 
at time, until egg whites are stiff and glossy. Do not underbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipe meringue into 3 (10-inch) rounds on parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake 
at 250 degrees about 3 hours, until golden. Check meringues to be sure centers 
are baked until dry. Let stand overnight in cool, dry place. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl blend together mascarpone cheese, chocolate and almond liqueur. Fold 
whipped cream into cheese mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 To assemble, put 1 dollop of cream filling on platter, top with first layer of 
meringue and press down slightly into cream dollop to hold meringue in place. 
Spread 1/3 of cream filling over meringue layer. Repeat, ending with cream 
layer. Sprinkle over cookie crumbs. Chill until serving time. Makes 16 
servings.

 The caramel apples of autumn were the inspiration for this cake developed by 
Mayi Brady. It took a few tries to come up with just the right texture in the 
moist apple cake. The drizzled caramel sauce works as frosting. It's a perfect 
homey cake for cool weather.  
</P>

CITY HALL NEWS: MONTEREY PARK; FIRM OFFERS MONEY TO 2 GROUPS IF CITY REVERSES 
BILLBOARD BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An outdoor advertising company has angered the mayor of Monterey Park by 
offering money to two local nonprofit groups -- if the City Council overturns 
its ban on new billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Regency Outdoor Advertising Inc. seeks to put up 12 large billboards along the 
freeways in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Chu, who opposes any new billboards, and other local officials 
revealed that Regency representatives offered to give $70,000 a year for three 
years and $45,000 a year thereafter to the Monterey Park Chamber of Commerce 
and $10,000 annually to the Boys and Girls Club -- if the council allows new 
billboards. The donations would have no end dates. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to vote Monday on whether to amend the city's 
5-year-old billboard ban to allow signs in manufacturing areas along the Pomona 
and Long Beach freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu and other opponents are angry at what they say is an attempt to influence 
the council by privately promising to provide money to groups known to be 
popular with council members Fred Balderrama, Francisco Alonso and Marie T. 
Purvis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we vote for this, it will send the message anyone can come in here and 
give a donation and build anything," Chu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonso countered that Chu "is just looking at those who are likely to vote for 
billboards and deciding they must be doing it for that reason. That's not our 
business. We look at the issue based on the merits." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has not decided which way to vote, but that there seems little 
other use for the land in already blighted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Katherman, a consultant hired by Regency, said he believes the council 
will decide the issue on its merits. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the company has "made offers" to help the chamber and the 
Boys and Girls Club, but said it has not finished negotiating the specifics of 
a contract to give them money once new billboards are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to hide anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherman said Regency would give a discount of 25% to city businesses for 
billboard ads and provide nonprofit organizations with free advertising space. 
The billboards will increase the value of unused land, he said, and will not be 
visible from any city home. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, who made up the majority of speakers at last week's council hearing 
on the matter, say the signs are nothing more than blight, are visible to some 
homes and offices in the city's corporate center, and could be used to promote 
other cities' businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as a good billboard," Hamner said. "They visually 
impair an area and are environmental blight."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; MEETING SEEKS INPUT ON NEW WEST-END PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents are being invited to help plan a long-awaited, 14.5-acre park on the 
west end of downtown.Councilwoman Jenny Oropeza will lead the community meeting 
at 10 a.m. Saturday at 5th Street and Golden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, which will be bounded by Broadway, 6th Street, Golden Avenue and the 
Long Beach (710) Freeway, will be one of the few green areas on the city's west 
end. Residents there have long complained that most of the city's parks are on 
the wealthier east side. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attend will be asked for ideas about what the park should include.

 Argow will assume his new post on Nov. 28.He said he will continue to conduct 
South Gate's business matters "right up until midnight" of his last day on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think I'm leaving South Gate in good shape," Argow said. "During my 
time here, the climate for businesses has greatly improved and the city has 
become a safer place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Argow, 42, said his two greatest accomplishments were developing an emergency 
preparedness program that helped keep the city virtually untouched during the 
1992 riots and the high ranking that South Gate recently received from 
Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., economic research firm, as an attractive 
environment for entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Argow also noted that the city's financial shape has improved. When he arrived 
in South Gate, the city was running a deficit of $200,000. The city now has a 
$4-million reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Argow said he made the decision to leave because Hawthorne offered him a 
higher salary and new responsibilities. Hawthorne's outgoing city manager, Jim 
Mitsch, earned $120,000. Argow would not disclose his salary or how much more 
he will be earning at his new job. SIMON ROMERO

POLITICAL NOTES: ELECTION RETURNS; BROOKS CARRIES HER TUNE TO THE END WITH 'MY 
GUY' SPOOF OF HARMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TIME TO CROON: At the last minute, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan 
Brooks tried to change the tune in her bitter race with incumbent Rep. Jane 
Harman but not the tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing a packed hospitality suite on election night, Republican Brooks and 
daughter Meredith sang a song about Harman (D-Rolling Hills) and President 
Clinton to the strains of "My Guy." The tone, however, remained negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane's stuck like glue to her guy, Clinton," the mother and daughter crooned, 
referring to Harman's votes in support of Clinton policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like birds of a feather, they vote together," was another memorable line. 
</P>
<P>
 After the mother-daughter duet, the roomful of Brooks supporters chimed in 
with the chorus yelling, "Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 The song fit in with the festive mood in Brooks' suite. But one supporter, 
Palos Verdes Peninsula resident and developer Ken Zuckerman, said, "Hopefully, 
she makes a better congresswoman than a singer. . . . She's always had a lot of 
sport, and I enjoy her enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 BALLOT BUZZ: If Harman (D-Rolling Hills) wins by one vote, she can thank her 
daughter, son and Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter Hilary, a sophomore at Princeton University in New Jersey, was hoping 
to vote in her first election this year. But she applied late for an absentee 
ballot, and it arrived on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was going to be a major disaster, as far as her mother was concerned," 
Harman told supporters at her campaign party. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Hilary voted the ballot and had it shipped to Los Angeles on a 
cross-country flight. Harman's son Brian picked up the ballot at LAX and, in 
accordance with election rules, dropped it off at a polling place at 7:47 p.m., 
13 minutes before the polls closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Harman ask Hilary how she voted? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to ask," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 THE CHICKEN UNCOVERED: Harman never talked to the chicken. And seldom 
acknowledged it in speeches. But she wondered who it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times, Brooks' campaign dispatched someone in a chicken suit to goad 
Harman into a one-on-one debate. It was a strategy that Clinton used against 
George Bush in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon, Brooks campaign manager John Perkins was ready to reveal 
the chicken's identity. Mike Espy? Joan Milke Flores? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. It was David Bohline, who worked on the Brooks campaign and made an 
unsuccessful bid in the 53rd Assembly District primary against Julian Sirull. 
Sirull was defeated Tuesday by Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 WATERWORLD: A slate of candidates affiliated with the political machine of 
former Rep. Mervyn Dymally captured five of the eight seats on local water 
boards.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, incumbents accused Dymally of trying to stack the 
financially potent boards of the Central and West Basin municipal water 
districts, as well as the Water Replenishment District of Southern California. 
The agencies store and distribute water to communities across the South Bay, 
Southeast and Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dymally and other candidates accused the incumbents of raising smoke 
screens to avoid talking about the real issues in the campaign, including the 
diversity of representation, access to contracts for minority businesses and 
the structure of water rates that some said fall unfairly on poor and urban 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Dymally's son, Mark, who headed the slate, and R. Keith McDonald defeated 
incumbents Charles Stuart and Richard C. Heath on the West Basin board. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Orduna, Dymally's former chief of staff, won reelection to the Water 
Replenishment District. And two other candidates, Richard Mayer and Charles M. 
Trevino, won seats in the Central Basin. But Dymally candidate Clarence Won, a 
member of the Water Replenishment District board, lost his bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Dymally, 38, said he wants to examine the West Basin's finances 
and operations as one of his first priorities. "We are about fairness," he 
said. "We're about diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Mervyn Dymally said the candidates were successful because they stuck to the 
issues, but he admitted that his involvement in the race probably gave his 
slate a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect the Dymally name helped a little bit," he said.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; CITY PANEL APPROVES SITE FOR ASPHALT PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The EcoPave asphalt recycling plant seemed to have finally found a home last 
week after the city's Planning Commission unanimously approved a proposed site 
at 1646 E. 32nd St. But Southland Industries, a mechanical engineering firm 
near the site, objects to having an asphalt plant as a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland Industries plans to appeal the decision, arguing that establishing 
an asphalt plant would not be the best use of the site."We've filled out the 
application (to appeal)," said company spokeswoman Diane Reavis. "We're just 
waiting for the (company) president's signature." 
</P>
<P>
 EcoPave's previous efforts to build the plant in North Long Beach were 
rejected by the Planning Commission and City Council after residents protested. 
EcoPave officials then filed a $2.2-million claim against the city.

HOGE ON TOP AFTER WAR OF NEGATIVE MAILERS; 44TH DISTRICT: NATIONWIDE GOP FERVOR 
HELPED ASSEMBLYMAN STAVE OFF DEMOCRAT BRUCE PHILPOTT, ANALYSTS SAY. THE TWO 
TRADED A SLEW OF ACCUSATIONS DURING CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about negative campaigning. One foot soldier summed up the race for the 
Assembly's 44th District seat this way: "The whole campaign was the drunken cop 
versus the gambler." 
</P>
<P>
 But, pundits say, the slew of negative mailers, billboards and cable TV spots 
were not the key to the 10-point victory that Assemblyman Bill Hoge 
(R-Pasadena) scored over Democrat Bruce Philpott, Pasadena's former police 
chief.  
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1 is the 'R' after Hoge's name," said Alan Heslop, a political science 
professor at Claremont McKenna College. "That's not a bad Republican district, 
and it was a great Republican night." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic voters hold a 2% edge in the 44th District, which includes 
Altadena, La Canada Flintridge, Pasadena, San Marino, South Pasadena and parts 
of Arcadia, San Gabriel, Temple City and the San Fernando Valley. But voter 
registration probably favored Hoge because Republicans tend to turn out to vote 
at higher rates than do Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge jumped out to a substantial lead early Tuesday night and, although it 
narrowed some, he was declared the winner of the bitter race Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked about fighting crime, fighting for jobs and fighting illegal 
immigration," said Hoge, who has written a number of anti-crime bills as a 
freshman lawmaker. "I believe that I, throughout the entire campaign, addressed 
the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott did not return calls for comment, but campaign spokesman Jerry Jeffe 
attributed the outcome to the Republican fervor that swept the state and the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just got caught up in a year where everything went wrong," Jeffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge and Philpott staked out their positions on the key issues of the day: 
Both declared themselves enemies of crime. Hoge supported Proposition 187, 
which seeks to cut off some public services to illegal immigrants, but Philpott 
opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But a good portion of their resources paid for mudslinging in a campaign that 
was grimy from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge set the tone in the primary even though he and Philpott were running 
unopposed. The assemblyman put out mailers accusing Philpott of abusing his 
standing as a police chief to get off scot-free after giving two Glendale 
officers a tongue lashing during a 1990 traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott groused that he had justifiably protested the stop, which he said 
occurred only after the officers saw that his date was an African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge, who declined to debate Philpott throughout the campaign, sharpened his 
blows in the days before Tuesday's election. A Hoge mailer alerted voters to 
"The Bruce Philpott Drinking and Driving Story," even though Philpott was never 
arrested or cited for drunk driving in the 1990 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott showed a knack for negative campaigning as well. The former police 
chief filmed a commercial inside a San Diego County card club and aired the 
spot on local cable television, painting Hoge as a point man for gambling 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 He rented billboards that said, in a combination of words and pictures, that 
Hoge loves cards, dice and money. Philpott's mailers carried the attack as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 At first avoiding press interviews, Hoge surfaced in the week before the 
election and said he had done nothing wrong in accepting campaign contributions 
from horse racing and casino interests -- about $140,000 -- while carrying 
plenty of legislation for those gambling enterprises, which operate in his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman lawmaker, Hoge wrote six bills to benefit horse racing or card 
clubs and cast a number of votes in favor of those interests. The most 
controversial gambling bill that Hoge introduced would have expanded 
opportunities for card rooms and opened the door to gambling on credit. It was 
vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson at the urging of Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge, who said he became interested in gaming legislation because he and his 
late father once owned and raced thoroughbreds, labeled Philpott a hypocrite 
because he accepted money from the Assembly's Democratic leadership, some of 
which came from special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman also attacked Philpott as a liberal who wanted to boost 
welfare costs -- which Philpott said was a lie. Another mailer accused Philpott 
of being soft on illegal immigration at the expense of California taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most controversial mailer came from the Philpott campaign a 
week before the election. The mailer contained a letter from Hoge's former 
wife, saying the assemblyman "suffered" from a "serious gambling addiction" 
that contributed to the failure of the marriage more than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge denied that he was ever addicted to gambling and called the mailer a 
"Nixonian dirty trick." 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott said the mailer was relevant because of Hoge's legislative record. 
The Democrat pledged to write legislation to limit the influence of special 
interests if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the mailer had backfired, Hoge would say only, "The election's over. 
The voters spoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge, an insurance agent and former president of the conservative California 
Republican Assembly, won election to the state Assembly in 1992 by campaigning 
as a tax-fighter and a tough law enforcement candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he had never held office before, the party activist won the seat 
after securing the endorsements of Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) 
and former Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). Nolan pleaded guilty to 
racketeering this year in connection with an eight-year federal political 
corruption investigation.

ELECTION RETURNS; 54TH TALLY AWAITS ABSENTEE COUNT; LEGISLATURE: KARNETTE HOLDS 
SLIM LEAD OVER KUYKENDALL. DEMOCRATS RETAIN FOUR OF FIVE ASSEMBLY SEATS. DILLS 
IS REELECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 While Democrats held onto four out of five South Bay Assembly seats, Democrat 
Betty Karnette and Republican Steve Kuykendall remained locked in a close race 
as of Wednesday that could determine which party will control the state 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 With all precincts reporting, Karnette held a slim 64-vote lead out of about 
100,000 votes cast. But a handful of uncounted absentee and provisional ballots 
could swing the election either way. Counting of those ballots is expected to 
begin today and could take several days. Even then, both sides said a recount 
might be necessary if the margin remains narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 A Karnette victory could help Democrat Willie Brown hold on as Assembly 
speaker, while a Kuykendall victory could put the Assembly under Republican 
control.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole Republican Party is watching this race," Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in other South Bay races, incumbent state Sen. Ralph C. Dills, who 
at age 84 advertised himself as "Too Old To Quit," will be returning to the 
28th Senate District after defeating Republican David Barrett Cohen, a Redondo 
Beach attorney a half century his junior. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly, incumbent Democrats Curtis R. Tucker Jr. won in the 51st 
District in the Inglewood-Hawthorne area, Willard H. Murray Jr. coasted to 
victory in the Compton-Gardena-Lynwood 52nd District over a Republican who had 
pulled out of the race, Debra Bowen beat insurance agent Julian Sirull in the 
beach cities of the 53rd District and Juanita M. McDonald trounced a 
Libertarian opponent in the Carson-Compton-Long Beach 55th District. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 54th District, Karnette fought doggedly to retain the seat she wrested 
away from 14-year Republican incumbent Gerald Felando in an upset victory two 
years ago in the newly redrawn district. 
</P>
<P>
 Karnette, 63, a former public school teacher, said crime, particularly 
crime-prevention initiatives that target children, would remain her top 
priority if she retains her seat.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't give (children) something to do, they're going to find something 
to do," she said. "A criminal's path starts very early." 
</P>
<P>
 On the controversial Proposition 187, which bars government services for 
illegal immigrants, Karnette said she was surprised at how sweeping voter 
support was. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't do what the public wants it to do," she predicted. She supports a 
stronger Border Patrol and better documentation measures to help stop illegal 
immigration into California. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall, 47, the mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes and a mortgage banker, was a 
strong advocate of 187, calling it a good way to "send a message" to the 
federal government concerning illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 At his election night celebration at a Long Beach restaurant, his supporters 
loudly cheered each new TV report about the large percentage of yes votes for 
the initiative -- to the obvious annoyance of some young waiters and busboys 
who were working there. Later, with more passion than spelling ability, someone 
used soap to scrawl a message on the restaurant men's room mirror: "USA Without 
Immigranst is Nothig." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, after hours of waiting for tardy results, Dills declared 
victory at 5 minutes past midnight at his campaign party at the Radisson hotel 
in Carson -- after the jazz band had disbanded and hotel workers were stacking 
chairs and folding up tablecloths. But Dills remained upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about it. I feel that I have proven that you can be an 
octogenarian and still do the job for four more years," Dills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills said he believes voters valued his experience in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can send a nice young man up there if you want to," he said, "but he'll 
have a hard time finding the men's bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills managed to squeeze a victory out of a reformulated district that 
includes the heavily Republican beach cities as well as his traditional 
Democratic territory of Carson, Compton and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitterness of the campaign persisted in Dills' opponent even after the 
election. Cohen lambasted Dills for a mailer that called Cohen a deadbeat 
because he loaned his campaign $9,000 instead of applying it to his student 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has damaged my reputation in the community, and I have no respect for him, 
" said Cohen, who added that he never missed a payment on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 53rd District, which stretches from Venice to Marina del Rey, 
Westchester and the South Bay beach cities, Democratic Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen, 38, ran her first reelection campaign with the traditional perks of an 
incumbent -- name recognition, political allies and a campaign war chest far 
larger than her opponent's. 
</P>
<P>
 Registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by a narrow 43% to 41% in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's Republican opponent, commercial insurance agent Julian Sirull, 36, 
cited as one of his main qualifications that he wasn't an incumbent politician. 
But Sirull acknowledged that he didn't get as much financial support from the 
Republican Party as he would have liked. As of Sept. 30, his campaign had spent 
$4,988, compared with $53,960 by Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 51st District, Tucker, who was a legislative aide before being elected 
to the Assembly, spent $134,000, while Republican Adam Michelin had raised only 
$3,257 for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelin, a political newcomer who founded a chain of child-care centers, had 
proposed one of the most unusual ideas of the election when he advocated a 
program that would offer any prison inmate who volunteered for the death 
penalty a cash payment, made to his estate, equal to 10% of the state's savings 
in incarceration costs for the prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the voters were not attracted to the idea.

ELECTION RETURNS; VINCENT HANDILY WINS 4TH TERM AS INGLEWOOD MAYOR; JUDY 
DUNLAP, ONE OF TWO OPPONENTS, CLAIMS ELECTION VIOLATIONS AND PROMISES TO 
CONTEST HIS VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Edward Vincent easily won reelection for a fourth term as Inglewood mayor 
Tuesday, trouncing City Council members Judy Dunlap and Garland Hardeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent continued his campaign practice of not showing concern for the 
opposition by falling asleep at home while waiting for election returns. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not show up for the party at his headquarters on the corner of La Brea 
and Manchester streets, where supporters ate fried chicken and potato salad and 
sipped champagne until after midnight, when the first returns trickled in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I feel good about this election," he said in a telephone interview 
around 10 p.m., shortly after waking up from his nap. "I'm not nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent's strategy throughout the campaign was to ignore his opponents, and he 
refused to debate Hardeman and Dunlap, who accused him of poor leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The question at his campaign party was not whether Vincent would win, but by 
how much. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want is for the voters to send a strong message that he is their real 
choice," said Vincent's campaign manager, Roger Thomas. "We want a resounding 
victory, and we're hoping they will show their appreciation for all the work 
he's done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent campaigned on his accomplishments in office, linking them to the 
city's firm financial standing. He told voters that Inglewood is on the right 
track, crime is falling and businesses continue to be attracted to the city.  
</P>
<P>
 And he stuck up for City Manager Paul D. Eckles, whom Hardeman and Dunlap want 
to oust. 
</P>
<P>
 The election results mean that the composition of Inglewood's council remains 
the same, but the ideological animosity among Vincent, Dunlap and Hardeman has 
new fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, campaigning on a promise to make city leaders more accountable to the 
citizens, claimed voter fraud from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Tuesday, her campaign received reports of campaign signs closer to 
voting booths than regulations allow, and 15 to 20 complaints that television 
sets at some polling sites showed campaign commercials during voting. Many 
television stations have a policy not to run political ads on Election Day, but 
Dunlap's media adviser, Andrew Cunningham, said he did not know whether the 
commercials were live or on videotape.  
</P>
<P>
 Both alleged election violations were enough for Dunlap to promise she would 
contest Vincent's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way he can win outright. I've been out there. . . . He's unpopular 
and ill-thought-of by the community," Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap pointed to a 1987 City Council election that was thrown out by a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge for voter fraud. In that case the judge ruled that 
Vincent, in support of another candidate, had invaded voters' rights to ballot 
secrecy. The state Fair Political Practices Commission fined Vincent $16,000. 
Vincent denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about these new (voting) irregularities as a citizen and as a 
resident," Dunlap said. But she stopped short of accusing either Vincent or 
Hardeman of election violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman, who said his main campaign goal was to rid the city of Eckles, came 
in third in the three-way contest. But he has already turned his sights to 
1996, when he said he plans to run for the Assembly seat occupied by Curtis R. 
Tucker Jr. Tucker will be forced out by the state's term limits, leaving the 
race open for local candidates, which may include Vincent as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman said that to win in 1996, he will have to improve his fund raising. 
"With the potential numbers of candidates (for the Assembly seat), I'll need 
$150,000 at least," he said.

ELECTION RETURNS; LATE ABSENTEE BALLOTS TO DECIDE BROOKS-HARMAN RACE; CONGRESS: 
GOP TREND BOOSTS CHALLENGE TO FIRST-TERM CONGRESSWOMAN, WHO TRAILS BY 93 VOTES. 
HORN, OTHER LOCAL INCUMBENTS WIN HANDILY.

<P>
 The South Bay's most competitive and closely watched congressional race lived 
up to its billing as the contest between Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) and 
Republican Susan Brooks remained too close to call as of Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harman clung to hopes that she would survive the nationwide GOP trend 
that marked Tuesday's election, she trailed Brooks and could be headed for 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 With all of the precincts in the 36th Congressional District counted, Harman 
was 93 votes behind Brooks out of nearly 165,000 ballots cast. An undetermined 
number of absentee ballots -- perhaps hundreds -- are left to be counted, and 
Harman's campaign remained hopeful that it could put her ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to wait for the votes to get counted," said Harman's campaign 
spokesman, Roy Behr. "It's too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign was optimistic, however, pointing out that the Rancho Palos 
Verdes councilwoman had an eight percentage point margin over Harman in about 
14,000 absentee ballots counted on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brooks wins, it would be an upset. Harman outspent her opponent by more 
than 2-to-1 as of Oct. 19 and was the only congressional candidate in Los 
Angeles County to air commercials on local broadcast stations. The race was 
expected to be close, but most political observers expected Harman, who had 
worked hard to consolidate her hold on the district, to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Brooks gained a reputation as a pugnacious, outspoken 
campaigner. And she matched Harman with cable television ads and a few attack 
mailers in the waning days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into Tuesday's vote, Democrats enjoyed a 30-22 advantage over 
Republicans in California's House delegation. If Brooks' lead holds up, the 
breakdown will be even -- 26 Democrats and 26 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In other South Bay races, Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) trounced Cypress 
College professor Peter Mathews. Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton), under 
indictment on charges he accepted bribes while mayor of Compton, won 
reelection, as did Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 The Harman-Brooks race attracted national party leaders from both sides to the 
district. Some pundits called it a quintessential matchup between a freshman 
incumbent, elected on Clinton's coattails in 1992, and a challenger who tried 
to capitalize on an anti-Clinton backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brooks' campaign party at the Doubletree Hotel near Los Angeles 
International Airport, workers were jubilant as a four-piece band played 
Dixieland music when Tuesday night's returns showed a victory within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there has ever been a referendum on Clinton, this is one," Brooks said as 
it became clear that her party would win both houses of Congress. Of her own 
tight race, she said: "That's what happens when you run a colorful race and get 
in somebody's face." 
</P>
<P>
 As Harman's supporters watched the GOP machine sweep to the West Coast on 
Tuesday night, enthusiasm dampened at their party at the Radisson Hotel in 
Manhattan Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are angry, and I think for the most part we are seeing a protest 
vote," Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 If she loses after the absentee ballots are counted, it would end what many 
South Bay aerospace executives praised as a promising start in Congress. They 
shunned Brooks in the race and instead backed Harman, who gained seats on the 
House Armed Services and Science, Space and Technology committees.  
</P>
<P>
 But House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), in line to be the next Speaker 
of the House, pledged to find spots on those committees for Brooks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If she wins, Harman said Tuesday night: "We're going to have bipartisan 
government. I'm ready for that. I operate that way. I don't think that hurts my 
ability to help the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman acknowledged as early as last spring that it would be a tough battle in 
the district, which stretches from Venice to San Pedro and where voter 
registration is split almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans. Almost 
from the day she was elected, she began amassing a campaign war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 That helped her in the closing days of the campaign, when she fired off a 
series of last-minute mailers, including one that questioned whether Brooks 
really favored abortion rights. Another suggested that Brooks abused perks on 
the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council, including a vote to buy seven new council 
chairs for $6,000. Rancho Palos Verdes officials, however, say the city ended 
up spending only $2,300 on the seven chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman also waited until late last week to announce that she opposed 
Proposition 187, which will deny benefits to illegal immigrants, and her 
position was not widely publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign crowed about its Republican crossover support, including almost 
all of the South Bay's aerospace executives. The industry leaders praised 
Harman -- a former aide to President Jimmy Carter -- for drawing on her 
Washington connections to come through for the district. Among them was 
then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin, whom she lobbied in 1993 to keep the Los 
Angeles Air Force Base off the closure list. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman tried to walk a fine line between characterizing herself as an 
independent and embracing the Clinton agenda. She broadcast commercials 
throughout the L.A. basin -- the only congressional candidate to do so -- in 
which she declared, "My party leadership isn't always happy with me." Yet, as 
recently as the end of last week, she was at Clinton's side when he was in Los 
Alamitos to announce a Chinese order of commercial aircraft to McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks pounded Harman throughout the race for voting for President Clinton's 
deficit reduction plan. And Brooks harped on Harman's Washington past. She 
characterized her opponent as a carpetbagger who bought the election two years 
ago after a career spent largely in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' attacks were echoed by GOP stalwarts such as House Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kansas) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp -- 
who stumped for her. Harman supporters were surprised that Brooks attracted 
such high-powered support, given that she was unknown in much of the district 
before she announced her candidacy in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the race in the 36th District was tight, other officeholders in the 
region, including the handful analysts regarded as facing more than nominal 
opposition, breezed back into office. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn rode the Republican wave to an easy victory over Democrat Mathews despite 
a preponderance of Democratic voters in the 38th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger, a Cypress College associate professor of American government, 
was running in a district where 52% of the voters are registered as Democrats, 
but he got caught in the GOP undertow, said campaign manager Noah Mamet. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Newt Gingrich as our next speaker, you're not going to do too well if 
you're a Democrat," Mamet said at a dispirited gathering at a Long Beach 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Mathews faced an uphill battle against Horn, a prominent 
public figure in the district since 1970, when he was appointed president of 
Cal State Long Beach, a post he held for 17 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question I always heard was, 'Who is Peter Mathews?' " said Long 
Beach City Councilman Jerry Shultz, a Horn supporter. "What's his track record? 
What has he done for Long Beach or Southern California? " 
</P>
<P>
 Horn supporters say the margin of victory was widened by a series of Mathews 
"hit pieces," negative mailers sent out late in the campaign. One, displaying a 
picture of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, asserted that Horn "sent millions 
to help Russian workers" but failed to help American workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (my victory) is a referendum in the sense that people want positive 
campaigns," Horn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who announced late Tuesday that he plans to run again in 1996, 
defended the mailer. Horn "voted against the President's economic stimulus 
package," Mathews said, "but he voted for foreign aid. We understand why he 
does things like that. He's a Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th Congressional District, which includes Carson, Compton, Long Beach 
and Wilmington, Tucker was easily reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, who was indicted in August on bribery charges, faced no Republican 
opponent, but he got a spirited challenge from Libertarian Guy Wilson, a 
merchant seaman from San Pedro. Wilson, who garnered just 45 votes in the June 
primary, drew almost a quarter of the popular vote on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will run again, and I'm going to be a pit bull next time," said Wilson, who 
had not planned to campaign aggressively until Tucker was indicted. The 
congressman did not campaign in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 35th Congressional District, which includes Gardena, Hawthorne and 
Inglewood, Waters sailed to victory over graphics designer Nate Truman, a 
Republican.

 What wave of anti-incumbency? 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen in legislative races in the Long Beach/Southeast region on 
Tuesday, where all of the congressional incumbents won and only one state 
legislative incumbent -- Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) -- failed to regain 
his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 One other Assembly seat appeared too close to call, with Assemblywoman Betty 
Karnette (D-Long Beach) holding a lead of a few dozen votes over Republican 
Steven Kuykendall out of more than 100,000 votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officeholders in the region, including the handful whom analysts 
regarded as facing more than nominal opposition, breezed back into office. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) rode the Republican wave to an easy victory 
over Democratic challenger Peter Mathews despite a preponderance of Democratic 
voters in the 38th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>

running in a district where 52% of the voters are registered as Democrats, got 
caught in the GOP undertow, said campaign manager Noah Mamet. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Newt Gingrich as our next Speaker (of the House of Representatives), 
you're not going to do too well if you're a Democrat," Mamet said at a 
dispirited gathering at a Long Beach restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Mathews faced an uphill battle against Horn, a prominent 
public figure in the district since 1970 when he was appointed president of Cal 
State Long Beach, a post he held for 17 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question I always heard was, 'Who is Peter Mathews?' " said Long 
Beach City Councilman Jerry Shultz, a Horn supporter. "What's his track record? 
What has he done for Long Beach or Southern California?" 
</P>
<P>
 Horn supporters say the margin of victory was widened by a series of Mathews 
"hit pieces," negative mailers sent out late in the campaign. One, displaying a 
picture of the onion-domed St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, asserted that Horn 
"sent millions to help Russian workers" but failed to vote for programs to 
assist American workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most negative campaign I've ever seen in California politics -- 
and I've seen a lot of them," Horn said Wednesday. "I think it (Horn's victory) 
is a referendum in the sense that people want positive campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, who announced late Tuesday that he's in the running again for the 
1996 election, defended the mailer. Horn "voted against the President's 
economic stimulus package," Mathews said, "but he voted for foreign aid. We 
understand why he does things like that. He's a Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Southeast-area congressional races, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los 
Angeles), Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente), Rep. Walter R. Tucker III 
(D-Compton) and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) were reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, who was indicted in August on bribery charges, faced no Republican 
opponent, but he got a spirited challenge from Libertarian Guy Wilson, a 
merchant seaman. Wilson, who garnered just 45 votes in the June primary, drew 
almost a quarter of the popular vote on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will run again, and I'm going to be a pit bull next time," said Wilson, who 
had not planned to campaign aggressively until Tucker was indicted. Third-term 
Assemblyman Epple said his loss to Cerritos real estate broker Phil Hawkins was 
part of the Republican wave. "It's always been tough to win in this district," 
he said. "Clearly, it's a conservative district." The 56th Assembly District is 
51% Democratic, but many are the conservative "Reagan Democrats" who have 
frequently voted across party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not loyal Democrats," Epple said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkins said that voters responded positively to his status as a political 
newcomer. "This is my district, I've lived here since 1954," Hawkins said. "I'm 
like these people. It's not like I'm a politician. I'm one of them -- and I 
want to stay that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the Karnette-Kuykendall race, which will be determined by 
absentee ballots, has implications far outside the district. Because of 
Republican gains in the Assembly, a Kuykendall victory could put the 
Republicans over the top, ousting Democrat Willie Brown as the Assembly 
Speaker. Counting of the remaining ballots is expected to begin today and could 
take several days. 
</P>
<P>
 The race shaped up as a classic contest between a moderate Democrat and a 
conservative Republican. Karnette opposed Proposition 187, while Kuykendall 
supported the measure.  
</P>
<P>
 The initiative to restrict services to illegal immigrants "won't do what the 
public wants it to do," Karnette, 63, asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall, 47, the mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes, called the measure a good 
way to "send a message" to the federal government regarding illegal 
immigration. At his election night celebration at a Long Beach restaurant, his 
supporters cheered each new television report about pro-187 support -- to the 
obvious annoyance of some waiters and busboys working there. Later, someone 
scrawled a message on the men's room mirror: "USA Without Immgranst is Nothig." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Southeast-area Assembly races, incumbents Willard H. Murray Jr. 
(D-Paramount), Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson), Grace F. Napolitano (D-Norwalk) 
and Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) prevailed easily. Horcher's victory came 
after a recent defeat in a special election to fill a vacant Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo), who has been in the State 
Legislature since 1938, rode out an aggressive challenge from attorney David 
Barrett Cohen, who has never held political office. Dills, 84, advertised 
himself as "too old to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Proclaiming victory shortly after midnight, Dills said that his experience had 
been the deciding factor. "You can send a nice young man up there if you want 
to," he said, "but he'll have a hard time finding the men's bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 In one other state Senate race, Charles M. Calderon (D-Montebello) easily 
defeated Republican Ken Gow despite an investigation by the state Fair 
Political Practicves Commission that showed the incumbent had improperly dipped 
into his campaign treasury to pay for personal items.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SIGNAL HILL; GROUP IS DEVELOPING HOUSING FOR DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-unit apartment complex designed to accommodate disabled residents is 
being developed in Signal Hill by the Crippled Children's Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's Los Angeles chapter has built four apartment houses for 
disabled people since 1982 and is developing four more, including the 
$2.6-million Signal Hill complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge demand for these apartments everywhere, and those of us who 
are building them can't build them fast enough," said Roy Cain, the society's 
director of residential services. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has tentatively approved 
a $1.8-million grant to help pay for the Signal Hill apartments. Cain said he 
hopes HUD or the city's redevelopment agency will provide the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency already has put up about $500,000 to buy a 1.3-acre 
parcel at the corner of Gaviota and Alamitos avenues for the one- and 
two-bedroom apartments. In addition, it agreed last week to lend the society up 
to $125,000 for designs and other pre-construction costs that must be paid 
before it receives the HUD grant. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the apartments will be designed for wheelchair users. All 
tables, countertops, cabinets and light switches will be lower than in regular 
apartments. Halls will be wider than usual and bathrooms will be large enough 
for wheelchairs to move around. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is scheduled to begin in the spring, and the apartments could be 
finished by the end of 1995, Cain said. STEVE EAMES

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; WOMAN LOWERS HEIGHT OF FENCE, SIDESTEPS JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Bixby Knolls woman avoided a stint in jail this week by complying with a 
judge's order to lower a fence that violated city height limits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patsy Barggren, who said she built the 8-foot-high fence to provide 
security and privacy, pledged to continue a three-year battle that has earned 
her the enmity of a neighbor and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Municipal Judge Bradford L. Andrews dismissed a conviction against 
Barggren for violating a city law that restricts fences to 6 1/2 feet. The next 
day, however, Barggren hung a canvass tarp from her back yard trees to shield 
her property from her next-door neighbor, George Boucher, whom she accuses of 
harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to let this man stare at me, no matter what I have to do," 
Barggren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boucher, 78, denied that he is harassing Barggren, who said she is in her 
mid-40s. Boucher said he filed an original complaint about the fence, just 
seven feet from his house, because it was ugly and hindered his view. Boucher 
said he is thinking of reporting the tarp to city inspectors. "It just looks 
like hell," Boucher said. "I don't understand why she wants all this privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 City Prosecutor John Vander Lans said he is uncertain if the tarp violates 
city laws but said inspectors will investigate if a complaint is filed. Vander 
Lans, who personally handled the criminal case against Barggren, expressed 
anger at the thought of having to spend more time on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been fiddling with (this) for three years," he said. "Win, lose or 
draw, it's over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Barggren has spent about $25,000 on legal fees defending the $5,000 fence over 
the last three years. She had been ordered to lower the fence before her 
scheduled court appearance Monday or face six months in jail. She said she may 
take her case to federal court. From the beginning of the saga, Barggren has 
contended that she was singled out for prosecution. DUKE HELFAND

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; 2 BACKERS OF RECLAIMED WATER PROPOSAL REGAIN BOARD SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what many saw as a referendum on the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal 
Water District board's reclaimed water project, voters in the Mid-Valley 
reelected board members Tony Fellow and Marvin J. Cichy, backers of the 
controversial plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Cichy and Fellow won second four-year terms on a campaign emphasizing the 
district's $25-million proposal to replenish the San Gabriel Basin's 
ground-water supply with treated sewage water as a safe way to save money and 
water, and one that is already in use in many regions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Their victory was a setback for Miller Brewery Co., which is fighting the 
district in court to keep treated sewage water out of the ground water that 
supplies its Irwindale plant. Miller last week gave $11,000 to Consumers for 
Clean Water, which provided more than $15,000 each to the campaign chests of 
challengers Linn E. Magoffin and John T. Walker, who oppose the plan.

TOPICS / EXHIBITS; PRESERVING A DARK REMNANT OF NATIONAL HISTORY; BARRACKS FROM 
A WORLD WAR II JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT CAMP IS TRANSPLANTED TO LOS 
ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years after World War II, Bacon Sakatani finds serenity in resurrecting 
a barracks -- one of hundreds at the internment camp where he and 10,000 other 
Japanese Americans were forced to live by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent, breezy Sunday morning, the West Covina resident and several 
volunteers from across the Los Angeles area sawed and hammered the three-unit, 
20-by-60 foot barracks into shape after Sakatani and others brought the pieces 
back on flatbed trucks from the former camp in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The barracks, transplanted across the street in Los Angeles from the Japanese 
American National Museum in Little Tokyo, will be unveiled Friday as part of an 
exhibit called "America's Concentration Camps: Remembering the Japanese 
American Experience." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sakatani, who was 13 when incarcerated with his family in 1942, the 
barracks symbolize a painful wartime experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The barrack has taken out much of my anger," said the retired computer 
programmer. "I had a lot of anger before. But now I don't have to speak about 
it. They can just look at the barracks and understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before his work, he said with a smile: "I am so proud of this. When I 
saw the walls up . . . it was the most exhilarating moment in my life. I was so 
relieved, as if the burden was off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, the government ordered 120,000 Japanese Americans from the 
West Coast to evacuate their homes, abandon their jobs and relocate to camps 
throughout California, Arizona and interior states. The order was rescinded 
when the war ended in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sakatani rode on a train bound for the Heart Mountain Camp in Wyoming, the 
experience seemed like "an exciting adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a teen-ager, I had fun at the camp. We would go sledding in the snow, camp 
at the river and even at Yellowstone Park," he said. "But for my parents, it 
was very painful; they lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time his father, a farmer, had just bought a new tractor for his 
prospering Los Angeles-area farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakatani's parents and their six children were eventually forced to leave 
their home, carrying only the bare necessities on their backs, and to move to a 
barracks at the camp, confined by barbed-wire fences and armed guards. For 
three years, his parents endured meager pay for limited manual labor at farms 
and factories. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was in his early 40s, the prime of his life. I don't think I could 
forgive the government for depriving him of those years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing can ever repair the pain. But I think the barracks will alleviate 
some of that pain," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Sakatani nine years to bring the barracks exhibit to fruition. In 
1982, a reunion with friends from the internment camp prompted him to research 
this episode in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 As he examined government documents and newspaper articles from that period, 
Sakatani said he was driven to tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rude awakening. The more I read, the more fascinated I became of 
what happened to (Japanese Americans)," Sakatani said.Hoping to bring back a 
barracks, Sakatani took 10 trips to Heart Mountain Camp, now a farmland with 
only about 24 of the 450 barracks that once housed 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese American National Museum considered organizing an internment 
exhibit two years ago, he jumped at the chance to bring back an original 
barracks. After years of negotiations with the museum and city officials, the 
barracks now occupy a city-owned lot.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the museum paid for the supplies needed for the reconstruction and 
transportation of the barracks, Sakatani relied on volunteers to rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakatani's quest to unravel the Japanese American experience does not end with 
the barracks. He fills his time presenting slide shows of the internment camps 
at high schools and working on a book chronicling information on the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sakatani: "There's much to be done. I see no end to what I can do to help 
people, especially the younger generations, understand our history."

TOPICS / EDUCATION; CHILDREN'S CENTER RE-CREATES OLD-TIME TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire station, post office, schoolhouse, sheriff's station and farm are among 
sets re-creating an old-fashioned Western town at an educational and 
entertainment center for children to be opened Friday in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed for children ages 2 to 12, the Little Learners Children's Museum & 
Learning Enrichment Center is a business venture conceived by Miriam Justice of 
Monrovia, an educational psychologist who said she has worked with children of 
all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice said each of nine settings at the center offers a theme for learning. 
For example, she said, fire prevention, fire safety and the ecological impact 
of forest fires will be taught by visiting firefighters at the bright red fire 
station, facts about American Presidents can be found at the small-town post 
office and tips on pet care will be offered at the live petting zoo at an "old 
MacDonald's farm." 
</P>
<P>
 Snacks and food will be served at "grandma's and grandpa's house," safety 
rules may be practiced at the sheriff's office, and exhibits highlighting 
holidays and ethnic traditions will be featured in a multicultural room. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand opening ceremonies will be from 4 to 9 p.m. Friday at the center, 
located in a storefront building at 601 S. Myrtle Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will be operated 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and 9 
a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Admission will be $4 for adults, $3 for 
children ages 2 to 12, free for infants under 2 and $3 for senior citizens. 
Justice may be contacted at (818) 359-1047.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; BENEFIT RAISES $31,000 TO FIGHT PEDIATRIC AIDS 
</P>

<P>
 An annual fund-raiser in Redondo Beach has netted $31,000 to fight pediatric 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara ramsey-Duke, a Redondo Beach resident, organized Fit to Fight 
Pediatric AIDS two years ago to raise money for the Children's AIDS Center at 
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Last year, the group raised $19,000 for the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised Sept. 9 and 10 through a wine- and food-tasting event and 
5-kilometer walk will go toward AIDS research and long-term care for children 
with AIDS, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money raised last year helped fund a full-time nutritionist at the 
hospital. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; CONSTRUCTION OF TRANSIT CENTER TO START IN MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission will begin construction of a transit 
center and park-and-ride facility in March at the Artesia and Harbor freeway 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans approved the $12.2-million development last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be built on a vacant 18-acre landfill southwest of the 
interchange, Caltrans spokesman Rick Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park-and-ride lot will hold 1,000 vehicles. A bus terminal and a water 
treatment center to help remove low levels of hazardous substances and methane 
gas found on the property also will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is part of the Harbor Freeway-Transitway project that runs 19.6 
miles from San Pedro to the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the project include widening and elevating the Harbor Freeway 
between the Artesia and the Santa Monica freeways for car pools and buses.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOMITA; RACIAL DATA TO FIGURE IN 2ND SECESSION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GRIMM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time, the racial mix of students in Lomita's schools may affect 
the city's bid to secede from the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time the state Board of Education will compare the racial mix of the 
proposed Lomita Unified School District with the mix of the city's population, 
a comparison the board didn't make in denying a similar bid by Lomita in 1987. 
"It will be a consideration the board has not seen, so it could be a 
determining factor," said county spokesman Greg Magnuson. 
</P>
<P>
 The secession would push the racial makeup of Lomita's schoolchildren from 
28.3% to 43.8% white, according to a preliminary report submitted Nov. 2 to the 
county Committee on School District Organization. But the city itself is 68.4% 
white, according to the report. Since Lomita's proposed school district would 
be more integrated than the city itself, the mix might be considered favorable, 
Magnuson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Black student enrollment in Lomita schools would drop from 17.7% to 9.9%, 
while Latino enrollment would fall from 40.6% to 35.2%, the study estimated. 
Asian enrollment would increase from 6.4% to 7.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomita's first bid made it as far as the state Board of Education, which cited 
segregation concerns in its denial. The final county report and recommendation 
are to go to the state Board of Education on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomita's new school district would serve about 2,000 students attending 
Eshelman Avenue Elementary and Lomita Elementary, a magnet school. Fleming 
Middle School would become a high school or a combined junior and senior high 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 The county committee is expected to investigate several other issues before 
submitting the final report to the state, Magnuson said. Prominent among these 
are Lomita's plans for its special-education students and for the estimated 
1,700 students who live outside the city but attend Lomita schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of Lomita's secession battle say Los Angeles Unified is too big and 
too far away to meet the needs of the city's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Grant, a spokeswoman for the movement, called the report's ethnic 
concerns a smoke screen for the real issue: Los Angeles Unified's dwindling 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we break away, that's the start of the domino process," Grant said. 
"Carson wants to go, Gardena wants to go. Everybody wants to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Though secessionists remain optimistic, Magnuson would not speculate on the 
outcome of the county's final report. "The ethnic concerns have changed 
considerably," he said, "but whether it's enough to change what was a 
disapproval to an approval, I don't know." DAVE GRIMM

SOUTHBAY / COVER STORY; WORST OF THE WORST; AMID THE DEBRIS OF FAR EAST 
WILMINGTON, THE DOWN-AND-OUT DEAL DRUGS, SELL THEIR BODIES AND STRIP CARS. THIS 
'THIRD WORLD' MAY BE THE MOST RUN-DOWN SECTION OF LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The skinny woman looks like a zombie. She walks aimlessly along a dirt street 
where businesses vie for space with towering piles of debris. Her dirty blonde 
hair is coarse and unkempt. Black rings surround her sunken eye sockets. 
</P>
<P>
 At 21, her body is infested with hepatitis B and AIDS. The woman is a 
prostitute, active along with 20 to 30 others in this part of East Wilmington, 
a huge but hidden junkyard -- literally and figuratively -- that is part of Los 
Angeles. Residents in the wider port community call it the Third World.  
</P>
<P>
 The area attracts not only prostitution but a lively drug trade, illegal 
dumping and car stripping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all this, David Stoll, owner of Stoll Engine Co. on East Anaheim Street, 
is trying to keep his maritime business alive. The store has been in his family 
since the 1930s, but Stoll expects to relocate to Irvine next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My customers have been propositioned by prostitutes. Then there's the drug 
dealers," he said. "I have fights outside my store. I have bullet holes in my 
windows on a continuing basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of down-and-out people have flocked to Wilmington's Third World over 
the years as legitimate business owners such as Stoll have struggled to get the 
blight and illegal activities eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 The area has had three Los Angeles City Council representatives in the past 40 
years, but none has successfully motivated the myriad of government agencies 
and authorities who have responsibility in the area. Today the Third World -- 
also known as Far East Wilmington -- is arguably the most run-down section of 
Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 From the Terminal Island Freeway, the 100-acre area is a sea of abandoned car 
bodies, tires, metal scraps, furniture and other dumped debris that the 
homeless survive on. Only one of the city streets is paved. Dozens of junk 
piles, which can grow several feet a day, make several streets impassable. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 300 businesses, most of which are auto dismantlers, operate amid the 
decay. Many have no electricity or running water. The area has no sewage 
system, only a series of cesspools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Third World is bordered by the Dominguez Channel and Grant and Anaheim 
streets; on its fourth side, an unnamed exit off the Terminal Island Freeway 
spits those who want to go there, or those who don't know better, into a 
bustling center at Foote Avenue. Sometimes, crack-dealing at Foote Avenue and 
the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks is so blatant that the area resembles a 
small marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the addicts make money "skinning," slicing the plastic coating from 
stolen industrial cables with a technique not unlike a Japanese chef preparing 
live eel. The copper treasure inside fetches up to 95 cents a pound at the many 
recycling businesses in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to the Third World, towering dunes of canary-yellow sulfur sit atop 
property owned by the Port of Los Angeles. Windblown particles from the 
California Sulphur Co. operation fill the air, assault the nostrils and quickly 
leave a visible residue on car windows. 
</P>
<P>
 At Downtown's Skid Row, a more-notorious district of drug activity, 
prostitution and homelessness, the conditions are better. At least there the 
city streets are paved, portable toilets have been installed and the city's 
Public Works Department has started daily trash pickup, said LAPD Sgt. Chuck 
Mealey, who has worked on Skid Row since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 In Far East Wilmington, longtime business owners blame the city and the Harbor 
Department, which owns about 20% of the property, for the poor conditions. They 
argue that authorities simply ignore the area and its problems, as they say has 
been true of all of Wilmington since it joined Los Angeles in 1909. Although 
government bodies such as the Community Redevelopment Agency are set up to 
assist run-down areas, no long-term improvement program has been initiated in 
the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be an ideal place for urban renewal," said Manuel Louis, who has 
operated the Louis Equipment marine supply company on Schley Street since 1947. 
He and Stoll established the Far East Wilmington Improvement Assn. six years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have some of the most valuable ground in L.A., adjacent to the expansion 
of both the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, and we're existing in the 
backwash." 
</P>
<P>
 But CRA property manager Jeffrey Skorneck said: "We found that when we looked 
at that area, (a renewal plan) wasn't going to be financially feasible."  
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, port officials said they would like to own Far East Wilmington for 
future harbor business. In the meantime, they objected to the idea of spending 
millions of dollars to improve the streets, which are pocked with holes that 
become impassable ponds when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll was so exasperated that he sued the city and the port in 1991, accusing 
them of deliberately neglecting the Third World to drive down property values 
so they could acquire the land cheaply for development. 
</P>
<P>
 City and port officials deny Stoll's allegations. Although the port has 
acquired several properties in the area since 1985, acquisitions have slowed in 
recent years and the port has no plan for the area, said Mike Lemke, the port's 
director of property management. "We have no evil intent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his suit, Stoll sought $6 million in damages. No damages were paid, but the 
city and port agreed to purchase Stoll's property and building for $680,000. 
The settlement was finalized in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll said he was pleased to settle. "I don't know who else would buy my 
property, at any price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities from city, county and state government agencies are familiar with 
the area, but say they are understaffed and need a coordinated approach to 
tackling the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 Many city authorities, such as the Street Use Inspection division in the 
Public Works Department, respond primarily to complaints. The division only has 
one inspector for the region stretching from San Pedro to Watts, said Chief 
Inspector Jim Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 The division has not issued a single citation for illegal dumping in the 
streets of Far East Wilmington, Washington said. Authorities say it is 
difficult to catch the people who come in and dump at night, and no single 
agency is in charge of removing the mess.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank C. Cardenaf, who was appointed to the city's Public Works Commission 
last month, is one of several officials who have visited Far East Wilmington 
recently, some for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was amazed at the conditions," Cardenaf said. "We should not have pockets 
like this in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Vito Scattaglia, district commander of the Department of Motor Vehicles' 
Bureau of Investigations, has been there twice since his area of command was 
restructured to include Wilmington last year. The department controls car 
dismantling businesses in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first went down there and looked at what I'd inherited, I just about 
died. It's unbelievable," Scattaglia said. "We've got our work cut out for us. 
It's a disaster down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV licenses 123 auto dismantlers in all of Wilmington and San Pedro, but 
many more illegal dismantlers operate in the Third World, he said. Police and 
business people who know the area estimate about 200 dismantlers have probably 
set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattaglia said enforcement is a nightmare. Any time that the DMV comes in to 
inspect permits, word gets out and the illegal businesses close for the day.  
</P>
<P>
 "The people there are too well established. They have their own network," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV has neglected the Third World in the past, Scattaglia said, but he is 
organizing a major investigation of the area. It will start early next year, 
when more inspectors have been appointed to his bureau. "We will investigate, 
arrest and prosecute. We will take them on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Far East Wilmington also is known to the BADCATS division of the LAPD, which 
investigates organized auto theft rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bill Lovold said the Far East Wilmington car yards are more 
concentrated than those found in the San Fernando Valley -- another hot spot 
for auto thefts. "They seem to open up businesses (in the Third World) with or 
without the necessary permits at the drop of a hat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Police Department recovers about 100 vehicles that have been stripped 
in Far East Wilmington every year. "They bring the cars in here and strip them 
for parts, then dump them in Wilmington," said Senior Lead Officer Michael 
Bland. "Then I find them the next day and have to impound them."  
</P>
<P>
 For all the openness of illegal activity in the Third World, the Harbor 
Division of the LAPD, which has jurisdiction, is not as active in the area as 
it was a year or two ago, some business owners say.  
</P>
<P>
 Police respond that they cover the area as well as they can with the manpower 
they have.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're there any time we can, when any officers working that area have the 
time," said Harbor Division Lt. William R. Sweet when asked how frequently the 
police visit. "We don't have the adequate personnel to give it as much 
attention as we would like." 
</P>
<P>
 The division's "junkyard detail," which coordinates police activity in the 
area, was cut from four officers to one in 1991, Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
 And people who loiter in the area say they can sense the arrival of police. On 
a recent afternoon near the railway tracks, several homeless people were 
skinning for metal. "Get back," said Dave, one of the group. The crowd 
dispersed. Later, it turned out that the driver of an unmarked car parked 
several hundred yards in the distance was a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Over on Foote Avenue, two marked LAPD vehicles recently pulled up beside the 
railway line, where it isn't uncommon for 15 to 20 crack users to hang out. The 
officers, their hands gloved in plastic, searched the clothing of three men and 
a woman, but found no trace of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the jurisdiction of the Port Police stops 500 yards from the edge 
of the harbor, they help patrol the Third World. Business owners and the 
homeless say Bland, the port police senior lead officer, has been a more 
familiar face than the LAPD officers since about 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis tells the story of a trailer that was pushed to a spot near his business 
and used for prostitution. "I called Bland, and two hours later it was removed. 
There's no other department that operates like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bland believes that responsibility for improving the area rests squarely on 
the shoulders of city officials. He said he is fed up with the procrastination. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this that they want to sit down and talk about, they don't need to 
talk about," he said. "They need to get in here and clean it up and have their 
building and business permit people come in and cite these people." 
</P>
<P>
 If Far East Wilmington seems bad and ugly now, Bland said, it was much worse 
four years ago. With the help of legitimate auto dismantling companies, he 
impounded abandoned vehicles for 18 months straight, bringing in tow truck 
after tow truck to clear the streets under a plan initiated by former Mayor Tom 
Bradley. This was the only city attempt at a coordinated cleanup effort of the 
area in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bland still drives through the Third World every day he is on duty, tracing 
the origin of an abandoned car or ordering employees to remove debris outside 
their businesses. "If I waited for the city to do it, I'd be waiting forever," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Joan Milke Flores was councilwoman for the harbor district, her office 
suggested that Far East Wilmington be fenced to keep dumping, prostitution, 
drugs and thievery at bay. Business owners balked at the idea, saying the fence 
would discourage customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who has been known to record the location 
of a pothole or broken sign on a hand-held tape player while driving the 
streets of San Pedro, says he will take on Wilmington's Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost an estimated $13 million for the sewage, storm drains and street 
paving needed in the area. Svorinich said the work could go forward if property 
owners agree to pay additional taxes to reimburse the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the policy of the city to come in and invest resources," he said. 
"Someone has to pay for them."

 Svorinich hopes to organize a task force of city agencies before the end of 
the year that will address issues affecting the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardenaf, the new Public Works commissioner assigned to Svorinich's 
district, said the dismal state of Far East Wilmington challenges any quick and 
simple remedy. "I don't think there's going to be an easy solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Louis said he is skeptical of Svorinich's plan. Although the area is 
located next door to one of the wealthiest harbors in the country, Louis said 
Wilmington residents simply lack the political clout to get officials hopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis expects that the area will become more run-down as city development 
plans for the Alameda Corridor and the Dominguez Channel bridge are 
implemented, disrupting business access to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Stoll, some business owners are finding somewhere else to go. Up to the 
early 1980s, the area was dominated by boating-related businesses like his. Now 
there are only three. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not by choice," Stoll said. "I'm third-generation in this business. I 
really had no intention of ever moving."

POLICE SEEK CLUES IN RAPE OF 12-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sheriff's deputies, continuing the search for the man who kidnaped and raped a 
12-year-old girl in Valinda last week, will be combing the area this morning, 
distributing flyers with information about the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, whose name was not released, was walking to school Nov. 3 on Azusa 
Avenue near Glenloch Avenue when a man asked her for the time, sheriff's 
officials said.The girl tried to walk away but the man had a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 He then dragged her by the arm to a pickup truck and drove the girl to McLaren 
Street in Valinda, where he raped her and then drove a mile and released her. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a Latino in his 30s, 5-foot-5, weighing 140 to 150 
pounds. He has brown eyes, short, wavy black hair and a thick mustache. He was 
wearing maroon sweat pants and drove a light blue GMC pickup with gray interior 
and gray lettering on the tailgate. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hansen, principal of Giano Intermediate School in La Puente, where the 
girl is a student, said the school has reviewed safety procedures with its 950 
students and sent information home to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Giano's students walk to school, Hansen said, and the incident 
has made them more cautious. Hansen said school officials are advising students 
who walk to school to walk in groups.

COVER STORY; FIELD OF DREAMS; ATHLETES COMPETING FOR SCHOLARSHIPS PLAY 
HIGH-STAKES GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Estrada is standing on the sidelines at the St. John Bosco-St. Paul 
football game in Bellflower, watching intently as the players on the field run 
and pass and butt heads on the line. He holds a clipboard, making notations on 
a form after every play, but he's actually holding much more than that in his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 What Estrada is holding are the dreams and futures of young athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada is a professional high school football scout. For the last six years, 
Estrada has worked for an Orange County-based scouting company, attending 40 to 
50 high school football games throughout Los Angeles County to assess players' 
abilities, attitudes and potential. 
</P>
<P>
 His reports, and those from other company scouts in Southern California, will 
be assembled and sold to colleges and universities for $1,500 to $2,000 a copy, 
giving them an overview of what's available in the Southern California high 
school football market. 
</P>
<P>
 For anxious high school football players who will be waiting for those college 
football coaches to call, a thumbs up or a thumbs down from Estrada could be a 
deciding factor. Each notation he makes on that clipboard can help advance -- 
or demolish -- a boy's dreams of getting a "ride" -- that is, a full college 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's big business, this quest to get a scholarship, not just in football but 
in other sports, for girls as well as boys. Full or partial scholarships are 
available in about two dozen sports. Since implementation in the 1970s of Title 
IX, which seeks to balance expenditures on women's sports with men's, the 
growth of women's athletic scholarships has been explosive. In 1991, the last 
year for which figures are available, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
reported that 90,000 athletes were receiving about $468 million in full and 
partial scholarships -- almost one-third of them to women -- from more than 500 
NCAA Division I and II colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the numbers are large, the size of the athletic scholarship pie 
actually is small, given the huge demand for a slice of it. No one knows just 
how many high school athletes -- and their parents -- entertain dreams of full 
scholarships. But insiders estimate that no more than 10% of high school 
athletes qualify for athletic scholarships, either full or partial.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Long Beach and the surrounding areas have a rich tradition of producing 
great athletes. Dozens have become baseball stars, including Wilson High School 
teammates Bobby Grich and Jeff Burroughs. Grich was an all-star second baseman 
with the Baltimore Orioles and the California Angels. Burroughs was the 
American League's Most Valuable Player in 1974 with the Texas Rangers. Shane 
Mack, who graduated from Gahr High in Cerritos, attended UCLA, made the 1984 
U.S. Olympic baseball team and played for the Minnesota Twins' 1991 World 
Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
 If it can happen to them, some parents think, maybe it can happen to my kid. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many adults go to great lengths to help their children qualify 
for a college athletic scholarship, which not only would ease the burden of 
tuition costs but just might turn out to be a ticket to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents move their children into certain school districts from miles away 
to get them in the best, most high-profile athletic programs for their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even take their kids across the country to "showcase tournaments," where 
college coaches and recruiters can see them in action. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents pay hundreds of dollars to companies that circulate athletic 
resumes among college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary El Segundo High School baseball Coach John Stevenson thinks that 
parents' aggressiveness has gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become a frenzy," said Stevenson. "There are kids playing solely 
because their parents are demanding that they earn a scholarship. Kids are 
trying to play for the wrong reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone connected with high school sports has a story about pushy 
parents screaming at their kids for supposedly blowing a scholarship by missing 
a layup or muffing a grounder. Yet, with the average cost of a private 
four-year college hovering around $14,000 a year, including tuition, room and 
board, who can blame a parent for thinking that it certainly would be nice if 
Junior or Sissy could get all or even a portion of that tuition picked up by 
the school's athletic department? 
</P>
<P>
 So the question becomes, how do you help the kid do it? How do you increase 
the chances that your young athlete will get financial aid? 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with coaches, student athletes, scouts, recruiters and 
parents, here are some suggestions: Make Sure the Kid Can Play 
</P>
<P>
 That may sound obvious, but the ability to play a sport well -- very well -- 
is a factor some parents overlook when they start dreaming of an athletic 
scholarship. Simply put, they think their young athlete is better than he or 
she really is. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of wishful thinking going on out there," said football scout 
Estrada. "But you have to be realistic. Sometimes parents will come up and ask 
me about their kids. I can't lie to them. If they ask me, I tell them the 
truth. Most of the time they're nice about it, but sometimes they don't want to 
believe me." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Williams, basketball coach at La Mirada High for 17 years, thinks that 
parents often look through rose-colored glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sometimes think their kids are better than they really are," said 
Williams, who has seen a couple of players leave La Mirada for what they 
thought were greener pastures, only to fail to earn a scholarship. "It's like, 
'Hey, my kid was an all-star in Little League.' Well this isn't Little League 
any longer. You have to perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some kids -- a very few -- are standouts, the so-called "blue 
chippers." For them, it's not a question of whether they're good enough to get 
an athletic scholarship, but which school they will grace with their presence.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, Long Beach Polytechnic High School's standout football 
lineman Brandon Whiting. At 6-foot-3, 260 pounds, Whiting had his pick of 
Pac-10 schools. He chose California over Stanford, and is starting at defensive 
tackle as a freshman this fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Artesia basketball star Charles O'Bannon, who was recognized as 
one of the finest college prospects in the nation while still in middle school. 
In his senior year, the 6-foot, 7-inch high school All-American received offers 
from more than 100 schools. O'Bannon finally chose UCLA, where he starts 
alongside brother Ed O'Bannon, who also had been the object of an intense 
recruiting battle.  
</P>
<P>
 The athletic talent possessed by the O'Bannons and Whiting are undeniable. But 
the trio also did well in the classroom, something that not all athletes 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to an equally important requirement for getting an athletic 
scholarship. Make Sure the Kid Has Good Grades 
</P>
<P>
 Until the early 1980s, about the only academic requirement for playing college 
ball was maintaining a 1.6 grade-point average in college courses -- not a 
skull-busting requirement. In 1983, however, the NCAA started requiring high 
school graduates to meet minimum grade-point and SAT standards to be eligible 
for college scholarships. There is now a sliding scale: if you have a 2.0 GPA, 
you need a 900 SAT score; if your GPA is 2.5, you need a 700 SAT. And the GPA 
must be in 13 "core courses" -- math, English, the sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are strict. Poor grades mean no scholarship and no play. End of 
story, end of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Broncos running back Leonard Russell, the National Football League 
offensive player of the year in 1991, had his pick of colleges when he 
graduated from Long Beach Poly in 1987. He accepted a scholarship from Arizona 
State, but soon found that he had shortchanged himself in high school by not 
studying. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the academics, I knew I wasn't as disciplined in the classroom as I 
was on the football field," Russell once said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 That's true at many high schools, it seems. Says Estrada: "The city of L.A. 
probably has the best athletes overall in Southern California, but a lot of 
times nobody's pushing those kids to study and go to school. So you get a kid 
with maybe a high-C average, but then you look at his SAT, and sorry, it's 600 
-- and you get 200 just for writing your name. So those kids can't get 
scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell graduated from Poly with a 1.8 GPA, which made him ineligible to play 
for Arizona State his freshman year. He wound up playing football at Mt. San 
Antonio College, a junior college in Walnut. In two seasons he boosted his GPA, 
and graduated with an associate's degree. He earned back his scholarship at 
Arizona State. After one season with the Sun Devils, Russell was selected by 
the New England Patriots in the first round of the NFL draft.  
</P>
<P>
 Some kids flip the equation, making athletics an adjunct to getting an 
academic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula High School girls' basketball player Katharine Foster-Keddie, a 
17-year-old 6-footer who has a 3.9 GPA, recently became a semifinalist for a 
National Merit Scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's been approached by several colleges that provide athletic 
scholarships, she wants to attend an Ivy League school, preferably Harvard or 
Yale. Those schools do not award athletic scholarships. But she knows that 
being a sports standout -- she also plays volleyball -- could tip the 
admissions scales in her favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster-Keddie and her parents also recognized another important step in 
increasing the chances for a scholarship. That is . . . : Make Sure the Kid 
Plays Where the Decision-Makers Will See Her 
</P>
<P>
 Because of shrinking travel budgets, especially in the so-called "non-revenue 
sports" such as volleyball and softball, recruiters gravitate to the best 
teams, the ones with the stars and blue chippers, bypassing lesser-known 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if you don't happen to live in a district that is tops in your 
child's sport? 
</P>
<P>
 You can do what a lot of parents do: Move into the district so your child can 
go to school there. 
</P>
<P>
 The O'Bannons' parents, Ed and Madeline O'Bannon, moved the family in the 
mid-1980s from South-Central Los Angeles to a home in Cerritos within the 
Artesia High School attendance area. Basketball, they say, didn't figure 
totally in their decision to move, but the move allowed their sons to play for 
coach Wayne Merino, one of the most successful basketball coaches in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those youths who move on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrico Bozman, a standout running back at Bellflower High in 1992, moved in 
with the parents of his girlfriend last year, was given a hardship transfer 
clearance by local athletic officials, and starred at Los Alamitos High, where 
coach John Barnes has built a football dynasty.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost every top program has players with similar stories of moving from 
sometimes far-flung areas into the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball coach Patrick Roy at Inglewood High School has had players move 
into the district from Artesia, the San Fernando Valley, all over. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel they need to come here to be seen by the coaches," Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone can pick up and move, though. Some parents find a distant 
relative or friend and send their kid to live there during weekdays. Some 
simply list a relative's address so their kids can attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount football Coach Ken Sutch, a 20-year veteran, frowns on moving a kid 
for the sake of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to be settled, have friends," he said. "When kids jump around from 
place to place, all they have is that one focus, and that makes them a pretty 
narrow person. That's a real danger." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to concentrating on high school powerhouses, recruiters spend a 
lot of time scouting spring and summer leagues and privately funded club teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' sports, such as volleyball and soccer, the vast majority of college 
scholarships awarded are based on an athlete's performance with private club 
teams or in private tournaments, according to Brian Gimmillaro, coach of the 
Cal State Long Beach women's volleyball team, the defending national champions. 
The 20th annual UC Davis summer volleyball tournament, for example, drew more 
than 7,000 athletes and more than 100 college coaches and scouts in June. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if you can't quite uproot your entire family just to make sure your 
son or daughter is in the best sports program? What if you can't afford to fly 
all over the country showing off your child at showcase tournaments? How can 
you get recruiters and coaches to notice you? The solution may be . . . : 
Advertise, Advertise, Advertise 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you're a true blue chipper in football or basketball, you need to 
market yourself," said Tracy Jackson, president of College Prospects of 
America, an Ohio-based firm that contracts with student athletes to distribute 
profiles of their athletic statistics and academic record to colleges across 
the country. "It's a dating service concept. We introduce athletes to colleges, 
and vice versa. If they want to get married, that's up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest and largest company of its type, 9-year-old College Prospects 
operates through about 175 independently owned franchises in 47 states. For 
$650, student athletes can have a complete resume sent to every college 
athletic program in which they might legitimately be qualified to play. Jackson 
makes no guarantees that they'll get a scholarship, but he says there's a 
money-back guarantee that the athlete will get at least one response from a 
college coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone approves of the concept -- coach Stevenson of El Segundo calls 
such services "parasites," and even Jackson acknowledges that some fly-by-night 
operations have damaged the concept's image. But the company literature is 
thick with testimonials from college and high school coaches and parents. And 
some student athletes say it's the only way to get their names out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Clark of Carson, whose daughter, Leslie King, 17, is a standout 
softball player at Carson High School, said the girl was hoping somebody would 
notice her, but nobody did. "Her coach told her about it (College Prospects), 
and since she signed up, she's gotten about 25 responses." 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches are sending me questionnaires," said King, a senior who's on the 
honor roll and has a 3.95 GPA. "I haven't talked to any of them yet, but I'm 
hoping something will work out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't easy to come up with the money (for the service)," Clark said. "But 
when you consider how much college costs, we thought it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most important piece of advice on college athletic 
scholarships, according to almost everyone, is not to attach too much 
importance to them. For most kids, the odds are long, the payoff often is not 
that great -- especially from a partial scholarship -- and the athletic 
scholarship may not jibe with the student's educational goals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission (in high school athletics) is not to build college players or 
professional players," said Stevenson. "Our mission is to provide an education, 
and athletics is part of the educational process. If a kid gets a scholarship, 
that's nice, but I don't think kids should play just for that purpose. They 
should play because they love to play."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FLAMING FRENCH FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Chalet de France opened 32 years ago, it was a trendsetter for 
Torrance and the South Bay, serving daring novelties such as beef Wellington, 
vichyssoise and flaming steak Diane. Those dishes are no longer seen as daring, 
and dining here nowadays is a bit like taking a history class in classic French 
cuisine. But judging by the Chalet's consistently packed houses, it's a very 
popular course. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated at the edge of a quiet residential neighborhood and just up the hill 
from a relatively desolate stretch of Pacific Coast Highway, the Chalet de 
France signals its presence with a long tricolor awning. It may seem a bit 
imposing from the outside, but the interior has the comfortable, rustic 
elegance of a country inn and you are greeted by the sincere welcome of 
Champagne-born owner and hostess Andree Haon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Michel Cleire apprenticed in Vichy, then made his way to America, 
becoming head chef at the Chalet in 1984. A quick look at the soup offerings is 
a bit like looking at your school yearbook and seeing old friends -- onion soup 
gratineed under a thick layer of cheese ($3.25), the famous cold 
leek-and-potato soup, vichyssoise, ($3.25) and a rich lobster bisque with 
chunks of lobster ($5.25). 
</P>
<P>
 The classics continue into the hors d'oeuvre listings: escargots de Bourgogne 
, rich with garlic butter ($6.50), oysters Rockefeller ($9.50) and a seafood 
crepe filled with bay scallops and halibut and topped with Parmesan ($6.50). 
Jumbo shrimp ($8.50) are sauteed with butter, cognac, fresh dill and basil. 
</P>
<P>
 Steak Diane ($21.95) is still one of the most popular choices -- a filet 
mignon prepared at your table in a red wine sauce with shallots, peppercorns 
and fresh thyme, then flamed with cognac. Roast Long Island duckling, served 
with orange sauce, is also flamed with cognac. If that's more flame than your 
table desires, Veal Normande ($19) is simply sauteed in a light cream sauce 
with mushrooms, apples and Calvados, the French apple brandy.  
</P>
<P>
 Chalet de France is at 23254 Robert Road, Torrance (310) 540-4646. Open 
Tuesday through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and Tuesday through Sunday 4 to 
10 p.m.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; READING ROOM; AS HUGE CHAINS PUT THE SQUEEZE 
ON SMALLER BOOKSTORES, INDEPENDENTS STRIVE TO FIND THEIR NICHE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 The bookshelves at the Wild Iris Bookstore in Claremont stand half-empty. The 
lilac walls are covered with paintings, masks and T-shirts for sale, one of 
which reads "Eve was framed." Two small cats scamper across the soft carpet, 
landing atop each other in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 And cornered is how Genevieve Beenen, owner of Wild Iris, is feeling these 
days. Last year, she said, the recession and the nearby opening of a Barnes & 
Noble bookstore nearly put her small bookstore for women out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Beenen struggled through the year, but last month was again on the verge of 
shutting down. Her bookshelves, once stocked from floor to ceiling, are down to 
about 4,000 titles. She is supposed to put in her book order soon but doesn't 
know if she'll have the money. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the valley, in Pasadena, is Vroman's bookstore, one of the 
most venerable independent bookstores in Southern California. Vroman's, on 
Colorado Boulevard, celebrated its 100th year in business at the end of October 
and plans to double in size next year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past few years, bookstore chains have given birth to book 
megastores such as Barnes & Noble and expanded beyond suburban shopping malls 
to the city streets that were once the domain of independent booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the superstores' vast selections and discount pricing, some of the small 
independent booksellers complain of overwhelming competition and unfair 
business tactics by publishers. But National Independent Bookstore Week, which 
ends tomorrow, finds other small bookstores in the area holding their own and 
even thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most successful is Vroman's. Founded by photographer A.C. Vroman in 
1894, the bookstore now offers more than 110,000 titles and has become 
something of a cultural institution. With the demise of Fowler's Books in 
Downtown Los Angeles six months ago, Vroman's is now the oldest bookstore in 
Southern California, said Karen Watkins, Vroman's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specialty stores and very well-established independents will survive," said 
Lise Friedman, president of the Southern California Booksellers Assn. and 
manager of Dutton's Brentwood, a large independent store. 
</P>
<P>
 Many independents have closed in recent years, Friedman said, but not solely 
because of book chains. The recession and the move of society toward television 
and away from reading are other reasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's definitely scary, because they (the chains) have a lot of money," 
said Friedman. "My customers tell me they go to Crown for their bestsellers, 
but come to my store for special orders, which I lose money on." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest of the eight Super Crown Books outlets in the San Gabriel Valley 
opened on Foothill Boulevard in Pasadena in February, just a few blocks from 
the site of Mr. Books, which had closed three months earlier. Its expansive 
front windows are blanketed with posters advertising 40% off all New York Times 
bestsellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the massive space, the rows of more than 200,000 perfectly organized 
books are daunting. Displays of heavy hardback bestsellers dominate various 
intersections in the store. Beautiful coffee-table books abound, and with 
Playboy magazines adjacent to the classic literature section, the store seems 
to provide something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Crown Books, specializing in discount pricing of big sellers, opened 
in Maryland in 1977 and was an instant success, said Jose Gonzalez, executive 
vice president. There are now 241 stores nationwide, 80 of which are Super 
Crowns, a larger version of the original. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are here to stay," Gonzalez said. "Bigger and better is what everybody 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley has nine Waldenbooks, eight Crown Books -- including 
two Super Crowns -- seven B. Daltons and two Barnes & Nobles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to put independent bookstores out of business," said Jeanie 
Prukop, district manager for B. Dalton. "We just want to see people reading, 
and we're trying to stay ahead of the game, just like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the valley saw the closure of two independent bookstores. Hunter's 
Books and Mr. Books, both in Pasadena, apparently closed for different reasons, 
but today there are separate Super Crowns just doors away from each site. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Books, which once advertised its store as "destined to be as famous as the 
Rose Parade," closed a year ago. According to several local bookstore owners, 
the store was simply in the wrong location at the wrong time. The former owners 
were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's, once a thriving chain with stores all over the West, closed its last 
California store in January after three years on Lake Avenue in Pasadena. The 
store was one of the largest in the chain and offered more than 370,000 new 
books and paperbacks. A year before its closure, a Super Crown opened down the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Kalvinskas, owner of Distant Lands, a travel bookstore in Pasadena, 
said he was not surprised by Hunter's closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunter's had an image problem," he said. "They had a good selection, but they 
needed to upgrade their image of a cold, basic, white room with books to 
compete with the Super Crown." 
</P>
<P>
 But the former owner of Hunter's Books, Lewis F. Lengfeld, said location, not 
competition, was the main reason for the store's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lake Avenue is not a classy area," Lengfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Smith, owner of the Alhambra Bookstore, said a Waldenbooks opened across 
the street from him several years ago and the only reason his 
16,000-square-foot store is still in business is that it's easy for him to make 
the rent -- he owns the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has been in the same location for 30 years, said his sales have 
dropped 25% during the past year, a decline he attributes to the chains and to 
discount department stores such as Target and K Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 To stay alive, Smith has been giving discounts on bestsellers, selling books 
in bulk to teachers and doing special orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Publishers give a huge discount to the chains because they buy in large 
volume," he said. "They sell books at prices I could never afford to." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is not alone in his complaints against certain publishers. Last May, the 
American Booksellers Assn., which represents 4,552 retail bookstores 
nationwide, filed an antitrust lawsuit against five U.S. publishers, charging 
them with unfair and illegal practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit accuses the publishers, including Houghton Mifflin Company Inc., of 
violating federal antitrust laws by offering the chains lower prices for bulk 
buys. The suit also claims that the publishers routinely make payments to 
bookstore chains so the chains will advertise their books and place the books 
in favorable places within the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishers have responded by declaring that the booksellers' group cannot 
legally bring a single case on behalf of an unspecified number of bookstores, 
said David Kaye, general counsel for St. Martin's Press, one of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bookstores have to file a complaint themselves," Kaye said. "The suit, as 
is, is too vague and more of a political move than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The case is awaiting a hearing in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the Northern California Independent Booksellers Assn. successfully 
sued Avon and Bantam, two of the largest publishers of mass-market paperback 
books, for giving better discounts to Crown Books than to the several hundred 
small stores the association represented. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no damages were awarded, the case led Avon Books and Bantam to offer 
independents the same discount as chains, said Hut Landon, president of the 
Northern California association. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Weaver, general counsel for Houghton Mifflin, said discounts on quantity 
purchases are not unique to bookselling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Competition is competition," Weaver said. "I have sympathy for a small store 
when a chain opens up across the street, but they just have to find a way to 
distinguish themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Many specialty and secondhand stores scattered throughout the area are 
successfully distinguishing themselves by selling only used and rare books and 
catering to more specialized tastes.  
</P>
<P>
 At Cliff's Books in Pasadena, a disorderly array of a quarter of a million 
books, records and comics jam the narrow shelves. Upstairs, in the rare-book 
room, is an eclectic collection of antique books, some more than 100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the chains as any competition," said Mark Sailor, book buyer for 
Cliff's. "The price of new books is always escalating, and as a used-book 
store, we can offer more discounts across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff's, just down the street from Vroman's, stays open until midnight, 
thriving on street business. The two stores have a symbiotic relationship of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They send us a lot of customers, and we get a lot of their spillover," Sailor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailor said the only thing new-book stores have is new books at higher prices 
than his. In a twist on the megastore's slogan, he tells his customers, "If you 
bought it at Crown, you paid too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Other secondhand and specialty bookstores echo Sailor's claim that chains 
can't compete with their unique selections and environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come for more than the books, they come to talk about mysteries," said 
Barry Martin, owner of BOOK'em Mysteries, a sleek South Pasadena store 
specializing in mysteries and dark fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said his business is holding its own despite the presence of a Crown 
Books three blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Distant Lands' owner Kalvinskas said the Barnes & Noble two blocks away 
doesn't offer the same service and selection he does and, as a result, will 
send customers his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a decent selection, but not extensive," Kalvinskas said. "I have 
over 9,000 travel books, compared to their 1,500." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to selling books, stationery and office supplies, Vroman's 
sponsors a long list of monthly workshops and events that reads like a 
community college class schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In the month of October alone, there were poetry readings, writers' workshops, 
photography exhibits, story time for children, live music and a philosophy 
reading group. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there are the guest authors. Last year, Vroman's made local 
news when radio shock jock Howard Stern attracted more than 10,000 fans 
clamoring for him to sign his book "Private Parts." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always done outside events, which is one reason for our success," 
said Vroman's Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for many independent bookstores, the future remains cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next 10 years will be crucial for small bookstores," said Carol Seajay, 
publisher of the Feminist Bookstore Network, a booksellers' newsletter. She 
worries that what America reads is at stake. "If the chains take over, then 
who's buying books for America? A handful of chains, who are not known for 
buying progressive books," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feminist bookstore owner Beenen, who offers books by and for women, has sent 
out a letter to more than 500 people in Claremont appealing for their help and 
support in keeping the Wild Iris open. 
</P>
<P>
 Beenen, 59, who said she has invested her life savings in the store, hopes to 
keep it afloat through the Christmas season. If business increases, she plans 
to set up a women's resource center and a coffee area and to expand her teen 
and young-adult book section. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of her letter of appeal, she expressed her fear that megastores 
signify an end to stores like hers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My store creates a unique environment that supports, encourages and makes 
tangible the writing and artistic creativity of women," she wrote. ". . . This 
is something they won't find at Barnes & Noble."

<P>
 I am always a little suspicious of gorgeous restaurants. It makes me wonder 
whether the owners have had to scrimp somewhere -- say, in picking a chef. 
Fortunately for Gazzella, a very attractive Italian restaurant in Long Beach, 
the owners could get away with spending a bundle on the building. One of them 
is the chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Kazemi, who owns the restaurant with brothers Mike and Nader, learned his 
way around a saucepan in Milan, where he spent 10 years working in restaurants 
and hotels. The brothers opened the six-table Cafe Gazelle in Belmont Shore in 
1982, and its success spawned another small place, Martini. Three years ago the 
brothers went big time with Gazzella -- a handsome Italianate building with two 
floors of dining rooms (maroon drapes, comfortable chairs, frosted light 
fixtures) and a large bar (jazz and blues on weekends). 
</P>
<P>
 A good way to begin a meal here is with the timballo de melanzana e funghi 
($6.95), a mixture of mushrooms, capers, rice and garlic wrapped in sheets of 
baked eggplant, topped with a saffron-tinged cream sauce. Crostini di 
canestrelli ($6.95) is scallops sauteed in white wine, capers and oregano and 
set on garlic toast. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite among the 18 pasta selections is fettuccine Michelangelo ($6.95), 
topped with prosciutto, chicken, mushrooms and onions. Penne Russa ($6.95) 
features small tube pasta in a creamy sauce of tomato and vodka with green 
peppercorns.  
</P>
<P>
 For meat eaters, the highlights are broiled filet mignon in cognac-shallot 
cream sauce and grilled baby rack of Sonoma lamb served in its own juices 
($16.95 each). 
</P>
<P>
 An in-house pastry chef prepares a changing array of desserts ($4.25) that are 
wheeled by your table for consideration -- though if you've ordered some of the 
cream-sauce dishes, you might prefer to simply look wistfully at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazzella is at 525 E. Broadway, Long Beach. (310) 495-7252. Open Monday 
through Friday 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and every day 5 to 11 p.m.

PEOPLE: JOB-TRAINING PROGRAM ALLOWS MOTHER TO ACHIEVE HER CAREER GOAL

 Aurora Bermudo took a job at a Terminal Island tuna-packing plant because she 
had to support her family. But while she fileted fish for canning, she dreamed 
of working in the medical field.  
</P>
<P>
 Finding the job at the plant had been hard enough, she said, because she 
didn't have a college degree and had little work experience, having married at 
17. Then, in 1989, Bermudo got laid off from the packing plant, where she and 
her husband had worked for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 She faced unemployment while she had two children in college. "The first thing 
is that you are depressed -- you don't know what to do," she said. But when a 
group of job counselors from the Carson/Lomita/Torrance Private Industry 
Councilcame to the plant, Bermudo was first in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you need a job, you take what you can get," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Private Industry Council honored Bermudo, now 47, as one of the 
organization's successful alumni. In recognition of the success stories of the 
federal Job Training Partnership Act, Bermudo attended a luncheon with the 
governor in Sacramento last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolly Maldonado, one of the council's counselors, met Bermudo during the first 
frantic weeks after Bermudo was laid off.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was concerned about being able to provide an education for her sons," 
Maldonado recalls. Getting them the college education she never had was very 
important, Bermudo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to be like me," she said. "The one thing you cannot lose is 
your education." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bermudo, who had helped out at a pediatrician's office when she lived in the 
Philippines, enrolled in the Private Industry Council's 10-month medical 
assistant training program. 
</P>
<P>
 A star pupil, she had perfect attendance and a straight-A average. Classes 
were held four hours a day, five days a week, and students had three months of 
on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of her graduation in 1990, Bermudo landed a job in the pediatrics 
department at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Harbor City. As a medical 
assistant, she works 32 to 40 hours a week, helping doctors and licensed nurses 
care for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the council) weren't there, I don't know where I'd be right now," Bermudo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a couple of months, the second of her two sons will graduate from college, 
fulfilling her dream for them. For herself, she's considering more retraining. 
She has her sights set on attending culinary school, but until she saves up 
enough for tuition, she's happy working at Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best things about her job is watching the children grow up, she 
said. "Even when they're not your kids you get excited to see them get bigger 
and bigger."

 CRYING FOUL 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood High will not return to defend its title at the Pacific Shores 
basketball tournament this month because Coach Pat Roy believes his team was 
subjected to biased officiating in last season's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood defeated tournament co-host Redondo, 86-64, in the final at Redondo. 
One of the officials was Ken Greenleaf, a 1974 Redondo graduate and former Sea 
Hawk basketball standout who Roy claims did his best to prevent Inglewood from 
taking control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Greenleaf) called the game too tight," Roy said. "It was biased, without a 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would love to go back, but I'd rather pull out than put the kids through 
that again. I want our kids to be treated fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the scorebook, it's difficult to understand why Roy was so upset. 
Redondo was called for 22 fouls, one more than Inglewood, and drew a technical 
foul early in the fourth quarter that led to a 10-0 Inglewood run. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Coach Jim Nielsen denounced Roy's charges of officiating bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 180 degrees opposed to everything Roy has said," Nielsen said. "If that 
is his stand, it is unconscionable. I've always found Greenleaf to be a man of 
integrity. I liked him officiating games when I was at Mira Costa and I liked 
him officiating games when I was at North Torrance. He never sides with a team 
one way or another. I've never had any problems with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Roy doesn't want to be in the tournament, that's his decision, but the 
tournament will go on with him or without him." 
</P>
<P>
 Not having Inglewood means that the tournament will be without an attractive 
drawing card in Sentinel forward Paul Pierce, one of the nation's top prep 
players. Artesia, a tournament newcomer, and Peninsula are the top-seeded teams 
in the Pacific Shores, which begins Nov. 28 at Redondo and Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood opens the season Dec. 9 with a nonleague game at Westchester, which 
handed the Sentinels two of their four losses last season. CHANGE OF HEART 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony McNair, an All-Ocean League forward who took advantage of the new open 
enrollment policy to transfer to Inglewood at the start of the semester, has 
transferred back to Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things didn't work out," Roy said. "I recommended that he go back." COACH 
INJURED 
</P>
<P>
 Things went from bad to worse last week for Don Weems, the beleaguered Harbor 
College football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Weems, who took a leave of absence from Harbor last month because of an 
undetermined illness, was hit by a car and seriously injured Friday night while 
crossing Pacific Coast Highway near his home in Hermosa Beach. A spokesman for 
Kaiser Hospital in Harbor City, at the request of the family, refused to 
provide details of Weem's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Weem's accident stunned his colleagues at Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is pretty shocked," Athletic Director Jim O'Brien said. "We are all 
saying our prayers for him and his family. I don't know the extent of his 
injury, but I know it is very, very serious." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien denied rumors that Weems has already been told he will not return as 
Harbor's coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," O'Brien said. "The facts are he's out ill. Now with this, I 
don't know what his status is going to be. He obviously can't coach right now. 
To my knowledge, he fully plans on coming back." SECOND HOME 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have entered into an agreement to use a Carson gym as their 
practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA team's new home away from home is the Veterans SportsComplex, a 
state-of-the-art athletic club built by the city of Carson for $9 million. 
Opened in 1990, the SportsComplex features a gym with an NBA-sized court. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Yotsuya, Carson deputy city administrator, said the Clippers were 
looking for a permanent practice site when they contacted his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them tours and they liked what they saw," Yotsuya said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's three-year agreement with the Clippers includes an extension option 
and provides for visiting teams to also practice at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope it is a long time before they ever leave us," Yotsuya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yotsuya declined to disclose financial terms of the agreement, but he said 
that in the past year his office has become more aggressive in soliciting 
business from the professional sports and entertainment industries. Several 
television commercials have been filmed at the SportsComplex gym, including a 
Rold Gold Pretzels spot featuring "Seinfeld" co-star Jason Alexander and a Nike 
spot with Tim Hardaway of the Golden State Warriors. Two weeks ago, fitness 
expert Kathy Smith filmed her latest workout video at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Yotsuya said the additional revenue is being used for maintenance and other 
services at the SportsComplex. BREAKDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 It seems hard to believe given the importance of the outcome, but El Camino 
College football Coach John Featherstone suggested the Warriors may have taken 
their opponent too lightly Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 If they did, it was a huge mistake. Long Beach trampled error-plagued El 
Camino, 65-38, to take over first place in the Mission Conference Northern 
Division and end the Warriors' dream of winning the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the hardest thing for our kids to accept after the game," 
Featherstone said of the team's dashed national title hopes. "But it's hard to 
go undefeated, especially in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Featherstone said the Warriors (7-1) may have been overly confident about 
their chances of victory because they had beaten Rancho Santiago, 55-28, and 
Long Beach had lost to Rancho Santiago, 50-27. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not have thought it was as tough a game as we were getting into," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino was done in by mistakes. The Warriors lost four of eight fumbles, 
had a pass intercepted, gave up a safety, had a field goal blocked, had a 
touchdown called back by penalty and gave up a punt return for a TD. HARD TIMES 
</P>
<P>
 At this time last season, North Torrance High had already clinched a share of 
the Pioneer League football title under first-year Coach Tony Uruburu. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Uruburu, the second time around has not been nearly as 
enjoyable. North, now in the more competitive Bay League, remained the only 
winless team in the area after Friday's 27-14 loss to Leuzinger. The Saxons are 
0-9, 0-6 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, it's tough," Uruburu said of the team's poor record. "And I've 
got the ulcers to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Uruburu said the players have maintained a positive attitude and have 
improved every week. Junior free safety Joey Alofaituli, who made 19 tackles 
against Leuzinger, has been the team's brightest hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a young team," Uruburu said. "We'll be better next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons' last chance for a victory in 1994 comes Friday when they meet 
Inglewood (1-8, 1-5) at Coleman Stadium. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Outside hitter Cindy Weglarz of Bishop Montgomery, the 12th-ranked girls' 
volleyball team in the state, has given an unwritten commitment to attend 
Loyola Marymount and play volleyball for the Lions. Weglarz will join her 
sister Nelly, a Loyola freshman, on the team next season. The Lions play 
Pepperdine at 7 p.m. Saturday in a key West Coast Conference match at Gersten 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Loyola Marymount men's basketball team will play its annual intrasquad 
game at 7:15 p.m. Thursday at Gersten Pavilion. The Lions were expected to sign 
two prep recruits this week: Tim Kennedy, a 6-6 forward from Serra High in San 
Francisco, and Jason Perry, a 6-6 forward from O'Dea High in Seattle. Wednesday 
was the first day of the one-week, early national signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peninsula High, 92-0 in girls' tennis since the school opened in 1991, 
begins its quest for a fourth consecutive Southern Section Division I title at 
2 p.m. today with a first-round playoff match against visiting Mater Dei. The 
Panthers (20-0) are seeded No. 1 in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mira Costa, the second-ranked girls' volleyball team in the state, opens the 
Division I playoffs at 7 tonight at home against either University of Irvine or 
El Toro. Standing between the Mustangs (17-0) and a ninth Southern Section 
title is top-seeded Newport Harbor, the nation's top-ranked team. In Division 
II, Bishop Montgomery (16-3) plays host to Lakewood tonight. ROB FERNAS

 South Gate High Coach Gary Cordray notched his 100th career coaching victory 
in the Rams' 26-14 victory Friday over Jefferson. Cordray, who also coached at 
Washington from 1978-81, has a record of 100-70-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a real goal to win 100, 150 or 200 games," Cordray said. "I 
like to think my success as a coach comes from doing a lot of studying game 
film and being prepared but I don't think of this victory as a milestone. It's 
just means I've been around the game a long time."

<P>
 Cordray, 48, led South Gate to the 1988 City Section 3-A Division title and 
Southeastern Conference titles in 1988 and 1989, but he cites a 28-19 victory 
over Wilson as a first-year coach at Washington to end the Mules' 42-game win 
streak as one of his most memorable victories. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th-year South Gate coach can garner another accolade tonight when the 
Rams play host to Fremont with the Southeastern Conference title on the line. 
South Gate (8-1) and Fremont (8-1) are 7-0 in conference.

 Bell Gardens is in danger of missing the playoffs for only the third time in 
18 years after forfeiting a 29-6 victory over Keppel on Oct. 14 because of an 
ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Keppel (4-5, 2-2) holds a one-game lead over Bell Gardens (3-6, 1-3) and

second-place St. Monica (6-2, 2-1), 23-20, on Friday to finish its league 
schedule 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Anthony plays host to Verbum Dei (0-3, 5-4) at Clark Field on Friday and

 The records keep coming for Long Beach City College quarterback Neo Aoga. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman from Long Beach Poly set a school record for completions and tied 
the mark for touchdown passes in a season in a 65-38 victory over previously 
unbeaten El Camino Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (8-1, 5-0) also clinched its second consecutive Mission Conference 
Northern Division title against El Camino (7-1, 3-1), the state's second-ranked 
team. The Vikings, who moved from eighth to fifth in the state rankings, close 
out the regular season at Mt. San Antonio (3-4-1, 0-4) Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ratings really don't matter," Aoga said. "We could be No. 1 and come out and 
lose. We just wanted to play for the conference title. We just tried to play 
our game and not get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Aoga completed 17 of 36 passes for 247 yards to bring his season total to 156 
completions to surpass the mark of 146 set by Dennis Dummit in 1968. Aoga's two 
touchdown passes tied Dummit's record of 19. He also rushed for 100 yards and 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Palomar on Oct. 22, Aoga set single-game records for passing with 454 
yards and seven touchdowns. Through nine games, he also passed for a record 
2,462 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought about breaking all these records that had stood for 30 
years," Aoga said. "If we just played, the coaches said everything would fall 
into place."

<P>
 After taking 16 votes, the Palos Verdes Library District board appointed a 
fifth trustee, community college Administrator Mary P. Borell. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees voted 3 to 1 on Nov. 2 to appoint the Rancho Palos Verdes resident, 
whose term will expire in November, 1995.Borell replaces Chris Tara, who 
resigned after taking a job in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Borell, 55, holds a doctorate in educational administration from Northwestern 
University and is the director of economic development for the Los Angeles 
Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 Borell said she wants to increase funds, hours and collections at the 
peninsula's three libraries through partnerships with businesses, schools and 
other libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The district received 13 applications, an unusually large number, for the 
unpaid position, said Linda Elliott, library district director. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott said the board used a voting system that eliminates candidates if they 
do not receive a set number of votes to narrow down the large field of 
candidates. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; RECALL EFFORT AGAINST COUNCILMAN PLANNED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty residents plan to circulate a petition to recall City Councilman Greg 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement filed with the city clerk's office Nov. 1, the residents stated 
they want to recall the first-term councilman for a number of reasons, 
including their claim that he hired a convicted child molester as his campaign 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents also opposed a vote he cast to approve a high-density project 
they said was opposed by many in the community and another vote he cast to 
eliminate after-school programs for children. They also said Hill was absent 
from more council meetings than any other council member. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff is outlandish, outrageous," said Hill, who added that he believes 
his critics should vote against him when his term expires rather than stage a 
recall effort in midterm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said he had no idea when he hired his campaign manager that the man was a 
convicted child molester and said the individual no longer works for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he defended his vote to approve a condominium complex, saying the 
project was supported by many in the community, and he defended his attendance 
record, which he said includes only two absences out of dozens of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the clerk finalizes the petition, the residents will have 90 days to 
collect 1,875 valid signatures to force a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was elected in 1993 to represent District 2, which includes the marina 
area. His term expires in spring of 1997. JAMES BENNING

 On New Year's Eve, city officials plan to transform downtown Hermosa Beach 
into a series of stages and concert halls where more than 25 artists will 
perform poetry, plays and music. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans are designed to give Southland residents an enriching and

 Pianist Dragana Bajalovic, one of the organizers, said she has received nearly

CARL'S JR. GETS OK FOR OUTLET IN LA CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a battle pitting one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Southern 
California against a hamburger mogul. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it was over, Carl Karcher, the man who built a hot dog and burger 
stand in South-Central Los Angeles into a multimillion-dollar fast-food chain, 
had won. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher, chairman emeritus of Carl Karcher Enterprises and pitchman for Carl's 
Jr., came himself to the La Canada Flintridge City Council meeting Monday night 
to win permission for a drive-through restaurant near the intersection of the 
Foothill (210) and Glendale (2) freeways, where an eight-screen cinema complex 
is planned. The proposed Carl's Jr. had met with sniffs from nearby residents, 
who said the brightly lit drive-throughs did not fit in with the nearby 
neighborhood, where homes fetch $600,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is, this is in La Canada," said Cindy Wilcox, a neighborhood 
leader who filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to OK the 
permit for a drive-through Carl's Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people will come from Los Angeles, Pasadena and Glendale?" wondered 
Brian Hummel. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rick Myers, "I don't think it's the character and integrity we want to 
see in La Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors said they were afraid the restaurant would bring crime and 
traffic to the peaceful streets near Descanso Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 But Karcher assured council members the restaurant would generally cater to 
theatergoers and city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say 90% of our restaurants are drive-throughs, and they never cause any 
problems," Karcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Gary Zentmyer, who is building the cinema complex, and city business 
leaders said the entire project, the biggest La Canada development in 30 years, 
would fall apart financially without the Carl's Jr. participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to have a great big grass weed lot for the next 20 years?" asked 
Paul Hartung, chairman of the local business support committee, referring to 
the project site. 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours of debate, the council voted 3 to 2 to deny Wilcox's appeal 
and support a drive-through with a provision it will review its hours of 
operation six months after it opens. It would be the city's third drive-through 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Joan C. Feehan, John W. Hastings and Mayor David Spence voted 
for the permit, saying the cinema complex was vital to the city. Council 
members Carol J. Liu and Jim Edwards dissented.

HESTER BRANCHES OUT HIS CAREER WITH RAMS; FOOTBALL: VETERAN RECEIVER HAD 
PROBLEMS WITH THE RAIDERS BUT HE'S JUST WHAT HIS LATEST TEAM NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billed as the next Cliff Branch when the Raiders spent a first-round draft 
pick on him in 1985, wide receiver Jessie Hester wound up running pass routes 
and hoping the quarterback wouldn't throw to him. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, watching Hester try to catch the football was like watching a leaky 
faucet. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop . . . Drop . . . Drop . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But six seasons after the Raiders traded him to Atlanta because of his 
inability to catch the ball, Hester has become a steady veteran starter with 
the Rams. He takes a 71-game catch streak into Sunday's sold-out game against 
the Raiders at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any negative things said about me (in college)," said Hester, a 
three-year starter at Florida State, "and then I came to L.A. and had all this 
pressure thrust on me being 'The Next Cliff Branch' and all of a sudden I was 
'doo-doo squat.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt bad." 
</P>
<P>
 It got so bad, Hester was making sure defensive backs stayed with him, 
step-for-step. Why drop the ball when you can hide behind the competition, he 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want the ball," he said. "I didn't want to shame myself, the 
organization, my family, myself, nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Hester admits he once probably deserved that reputation as the Roberto Duran 
of NFL wide receivers -- he was the man with the hands of stone. But he said 
four solid seasons in Indianapolis and the 71-game catch streak proved he 
doesn't deserve that knock now. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started out, people were saying I couldn't catch the ball," 
Hester said. "But go back and check the records. The past five or six seasons, 
I haven't let balls go on an everyday basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in those first three seasons with the Raiders, Hester watched the ball 
-- and his confidence -- slip through his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 He started every game as a rookie, catching a respectable 32 passes for 665 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But his productivity decreased with every dropped pass in the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He started only one game in 1986 and finished the season with 23 catches. He 
played in only 10 games the next season, catching only one pass in a reserve 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were tough catches that got away from me in crucial situations," Hester 
said. "I just didn't hold onto them. Maybe they were hard on me because I was a 
No. 1 draft pick and I was in the shadow of a Cliff Branch. Those were some big 
shoes to fill, to come right in as a young guy and they expect you to be a 
Branch right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just mentally shot from all the pressure that 'I can't do this and I 
can't do that.' I was used to people saying positive things about me, but all 
of a sudden the tide had turned and I just got in a serious funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started believing it, and it came true. I believed I couldn't play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders thought so too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Next Cliff Branch wasn't even the Next Dokie Williams, so the Raiders went 
shopping for wide receivers. They brought in James Lofton and Mervyn Fernandez 
in 1987, then signed Willie Gault and drafted Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown 
before the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester got the picture: they traded him to Atlanta for a fifth-round draft 
pick at end of the 1988 training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they brought in those guys," he said, "they gave up on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hester started three games with the Falcons, catching 12 passes. The Falcons 
cut him before the 1989 season, and he sat out the year before Indianapolis 
signed him as a free agent in March 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches in Indianapolis said they would give me a fresh start," he said. 
"They told me they had heard some stuff about me (that he couldn't catch), and 
I told them it wasn't true." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he proved it, averaging 57 catches the next four seasons. He caught a 
career-high 64 passes last season, then tested the market as an unrestricted 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, in need of a veteran wide receiver, settled for Hester, and signed 
him in June. 
</P>
<P>
 He impressed Ram coaches in training camp and earned a starting spot opposite 
Flipper Anderson by the opening day of the season. He has caught 19 passes for 
224 yards, and his 24-yard run on a reverse play against Denver last Sunday is 
the longest run from scrimmage by a Ram this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the job Jessie has done," Ram wide receiver Coach 
Steve Moore said. "He and Flipper have done a great job of working with our 
younger receivers too." 
</P>
<P>
 Hester remembers his struggles as a young receiver every time he works with 
Ram rookies Isaac Bruce and Chris Brantley. He remembers Marcus Allen, Todd 
Christensen and Branch giving him advice. 
</P>
<P>
 And he remembers playing against Raider teammates and all-pro defensive backs 
Mike Haynes and Lester Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough," Hester said. "It was real tough."

AFTER 12 YEARS, WORTHY TO CALL IT QUITS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The end of James Worthy's career, and the end of an era, will come today when 
the veteran small forward announces his retirement from the Lakers after 12 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 What would have been his 13th started last Friday, but Worthy has been with 
the team only two days since an Oct. 21 exhibition at the Forum because of the 
death of his mother. He attended two practices upon returning from services in 
his native North Carolina, but the Lakers put him on the injured list the day 
before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 Tendinitis in the left knee was cited, but the real reason was his lack of 
conditioning after the extended absence and, ultimately, to give him some extra 
time to consider his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of the unfortunate and unexpected loss of his mom, he has settled 
into deep contemplation on a number of matters in his life," said his agent, 
Frank Wheaton. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy is the last active link to the Lakers' Showtime era. Too often regarded 
as simply a complimentary player to Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he 
was the perfect fit for the signature fast-break offense and a key part of 
three NBA titles -- 1985, '87 and '88. He was the most valuable player of that 
last championship, a seven-game victory over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 He retires second in team history in steals, fourth in field goals, fifth in 
scoring, sixth in shooting percentage, eighth in assists and 10th in rebounds. 
Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Jerry West, with 14 seasons each, spent more time 
with the Lakers than the No. 1 pick from 1982, and the 12-plus years gave him 
the longest tenure with one team among active players. 
</P>
<P>
 His contract has two years left at $7.2 million for this season and $5.15 
million for 1995-96. Wheaton indicated that he expected the Lakers to honor the 
contract fully. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy had contemplated retiring during the summer but decided to return after 
meeting with West, the club's executive vice president, and owner Jerry Buss. 
He even said during training camp he was excited about his 13th season, 
although he would have had a more reduced role than ever after the acquisition 
of Cedric Ceballos. But that thinking apparently changed after the death of his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Wednesday whether Worthy might be making a hasty decision because of the 
tragedy, longtime friend Johnson said, "James never does that. He always thinks 
things out. He's an intelligent guy. He's doing what's best for him. I really 
believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kevin McHale, a long-time counterpart with the Boston Celtics and 
assistant general manager with the Timberwolves: "It's tough when your body 
starts giving out on you. It's a very hard thing to deal with. There's a time 
for everybody, and it seems to be James' time now."

TIMBERWOLVES CAN'T KEEP UP WITH JONES; LAKERS: ROOKIE GUARD IS IMPRESSIVE WITH 
31 POINTS AND FOUR BLOCKED SHOTS IN 122-99 VICTORY OVER MINNESOTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sunset of one career upon them, the Lakers got a glimpse at the dawn of 
another Wednesday night at the Target Center, with the Minnesota Timberwolves 
along as the witnesses and victims all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not credible enough, the New York Knicks will be glad to supply 
additional testimony. Maybe even the Detroit Pistons and Milwaukee Bucks too. 
Eddie Jones has been that impressive in his first four games as a pro, though 
never more than when he scored 31 points on 12-of-15 shooting and blocked four 
shots at shooting guard to lead the Lakers' 122-99 rout of the Timberwolves 
before 15,892. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Coach Del Harris said, "Eddie's getting everyone's attention on this 
trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had shown Harris enough during training camp and eight exhibition games 
to be named the starter despite no NBA experience, the coach even predicting 
that he could be a first-team all-rookie selection this season. Executive Vice 
President Jerry West has hardly been able to contain his enthusiasm over the 
No. 10 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the tough part. 
</P>
<P>
 Living up to the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opener last Friday at Detroit, Jones got in foul trouble, but still 
managed six rebounds in 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night at Milwaukee, he had 10 points, five rebounds and three steals 
in 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday at New York, the biggest challenge of the trip, he had 15 points, 
eight rebounds and six steals in 28 minutes. Only two Lakers had more than six 
steals all last season. 
</P>
<P>
 It took him only 26 minutes to turn the Timberwolves into wreckage and help 
the Lakers to a split of the season-opening four-game trip. Four blocked shots? 
The only teammates to have more than three during 1993-94 were 7-1 Vlade Divac 
and 6-11 Elden Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is 6-6 and a scrawny 190 pounds, but his stature is getting taller by 
the minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what impressed me?" Harris said. "That with that thin body, he is 
fearless. He goes after everything. He wasn't intimidated going into the pile 
(for a loose ball Tuesday) with (Charles) Oakley, (Patrick) Ewing and (Charles) 
Smith. And how about that block tonight on Donyell Marshall?" 
</P>
<P>
 That came late in the third quarter, when Marshall, the Timberwolves' 6-9 
rookie small forward, came down the right side with a clear path to the basket 
for a layup. At least it was clear until Jones came from behind and smacked the 
ball aside. The Laker bench, a few feet away, erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't fear anybody," Jones said. "I don't care who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are off today, when James Worthy will announce his retirement. Then 
the attention will turn back to the future Friday night, with the home opener 
against the Denver Nuggets, and with Jones heading into his first 
regular-season game at the Forum averaging 16 points, 5.8 rebounds and three 
blocked shots in only 27.3 minutes while shooting 59.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I wanted to play a lot better," he said. "I could have played a lot 
better against Milwaukee, the Knicks and even the first night against the 
Pistons." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Timberwolves? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I played great defense tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall would beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell, who went without a rebound in 24 minutes the first two games 
and got benched in the third, had 16 points, a game-high nine rebounds and two 
blocked shots in 24 minutes off the bench. . . . Cedric Ceballos scored 25 
points on 10-of-19 shooting. . . . Isaiah Rider led Minnesota with 27 points. . 
. . The Timberwolves are 0-4 and have lost all four games by an average of 22.1 
points. It gets worse. They announced before the game that point guard Micheal 
Williams will be sidelined six to eight weeks because of a heel injury.

NHL HOPES UP AS TALKS RESUME; HOCKEY: POSSIBLE ENTRY-LEVEL SALARY STRUCTURE AND 
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CREATE OPTIMISM THAT LOCKOUT MAY END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Optimism surged Wednesday that the NHL lockout might be near an end, fueled by 
reports that players are willing to adopt an entry-level salary structure and 
move toward the owners' position on limiting salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's negotiations in Buffalo, N.Y., will largely determine whether those 
are false hopes or steppingstones toward resolving the 41-day-old stoppage and 
starting the season by early or mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 A management source said that if negotiators make significant progress today, 
they will meet throughout the weekend in hopes of producing an agreement next 
week. If they don't have a comprehensive accord but agree on key issues, owners 
would consider accepting the no-strike pledge previously offered by players as 
long as players agree to a moratorium on renegotiating contracts or contract 
extensions until a deal is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if they can't build on the atmosphere of compromise created Monday, 
there's little hope a meaningful season will be played, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been enough pain extracted so a deal is strikeable," said one club 
executive. "But if Bob (Goodenow, head of the players' association) waits until 
the last minute to make what he thinks will be a better deal, more hawks will 
be lining up against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe he's got a unique opportunity to make a deal right now. But 
if he puts it off, the doves are going to grow talons." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for players' compromises, the NHL would restore guaranteed 
contracts and the other economic givebacks it imposed at the start of training 
camp. If pushed, it would drop the payroll levy it proposed as a means of 
subsidizing small-market clubs. The union has opposed the levy, contending the 
measure -- which peaked at 122% -- would inhibit clubs' willingness to sign 
players and depress salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs have presented a united front publicly on the levy plan, but it's known 
that many would happily drop it if players would agree to the entry-level 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a hard salary cap, the the NHL has proposed a compensation pool 
that would be divided among all clubs to pay rookies each season. Clubs that 
exceed their allotment, as they might to pay an exceptional rookie, would pay a 
penalty. Salaries in players' second and third seasons would follow a 
predetermined formula and could be supplemented by bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, players have differed on rookie salary controls. Many 
veterans urged the union to accept it, but Goodenow said adopting any form of 
salary restriction would set a bad precedent. That reasoning united them for a 
time, but the duress of missing two paychecks is opening the cracks in their 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke, who last week said he feared the season 
would be lost, said Wednesday he was "optimistic that a deal can be worked out 
in time to save the season." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "We will find out in the next couple of days whether there is 
momentum or not. I think it (Monday's meeting) is a real good start. It was the 
best discussion we had in months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next meeting is key in my mind because that good start could turn into 
momentum or it could grind to a halt and that, to me, is going to be the key of 
whether I am optimistic or not." 
</P>
<P>
 However, a league official said he sees no imminent resolution and disputed 
reports of agreement on the entry-level salary structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had agreed to it, I'd be very happy right now and I'm not very 
happy," he said. "Are we optimistic about saving the season? Yes. Are we 
optimistic that a deal is about to be made? No. We've made some movements . . . 
and we've seen nothing in return that would give us cause for real optimism. Of 
course, that doesn't mean we won't see a smiling face on the other side of the 
table today." 
</P>
<P>
 Through Wednesday, 218 games have been missed. The NHL has canceled 14 games 
from each club's 84-game schedule.

RAIDERS' GAME PLANS COME OFF UNBALANCED; PRO FOOTBALL: OPPONENTS ABLE TO KEY ON 
BROWN AND WILLIAMS, WHILE SPEEDSTERS GET LITTLE USE.

<P>
 Tim Brown had a thought-provoking conversation with Kansas City's Derrick 
Thomas when he left the field after the Raiders' 13-3 loss to the Chiefs on 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "I can't believe that we didn't score a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas: "Why not? All we had to do was key on you and Harvey Williams because 
that's your offense." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a point that is painfully true to Brown and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Chiefs, Brown and Williams combined for 215 of the Raiders' 248 
yards in offense. Throw in Brown's 88 yards for five punt returns and you have 
an extremely limited one-two attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler said Wednesday it is important to spread the Raider 
offense around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we're all conscious of," he said. "We need to continue to work 
at it and try to get some things done. I think that we do a good job in 
practice, but come game time, we're not getting it done like we should." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Raiders' last three games combined, Hostetler has completed 53 passes, 
37 to either Brown or Williams. Also, Williams has carried 80 of the Raiders' 
89 rushes. Hostetler carried the other nine. 
</P>
<P>
 So what has happened to the Raiders' other weapons, such as fullback Tom 
Rathman and receivers Alexander Wright, Rocket Ismail, James Jett and even 
Daryl Hobbs? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been answering that question for two weeks now," Raider Coach Art Shell 
said. "Everybody has to work to get open, and if you work to get open the 
quarterback will find you. That's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Wright and Jett did not want to discuss their roles in the 
offense as the Raiders limp into Sunday's game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak for (Hostetler) and Rocket and Jett and all those guys," Brown 
said. "All I can speak for is myself. When the route is called, I try to get 
open. And I try to do what I can do to get (Hostetler's attention)." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the Raiders' lack of variety has been pass-protection problems 
with the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the Raiders turned to a ball-control running game with 
Williams when left tackle Gerald Perry suffered an ankle injury. To spark this 
type of offense, Shell inserted veteran Robert Jenkins at left tackle and 
replaced Bruce Wilkerson with Greg Skrepenak at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Atlanta and Houston, both weaker opponents, the Raiders were able to 
get away with the strategy, but not against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs took advantage by keying to stop the run and using a variety of 
basic zone defenses to double-cover Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran bracket coverage on Tim the whole game," Kansas City safety Charles 
Mincy said. "When you have a go-to guy like him, it's easy to concentrate on 
him wherever he goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally such a plan leaves other receivers open, but the Raiders were limited 
because they used tight end Anthony Glover and Rathman in the backfield to 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping a lot of guys in to protect," Hostetler said. "A lot of cases, 
we had three receivers out with seven guys covering. That puts you in a tough 
situation sometimes. We just need to find the right mix between protecting and 
getting people out in patterns, and then getting the ball to the right people." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler has been criticized for ignoring receivers other than Brown, and for 
holding on to the ball too long in the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's been happening over the last three or four weeks is simply, if 
there's a ball that's been thrown, I've been put in position to go get the 
ball," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's going to change. It's going to have to change. In order for 
this team to go anywhere, we have to have productivity from everybody. I don't 
mind catching eight, nine, 10 balls a game. We've been doing it the last couple 
of weeks and won. But when you lose, all of a sudden it becomes a big deal to 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In the exhibition season, the Raiders were so deep at wide receiver they sent 
Charles Jordan to Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But the receivers have not done much since: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wright has seven catches for 103 yards and no touchdowns after catching 27 
for 462 yards and four touchdowns last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jett, an Olympic gold medal-winning sprinter, has five catches for 80 yards 
and no touchdowns after catching 33 for 382 yards and four touchdowns a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ismail has 16 catches for 248 yards and one touchdown after catching 26 for 
353 yards and one touchdown in limited action last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hobbs, the team's top receiver in exhibitions, has not played the last two 
weeks after catching five passes for 52 yards in five of the first six games of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, we're just not getting it done in the passing game the 
way it should be," Shell said, "but there's some things that we're working on 
to try to make that better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this week we'll be able to snap out and get more people involved 
in what we're doing and be more productive in our passing game than we have in 
recent weeks."

HE NEVER GOT SICK OF SCORING; PREP FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK JONAS LEWIS' 
10-TOUCHDOWN GAME LEAVES BEAUMONT HIGH FEELING GREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jonas Lewis was not expecting to make high school football history when he 
stepped onto the field for Beaumont High against Hemet West Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the 5-foot-10, 185-pound senior running back had been suffering 
from an upset stomach the entire week leading up to the Oct. 21 Skyline League 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little doubt who was hurting more after Lewis scored 10 
touchdowns despite repeatedly going to the sideline to get sick during 
Beaumont's 69-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis gained 302 yards in 13 carries and scored eight touchdowns rushing, one 
on a 42-yard reception and another on a 38-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
 He left at the end of the third quarter because game officials and West Valley 
Coach Tom Wallace asked Beaumont's Gary Harvey to keep him out. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Lewis left the game one touchdown shy of the state's 65-year-old 
single-game record, but it was a remarkable performance nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Greene of Coronado set the state record of 11 touchdowns in 1929, and 
the only challenge to that mark until Lewis' came in 1952 when Joe Silva of 
Gustine scored nine times in a 74-0 victory over LeGrand. 
</P>
<P>
 Few thought Lewis would have much of a game when he left early on to get sick 
on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two plays later Jonas taps me on the shoulder and tells me he's ready to go 
back in," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 On his first carry, Lewis ran 31 yards to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he returned to the bench showing signs of the upset stomach. Harvey 
thought Lewis was through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next thing I knew, he was tapping me on the shoulder again, telling me he was 
ready," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach sent Lewis in . . . and Lewis scored again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing I could do, it just kept coming out," Lewis said of his 
vomiting. "I felt like I had to throw up on the field. I knew the only way I 
could get back to the bench and throw up was to score. I can't think of a 
better incentive to score a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his condition, he never considered sitting out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was close at the time," he said. "I knew I couldn't let the guys 
down. I knew they needed me. I didn't want my teammates to lose respect for me. 
If a game is important, I won't come out unless I can't walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also received motivation from his mother, Jolyn Winters. 
</P>
<P>
 When she heard her son was suffering, she went to the field and told him to 
keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chewed him out for not telling me he was sick earlier in the week," said 
Winters, a high school referee for girls' basketball, softball and volleyball. 
"I told him he'd already come this far, he might as well complete the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Winters' actions were not surprising. She coached Lewis' Pop Warner team when 
he was 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's done everything for me," Lewis said. "She's my inspiration, my 
backbone. She's taught me a lot about the game of football." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is Riverside County's leading rusher with 1,834 yards and 27 touchdowns. 
He is averaging 12 yards per carry. He followed his 10-touchdown performance by 
rushing for 250 yards and scoring four times in a 39-7 victory over Banning two 
weeks ago. Last Friday, he rushed for 193 yards and three touchdowns in a 26-17 
victory over Riverside Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaumont is enjoying one of its better seasons. The Cougars are 6-3, 4-0 in 
the Skyline League, and have secured a berth in next week's Southern Section 
Division IX playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey has spent a lot of time with Lewis, who transferred from nearby Moreno 
Valley High two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a great substitute father for me," Lewis said. "I can talk to him 
about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the talk revolves round college scholarships. Nebraska, UCLA and 
California have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan on playing Division I football," Lewis said. "I feel I'm good enough 
to play at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jonas is a running back with power, but he possesses the ability to go in any 
direction," the coach said. "You never know which way he is going to go." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter which way he goes, he often ends up in the end zone.

BRIBERY SCANDAL ROCKS BRITAIN; SOCCER: TABLOID ACCUSES GOALKEEPER GROBBELAAR OF 
ACCEPTING MONEY TO THROW GAMES IN THE ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The British sports world was rocked Wednesday by published allegations against 
a renowned soccer goalkeeper, which, if proven, would constitute one of the 
greatest athletic scandals here in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-selling Sun newspaper, an English tabloid, accused Bruce Grobbelaar, 
a goalie who was a national star during 13 seasons with Liverpool, of accepting 
bribes to throw certain matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Grobbelaar, 37, Wednesday postponed a flight to Zimbabwe to play with that 
country's national team, in order to remain in England and deny the charges 
raised by the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun said it has film of him accepting money and admitting he threw a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never attempted to throw a game in my life," Grobbelaar told the Sun 
when confronted with its evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The central allegation made by the Sun is that Grobbelaar received about 
$65,000 for fixing a match last season -- before he transferred from Liverpool 
to Southampton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun claimed a shadowy Far Eastern syndicate netted more than $4.5 million 
in betting on a match in which Liverpool, with Grobbelaar in goal, lost to 
Newcastle, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper also said Grobbelaar attempted unsuccessfully to throw three 
other games, including last Saturday's Southampton-Manchester City match, which 
ended in a 3-3 draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Southampton director Lawrie McMenemy said Wednesday that Grobbelaar had 
emphatically denied the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 The English Football Assn., the sport's governing body in England, launched an 
"urgent and thorough" investigation of Grobbelaar, one of the highest-profile 
players in the Premier League and winner of more than a dozen major trophies 
while at Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Gerald Ashby, who was in charge of the Newcastle-Liverpool game, said 
he was "absolutely amazed" by the newspaper's claims, adding: "There was 
nothing in the game that raised any suspicions in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun printed Wednesday what it claimed was a still from a videotape in 
which it said Grobbelaar is shown accepting an envelope containing about 2,000 
pounds sterling (about $3,200) from a former business partner. The partner 
acted on behalf of the newspaper, which said it conducted a two-month 
investigation of the soccer star's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Durban, South Africa, Grobbelaar moved to Zimbabwe with his parents 
when he was a child. His Zimbabwe citizenship enables him to play for that 
country in international competitions such a the African Nations Cup and the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Grobbelaar played for the Vancouver Whitecaps in the North American Soccer 
League before being signed by Liverpool, where he developed a reputation as a 
colorful, popular player, often given to clowning on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The last major soccer bribery case in England was in 1965, when several 
players, including one English national team player, were jailed and banned 
from the sport for life because of their role in a match-fixing scandal.

 As far as Ted Williams is concerned, Babe Ruth is the best hitter ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth is followed by Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Rogers Hornsby, Joe DiMaggio, Ty 
Cobb, Stan Musial, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Henry Aaron and Willie Mays, according 
to Williams' Top 20 list in the Nov. 14 issue of the Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of my list is that the major ingredients of the complete hitter 
are No. 1 power and No. 2 getting on base," he said. "Why is getting on base so 
important? Here I hit .340 and he hits .340. But I hit 40 home runs and he hits 
20. Now I've got more total bases. He walks 38 times and I walk 138. Getting on 
base is how you score runs. Runs win ballgames."

FREUDENBERG COMMITS TO BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Modena senior Brandi Freudenberg, twice named The Times girls' tennis 
player of the year, has orally committed to UCLA and is expected to sign a 
letter of intent with the school Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday was the first day of the early signing period, which runs through 
Nov. 16. Freudenberg and many of the county's top athletes are expected to sign 
during the one-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 Freudenberg chose UCLA over Arizona, San Diego State, UC Santa Barbara, Fresno 
State and Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, she won the Century League singles championship for the third time 
in four years, beating defending champion Faye DeVera of Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin guard Doug Gottlieb and Mark Seaton, a Servite forward, have signed 
letters of intent with Division I basketball programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb signed a letter of intent with Notre Dame, Tiller basketball Coach 
Andy Ground said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaton said Wednesday that he had signed with Stanford. The 6-foot-9 forward 
averaged 12 points and eight rebounds for the Friars last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb and Seaton are two of six Orange County boys' basketball players 
expected to sign this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The other four are Mater Dei's Clay McKnight (UC Irvine) and Shaun Jackson 
(Wyoming), St. Margaret's Damian Raibon (San Francisco) and Sonora's Craig 
Clark (San Jose State). 
</P>
<P>
 In softball, Marina's Marcy Crouch said she signed a letter of intent 
Wednesday with Stanford. Crouch, also a standout in soccer and volleyball, said 
she will only play softball as a freshman but may play an additional sport 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top county players expected to sign early include Foothill's Michelle 
Churnock (Arizona), Ocean View's Kathy Ponce (Arizona State) and Cypress' Julie 
Adams (UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wednesday is the first day of the early signing period for most 
sports, the signing period for football is Feb. 1-April 1. The signing period 
for field hockey, soccer, women's volleyball and water polo begins Feb. 8. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Kristy Kierulff, a standout in girls' volleyball and high jump for Esperanza, 
has orally committed to Long Beach State, Aztec volleyball Coach Kurt Kersten 
said.

 Kierulff, a 5-foot-9 outside hitter, was a three-year starter in volleyball 
and was named All-Empire League last season and All-Sunset League this season.

UCLA'S HARRICK AGAIN LANDS TWO OF THE BEST; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TOP PROSPECTS 
JELANI MCCOY AND BRANDON LOYD SIGN LETTERS OF INTENT WITH THE BRUINS.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jim Harrick, who nearly lost his job two years ago for failing to recruit many 
big-name basketball players, appears to have reversed that trend for the second 
consecutive year.  
</P>
<P>
 Harrick took advantage of the NCAA's one-week early-signing period Wednesday 
as UCLA received letters of intent from highly regarded Jelani McCoy of St. 
Augustine in San Diego and Brandon Loyd of Tulsa (Okla.) Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins have two remaining scholarships to offer during the spring signing 
period in April. They hope to sign either Paul Pierce of Inglewood or Tommy 
Prince of Compton Dominguez, perhaps both. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's 1994 freshman class is considered one of the best in the nation, led by 
6-foot-10 center omm'A Givens and 6-9 forward J.R. Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy is regarded as one of the country's top prospects. The 6-10 
center/forward is described as an instinctive shot blocker who averaged 22 
points and 12 rebounds per game as a junior. Loyd is a 6-1 guard. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC, meanwhile, George Raveling's recent car accident appears to have 
hindered his earlier recruiting efforts. The Trojans' only signing Wednesday 
was 6-2 guard Damion Dawson of Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce and Prince, considered the state's top two prospects, also are 
considering USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC women's basketball team fared much better. Coach Cheryl Miller's first 
recruiting season saw 6-2 guard Jody Parriott of Cerritos Valley Christian and 
6-3 center Jenny Circle of Menlo Park Sacred Heart Prep sign letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable signings Wednesday included 6-0 guard Doug Gottlieb of Tustin to 
Notre Dame; 6-6 forward Donte Quinine of Rowland to Utah, and 5-10 guard Duane 
Davis of Fairfax to Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford signed two of the Southland's top prospects in 6-0 guard Arthur Lee 
of North Hollywood and 6-9 forward Mark Seaton of Anaheim Servite.

 Jennifer Capriati returned to tennis Wednesday night, looking much more like a 
young phenomenon than a troubled schoolgirl who was arrested for carrying 
marijuana. Capriati lost to Anke Huber of Germany, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, in the first 
round of the $750,000 Virginia Slims of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I played good," Capriati said. "It was really great to be out there 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati had not played a tournament match since Aug. 31, 1993, when she was 
eliminated by little-known Leila Meskhi in the first round of the U.S. Open. 
She left the tour and went through months of personal and legal problems. Golf

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID; COLEMAN SETTLES IN, SETTLES DOWN AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA freshman setter Kim Coleman arrived in Westwood with minor expectations 
-- at most -- which is confusing in itself. Why would someone with Coleman's 
credentials not expect to stand out for the Bruin women's volleyball team? 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, is what really confounded her teammates: despite her talent, 
Coleman couldn't seem to convince herself. Instead, she tip-toed around like 
someone who didn't belong. 
</P>
<P>
 Confused? 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman was too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt intimidated," Coleman said. "But, really, I don't want this to sound 
like a negative story, because it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are getting better every day. It's about a million times better than 
at the beginning. UCLA is such a great school and I love it here." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Coleman done riding her emotional roller coaster, she's reverted 
to the confident on-court demeanor that helped her excel at Corona del Mar 
High. Coleman is a key component for the Bruins, who are ranked third in the 
nation by the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin Coach Andy Banachowski wasn't overly concerned by Coleman's early 
behavior. Understandably, though, he's pleased her turnaround didn't take too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just takes some time," Banachowski said. "Everything is so new to Kim 
right now, but she's been coming along great." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, 18, is the Bruins' No. 2 setter behind sophomore Kelly Flannigan. 
Coleman (6 feet 1) has started four matches and provides a spark with games on 
the line, Banachowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's done really well coming off the bench," Banachowski said. "She's been 
our 'Jim Dandy' to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go to her when we're in trouble (because) she gives us steadiness with 
consistent outside sets. I'm very pleased with her presence." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman averages 8.85 assists per game. She set personal highs in assists (44) 
and digs (11) Oct. 1 against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already played more as a freshman," Coleman said, "than I thought I 
would play all four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Her strong play is what Banachowski hoped for, and more, when he persuaded 
Coleman to turn down Colorado, Hawaii, Pepperdine and UC Santa Barbara to join 
the Bruins after helping the Sea Kings win consecutive mythical national 
champions in her junior and senior seasons as an all-county outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the initial stress? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing but your average growing pains, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it would be hard to leave home, but it was," Coleman said. "I 
mean, I went from having 10 students in one class to 500. I've grown a lot in 
the last three months." 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that she no longer takes her athleticism, and what it's brought 
her, for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't really hit me until I got here, but athletes are treated so well," 
she said. "We get all the support we need, we get tutors and everywhere we go 
it's first class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel so incredibly lucky to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former El Toro High standout Michelle Mauney also contributes to the Bruins' 
success. The 6-2 junior middle blocker is UCLA's top reserve at her position 
and has played in 24 matches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii positioned itself to gain a share of the Big West Conference women's 
volleyball championship by splitting two pivotal matches with Long Beach State 
last week at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Chase and Brandi Brooks are important parts of No. 6 Hawaii's title run. 
Chase, a six-foot junior middle blocker from Pacifica High, is second on the 
Rainbow Wahine in kills with 240 and fourth in the conference in hitting 
percentage (.366). 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sarah) plays with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement that really gets the 
team motivated," Rainbow Wahine Coach Dave Shoji said. "She is a finesse player 
who always seems to make something happen with her court awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, a 6-1 senior outside hitter from Estancia High, is seventh on the team 
in kills. "When she is on," Shoji said, "positive things happen for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California All-American senior linebacker Jerrott Willard (Corona del Mar 
High) is having another fine season, despite his team's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard, a semifinalist for the Dick Butkus and Lombardi awards, is one of the 
few good things going for the Bears (3-6, 2-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference). He 
has 82 tackles, including 57 unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerrott Willard is as good a football player as I've ever been around in my 
20 years of coaching," Cal Coach Keith Gilbertson said. "He's relentless and I 
don't think you'll find a tougher player in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice the conference's leading tackler, Willard has 457 in his career and is 
third on the Bears' all-time list. With only two games remaining, however, 
Willard probably won't overtake the top two. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ortega (1986-89) tops the list with 525. Hardy Nickerson (1983-86) is 
second with 501.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; ROBINSON LAUDS JOHNSON'S LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson indicated Tuesday that the major force in USC's 23-10 
victory at Washington State was quarterback Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for you to handle an opponent like that, the quarterback has to play 
a key role," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're familiar with a Buddy Ryan type of club that's knocking the ball loose 
and all that stuff. . . . The quarterback, if he's not going to make something 
big happen, he can't let something big happen for the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Rob did a great job of audibilizing when he had to, of getting out of 
plays that had the potential of being disastrous if he hadn't recognized some 
things. He kept us moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "After accomplishing that, he made five or six big plays that were very 
impressive. It was one of his best games as a competitor, certainly coming off 
four weeks of inactivity." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Johnson's first full game since spraining his right ankle Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC's defense, against its last two foes, California and Washington State, has 
given up only two first downs on 30 third downs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson, on the 62- and 39-yard games by his running backs, Shawn 
Walters and Rodney Sermons, at Washington State: 
</P>
<P>
 "When a back gets big holes in the line and runs for 160 yards, that's not as 
impressive to me as a back getting 50 in a game like we had at Washington 
State, as tight as they play the run." EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: TIARA MIGHT MEAN A CROWN AT AZUSA PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things have turned around for the Azusa Pacific women's volleyball program. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly all of it can be attributed to middle blocker Tiara Ainuu. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Azusa Pacific was 12-20 and finished sixth of seven teams in the 
Golden State Athletic Conference. With Ainuu being the only major change on the 
team this season, the Cougars are 20-9 and second in the GSAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad influence from someone who was ready to give up volleyball a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ainuu was a member of the Samoan national team out of high school and received 
a scholarship to play for Carroll College in Montana. Two uncles who attended 
Carroll told her it was a great place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they forgot to tell me how cold it is," Ainuu said. "Winter was brutal 
for me. It was below 30 degrees when I was used to around 80 in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, Ainuu was far from her family for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still liked it there -- I had many friends that I had to leave -- but the 
problem was, it was getting to the point where volleyball was everything. I 
wasn't myself anymore. When I came home at Christmas, all my friends said I had 
changed -- that I wasn't sweet any more. The game wasn't fun any more." 
</P>
<P>
 So Ainuu, a six-foot junior, decided to quit. Not only the team. The school. 
The weather. Everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother-in-law started attending the School of Theology in Claremont in 
1992 and suggested she move to Southern California, where she would like the 
climate and have family nearby. After looking at several schools, Ainuu decided 
to enroll at Azusa Pacific last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one at APU knew I had played volleyball before, and I didn't go to APU's 
volleyball games because I knew it might make me want to play. I really did not 
want to play." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a year, Ainuu decided she missed the game, and her family persuaded 
her to give it another try. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's fun again," she said. "Volleyball in California is totally 
different. It's more competitive, but I like it better." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Azusa Pacific, which is seeded second in the NAIA Far West Regional 
playoffs and will play host to Dominican at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 La Verne is still in control, but Redlands pulled itself into the race for the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference football championship 
by upsetting Occidental, 30-6, last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne, 8-0 and 5-0 in the conference, needs only a tie at Occidental on 
Saturday to win the championship. A victory by Occidental (6-2, 4-1) and one by 
Redlands (5-2-1, 4-1) over Whittier would create a three-way tie. There are no 
tiebreakers because there is no automatic bid to the NCAA Division III playoffs 
by winning the SCIAC title. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands' defense was impressive in its victory. Occidental, with its wishbone 
offense, had averaged 236 yards rushing, but Redlands held Occidental to 145 
yards and took advantage of six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle linebacker Brett Wixom has been a key player for Redlands all season. 
</P>
<P>
 If that name sounds familiar, it should. 
</P>
<P>
 Wixom was the SCIAC's defensive player of the year as a sophomore three years 
ago. But he sat out most of his junior season because of a broken hand and 
played in only three games last season before tearing an arm muscle that 
required surgery. He was granted an extra year of eligibility and again is a 
leading candidate for defensive player of the year. He has 93 tackles nine for 
losses, one interception and caused a fumble. 
</P>

SUN DEVILS HAVE A PLUMMER, BUT TOO MANY LEAKS TO PLUG; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: 
SOPHOMORE QUARTERBACK QUICKLY LEARNS THAT HE CAN'T DO IT ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, he was going to Stanford. Bill Walsh liked him enough to give him a day 
of personal attention in the big stadium after a summer quarterback camp. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stanford liked Scott Frost a little more than Jake Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was going to Washington State. It was not too far from his home in 
Boise, Ida., and his parents could see him play. Also, it was a quarterback 
school -- Drew Bledsoe, a No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, went there. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Bruce Snyder, Arizona State's coach, stepped in at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder needed Plummer. He needed a lot of other players too. Still does. 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't need a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He has Plummer, who UCLA Coach Terry Donahue says is "a future superstar." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder agrees, but he tempers the praise with a challenge to himself: "I think 
there's a chance of that if we do a good job of recruiting for him." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pitch he makes daily, and you get the idea he draws recruits a verbal 
picture of Plummer, arm cocked and saying, "I Need a Few Good Men." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly if they are wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if I were a young kid who can run and catch, I'd want to go to a 
place where there's a quarterback who can get it to me," Snyder said, still 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer has done that, completing 135 of 249 passes for 1,819 yards and 12 
touchdowns in a season in which he has been the Arizona State offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer has thrown successfully while a running game has been virtually 
nonexistent and despite an offensive line that is young and ever-changing 
because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a difficult situation for a 19-year-old quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing worse might have been suffering through a similar fate as an 
18-year-old freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State was struggling with quarterback Grady Benton, whose arm hurt and 
who couldn't seem to spark an offense. Plummer had won the backup role and 
connected with Carlos Artis on a 78-yard touchdown play the first time he threw 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Six games into the season, Plummer found himself starting and throwing for 237 
yards and two touchdowns against Oregon. A week later, in somewhat familiar if 
disappointing territory at Stanford, he found himself beginning a four-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victories came over UCLA, which Arizona State faces Saturday night 
in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been a heady experience for anybody. For a freshman, it was 
downright scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came in, I thought I would redshirt and get a year off from 
football, maybe playing scout team to learn what it was all about," Plummer 
said. "But when I won the backup spot, I was thrust into being prepared in case 
the starter went down, and that's what happened. He injured his shoulder and 
they had to call on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's not that simple. The offense was ineffective and the Sun Devils 
were 2-3 with Benton as the starter, 4-2 with Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jake took over the reins about the fifth or sixth game of the season and kind 
of just ran around, because he didn't totally understand everything," Snyder 
said. "But he made some plays." 
</P>
<P>
 He was erratic, running a slimmed-down offense designed to allow him to play 
more and think less. 
</P>
<P>
 He was exciting and frequently excitable, an 18-year-old a long way from 
Boise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seniors gave me a lot of respect, so it was a lot easier than a lot of 
people would expect," Plummer said. "When things would get crazy out there, 
they helped me out, telling me to calm down. At times, I would (get excited). I 
still do. That's just football out there, and tensions are running high and 
things get a little crazy sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, he gave Arizona State a starting point. Snyder's three 
seasons as the Sun Devil coach have involved addition by subtraction, weeding 
out players who did not belong in the Pacific 10. His predecessor, Larry 
Marmie, had recruited poorly for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those recruits was Benton, who, like many other Arizona State players, 
sized up the situation and left for West Texas A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 He leads the nation's passers in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 His former sub, Plummer, looked to a sophomore season as a veteran, more or 
less. Then he looked around the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange at first," he said. "I was expecting to have some guys out 
here who didn't make it because of academics and other problems. But you have 
to play the cards that have been dealt. . . . Depth has been a bit tough, but 
you can't make excuses. You've got to win the games you have a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State, Stanford and Brigham Young have been beaten. Louisville, 
California, Washington State and Oregon could have been, but weren't. Miami and 
Washington blew out Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 As the season has progressed, numbers have regressed. It's as though a plague 
has struck Tempe. Blown-out knees seem to be the injury of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Plummer has thrown while being educated. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times it's tough when you're down," he said. "It's been a learning 
process, trying to deal with what's happened this year. You tend to overlook 
things when you win." 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer has learned that he is one player and Arizona State needs more. 
</P>
<P>
 "'I'm still young, and I still have a couple of years left," he said. "I can't 
put so much pressure on myself and say, 'I've got to go out every game and 
throw for 250 (yards) and throw two TDs.' I've got to go out every game and 
give it my best shot and learn from mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 He's still 19, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm impatient," he said. "I want to get this program going." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Snyder. Arizona State has extended his contract through 1999, but 
Plummer is there now. He is a cornerstone with which to build a program. Now, 
Snyder is looking for a few more good men.

 Coach Rich Brooks says the Oregon coaching staff is proceeding as if Stanford 
quarterback Steve Stenstrom won't start against the 15th-ranked Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford officials still list Stenstrom as questionable for Saturday's game at 
Palo Alto.He has not practiced and doctors reportedly are considering surgery 
that would end his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom broke the little finger on his throwing hand in last week's 46-28 
victory over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Scott Frost came on in relief and was extremely effective, especially 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, a sophomore, carried the ball 11 times for 88 yards against Washington. 
He completed two of eight passes for 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon (7-3, 5-1) can advance to the Rose Bowl for the first time in 37 years 
with a victory over Stanford and a win the next week at Oregon State.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; AREN'T COACHES SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO 
JUDGE TALENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What's thicker: Joe Paterno's glasses or the skull of the bozo coach who voted 
Penn State No. 6 in the latest USA Today/CNN poll? 
</P>
<P>
 This must have been some ballot. Our best guess of Coach Moron's top six: 1) 
Nebraska, 2) Yeshiva University, 3) Allegheny County Community College, 4) 
Notre Dame, 5) Nebraska (Kearney campus), 6) Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we'll never know who made a fool of himself, mostly because the USA 
Today/CNN poll protects the identities of the 62 voting coaches. And mock the 
media members who vote in the Associated Press poll all you want, but at least 
they don't hide behind anonymity (and we've got the angry West Virginia 
postcards from 1993 to prove it). 
</P>
<P>
 As an educational service to the coach who stuck it to Joe Pa, we devote this 
week's column to an easy-to-use national championship handicapping system. 
</P>
<P>
 Your odds: 
</P>
<P>
 PENN STATE (2-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: Of the five undefeated teams, the No. 2-ranked Nittany Lions have the 
easiest path to a perfect season. Penn State travels to Illinois on Saturday, 
then returns home for games against Northwestern and Michigan State. The Illini 
will cause some problems, but Northwestern won't. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Michigan State, expect the Spartans to be in their weepy 
Win-One-For-Coach- 
</P>
<P>
 George-Perles mode. Perles is gone at season's end, the loser of an ugly power 
struggle in East Lansing. The Spartans will hang tough for a quarter, maybe 
two, and then Penn State will blow their helmet flaps inside out. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the Nittany Lions will face either Donald Duck, USC or Arizona in 
the Rose Bowl. Oregon's Quack Attack makes for a heartwarming story, but 
please--an Oregon Stuns Penn State headline? We don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 A USC-Penn State rematch would be interesting if you conveniently ignore two 
things: The Nittany Lions dominated the Trojans in the Sept. 10 game and the 
same thing would happen Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arizona? Great defense, but the offense couldn't keep up with Penn State. 
In four of their last five game, the Wildcats have scored 16 or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
 BOTTOM LINE: Penn State is loaded and Paterno doesn't lose many games when he 
has five weeks to prepare, as he would for the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS: The schedule. Victories over Illinois, Northwestern, Michigan State and, 
say, Oregon, don't exactly send voter adrenaline rates off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if No. 1 Nebraska wins its Orange Bowl game the night before, some of 
the incentive for Penn State is gone. The chances of the Nittany Lions jumping 
over a 13-0 Cornhusker team aren't good, no matter how convincingly they beat 
their Rose Bowl opponent. Sadly, Penn State might need the help of others. 
</P>
<P>
 NEBRASKA (3-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: The top-ranked Cornhuskers control their own poll destiny. If they 
convincingly beat Iowa State on Saturday and Oklahoma on Nov. 25, they finish 
the regular season 12-0 and go to the Orange Bowl, where they'll probably face 
Miami or Florida State. Win that game and the national championship is 
Nebraska's. Simple. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers can do it too. Their offensive line makes blocking sleds 
wince. Their defense doesn't get the publicity it deserves, but ask Colorado 
Coach Bill McCartney if he has seen anything better. Their I-back, Lawrence 
Phillips, is standard Nebraska issue: tough, fast and durable. Their 
quarterback, Brook Berringer, continues to make believers. And then there is 
Tom Osborne, whose coaching staff is among the best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS: The Iowa State and Oklahoma games are on the road. The Cornhuskers can't 
afford to struggle in either one, or else they risk losing some first-place 
votes. And expect Oklahoma to play harder than usual, because it might be the 
final game for embattled Sooner Coach Gary Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Nebraska reaches the Orange Bowl undefeated and No. 1, it still has to 
beat the Hurricanes on Miami's home field or defeat the Seminoles in their home 
state. That could be a problem, considering that since 1984, the Cornhuskers 
are 0-5 in Orange Bowl games and a combined 0-7 against Miami and Florida State 
in postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
 ALABAMA (4-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: The luckiest team in America has the kind of finishing schedule that 
could sway voters. If unbeaten and sixth-ranked Alabama runs the table against 
No. 20 Mississippi State at Starkville, No. 3 Auburn at Birmingham, No. 4 
Florida at the Southeastern Conference Championship and then, say, No. 8 
Florida State in the Sugar Bowl, you could make a very strong case for a 
Crimson Tide share of the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama has the incredibly consistent Jay Barker at quarterback, a great 
defense, a very solid running attack and hasn't had a bad break since someone 
told Coach Gene Stallings he looks good in houndstooth. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS: A one-dimensional offense. That killer schedule. The law of averages. 
</P>
<P>
 MIAMI (5-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: Positioned nicely at No. 5, the Hurricanes could be as high as No. 3 or 
No. 4 if Auburn loses to Alabama or Florida loses to Florida State. Miami's 
schedule is kind: Pittsburgh at the Orange Bowl, a trip to Temple and a visit 
from unpredictable Boston College to close the regular season. Win those games 
and it would be hard for the Orange Bowl committee to ignore the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 As for matchups, the Hurricanes, led by Warren Sapp, have one of the few 
defensive lines capable of giving Nebraska's offensive line a challenge. Miami 
also would have the home-field advantage, a huge factor in a national 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS: Quarterback Frank Costa doesn't remind anyone of Jim Kelly, Bernie 
Kosar, Vinny Testaverde, Craig Erickson, Steve Walsh or Gino Torretta. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem for Miami, though, is that one loss against Washington. 
The Hurricanes have to jump over at least two teams in the AP poll--Nebraska 
and Penn State--and as many as four, depending on what Alabama, Auburn and 
Florida do. Things are a little easier in the coaches poll. The Hurricanes are 
ranked No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 AUBURN (8-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: The Tigers are two victories away (they play Georgia at home and Alabama 
on the road) from a second consecutive 11-0 season. NCAA sanctions prevent them 
from playing in a bowl game, but it might not matter. 
</P>
<P>
 How about this for a hypothetical: Auburn is 11-0 (again), Nebraska loses in 
the Orange Bowl, Penn State loses or struggles in the Rose Bowl, Alabama loses 
in the Sugar Bowl or Florida wins. Who's No. 1? Our guess is that Auburn will 
get enough AP votes to make a run at the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the Tigers are serving time in the NCAA big house, but that doesn't 
prevent them from finishing No. 1 in the AP poll. And yes, they don't play a 
bowl game, but that's not the fault of this team or Coach Terry Bowden. They've 
won every game they played, and if the Tigers finish as the only undefeated 
team, they'd be our likely choice as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS: Out-of-sight, out-of-mind mentality of voters could kill Auburn. The 
Tigers' season ends Nov. 19. The next AP vote is Jan. 3, after the bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a victory over Alabama at Crimson Tide-friendly Birmingham is no gimme. 
Plus, the Tigers need lots of assistance on Jan. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 FLORIDA (9-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: The Gators face South Carolina, Vanderbilt and Florida State to finish 
the regular season and play Alabama in the SEC championship. A 4-0 finish like 
that gets noticed, as would a Sugar Bowl victory against Miami or a possible 
rematch against the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
 If the AP rankings stay the same going into January--Nebraska, Penn State, 
Auburn, Florida--the Gators could jump to No. 1 with Cornhusker and Nittany 
Lion losses on bowl day. That's because even if Auburn ends the regular season 
11-0, the Gators will finish with two more games, both of them against probable 
top 10 opponents--Alabama and Miami or Florida State. If Florida is 13-1 and 
Auburn 11-0, voters might lean toward the Gators because of the extra quality 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS: That loss to Auburn. Mutiny at the quarterback position. Florida's 
record against the Seminoles (1-3 under Coach Steve Spurrier, 1-6 since 1987). 
The possibility of Sugar Bowl officials ignoring a Florida-Florida State 
rematch and instead choosing TV-attractive Notre Dame for the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 FLORIDA STATE (50-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: The Seminoles almost always finish strong and could do it again with 
victories over Notre Dame, North Carolina State and Florida. After that, they'd 
probably play in the Sugar Bowl, where the Seminoles could face undefeated 
Alabama. If Florida State wins and Nebraska and Penn State lose, Coach Bobby 
Bowden might own a share of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 CONS: Multiply Miami's problem by two. The Seminoles not only have a loss, but 
they have a loss to the Hurricanes. To position themselves for a chance at the 
national title, the Seminoles have to finish ahead of Miami in the 
regular-season poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, it might not be enough. If Penn State loses in the Rose Bowl and 
Miami and Florida State win their bowl games, voters might use head-to-head 
results to determine No. 1. If so, the Hurricanes were decisive winners over 
the Seminoles earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Also remember that coalition rules allow the Sugar Bowl to overrule a 
Gator-Seminole rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 TEXAS A&M (1,000-1) 
</P>
<P>
 PROS: Could finish the regular season with a 10-0-1 record. If everyone else 
loses their bowl games and Auburn gets ignored and . . . ah, forget it. The 
Aggies have no chance. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Nebraska's Osborne is grousing about the likelihood of facing Miami 
or Florida State in the Orange Bowl. OK, so it isn't geographically fair. But 
if Osborne thinks his annual complaints will have any effect on the Orange Bowl 
committee's selection process, think again. "Absolutely not," said a bowl 
official. "No way. That will have no influence." Instead, the Orange Bowl will 
take the highest-ranked team available. If it is Florida State or Miami, tough. 
. . . One last Nebraska item: Despite impressive games from Berringer and 
Phillips in last Saturday's 45-17 victory over Kansas, the Cornhusker coaching 
staff chose offensive tackle Zach Wiegert as its nominee for Big Eight 
Conference player of the week honors. Why? Wiegert received a perfect grade in 
each of the 70 plays against the Jayhawks. "We just thought that was such an 
amazing thing," said Osborne, who couldn't remember another player in his 
30-year career who had done it. Top 10

DUCK NOTES; PLAYERS ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT 
</P>

<P>
 NHL players in California have been ruled eligible for unemployment benefits, 
a spokeswoman for the state Employment Development Department said Wednesday. 
The ruling makes it likely some NHL players will receive the maximum of $230 a 
week for up to 26 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have received notice they have until Nov. 21 to appeal a claim by 
defenseman David Williams, and a club official said he is not aware of any 
grounds for objection. However, Williams' claim still has to receive final 
approval from the EED. 
</P>
<P>
 Don McSween, a Michigan resident, also has filed a claim in California, and 
Tom Kurvers has filed a claim in New York, where he was employed by the 
Islanders until being traded in June. Though New York law allows striking and 
locked-out employees to receive benefits, the state earlier denied benefits to 
striking baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, unhappy that some prospects aren't playing enough in San Diego, 
have assigned left wing Maxim Bets to the Worcester (Mass.) Icecats of the AHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Bets, 20, is a top scoring prospect acquired last season from St. Louis for 
defenseman Alexei Kasatonov. He had two 100-point seasons in juniors and 
appeared in three NHL games last season, but had played in only seven of San 
Diego's 13 games, totaling two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have 14 prospects in San Diego. ROBYN NORWOOD

 Quarterback Chris Miller, who continues to struggle with the effects of a 
concussion suffered Oct. 23, was expected to meet with the Rams' team doctor 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head still doesn't feel right," Miller said."I still have swelling, and 
pressure in my head. . . . It isn't right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to see the doctor to get this thing cleared up or at least see 
what's going on."

</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Chandler, who suffered a concussion last week, reported no 
problems after a full day of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a little bit of a sore jaw Monday, but my head feels pretty good now," 
said Chandler, who will start against the Raiders. "I had one concussion in 
Tampa and one in Indianapolis, but they were mild. Compared to a lot of guys, I 
guess I've been lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Troy Drayton and cornerback Todd Lyght said they were not 
reprimanded for suggesting after Sunday's game that the offensive coaching 
staff should start getting the ball to someone other than running back Jerome 
Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know what they're thinking, but then again they don't have to 
tell me," Drayton said. "I'm kind of surprised they didn't come to me, but then 
I'm kind of not. I'm not whining; I'm just trying to make the point that I can 
help us win. If they take it the wrong way, that's them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lyght: "That was nothing negative. I was just saying we have some great 
players on offense, that our productivity could go up at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried three Bettis rushes from the one and failed to score against 
the Broncos in a situation that could have put the game away. The coaching 
staff tried to send in a pass play, but Chandler didn't get the call. T.J.

OPPONENTS HAVE HARD TIME GOING AGAINST SONORA'S GRAIN; FOOTBALL: LINEMAN, WHO 
PLAYS BOTH WAYS, IS THE STRONG POINT OF THE RAIDER PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Grain was standing there amid all that talent, thinking how out of place 
and overmatched he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really intimidated," he said of his late April workout at Dick 
Lascola's scouting combine. "There were all kinds of big-time players there, 
about 70 or 80. I worried that I wouldn't be able to test good, that I would be 
horrible. I tested out fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the turning point for me. I knew that I could be a Division I 
player, that I could compete with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Mark) Takkinen told me it was a real big thing to be invited and if 
you do well, you'll get a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afterward, the mail started coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches from the Pacific 10 Conference had Grain in their Rolodex by the first 
of the month, and suddenly, they were visiting Sonora -- which was plenty 
unusual given the Raiders' football history. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sonora is on the verge of winning outright its first league championship 
since 1973, and Grain is a big reason why. 
</P>
<P>
 A really big reason. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the left tackle on offense and an end on defense. And he is 6 feet 5, 
270 pounds. And while most big kids' strength is their strength, Grain's is his 
agility and quickness. He is only 16 -- he skipped the third grade -- and still 
must mature physically. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the whole thing -- he's young," Takkinen said. "He's still got room to 
grow. His frame will lend itself to another 20 pounds and that will be all 
upper body strength. Strength is not his forte right now; it's his quickness 
and the way he attacks people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times in games where he's taken the guy he's blocking and 
taken them all the way to the other side of the formation -- all the way to the 
other tackle." 
</P>
<P>
 Grain credits his father, Emmanuel, for the great footwork -- but not his 
size. Dad is 6 feet and mom Shereal is 5-6 and of average build. He does have 
two uncles on his mother's side who played football -- Jimmy DuBose was a 
running back for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Keith DuBose was a defensive 
back at Duke from 1989-92. But both of them were little guys by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmanuel Grain is a believer in jumping rope -- it's good enough for boxers -- 
and Jason jumped in the off-season five to six times a week. Jason also is 
intelligent in an academic sense. He has a 3.4 grade-point average in honors 
classes, and he was one of the first players on the football team to grasp the 
Wing-T that Takkinen installed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew all the linemen's blocking assignments, not just his own (which was 
center last year)," Takkinen said. "He allows us to run our offense to its 
fullest capabilities. He's our best run-blocker, and we're averaging 192 yards 
per game, and we're passing for 173. 
</P>
<P>
 "He allows us to go to either side. In the past, we've only been able to go to 
one side and people have been able to key on that. He makes our whole offensive 
line a whole lot better. He allows us to run our counter play (to the right) 
for about 14 yards every time we run it; and we run the sweep to his side 
almost every time we run it." 
</P>
<P>
 Grain, who wants to major in history, will take recruiting trips to UCLA, 
Oregon State, Arizona State and Fresno State; he is considering California, 
Colorado State and Oregon for his fifth trip. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to become a football coach one day. Or a sportswriter. But he's 
leaning toward coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, I'm confident in my knowledge of the game and I think 
that's something I'm interested in right now," Grain said. "It's a combination 
of everything that makes me love the game. Right now, it's playing on Friday 
nights, the band, the crowd, the pressure of the big game, the high you get 
after a big win, being able to enjoy it with your teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to pick a role model, Grain did not look to a big-name NFL 
lineman, but to a classmate. While still a sophomore playing on the junior 
varsity because he wasn't old enough to play on the varsity, he decided he 
wanted to be like Sonora senior Ricardo Castro, who is now an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never until this year did I really think about being a Division I player, I 
only thought about being a great high school football player, and he was a 
great high school football player," Grain said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deacon Jones is in the Hall of Fame and Reggie White is going to be, but I 
didn't pattern myself after them because it's not just about one day being a 
pro player. Once I get to college, if I see a great player on my team, I'll 
pattern myself after him to be a great college player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm a high school player and my goal is to try to be the best 
Sonora Raider I can be." SUNNY HILLS VS. SONORA

Lancers score an upset, they share the title with Sonora, the Fullerton-Troy 
winner and possibly Buena Park.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; JENKINS SETS GOAL OF PLAYING SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Robert Jenkins is listed as probable for Sunday's game 
against the Rams, but he says there is no way an ankle injury will keep him 
from playing against his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only a chance for me to play against my former team but to play in 
front of my family and have them there to support me," Jenkins said. "It's just 
go out and play hard and show everybody that, 'Hey, I can still play this 
game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, from UCLA, played seven seasons with the Rams before signing as a 
free agent with the Raiders before the start of the season. He spent the first 
five games on the inactive list before replacing injured Gerald Perry at left 
tackle three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a (trash talker)," Jenkins said. "I'm going to paraphrase from 
someone that I know from the Rams: 'I'm just going to kind of lay in the 
weeds.' I just line up and play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Albert Lewis will not play Sunday because of a knee sprain suffered 
against Kansas City. Lewis will be replaced by Lionel Washington, who started 
the first four games of the season before losing the job to Lewis. Washington 
is second on the team in interceptions with three. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Derrick Hoskins did not practice Wednesday because of an ankle injury. 
He is listed as questionable for Sunday. Coach Art Shell said he expects 
Hoskins to play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, the Raiders released middle linebacker Joe Kelly -- who now 
starts at outside linebacker for the Rams -- in favor of Greg Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine games, Biekert leads the team with 52 tackles, including 10 against 
Kansas City. Shell said that the move has worked for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kelly) is doing pretty good (for the Rams)," Shell said. "But I think I told 
you in the off-season that we felt good about Biekert and we haven't changed 
our mind about that. Biekert's come on and played very well for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have played the Rams seven times during the regular season, 
winning five, including a 20-17 victory at the Coliseum in 1991. The only time 
the teams played in Anaheim was 1985 when the Raiders won, 16-6. LONNIE WHITE

HOLLYWOOD PARK; JOCKEYS START FAST BEFORE SUSPENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani and Fernando Valenzuela, who will begin five-day suspensions 
this weekend, were in the forefront Wednesday as Hollywood Park opened a 34-day 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani, who rode his first winner at Caliente on Oct. 2, 1988, rode his 
1,000th winner when Its Beer Thirty, a 5-year-old gelding, coasted home in the 
last race. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who also broke in at Caliente, a year before Nakatani did, rode 
three winners, including a 2 3/4-length victory astride Artica in the $50,900 
Jim Hill Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani, 24, begins his suspension Friday. It stems from a ride on Eagle Eyed 
in the Del Mar Derby. Nakatani appealed the suspension but now has decided to 
drop the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela's fast start at the Hollywood meet will lose momentum Saturday, 
when he begins a suspension for failure to maintain a straight course with 
Velvet Tulip, a horse that won on the closing day of the Oak Tree meet at Santa 
Anita on Monday. Velvet Tulip was disqualified to second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani is one of the hottest riders in the country. He won 51 races at Del 
Mar to take that title and had 30 victories to finish first at Oak Tree. 
Nakatani didn't win any Breeders' Cup races at Churchill Downs, but all four of 
his mounts ran well, starting with Serena's Song's loss by a head to Flanders 
in the Juvenile Fillies. Nakatani's other three mounts -- Dramatic Gold, third 
in the Classic; Miss Dominique, third in the Distaff; and Harlan, fourth in the 
Sprint -- combined with Serena's Song for $736,000 in purses.  
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani ranks seventh on the national money list with purses of $8.8 million, 
which is about $700,000 more than he totaled last year. Still to come is an 
assignment on Sandpit, the Oak Tree Invitational winner, in the world's richest 
thoroughbred race, the $3.8-million Japan Cup, in Tokyo on Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela made the most of his six mounts Wednesday. Besides his victory 
aboard Artica, he won two races for trainer Vladimir Cerin and finished second 
in another race. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela has ridden Artica, a 2-year-old daughter of Canadian turf champion 
Frosty The Snowman, in all six of her races. It was the filly's first on grass 
and came after she had broken her maiden at a mile at Santa Anita on Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Trainer) Mike Harrington told me this filly was really bred for the grass," 
Valenzuela said. "And I knew she was improving. That last win, she really felt 
good and finished strongly. One of the most important things is that she's 
relaxing a lot better, and it is sure making a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Artica, who paid $15.20 and ran a mile in 1:37 4/5, came from fourth place and 
passed the leader, Favored One, with about a sixteenth of a mile to go. Favored 
One protected second place, two lengths ahead of Royal Vale, with Nakatani's 
mount, the 3-2 favorite Wilga, fourth in a six-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Before breaking her maiden, Artica had some dull races, including two 
seventh-place finishes in September at Del Mar and Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had never set foot on a turf course until (Wednesday's) race," Harrington 
said. "But her dad held the world record going a mile and an eighth on turf, so 
there was no doubt in my mind that she'd run on turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington is considering paying a $10,000 supplement to make Artica eligible 
for the $200,000 Miesque, another mile race, on Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I nominated a bunch of 2-year-olds, and none of them made it," 
Harrington said. "So this time I thought, why waste the money?" 
</P>
<P>
 The on-track crowd of 11,012 was more than 1,000 less than last year, but 
betting was up slightly and overall the handle of $6.8 million was almost 25% 
higher than 1993's opener. To emphasize betting on Bay Meadows, Hollywood 
interspersed the races from the Northern California track in its daily program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Hollywood Wildcat finished seventh as the 9-5 favorite in the Breeders' 
Cup Distaff, it was her worst finish since April of 1993. The 4-year-old filly 
had never been farther back than third in 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Neil Drysdale had been concerned all week at Churchill Downs about how 
Hollywood Wildcat would handle the track, and apparently that was her undoing. 
Last year's Distaff winner and Eclipse Award champion came out of the race in 
good shape and was jogging at Hollywood Park on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Drysdale has his eye on the $400,000 Matriarch, a 1 1/8-mile grass race, on 
Nov. 27. Hollywood Wildcat ran that distance twice on the Hollywood Park turf 
course this summer, winning the Gamely Handicap and finishing second to 
Corrazona in the Beverly Hills Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a chance that Fondly Remembered, second to Aube Indienne in the Yellow 
Ribbon at Santa Anita, will be supplemented for $20,000 to the Matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas, thanks to the Breeders' Cup, moved ahead of Bill Mott in the 
national trainers' standings. Lukas, who led the country 10 consecutive years 
before Bobby Frankel dislodged him last year, has started horses that have won 
$8 million. He holds a $1.7-million lead over Mott. . . . Lukas, who won two 
Breeders' Cup races and ran 1-2-5 in the Juvenile Fillies with Flanders, 
Serena's Song and Lilly Capote, is expected to run another filly, Ocean Cat, in 
Saturday's $75,000 Moccasin Stakes at Hollywood. . . . Mike Smith, who rode two 
Breeders' Cup winners, has $15 million in purses, breaking the record of $14.4 
million by Chris McCarron in 1991. . . . Bertrando, sixth in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic after leading the field for almost a mile, will run one more time -- 
either the NYRA Mile at Aqueduct on Nov. 26 or the Hollywood Mile on Nov. 27 -- 
before he's permanently retired to stud. . . . All nine of the races on 
Hollywood Park's first Friday night card of the season are claiming races.

APPRENTICE JOCKEY GETS HER DUE WITH BELATED ECLIPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosemary Homeister was named recipient of the 1992 Eclipse Award as 
outstanding apprentice jockey on Wednesday, replacing the original winner, 
Jesus Bracho, who was found to be ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeister was runner-up in original voting by the Thoroughbred Racing Assns., 
the Daily Racing Form and members of the National Turf Writers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bracho rode in Panama before coming to the United States, making him 
ineligible for the award. 
</P>
<P>
 He was suspended as a jockey on Nov. 2, 1993 after his previous experience was 
discovered. The return of the Eclipse Award had no bearing on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Apprentice jockeys are given a weight allowance in the United States.

RYAN TOPS INDUCTEE LIST FOR O.C. HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nolan Ryan and Brian Downing, two of the greatest players in Angel history, 
and Steve Scott and Mary Slaney, two of the greatest American milers, are among 
seven athletes to be inducted into the Orange County Hall of Fame, it was 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They are joined by former Ram center Rich Saul, boxer George Latka and tennis 
player Josephine Cruickshank. 
</P>
<P>
 The induction ceremony will be held Dec. 18 at the Hall of Fame at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan threw four of his major league-record seven no-hitters while with the 
Angels from 1972-79. Ryan's 383 strikeouts in 1973 remains the American League 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing is one of two Angels -- Bobby Grich is the other -- to play on the 
1979, '82 and '86 AL West championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, from UC Irvine, set the U.S. mile record of 3 minutes 47.69 seconds in 
1982 and made Olympic teams in 1980, '84 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaney, from Orange High, also made three Olympic teams but never won a medal. 
She holds the U.S. women's mile record of 4:16.71, set in 1985, and won the 
1,500 and 3,000 meters in the first World Championships in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul played 12 seasons for the Rams, retiring after the 1981 season. Latka 
turns 80 Saturday. Cruickshank was a tennis champion in the 1920s and '30s.

HE'S TAKING DIRECT ROUTE TO SUCCESS; RANCHO SANTIAGO'S PADGETT PINS HOPES ON 
EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Padgett is still "the Buffalo," even if most of his teammates on the 
Rancho Santiago wrestling team are unaware of his old nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 He still charges ahead, not so much out of control, but out to inflict damage. 
Aggressive remains the only way to describe his wrestling style. Game plan? 
Padgett picks 'em up and throws 'em down. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple, brutal and effective. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a senior at Canyon High, Padgett overwhelmed most of his 
opponents, always looking like one of the state's best, most intimidating 
wrestlers. But when he failed to win the 160-pound title at the 1992 State 
championships, finishing third, the expected scholarship offers failed to 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the next season off, helped coach his younger brother, Barney, while 
chomping at the bit for another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the midst of his second wildly successful season at Rancho Santiago, 
Padgett is stampeding toward another shot at a Division I scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it seems he really can't miss. He is the defending State community 
college champion at 167 pounds, the reigning State tournament MVP and perhaps 
the state's best, regardless of weight division. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago named him the school's male athlete of the year for 1993-94. 
He was chosen over baseball, basketball and football players, runners and 
swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what that's all about," Padgett said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Others certainly do. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not only one of the most impressive wrestlers I've coached, he's one of 
the best all-around citizens," Rancho Santiago Coach Gary deBeaubien said. "All 
of his professors like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Padgett is honored to be sure, but as always, there is the question of the 
future to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The State meet is coming up quickly, Dec. 2-3 at Rio Hondo College. And soon 
after, he will try again to secure a full ride to a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't get it, I don't know what I'm going to do," Padgett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is tight and Padgett doubts he could afford to walk on at Oklahoma 
State, his school of choice, or any other top-notch Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
 He is confident a scholarship will come his way, but tries not to dwell on the 
subject for too long. It's best to concentrate simply on wrestling well and 
winning. He remembers what happened in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I didn't win at State so I didn't get a scholarship," Padgett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds simplistic, but he really needed a State title to attract the needed 
attention. In the end, he accomplished everything but that. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior, he had a 54-1 record with 44 pins. When he pinned Neil Jackson of 
San Jose Oak Grove in the third-place match at the State meet, he pushed his 
career total to 114, a national record. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive credentials certainly, but in an age of shrinking collegiate 
athletic budgets and attempts to bring about gender equity on campus, Padgett 
needed more. With fewer wrestling scholarships available because so many 
division I and II programs are being disbanded, he needed State titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The colleges are looking for the blue chippers, the guys who are two- and 
three-time State champs," deBeaubien said. "In high school, he fell short." 
</P>
<P>
 When Padgett's family moved to Hemet, he went to Mt. San Jacinto College 
instead of a Division I wrestling power. He didn't compete on the team, 
choosing instead to help coach at Hemet High. When the season was over, one 
thought kept running through his head: 
</P>
<P>
 "I gotta compete."  
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled at Rancho Santiago the following fall and began pummeling 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Really, there appeared to be little difference from his matches in high 
school. Padgett attacked relentlessly, taking advantage of mistakes while 
learning to be less reckless than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aggressive style is still there," deBeaubien said. "He's cleaned a few 
things up. He was a little daring in high school, going on his back. His 
philosophy is the same. He wants to pin his opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Padgett: "Everyone says I make wrestling ugly look good." 
</P>
<P>
 At last year's State meet, he pinned all-comers in winning the 167-pound 
title. No one had ever done that. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as easy as all that, however. Padgett noticed a difference in the 
competition, in the intensity of even the most lopsided matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, there was the question of rustiness from a year off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back and wrestled, and it was fine for a while," Padgett said. "Then 
one day in practice, it wasn't working. I couldn't do anything right. I was 
mad, throwing things around. I said 'Coach, I can't do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Soon enough, Padgett regained his form and hasn't stopped pinning his 
challengers. So far this season, he is undefeated with pins in 17 of his past 
24 matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Can he be stopped? 
</P>
<P>
 DeBeaubien doesn't think so. He ranks Padgett as one of the best he's seen at 
the community college level. He also believes Padgett's reward is finally at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely feel scholarship opportunities will be there for him," 
deBeaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
 All Padgett needs to do is keep charging.

TITAN WOMEN LAND 3 BASKETBALL RECRUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton has received letters of intent from three high school 
standouts, according to Titan women's basketball Coach Deborah Ayres. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing with the Titans are Rhonda Anderson of Cerritos Gahr, Gabrielle Castro 
of San Mateo Burlingame High and Erin Whiteside from Littleton (Colo.) 
Chatfield High. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a 5-foot-7 guard, averaged 12 points, four assists and three steals 
last season at Gahr. Castro, who averaged 19.2 points and 8.1 rebounds, is a 
5-9 shooting guard who was an all-league selection. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-2 Whiteside averaged 15.3 points and 9.3 rebounds at Chatfield, where 
she was a two-time Class 6A all-conference selection.

AFTER SUCCESSFUL APPEAL, VAN NUYS LOSES IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After winning consecutive volleyball titles in the City Section 3-A Division 
playoffs, Dave Bessler wanted a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys High coach appealed to the City Section to place his team in the 
4-A playoffs. And after an undefeated regular season, Bessler got his wish when 
the Wolves were seeded seventh in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, the Wolves found out the difference between the divisions as 
Chatsworth middle blocker Jennifer Hodges had 12 kills and 13 blocks to lead 
the host Chancellors to a 16-14, 15-10, 15-13 sweep in the 4-A quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys stayed close to second-seeded Chatsworth with defense, including 
several near-impossible digs by senior setter Connie Chae, but the Wolves 
didn't have enough firepower to combat Hodges and outside hitter Jennifer 
Joseph (14 kills). 
</P>
<P>
 "They had more weapons than we did," Bessler said. "Our defense was very 
consistent, but we just didn't have enough hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges set the tone with six kills and 10 blocks at the beginning of the 
match. By the end of the first game, Van Nuys (14-1) resorted to quick sets and 
dinks to take away Hodges' dominance in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried fooling her but it wasn't working," Chae said. "Everything that came 
up, she seemed to be knocking down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolves rallied to take a 14-12 lead late in the opening game, but 
Chatsworth (10-4) scored four consecutive points, including a rare block by 
outside hitter Kim Pickup on game point. Pickup played almost exclusively in 
the back row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we took that first game, we knew we were going to take it," Hodges said. 
"Once we won the first game, we were fired up to show what we had." 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous lead changes for most of the second game, Chatsworth scored 
five consecutive points at 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wolves started the final game with five points in a row and fought off 
match point with the longest rally of the game. But Nicole Snell's kill closed 
the match and avenged a preseason loss for the Chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Van Nuys would be tough," Joseph said. "This didn't seem like a 
second-round match. It seemed like a championship match."

CSUN GETS SEQUOIAS GUARD, GOES FOR THE MATCHED SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Deal, a guard on the College of the Sequoias basketball team, accepted a 
scholarship offer from Cal State Northridge on Wednesday, the first day of the 
NCAA early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 Deal's backcourt mate, former Kennedy High star Joe Wyatt, also is considering 
an offer from Northridge, Sequoias Coach John Boragno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt, who last season led Sequoias in scoring with a 16.3 average, "is 
leaning heavily" toward committing to the Matadors during the early signing 
period, according to Boragno. The signing period ends Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt, a two-time All-Valley selection by The Times, averaged 30.6 points for 
Kennedy as a senior in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Deal averaged 14.6 points, six rebounds and 4.3 points a game two years ago as 
a freshman. He used a redshirt season in 1993-94 after sustaining ligament 
damage to his left knee in a collision with an opponent near the end of the 
previous season.

NOBODY'S TALKING AT CSUN; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BURT INSTALLS GAG ORDER AFTER 
MEETING WITH 16 PLAYERS WHO MISSED PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't exactly one big, happy family, but this is one problem the football 
coach wants settled between the walls of the locker room Cal State Northridge 
calls home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen players who boycotted practice Tuesday returned Wednesday and spent 3 
1/2 hours in an emotional meeting with Coach Bob Burt, who emerged afterward in 
a highly agitated state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not news," Burt said. "This is nobody's . . . business." 
</P>
<P>
 The repercussions of the walkout remain somewhat unclear. The 16 players will 
suit up for Saturday's game against Northern Arizona at North Campus Stadium, 
but Burt said he hasn't decided whether any will play. Burt said the players 
agreed to an unspecified disciplinary penalty for missing practice. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent attempt at damage control, Burt circled the wagons, closing 
practice and instructing players not to comment on the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Said senior tailback Mark Harper, who participated in the walkout: "(Burt) 
doesn't want us to talk and he's the head coach, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Burt compared the incident to a "family squabble" and said 
heatedly several times that the particulars of the walkout were not noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Burt: "What those reasons are (for boycotting) and what the discipline is 
are nobody's business." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior defensive lineman Oscar Wilson, who attended the meeting even though he 
said he missed Tuesday's practice because of illness, walked out of the meeting 
after two hours and said, "I can't take this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said coaches and the 16 players were attempting to settle their 
differences and salvage the final two games of a tumultuous season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's talking about how to make the last two weeks work," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the team's best players, including secondary starters Joseph 
Vaughn, Vinnie Johnson and James (Scoody) Woods, were among the boycotting 
players. Darren Walton, Shaun Coleman and Harper, who rotate at running back, 
also were among the 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Without mentioning any specifics, Burt said the dissension was generally 
caused by sheer frustration -- Northridge is 3-5 and has lost three games in a 
row -- and "miscommunication." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we're as together as we've been in a long time," he said. "If 
something positive comes out of the last two days, good."

MILLER ALREADY KNEW THE DRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rebuilding job Larry Miller has undertaken as Hueneme High's first-year 
football coach appears to faze him not at all. Perhaps that's because the 
42-year-old Miller already has created something out of nothing when it comes 
to football. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, as a member of Professor Al Nava's secondary education 
classes at Cal State Northridge, Miller traveled to Ensenada, Mexico, and put 
together one of the country's few high school football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-day stay in Ensenada, Miller diagramed plays, taught 
conditioning drills and demonstrated proper technique to Mexican players and 
coaches who were thrilled to show up at 6 a.m. and stay all day for the 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller even put the coaches through all the drills so that they would 
understand what they were supposed to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spoke very limited Spanish but your actions and sincerity get you over the 
barrier," said Miller, who used a classmate fluent in the language to interpret 
for him. "You could see their appreciation and when someone appreciates 
something, you'll walk over broken glass for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller continued to reach out to his amigos once he returned to the States. 
After getting the Hueneme job, he enlisted the aid of coaches and 
administrators from around the Channel League to gather used football equipment 
to send to Mexico. He also plans to bring the Ensenada team, which now plays in 
a league of its own, up to Hueneme for a preseason scrimmage next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry planted the seeds down there and they've been growing ever since," Nava 
said. "He was my star pupil. You get one in a million like Larry. He made a 
very good first impression as a leader and his questions were very mature, the 
kind that usually don't develop until you've been out in the field for a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's return to Hueneme as football coach this season has been doubly sweet 
for him. Not only does he guide the fortunes of the team for which he once 
played, but once again he lives in the town his family first moved to in 1965, 
and where his parents still live in their original house on E Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back all the time to see my mom and go to church and it saddened me to 
see some of the kids I grew up with not going anyplace past high school," 
Miller said. "It was evident there was a lot of work to be done because 
everyone who was successful here always left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be here and in a position to make a difference in someone's life. 
If you lead them and guide them and keep doors open for them, they will take it 
from there."

A NEW WAVE HITS HUENEME; FORMER ALL-AMERICAN HALFBACK RETURNS TO RESTORE 
RESPECTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The photocopies are blurred but legible under the plexiglass sheet on the 
battered wooden desk. They speak of wild-eyed crowds, furious comebacks and 
wondrous deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vikings Squash Scorpions" blares a headline, dated Oct. 25, 1969. "Miller, 
'One-Man Gang,' Totals 170 Yards" reads another. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Miller, Hueneme High's first-year football coach, leans back in his 
chair and clasps his hands in his lap. Outside the office, the locker room 
noise level rises steadily as the Viking freshman team spills in after a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun being back home," says Miller, a 1970 Hueneme graduate and an 
All-American halfback during the 1969 season. "There's a lot of work to be done 
but I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had a lot of fun when he played at Hueneme. The Vikings were 10-0 and 
Channel League champions in his senior year, when he won the Thom McAn Award as 
best player in Ventura County. Miller went on to become a three-year starter at 
Fresno State and play briefly with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Good times have grown scarce of late for Hueneme sports, especially football. 
The Vikings won two games in the five seasons before Miller arrived in June, 
including a 1-9 mark last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's record is only marginally improved -- 2-7 going into tonight's 
season finale against Dos Pueblos -- but players, school officials and opposing 
coaches say Miller has begun a transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot different," said junior tailback Ronney Jenkins, one of Ventura 
County's fastest players and the Channel League's leading rusher with 1,183 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year the team ran itself. We didn't practice hard and we told the 
coaches what to do. From day one, Coach Miller's had harder practices and 
discipline. He let us know he was the coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, first black head high school football coach in Ventura County, has 
demanded dedication and knows of what he preaches. The 42-year-old former 
electrician coached youth sports while living in Agoura, then became an 
assistant at Westlake in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by Westlake Coach Jim Benkert to pursue a teaching career, Miller 
enrolled at Cal State Northridge in 1991, taking 25 credits a semester and 
often sleeping four hours a night. He earned a kinesiology degree in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say to these guys, 'Don't tell me you can't get it done because I just did 
it,' " Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from conquering a mountain of academic challenges, Miller undertook 
another daunting climb when he made the commitment to rebuild a dismal Hueneme 
program that was the joke of the Channel League. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller arrived at the school to find a team that finished the '93 season with 
19 players, and had no footballs, uniforms, coaching staff or booster club. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller dug right in, exhibiting the qualities that impressed Hueneme Principal 
Joanne Black when she interviewed him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a very clear plan of what he wanted to do and he was very 
enthusiastic," Black said. "He emphasized discipline and it was important to me 
to bring that back to the team. I liked everything he said."  
</P>
<P>
 Miller marshaled considerable community support in the last five months, 
producing a 35-member booster club, new equipment, a game program and a 20-man 
coaching staff that includes 13 former Hueneme players. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches realized they faced a difficult rebuilding job once practice got under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to knock the previous coaching staff and I don't know exactly 
what happened here before, but it wasn't football," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to basics has stunted the rebuilding process at times. The Vikings 
defeated Channel Islands and Camarillo in their second and third games of the 
season but have lost the last six, including a 51-0 shellacking by Ventura. 
Still, the players are believers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's put his life aside for us, so we feel we have to do the same for him," 
said George Jones, Hueneme's junior quarterback. "He's a role model to me and 
he's been busting his butt, so we gotta make him look good and turn our school 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3, 190-pound Jones is one of several key players for the Vikings. 
Last year he piloted what was supposed to be a run-and-shoot attack but took a 
furious pounding by opposing defenders and was constantly on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has not only bolstered his players' confidence on the field, he has 
aided classroom performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory study halls have been set up for the team, tutors are available and 
players have access to Scholastic Aptitude Test preparation computer programs. 
Miller punishes those who misbehave off the field by circling the team around 
the guilty party and having everyone except that person do intense calisthenics 
for five minutes nonstop.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was an OK student before but now I'm really into school," Jones said. 
"Sometimes I'll be in class and be really tired but then I'll think of Coach 
Miller and I know it'll be up-downs. I'm supposed to be a team leader and I 
can't bring that on my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Miller attend to the bigger picture of team performance, he 
clamps down on small details the typical teen-ager is inclined to let go. 
Hueneme players wear no bandannas or flashy headbands under their helmets, 
their jerseys must stay tucked in at all times and matching Viking gear was a 
must at all summer passing league contests. 
</P>
<P>
 They would also do Miss Manners proud. "They're keeping their mouths shut and 
playing football," said Rick Scott, the coach at Buena. "In years past, there 
was pushing and shoving and talking from them. They got caught up in the 
negative role model routine." 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert, Miller's mentor, was similarly impressed after a passing league game 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked like a team, they acted like a team and they were polite," said 
Benkert, well-known himself for running a tight ship. "You could see all the 
things Larry's trying to teach them taking hold. The Hueneme teams of the past 
looked like 50 individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 It took one special individual to make the Vikings look like a unit.

LOS ALAMITOS PROBE TURNS UP NO ELIGIBILITY PROBLEM 
</P>

<P>
 The Southern Section said Wednesday "there was no eligibility problem" 
involving a football player from top-ranked Los Alamitos who had transferred 
from Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, on Tuesday asked Los Alamitos 
Principal Carol Hart to investigate an allegation that the player had not moved 
into the Los Alamitos attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Los Alamitos administrators made unannounced visits Wednesday morning to 
the family's current and former residences and found everything was in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything checks out," Hart said. "The mother was living there. (In the 
boy's bedroom) there was a bed, a football poster on the wall and dirty clothes 
on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Crowley: "They also visited the previous residence, owned by the mother. 
She rents it to other individuals. They were able to show a rental agreement 
and rent checks for the last few months. Apparently, she takes the boy over 
there on weekends to work on the house, to do yard work and clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two administrators were very, very satisfied. They did a thorough job. 
They did things I wouldn't have asked them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley asked Hart to act in response to questions raised by another Sunset 
League school.

NBA ROUNDUP; ANDERSON FINISHES OFF HORNETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal scored 46 points and grabbed 20 rebounds in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon's scored 43 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in Indianapolis, 
Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 But the efforts of both players were overshadowed by something else that 
happened in their respective games Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Charlotte, it was Nick Anderson's layup with one second left in overtime 
that gave the Orlando Magic its 130-128 victory over the winless Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic, which rallied from an 18-point deficit, led by two points in 
overtime on five occasions, but the Hornets stayed even to the final second as 
Robert Parish hit two free throws with 22 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte's Alonzo Mourning, who sat out the first three games because of a 
toe injury, finished with 26 points in his season debut. Larry Johnson had 25 
points for the Hornets, and Dell Curry 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant had 25 points and 15 rebounds for the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 109, Indiana 104 -- Olajuwon's 43 points and 16 rebounds carried the 
Rockets past the Pacers in Indianapolis, but it was the crowd's angry reaction 
to an official's call that got most of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry Pacer fans pelted the Market Square Arena floor with trash and caused 
play to be suspended for 10 minutes after Reggie Miller, who had 25 points, 
attempted a three-point shot with nine seconds left but was called for an 
offensive foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana committed 14 personal fouls and was called for three of its eight 
technicals in the first quarter, two of which were charged to Coach Lary Brown 
at the 5:16 mark, when he was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 109, Utah 101 -- Led by David Robinson's 30 points and 17 
rebounds, the Spurs ended a seven-game regular-season losing streak to the Jazz 
with the victory in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 The result also gave the Spurs a measure of revenge against Utah, which 
eliminated the Spurs in four games in the first round of the Western Division 
playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Elliott scored 21 points for San Antonio. Karl Malone led Utah with 23 
points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 110, Chicago 109 -- Kenny Anderson hit a game-winning jumper with 
17 seconds to play as the Nets squandered a late 10-point lead but came back to 
defeat the Bulls in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory in their home opener was the Nets' first after three losses in 
Texas under new Coach Butch Beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit Benjamin, seven of nine from the field, scored 22 points and had a 
team-high 13 rebounds for the Nets. Scottie Pippen led the Bulls with 28 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 108, Seattle 100 -- Mitch Richmond scored 28 points and Walt 
Williams 19 as the Kings defeated the SuperSonics in Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The King victory broke an eight-game losing streak to Seattle, and Sacramento 
won for the first time on the SuperSonics' home court since April 9, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp led Seattle with 21 points and Sarunas Marciulionis had 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 106, Atlanta 102 -- Kevin Johnson made four free throws in the last 11 
seconds to give the Suns the victory at Phoenix. 
</P>

 After Johnson made his first two foul shots to give the Suns a 104-100 lead, 
the Hawks took a timeout. Mookie Blaylock missed a three-pointer and Dan 
Majerle got the rebound, passing to Johnson, who was fouled again with five

 Jeff Malone had 22 points for the 76ers, including 13 in the fourth period 
when Philadelphia rallied from an 18-point deficit. Tom Gugliotta led the 
Bullets with 19 points and 10 rebounds.

THE COLLEGES / IRENE GARCIA; CSUN FOOTBALL TEAM UNDERMINING ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge football team has received ample attention lately and 
it has nothing to do with its performance on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it, a struggling program on the verge of extinction would not merit 
such a spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 In CSUN's case, the attention is related to incidents off the field: rejection 
of a referendum, which could lead to elimination of the program, a player 
charged with a felony allowed to compete, and the latest. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say when the going gets tough, Northridge football players get 
going. As in walking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season the team boycotted practice, citing a growing dissatisfaction with 
the level of funding for the cost-containment program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a handful of players, among them key starters, boycotted practice 
but refused to reveal why. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't do any good to ask Coach Bob Burt. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach seemed puzzled by Tuesday's action and said: "I'm sure I'll find out 
when they tell me what the reasons are. I honestly don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 How could a coach not know what's going on with his team, especially when one 
player indicated that coaching was among the grievances that led to the 
boycott? 
</P>
<P>
 Another player admitted he didn't know what was going on but followed the rest 
of the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attended Tuesday's practice also said they had no idea why their 
teammates walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps these last two cases best describe what's happening with the football 
team at Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows what's going on and the program has shifted into a state of 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 The team already has had two big distractions this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A starter was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted murder, 
causing controversy when the school allowed him to compete as if nothing had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the student body delivered a big blow when it voted against a 
controversial student-fee referendum. That rejection could result in the 
football program's elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this. 
</P>
<P>
 One can't help but wonder what these players hope to accomplish with this 
latest action.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they think it will motivate administrators to scramble for the funding 
that could save the program.  
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe they think this will arouse a sudden interest among the same student 
body that basically voted to get rid of football. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they're looking for sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 A more realistic guess is that Tuesday's demonstration isn't going to help the 
players' cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the incident will probably work against the football program. It 
probably will assure the students who rejected the referendum that they made 
the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs a program that brings the school so much bad publicity? 
</P>
<P>
 Burt guessed on Tuesday that perhaps the latest incident was related to 
players' frustration with the team's problem-plagued season and 3-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 That would make CSUN football players losers, on and off the field. If you 
can't win, might as well quit. 
</P>
<P>
 In these tough financial times, who wants to spend extra money to fund a team 
infested with losers?  
</P>
<P>
 If it survives the athletic department's drastic financial problems, the 
Northridge football team should find a better way to gain attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps demonstrating a winning attitude, both on and off the field, would be 
a start. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion: Improve the lines of communication between the coach and 
his athletes. That way he'll know what's going on with his team, for a change.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; PRESLEY COS., SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE $6-MILLION 
INVESTMENT SETTLEMENT

 Presley Cos. has agreed to a $6-million settlement with shareholders who filed 
a class-action lawsuit in 1992 against the Newport Beach home builder charging 
that it misled investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The shareholder group, contending that the company overstated the value of its 
real estate portfolio to investors when it sold a $70-million initial public 
offering in 1991, sued the company; its chairman, William Lyon; its chief 
executive, Wade H. Cable; and offering underwriter Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fair deal and a good settlement for shareholders," said Edward 
Gergosian, the San Diego attorney for the shareholders. Presley officials would 
not comment. The company's shareholders have until Dec. 10 to submit comments 
on the proposal to the judge. If a majority agree with the settlement, U.S. 
District Judge Gary Taylor is expected to approve it in Santa Ana on Dec. 19.

HOMEDCO GETS BIG CONTRACT WITH TRAVELERS; HEALTH: COMPANY WILL PROVIDE HOME 
SERVICES TO 1.8 MILLION PEOPLE IN MANAGED-CARE PROGRAMS.

 Homedco Group Inc. said Wednesday that it will begin providing 
home-health-care services to 1.8 million people enrolled in managed-health-care 
programs offered by The Travelers Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably one of the largest contracts that we've signed," said 
Lawrence H. Smallen, Homedco's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Travelers estimates that their (1993) expenses for home care were about $25 
million. We're not saying we'll get all of that business, but we feel we'll be 
working on a large part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of this contract is that, in the past, a lot of our 
referrals came from individual institutions and hospitals," Smallen said. 
"Today, and increasingly in the future, they'll come from large managed-care 
providers like Travelers." 
</P>
<P>
 Homedco, based in Fountain Valley, provides home respiratory therapy, home 
infusion and nursing through 225 branch locations in 44 states.  
</P>
<P>
 The company recently reported a $21.6-million profit on revenue of $385.2 
million for nine months ended June 30.

 Homes for Chinese: Largo Vista Group, Ltd., a Newport Beach maker of 
manufactured homes, said it has signed a deal to export its houses to 
China.Models are scheduled to be shipped this week from the Port of Long Beach 
to Shenzhen, China, 30 miles from Hong Kong. The models will be erected in 
China for viewing by potential buyers. The population of Shenzhen, China's 
largest "Special Economic Zone," has grown from 40,000 to 4 million in the past 
10 years -- creating a severe housing shortage. Largo Vista plans to satisfy 
pent-up demand in China by selling Western-style manufactured homes.

 Chinese Market Opportunities: Largo Vista is not alone in sensing real estate 
opportunities in China. Because of recent land reforms, a private housing 
market could develop there during the next 10 years, providing tremendous 
opportunity to California home builders and lenders, according to a report 
released Tuesday by Kenneth Leventhal & Co., the Newport Beach accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, "China -- Opportunities for Developers in an Emerging Real Estate 
Market," also finds that a severe shortage of commercial space in China's 
largest cities has triggered a boom in construction. During the next two years, 
the supply of office space in these cities could double or triple. Interested 
foreign developers need to find Chinese partners "who have good connection with 
government agencies and local businesses," according to the study's author Stan 
Ross, a managing partner with the firm.

DEJA VU FOR RIGHTS LAWYER; PETER SCHEY IS JUMPING INTO THE FIGHT AGAINST PROP. 
187 -- MUCH LIKE THE BATTLE HE HELPED WIN FOR TEXAS STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW HELLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 When the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark 1982 decision on the 
right of illegal immigrant children to attend public schools, one of the civil 
rights attorneys who handled the case was in the jungles of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were huddled 'round a two-way radio, listening to the BBC," recalls Peter 
Schey, who was part of a team investigating human rights abuses by Contra 
rebels. "When we heard the ruling, I whooped for joy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision affecting some 150,000 undocumented children in Texas, the high 
court ruled in Plyler vs. Doe that a state law barring them from free public 
education was unconstitutional. It was only the second case Schey had argued 
before the court. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen years later, California's newly approved Proposition 187 promises to 
keep Schey -- already fully occupied as an international human rights advocate, 
immigrant rights lawyer and operator of a shelter for homeless kids -- busy for 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, he filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the "Save Our 
State" initiative, which echoes the Texas law by targeting public school 
students who are not legal residents of the United States. Says Schey, who 
heads the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law: 
"The consequences (of the measure) would just be tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 During an unconventional 21-year career, which has spanned numerous liberal 
causes, Schey has represented Salvadoran political prisoners, Native Americans, 
Haitian refugees and an Indian guru. On Oct. 15, he accompanied Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide back to Haiti as the exiled president returned to power. ("The only 
other L.A. attorney on the trip was (Secretary of State) Warren Christopher," 
he notes wryly.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a casual setting, he can be low-key, even reticent. But in court, allies 
and opponents say, it's a different story. "Peter never stops," says Ralph 
Santiago Abascal, a doyen of public interest attorneys and general counsel for 
California Rural Legal Assistance in San Francisco. "He's always at your 
heels." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kendall, a Department of Justice lawyer who has opposed Schey on several 
cases, says he may appear "laid back and mellow," but that the gloves come off 
before a judge. "This little sweet, innocent tone leaves him and he becomes 
very aggressive." He adds with a laugh: "Sometimes he can overkill and the 
judge will say, 'Now, Mr. Schey, shut up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A dapper man with wavy hair and blue eyes, Schey, 47, isn't given to 
introspection about his work. Asked why he pursues cases that require years of 
tortuous litigation and battles with bureaucrats, he says, "I don't quite know 
how to put it. I truly enjoy the work." 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely not for the money. Schey takes most cases pro bono; often, he 
says, he'll accept clients only if they have nowhere else to go. If he wins, he 
can apply for attorney's fees as part of the judgment, but that can mean 
another legal battle and the resulting fees are often below market rates. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep two other lawyers and a dozen staffers employed, the center handles a 
few private cases, accepts grants from foundations and charities, and stages an 
annual dinner that has honored human rights activists such as Aristide and 
actor Edward James Olmos. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from the Century City high-rises of the city's legal elite, Schey works 
out of a converted A-frame in the Westlake district, eschewing pin stripes in 
favor of khaki and denim. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that activism is part of Schey's heritage. His parents fled Germany 
in 1938 -- his father was Jewish and an anti-Nazi agitator -- and moved to 
South Africa, where Schey was born. By his teens, he was protesting the 
country's apartheid policies. When he was 15, the family moved to San 
Francisco, partly for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got particularly concerned when my picture appeared in a (newspaper) 
story about an anti-apartheid demonstration," he recalls in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 As an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, he was arrested during a Vietnam War 
protest. And, when he was a part-time youth counselor at a community center in 
the Hunter's Point district in San Francisco, he was caught in the middle of a 
two-day riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence erupted on Sept. 27, 1966, after a white policeman shot and 
killed a black teen-ager. Schey, then only 19, rushed to the community center, 
which the rioters had turned into a virtual headquarters, and tried to restore 
calm. He was still there the following evening when National Guard troops 
opened fire on the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was pretty intense," Schey says matter-of-factly, recalling that he 
avoided the flying bullets by diving to the floor of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 After some frantic phone calls from the center to the mayor, the Guard 
withdrew and negotiations began that led to increased employment opportunities 
for minority youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduating with a psychology degree, Schey went on to California Western 
School of Law in San Diego, where, as a student, he handled cases of illegal 
immigrants at a legal aid clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 When Schey started practicing law in 1973, it was, as one long-time associate 
points out, only natural for him to focus on civil rights cases. "He knew from 
experience what it was like to live in a polarized society," says Juan Jose 
Gutierrez, executive director of One-Stop Immigration, a Los Angeles-based 
legal aid project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel moved when I encounter people who are suffering in someway that seems 
unnecessary, that seems to result only from the actions of some bureaucratic 
official or agency," Schey says. 
</P>
<P>
 These days he describes himself as "overwhelmed." In addition to advising 
people like Aristide on human rights issues and arguing cases across the 
nation, he is something of a social worker, operating a residential shelter for 
homeless youths two blocks from his cluttered legal office. 
</P>
<P>
 One moment he can be discussing Haiti with a senior State Department official; 
the next, taking a call from a high school principal reporting a discipline 
problem with one of the shelter kids. "Very much an average day for me," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Schey, a resident of the Westside's Carthay Circle neighborhood, manages to 
set aside Friday afternoons for his 9-year-old daughter. He is married to 
Melinda Bird, who is also a public interest lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 He often spends evenings doing outreach among the homeless on Westlake 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some extent, it keeps me well-grounded," he says of his social work. "I 
wouldn't want to be removed from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, a leader of the anti-Proposition 187 fight, calls him a 
"trailblazing lawyer," particularly in the area of immigrant rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter is an extremely strong advocate for the immigration cause," agrees 
Kendall of the Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of litigation, Schey won complex class-action lawsuits against the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service that provided those arrested by the 
agency with written notice of their rights and allowed undocumented children in 
custody to be released to responsible adults pending deportation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he negotiated a $110,000 damages award for a Texas resident who, as a 
14-year-old, was improperly deported to Mexico -- the largest INS settlement 
ever paid in a personal injury lawsuit. He recently filed a class-action suit 
that alleges conditions at INS detention centers in San Pedro and elsewhere are 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "A handicapped guy called me from a detention center. They won't let him have 
a walker," he says with a grimace. "Just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Schey acknowledges that much of his work is mundane, of interest mainly to 
constitutional scholars or immigration experts. But he has experienced his 
share of the bizarre and even dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 One client was the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the orange-clad Indian mystic who 
founded a commune in Oregon and collected Rolls-Royces. In 1985, the Bhagwan 
hired Schey to arrange his voluntary surrender to U.S. authorities on 
immigration law charges. But the day the charges were made public, he attempted 
to flee the country in a private jet, only to be apprehended after landing in 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't work out too well," Schey laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, he received death threats while representing Haitian refugees seeking 
political asylum in Florida. Two years later, amid a civil war, he traveled to 
El Salvador to help locate Dennis Quintanilla, a U.S.-born child who 
disappeared after his parents were found slain there. Persisting in spite of 
concerns about his own safety, he negotiated with the Salvadoran National Guard 
to have the 3-year-old returned to the care of his uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Schey now represents several relatives of Mario Aburto Martinez -- the 
convicted assassin of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio -- as 
they seek political asylum in the U.S. His goal, he says, is to challenge a 
U.S. policy that "at a minimum strongly discourages the granting of asylum to 
any Mexican national." 
</P>
<P>
 He is also gearing up for the battle over Proposition 187. Harking back to the 
Plyler vs. Doe case, "it seems like deja vu ," he says. And he predicts that, 
with the Plyler precedent in place, Proposition 187 will be quashed. "I don't 
think the courts will ever permit its enforcement. I think it's 
unconstitutional."

A LEGACY OF LITIGATION; CAN SPERM BE BEQUEATHED? DEBORAH HECHT -- PICTURED 
ABOVE WITH LOVER WILLIAM KANE SHORTLY BEFORE HIS SUICIDE -- IS IN THE MIDST OF 
A COURT BATTLE WITH HIS CHILDREN. RARELY HAS SUCH A PERSONAL AND PRIVATE 
POSSESSION CAUSED SUCH A TENACIOUS AND PUBLIC CRUSADE. 
</P>

<P>
 She calls it her child. She even has a name for it. Boy or girl, it will be 
called Wyatt. But she's way ahead of herself. Deborah Hecht isn't even 
pregnant. At this point, her child is no more than 15 vials of sperm chilling 
for the past three years at a Westwood sperm bank. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll be lucky to get any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, they were intended for her. She even went along with her longtime 
lover, William Kane, on his several trips in 1991 to deposit sperm for her 
future insemination. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, nothing about what they did was as simple as it looked. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kane, a brilliant businessman, the trips to the sperm bank were just some 
of the personal missions he needed to complete before he killed himself. For 
Hecht, distraught over her lover's suicidal intentions, the trips were a way to 
soothe a man beleaguered by his demons. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bill Kane finally did commit suicide in October, 1991, at age 48, the 
only thing his death laid to rest was his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, Hecht, the major beneficiary of the estate, found herself 
pitted against Kane's grown son and daughter and embroiled in a legal battle 
that continues to this day. They've fought over money, furniture, and whether 
or not Deborah Hecht could have saved Kane from his death. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly they've fought over sperm -- the most coveted and least monetarily 
valuable item of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hecht, 39, the sperm is the legacy of the man she once loved -- and her 
only chance to have his baby. For the Kane children, the sperm is a 
grotesquerie -- a reminder of their father's strangely orchestrated death and 
the woman who didn't stop him. They want the sperm destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's some unexplored legal territory here -- can a person bequeath 
sperm the way you will someone a bracelet? -- the rougher terrain is the 
landscape of emotions. Rarely has such a personal and deeply private possession 
caused such a tenacious and public crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 Upping the psychological ante is the children's choice of attorney: their 
mother, Pasadena attorney Sandra Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a Superior Court judge's Solomonic decision last March to give Hecht 
three vials of sperm has gone unenforced as the children appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have girded themselves in hurt, anger and a certain amount of 
self-righteousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had just dropped dead one day and there was sperm lying around, I would 
not have said a thing," says Kane's 23-year-old son, Everett, who believes that 
Hecht used the sperm as a lever to get as much of the estate as possible from 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end -- once his many creditors are paid -- Kane's estate of nearly 
$1 million may be worth virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sperm has created an impassable issue," says Gary M. Ruttenberg, the 
attorney for the administrator of the estate. "I don't think either side is 
fighting over money." 
</P>
<P>
 So why would Hecht continue to fight two people (who show no signs of 
capitulating) for sperm (which is no guarantee of pregnancy)? 
</P>
<P>
 Because she believes this is her future. This is her baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child has become more than just Bill Kane's child," she says. "The child 
has its own identity. It's not about Bill so much, do you understand?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many people do not understand. Those who don't know Hecht are 
mystified, even scornful. The people who do know her bring gifts for the 
baby-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 Embattled or not, married or not, Deborah Hecht is 39 and wants to have a 
baby. The way she sees it, the traditional choices are unsatisfactory: "I can 
have the child of a man whom I don't know with sperm from a sperm bank -- and 
then face dealing with that later. The second choice is I can find a man I know 
and say, 'Can I have your child?' . . . Or if I were to push a man into 
marrying me for a child then that child will probably end up being the child of 
a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Or there's the option she's chosen: "To have a child by a man I know I love, 
who loved me, and then be a single mother by choice. That seems to be the most 
sensible choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Kane killed himself is not an issue for Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met a man and loved a man and watched a man who made a conscious decision 
that it was time for him to go," she says. "And just because it doesn't fit 
your image or picture of the way you think it's supposed to be doesn't mean it 
can't be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 When she met Bill Kane in 1985, he was president of a Los Angeles bank 
subsidiary that invested in real estate. She had moved around -- growing up in 
New York, going to college in San Francisco, teaching elementary school in the 
Bay Area, then moving to Hawaii and running jewelry stores with a business 
partner/boyfriend. She first encountered Kane while working for a real estate 
executive head hunter. Kane and Hecht met to do business together. But a 
relationship quickly brewed. They courted on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 She was going through the phase of her life where she kept lists of the pros 
and cons of the men she dated. Kane defied the list. He was everything that she 
didn't want -- he smoked, he didn't exercise, he ate poorly. And he was 
everything that she did want -- dashing, smart, funny, unconventional, intense, 
wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane was also the archetypal eccentric. At the time of his death, he hadn't 
worked for income in four years yet he kept a full-time secretary in an office 
in his Malibu house -- which he rarely left. Living off his previous financial 
successes, he preferred to stay up half the night and sleep during the 
mornings, a schedule Hecht struggled to match. By all accounts talented, he was 
an author, a businessman, a Yale-educated lawyer with an undergraduate degree 
from Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 For years he regaled friends and family with dubious stories about flying 
military planes and parachuting into foreign lands on secret missions. But his 
most well-known story was that he was a military strategist during the Gulf 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, who grew up idolizing his father and chose his alma mater to attend, 
later became obsessed with debunking the many stories his father told him. They 
spent a year in therapy together working on their relationship, but it didn't 
prevent an eruption of anger when Everett confronted his father with evidence 
of some of his falsehoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was a garden-variety pathological liar with a psychotic edge," 
says Everett Kane, now an art student in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht never saw Kane that way. Her story of their life together has the glow 
of adventure about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she moved to Los Angeles in 1987 to be with him, her life revolved around 
his, whether it was redecorating his house or going out to buy him books on 
topics that intrigued him. "Living with Bill Kane was like being in school 24 
hours a day because he never slept and I was constantly up with him," she says. 
"He always wanted company. . . . It was an awesome, awesome experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the summer of 1991, Kane had become quiet and brooding. He was locked 
in a bruising legal battle with a former business partner and his financial 
resources were dwindling. An extravagant man, he was paying more than $8,000 a 
month to rent a rambling Malibu home at the end of a treacherous road in Las 
Flores Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht was soaking in the adobe tub of their bathroom when Kane told her that 
he planned to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I want to be here anymore," he said as he stood in the doorway, 
cradling a glass of wine in one hand. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two months, Hecht says that she cajoled and counseled Kane on all 
the reasons he should stay alive. She accompanied him to therapy sessions with 
Westwood clinical psychologist Carl Faber. She held him at night. She cried as 
he slept. But she also helped him finalize his plans: She bought him a kit so 
he could change his will, she suggested that he leave a letter for his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 He broached marriage -- then nixed the idea, saying she would be burdened with 
his financial problems. When he offered to get her pregnant, she feared the 
stress would make her miscarry. "I couldn't fathom the chance of being pregnant 
when he was talking about dying," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When he suggested a sperm bank, he dispatched her to research the topic. She 
accompanied him on his five trips to the California Cryobank, where he 
deposited sperm and left the vials in her name. 
</P>
<P>
 He made her promise not to tell his children of his plans. "I had no 
commitment to them," she says. "My commitment was to him." 
</P>
<P>
 And when he finally told her he was going to Las Vegas on a one-way ticket, 
she drove him to the airport, knowing full well she might never see him alive 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers saying to their psychotherapist: "'I can't glue myself to his 
hip and make sure every moment he doesn't. . . .' " Her voice quivers at the 
memory. "I wasn't God. So if I went with him to Vegas, then the next trip he'd 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 30, 1991, ensconced at the Mirage Hotel, Kane swallowed a handful of 
sleeping pills and some Dramamine and put a plastic bag over his head. He left 
a note for the management reassuring them he had no complaints with the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why am I checking out?" he wrote in a rambling suicide missive. "All I 
have to look forward to is a life of mediocre survival; and that has not been 
my chosen way of living." 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht does not see Kane's "checking out" as an affront to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved him so deeply that when he turned to me and said, 'It's time for me 
to go now,' ultimately I could step back and say, 'I love you so much that if 
you are in that much pain, that tired, it's time for you to go and I know it's 
not because of me.' He made sure I didn't feel personally. . . ." She stops 
herself, then continues, "It wasn't my fault." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A week before Kane's death, Hecht was counseling Kane's daughter, Katie, then 
18, on her love life. Two weeks later they were headed for a court battle. 
Kane's children contested the will, claiming that Hecht -- the major 
beneficiary of the estate and its executor -- had exerted undue influence over 
their father, whom they argued was too depressed to be of sound mind. They also 
sued her unsuccessfully for wrongful death. 
</P>
<P>
 The children portrayed Hecht as a conniving opportunist who kept Kane isolated 
from family and friends in the last few weeks before his death as she went 
about securing his assets for herself. In the days after his death, they say, 
she tried to sell Kane's furniture, forged checks on Kane's account and lied to 
Las Vegas officials about her identity -- she called herself "Mrs. Kane" -- to 
get Kane's body and personal property released to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a woman who will do anything to get what she wants," says lawyer 
Irwin, who was married to Kane for 10 years. They were divorced 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht says she did sign Kane's name on checks -- "to pay for his funeral." She 
did misrepresent herself as Mrs. Kane to Las Vegas authorities. She did try to 
sell furniture. "It seemed logical," she insists. "Sell some of it, pay bills. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And she wasn't without a certain theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the dismay of the Kane children, Hecht showed up at one deposition 
wearing Bill Kane's clothes -- as a kind of comforting armor, she explained 
later. When the estate attorney insisted she return the clothes to the estate, 
she angrily ripped the shirt open to her bra and sat there defiantly until her 
attorney suggested she put her clothes back on -- and defended her action as an 
attempt to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 The family claims that in the days after Kane's death, Hecht frantically 
searched for a nonexistent $1 million life insurance policy -- a charge Hecht 
denies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 when Hecht agreed to a settlement that essentially gave 80% of Kane's 
estate to the children, she believed the sperm was not an issue. Who would want 
it but her? She was wrong. Kane had left the sperm to the care of the executor 
of the estate, and although he had designated Hecht as his executor, the court 
transferred that role to a neutral administrator, a common practice. Suddenly, 
Hecht had no right to the sperm. And the battle for control began. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, a Superior Court judge ordered it destroyed. But last year a state 
appeals court reversed that finding, noting that sperm could be treated similar 
to property in court. That moved the case back to Superior Court, where Judge 
Arnold Gold ruled that Hecht was entitled to 20% of the sperm. The family has 
temporarily blocked that ruling by appealing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin's arsenal of arguments includes the claim that Hecht has no right to the 
sperm because it was an anatomical gift, like eyes or organs or limbs. "She is 
not a valid donee because she has no medical need for therapy or 
transplantation," Irwin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in all this is what Bill Kane himself seemed to want. 
</P>
<P>
 In his suicide letter, he acknowledged that he had been generating sperm for 
Hecht and even addressed these unborn children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have loved you in my dreams," he wrote, "even though I never got to see you 
born." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death, Kane and Hecht decided together that the child would be 
named Wyatt if it was a girl and Joshua if it was a boy. She has already 
transgressed against his wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill," she says, pausing over dessert in a restaurant, glancing skyward, 
"you'll forgive me, but I don't want it named Joshua any longer. I want it 
named Wyatt and Wyatt only, and I know you'll live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kane's suicide doesn't hang over her would-be pregnancy like a cloud. She only 
sees his desire that she bear his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes such a statement of his love for me," she says. "He couldn't be with 
me but he left me the capability to be with his child." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Irwin has accused Hecht of only wanting the child for its dramatic 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht admits she's thought about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to look at the fact that I'm sitting here with a reporter," she says. 
"Am I here with this reporter to get the sperm to make a scene to have a movie? 
I have to constantly be on check about that with myself because I don't want 
that to be the case. If I decide to have this child you can know that I decided 
to do it because I want to do it. And not because they don't want me to." 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the mention of Katie and Everett Kane's dread of a half-sibling can 
dampen her enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that her life is as lavish as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 She owes her attorney, Marvin Rudnick, $110,000. She's gone on talk shows for 
money, tinkered with a book, discussed selling film and television rights. Once 
an aspiring actress, she's now put theatrical ambitions aside to pursue a more 
stable job. She's now a gemologist and sells gemological equipment at a Santa 
Monica store. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the expansive Malibu house she once roamed. (It burned to the ground 
in the Malibu fires.) Now she lives in a tiny Santa Monica studio that she 
rents for $650 a month. She pays $200 a year in storage fees on the sperm she 
can't have yet. Hats decorate one wall and a collection of snapshots of friends 
crowd another. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she speaks of Bill Kane with devotion, she sees other men. "I 
date," she says tersely. "Let's just leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
 But always there is Bill Kane. 
</P>
<P>
 On a shelf sits a Chinese jade urn that contains a few spoonfuls of his ashes. 
Although she dutifully had his ashes scattered at sea, she saved a few for 
herself, an ever-present reminder of his life and his suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a lot of thinking and communicating before he decided to do it," says 
Hecht, sitting in her apartment, the urn nearby. "I don't want to say I forgave 
him, because it wasn't about forgiving him. It was about understanding him."

 Call it Compu-Coif. The Digital Dresser, perhaps? Microchip Clothier? Or how 
about just . . . Soft-wear? 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Chen, a 26-year-old USC graduate student in engineering, uses a computer 
program to get dressed. It chooses everything -- skirts, blouses, accessories 
-- each choice geared to the weather, season, event, even her sartorial whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 When you stop to think about it, Chen's program, developed as a project for a 
class in Neural Fuzzy Logic, offers the frightening potential of relieving 
humanity from the responsibility of the casual decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine. Computer programs to solve such trifling questions as: Where do you 
wanna eat? What movie do you wanna see? Should I punch out my therapist? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could design a program for any kind of decision," said Chen, who 
apparently has not considered the horrific ramifications of her invention. 
"When I was designing it, I was just trying to make something for me to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, programs of this ilk could have been devised years ago. What is new 
-- indeed, revolutionary -- about Chen's "Perfect Fashion Design" is her use of 
so-called "fuzzy logic," a relatively new concept that allows the computer to 
deal in probabilities rather than absolutes; gray instead of black and white. 
Just like humans (with the possible exception of Oliver North) do. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, in lieu of a plain "yes or no" offered by a non-fuzzy program, 
fuzzy programs might advise a user to lean toward Chinese food for dinner, or 
to probably steer clear of that stupid "Gump" movie, or merely irritate one's 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point, "Perfect Fashion Design's" database contains information on 
Chen's entire expansive wardrobe. Rather than sitting stricken with indecision 
in front of her crowded Hacienda Heights closet -- as she often did -- Chen now 
can feed the following variables into her program: season, weather, type of 
occasion and degree of formality. 
</P>
<P>
 Without fuzzy logic, her computer would be restricted to simple suggestions 
such as, in the question of weather: "hot," "cold," "cool," "warm." With fuzzy 
logic, Chen can slide her cursor anywhere between cool and cold, or between 
warm and warmer -- lukewarm, you could say. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of formality, she might slide the cursor barely toward formal, or 
just over the line toward casual, or tentatively in the direction of . . . 
flashy. Such possibilities as quasi-formal are available, or somewhat casual, 
or just a tad flamboyant, or a wee-bit chilly, or summery, or "casual day" at 
work, or rather funereal, or knock 'em dead. 
</P>
<P>
 And . . . voila! The computer "spits out," to use Chen's picturesque term, 
five choices of ensemble -- in order of recommendation, and in full color. In 
the rare instance in which the master's candidate doesn't like any of the 
options, she simply orders the computer to cough up five more. Yes, she still 
bears the burden of final choice -- but, as she will tell you, it beats the 
hell out of trying on a dozen outfits before going to work an hour late. 
</P>
<P>
 And lest you think that something as technically wondrous as fuzzy logic is 
demeaned by such mundane application, consider this: In Japan, fuzzy circuits 
control subways, elevators, bread-makers, rice cookers, washing machines and 
various other everyday appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "My program is for everyone who doesn't really have time to look into their 
wardrobe every day to figure out what to wear," said Chen. "You can make it 
adapt to your needs. If you program the same request two days in a row, it will 
not repeat the preceding top five choices. If you want different clothes every 
day, you can do that. Or you can train the computer to learn your taste." 
</P>
<P>
 That might be a dubious achievement in the case of Chen's fiance, Robert Lee, 
a self-described "nerdy engineer" who laughingly summed up his fashion 
sensibilities with the phrase "whatever's on the top of the pile." Lee is 
nonetheless helping Chen improve the program for possible marketing. (They're 
looking for investors.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process now," said Lee, "of putting adaptive strategy into the 
software, so what the program will do is try to derive your tastes in clothing. 
In other words, after you use the program for awhile, the software is smart 
enough to know your color taste, etc., just based on experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Chen brainstormed "Perfect Fashion Design," or PFD, for a class taught by USC 
professor Dr. Bart Kosco, who for the past six years has held annual contests 
in his popular Neural Fuzzy Logic course. Past winners have come up with fuzzy 
orange sorters, a fuzzy pet door that opens only for recognizable meows, a 
star-movement tracker to facilitate automatic photography of the night sky, and 
grander concepts (including a fuzzy sewer system). Chen was actually runner-up 
to a student who designed a fuzzy pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Jean did was novel, because her project is one of the first applications 
of fuzzy logic to fashion, if not the first," said Kosco. "And in general, it's 
one of the first applications to aesthetics. And it brings up an old problem in 
economics. That is, how does an executive pick her tie in the morning?" (Or 
even his.) 
</P>
<P>
 But what of the danger of losing the power of casual decision? 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a decision made, whether it's with help from your grandfather, or a 
chip implanted in your brain -- I don't think that does anything but give you 
more opportunity and enhance your freedom," Kosco said. "It's no more 
dehumanizing than writing your personal thoughts in a diary. It's no more 
dehumanizing than if I have access to your diary. That's what it comes down 
to." (The government has yet to resolve the privacy issues surrounding 
digitally stored personal information.) 
</P>
<P>
 Chen envisions several possible applications of PFD, aside from home use. 
First, she's thinking of joining up with her mom, Celia Hu, a former fashion 
designer in Taiwan, to market clothing via the Internet. Shoppers could program 
their stylistic preferences into the system and be instantly presented with 
pictures of items tailored to their distinct tastes. Chen is also mulling over 
the idea of using PFD as a long-distance shopping tool for celebrities who 
"don't like to go out and shop." Another possibility ought to frighten certain 
salespeople right out of their disingenuousness: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about doing something for department stores," said Chen. 
"Instead of going through the whole floor, browsing and asking for help, you 
just go to a terminal and say, 'OK, I want to wear thus-and-such,' and describe 
the type of clothing you want. And the terminal displays a few appropriate 
items and tells exactly where to look for them, like Aisle 1 or 2. And it will 
also offer matching accessories, shoes, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Right, but will it ever learn to be condescending, or unctuous, or cloying, 
patronizing, pesky, petulant, frivolous, suspicious, or even charming?

BY DESIGN; THE GREATEST OUTFITS ON EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the beginning, the acrobats refused to perform in feathers and lace, the 
pantomime artist said nyet to his new overcoat and the lead chanteuse rejected 
her seemingly 10-ton tulle skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Unruffled by such snags, designer Dominique Lemieux, who has been with the 
Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil since 1989, says that creating the 90 costumes 
for "Alegria" was easy: "It was like something I already had inside of me for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing inspiration from the title -- Spanish for joy, gaiety, merriment -- 
Lemieux sketched at least 10 options for every character. Final selections were 
made after meetings with the performers, in which, she says: "We try to find 
the truth about them -- how they move, how they relate to my drawings." 
</P>
<P>
 The traveling "Alegria," in Santa Monica on its fifth stop of a 12-city tour, 
expresses hope for humanity -- despite some ugly truths conveyed by 16 "big old 
birds" dressed in jewel-encrusted silk jackets. Masks of leather and Lycra 
(tidied daily with Baby Fresh wipes) create their grotesque wrinkled faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The tally for one bird costume is more than $10,000, and dressing the entire 
flock requires 5,000 buttons, rhinestones and faux jewels -- all hand-sewn; 
1,600 synthetic flowers; 2,000 yards of plastic boning; 300 yards of silk 
brocade, and 160 quarts of purple dye. 
</P>
<P>
 With $382,000 allocated for costumes, the creative staff can afford to be 
picky. Ninety percent of the fabrics, for example, are custom-dyed by a 
seven-member team ensconced in a Montreal technical school. Silk is the fabric 
of choice because it wears well, dyes beautifully, moves poetically and can be 
hand-washed and line-dried, a favorite Cirque maintenance technique. Trims 
attach with snaps or Velcro.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the feathers are rendered in washable chiffon or organza. But the two 
contortionists -- their tiny, nubile frames unforgettable in hand-painted gold 
and blue bodysuits -- enter and leave in ostrich feather capes, which stay 
white thanks to a special powder. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the extraordinary wear and tear, new costumes arrive from Montreal 
in a steady stream. And costumer Emery Comeau prowls the dressing rooms daily, 
looking for the minor repairs that must be made before every performance: 
Missing ornaments are replaced, ripped garments are mended, scuffed shoes are 
repainted. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent sunny afternoon, his chores included hand-finishing a new gold 
lame bodysuit for an acrobat and replacing the silver spangles on the back-up 
singer's net skirt. In all, 1,000 buttons and jewels are used for the two 
singers' costumes. But with replacement parts filed away in the myriad drawers 
and boxes that line his costume-shop trailer, Comeau says repairs rarely pose a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers, however, sometimes do. 
</P>
<P>
 Yves Fournier, director of the company's Montreal costume shop, concedes that 
former Olympic gymnasts don't take instantly to feathers, lace and lame or 
leather masks and varnished-acrylic wigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wig and a mask add five pounds more. And most of the artists have never 
worn costumes before. So we have to teach them it won't be a problem. For 
example, when the Russian trapeze team arrived, they said: 'We can't do our act 
with feathers in back and this big collar around our neck.' Then the trainer 
tried one, and we changed some little things." 
</P>
<P>
 The chanteuse was consoled with fewer layers of tulle. And the Russian clown 
had the last word. An understanding Lemieux explains: "We did a new coat for 
him, but he didn't like it. It has to move in a certain way. He's so used to 
being in one mood, if you put him in a costume that doesn't have that mood, it 
doesn't work. So the coat he has comes from Moscow."

BY DESIGN; A FAST BREAK; AFTER TWO YEARS WITH JC PENNEY, ANTHONY MARK HANKINS 
MADE HIS MOVE. NOW HIS ETHNIC STYLES ARE HOT AND HIS AMBITION ENDLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE M. JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Mark Hankins has big plans. There's the book deal, the tent shows in 
New York, the children's TV show, and, oh yes, the "Oprah" appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the designer speaks of these plans with his combustible mix of youth and 
determination, it's clear they are not dreams, they are certainties. He will 
summon them into being. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is the 26-year-old who left a well-paying job at JCPenney, set 
up his own company in two weeks, then signed a contract with the retailer that 
could bring him $1 million in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think it all started with Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins had already worked with New York designer Adrienne Vittadini when he 
landed an L.A.-based job in quality assurance with Penney's. Two years later, 
he was showing its executives his line designed especially for African American 
women. He persuaded them to merchandise the clothes, and they were a hit. But 
Hankins felt strangely unsatisfied. An epiphany struck as he rode a train 
toward Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up a magazine that had a cover article with a title like, 'The 
Trials and Tribulations of Connie Chung,' Hankins recalls. "I thought, 'What 
kind of problems could she have?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The article told of the newscaster's career challenges as an Asian American 
woman. "And then she said things got better when she finally decided to take 
control and do things on her own." 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins got off the train at the next stop and called a JCPenney executive to 
say he wanted to quit and start his own business. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, his eponymous firm has the Elizabeth, N.J.-born designer living in 
Dallas, right in Penney's back yard, because "I want them to know I'm serious 
about them. I want to be woven into the Penney tapestry." 
</P>
<P>
 Through their licensing agreement, he brightens the firm's image with clothes 
that emphasize sizzling color and spicy ethnic prints. His signature is 
detailing -- glass beadwork, braided trim and buttons that double as stylish 
ornaments. Even his label is embroidered with Mayan handprints, a symbol he 
says is spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 The little things, he says, let his customers know he cares. "Those are the 
things people cherish -- the things people labor over," Hankins says. 
"Retailers have forgotten that people buy for appreciation, not just because 
it's on sale. They want things for the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 With his line in 324 stores, sizes ranging from petite to extra tall, Hankins 
would love to see "every sister of color wearing something of Anthony's." But 
he believes his clothing's appeal is universal. In fact, he says, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton would look great in his clothes. "She has the perfect body for 
ethnic prints," he says. "I could have Hillary working it!" 
</P>
<P>
 The designer knows about working it. He has parlayed his JCPenney success into 
a deal with Vogue Butterick patterns, due out in fall, 1995. And he's 
developing a scent -- something exotic and earthy with hints of basil and mocha 
-- with help from a major fragrance house. "It will be for men, but women will 
sell it in the commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 Women surround and inspire Hankins. "I've always been fascinated by women," he 
admits. "They provoke change. How many men do you know that provoke change -- 
besides war?"  
</P>
<P>
 Although he designs with such notable women of style as Diana Ross and Diahann 
Carroll in mind, Hankins credits his mother with introducing him to the drama 
of fashion. "She had a walk-in closet full of hats and suits, and she had 
earrings made from buttons. She believes in adornment." 
</P>
<P>
 As a church missionary, Hankins' mother also taught him a thing or two about 
faith and perseverance -- he won't accept "no." Thus, he is confident in his 
two-year plan ("a book on a Generation Xer in the corporate world"); his 
three-year plan ("tent shows, but with my $64-for-a-set-type merchandise"); and 
his 10-year plan ("a PBS show on color appreciation for kids: 'Boys and girls, 
tomorrow we're going to Ivana Trump's house' "). 
</P>
<P>
 And let's not forget the retail stores and the haute couture line, because 
"Jessye Norman needs clothes too!" And the television appearances. "I'm going 
to be on 'Oprah' and '20/20'. . . . I will be on Barbara's (Walters) show if I 
have to show up on her set with my girls!" 
</P>
<P>
 When Hankins talks this way, he clenches his fists and squints and stamps his 
feet, as if to quell the overwhelming desire. He can see it in the distance, 
and he will make it so. He will . 
</P>
<P>
 Get ready, Oprah.

<P>
 No instructions are too fuzzy for Jean Chen's fuzzy-logic-based "Perfect 
Fashion Design" program. 
</P>
<P>
 As an experiment, the following deliberately quirky specifications were 
entered into PFD: weather -- coolish; season -- spring; style of occasion -- 
formal; sartorial whimsy -- between flashy and everyday.The results? 
</P>
<P>
 1. A gypsy-like (Carole Little) dress, a little off-the-shoulder, very loose, 
navy blue, with skirt portion containing horizontal layers of various muted 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A somewhat transparent black two-piece ensemble, with short skirt and 
sleeves trimmed with black lace, and big gold buttons up the front. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Ensemble of long-sleeved blouse and long skirt of subtle abstract pattern. 
Brick-brown color, with light lace trim and double-breasted top. 
</P>
<P>
 4. A conservative cotton gray dress with faint white stripes, pocket with 
white scarf. A dignified work dress. 
</P>
<P>
 5. A navy blue (Carole Little) blouse, with beige skirt printed with navy blue 
floral pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen's choice: No. 1, "Because I like navy, and this is a formal occasion."

CLINTON, GOP OFFER PEACE, AND CLENCHED FISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and the new Republican leaders of Congress proffered olive 
branches to each other but simultaneously clenched their fists amid strong 
signs that the post-election cease-fire may prove fragile and fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Though both sides vowed to work together on a broad range of issues, including 
welfare reform and government streamlining, each laid down markers that seem to 
make collision inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 In press conferences Wednesday, Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), soon to become Senate majority leader and Speaker of the House, 
declared their intention to move quickly to pass a balanced-budget amendment, 
limit welfare benefits and reform the political system. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich also spoke of a middle-class tax cut and Clinton, adapting quickly to 
a hostile new climate, indicated that he might cooperate in this area -- but 
only if a way can be found to pay for it through spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a clearly chastened Clinton who emerged Wednesday morning to survey an 
utterly changed political landscape and to wonder what he can salvage of his 
damaged presidency. Buoyant Republican leaders, trying unsuccessfully not to 
gloat, spoke with voices of authority that they had never before known. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said that Tuesday's GOP groundswell was a clear vote of no confidence in 
Clinton's agenda but he reassured the President in a telephone conversation 
that Republicans in the Senate "want to work together where we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, smiling wanly at a press conference, said of voters: "They sent us a 
clear message. I got it." 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted responsibility for the voters' harsh verdict on the Democrats' 
performance over the last two years but asserted that much of the popular anger 
was directed not at him but at an arrogant Congress dominated for 40 years by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Democrats in control of both the White House and the Congress, we 
were held accountable yesterday and I accept my share of the responsibility in 
the result of the elections," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added later in the news conference: "I believe that a lot of these things 
that we saw yesterday were the culmination of many years of trends, as well as 
a dissatisfaction with the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House aide, glumly analyzing Tuesday's results, said voters 
clearly concluded that the American political process was paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something had to happen and it had to be big," the aide said. "And it was 
big." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meeting with South Korean officials in 
Seoul, felt compelled to reassure his hosts that the course of American foreign 
policy will not change because of Tuesday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a strong continuity in American foreign policy," Christopher said in 
a hastily rewritten public speech. "I want to assure this international 
audience that we intend to go forward in the spirit of bipartisanship. . . . 
Our policy toward Asia and particularly toward Korea has strong bipartisan 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's electoral earthquake left behind a political landscape transformed 
almost beyond recognition. After controlling the House without interruption for 
40 years, Democrats surrendered the lower chamber with a loss of at least 51 
seats in Tuesday's balloting, with seven elections still too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the Democrats lost six open seats that the party now holds, saw 
two incumbents (Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania and Jim Sasser of Tennessee) 
defeated, and failed to capture a single seat now held by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans concluded election night with a 52-48 advantage in the Senate 
and swelled their margin by another vote on Wednesday, when conservative 
Democratic Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama switched to the GOP. In announcing 
his decision, Shelby declared that "there is not" room in the Democratic Party 
any longer "for a conservative Southern Democrat such as myself." 
</P>
<P>
 While at least 33 Democratic House incumbents were defeated, not a single 
Republican incumbent was turned out of office. Republicans will hold at least 
229 seats in the House next year, with the potential for further gains as the 
last races are decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list of defeated Democrats is House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.). Foley conceded defeat Wednesday afternoon to George Nethercutt, a 
Republican attorney who, like many GOP winners, had never previously held 
public office. With 99% of the vote counted, Foley trailed Nethercutt by 2,174 
votes, 50.6% to 49.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of Foley -- who became the first House Speaker denied reelection 
since 1860 -- offered an emphatic coda to a GOP sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Foley, Republican challengers took out such other prominent 
Democrats as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas, 34-year 
veteran Neal Smith of Iowa, former Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of 
Illinois and House Intelligence Chairman Dan Glickman of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats lost 10 governorships that their party now holds without capturing 
any that Republicans now control. Among the Democratic governors toppled were 
two of the party's best known figures: New York's Mario M. Cuomo and Ann 
Richards of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined loss of at least 59 seats in the House and Senate was the most 
since 1958 when Republicans lost 60 en route to losing the White House two 
years later. It exceeded even the losses that Republicans suffered in the 1974 
Watergate election, when the GOP lost 43 House and three Senate seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Republicans repeatedly insisted that they intend to work with Clinton, 
party leaders also made clear that they interpret the results as an unambiguous 
repudiation of the President and his agenda -- a position that may inherently 
limit the opportunities for cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't be dismissed as anti-incumbency because we didn't lose any 
(incumbents)," Dole told reporters Wednesday afternoon. "It was an anti-Clinton 
agenda, or anti-Clinton vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dole and Gingrich said that Republicans would move ahead quickly with the 
agendas that Senate and House Republicans respectively laid out during the 
campaign. The House plan is contained in the more detailed form of a "contract 
with America" that drew intense attack during the campaign from Clinton and 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Gingrich said that the Republican House would bring to a vote 
within the session's first 100 days central items in the contract plan, 
including "a vote on term limits; a constitutional amendment to require a 
balanced budget; the line-item veto; litigation reform; welfare reform; an 
effective, enforceable death penalty; beginning to phase out the marriage 
penalty in the tax code" and lowering Social Security taxes on higher-income 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said that the GOP also will move quickly on congressional reforms, 
promising "the opening thing the first day" to pass legislation requiring 
Congress to abide by the laws it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an appearance Wednesday morning in his home district of Cobb County, Ga., 
Gingrich unveiled a previously unseen conciliatory tone toward Clinton. 
Gingrich told reporters that "it would be foolish to seek to go out and 
embarrass the President" by proceeding first with measures that would prompt 
vetoes by Clinton or put the Administration in a defensive crouch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should start in a positive way and not assume there will be vetoes," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, Clinton ran against the items in the Republican contract and the 
voters decisively rebuffed him. "The American people chose," Gingrich said. "So 
the contract in my mind is not negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole was less specific about his priorities, saying that Senate Republicans 
had only "talked in general terms" about such issues as a balanced-budget 
amendment, welfare reform and ethics reform. Asked in one television interview 
if Gingrich's "contract" would drive the Senate Republican agenda, Dole -- who 
has previously sparred with his brash counterpart in the House -- quickly 
answered: "I think it'll more drive the House agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said at his news conference that there are items in the Republican 
contract that he could live with -- the line-item veto, political reform, 
revisions to the tax code and welfare reform -- but that he would not do 
anything that he believes would endanger the economic recovery, such as tax 
cuts without compensating reductions in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But compromise even in those areas may be extremely arduous. On welfare, for 
instance, it will be difficult for Clinton to swallow the demands, popular 
among Republicans, to cut off all aid to young women who bear children out of 
wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to compromise on my convictions," Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their paeans to bipartisanship, Republicans sent the same blunt 
message. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a leader among conservatives and a likely 
rival of Dole's for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination, said Republicans 
would be willing to deal with Clinton -- so long as he moves toward their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not willing to compromise meeting the President halfway and going in the 
wrong direction," Gramm said. "Why should we want to go halfway in the wrong 
direction?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the reality is that Clinton does not know what direction to turn now. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he wants to take "a long nap," let the Republicans revel in 
their victory for a few days, then travel to Asia to try to boost U.S. trade. 
</P>
<P>
 And after a long political strategy session at the White House Wednesday, one 
aide commented: "The question was, where do we go from here? I don't think we 
know. And that's what frightens me."

WILSON SAVORS WIN; DEMOCRATS ASSESS DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fresh from the most stunning comeback in California political history, Gov. 
Pete Wilson moved Wednesday to implement controversial Proposition 187 even as 
he simultaneously sought to cool the passions that he helped raise with his 
support of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed an executive order that would cut off prenatal care and nursing 
home services to illegal immigrants. At the same time, he warned in a Los 
Angeles news conference against any show of racial intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say very clearly, very simply, that there is no room in California for 
bigotry, discrimination," Wilson said. "We will continue to condemn 
intolerance. We will continue to protect individual rights. This is a 
commitment we make to all Californians without regard to ethnic origin or skin 
color. It applies regardless of whether the English they speak is with an 
accent." 
</P>
<P>
 Signaling by his rhetoric that his long-running battle with President Clinton 
over illegal immigration will extend beyond Election Day, Wilson continued to 
take defiant jabs at the federal government and sought to reassure voters that 
he had understood the message of rage delivered so emphatically Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters . . . sent a resounding message to Washington that California is 
not simply a colony of the federal government to be taxed without limit to pay 
for the cost of the federal failures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson was relishing the broadest statewide Republican gains in a 
generation -- changes that will substantially improve his chances of pushing a 
second-term agenda through the Legislature -- the Democratic Party was reeling 
from defeat, seeking to find something glimmering among the ashes of their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Kathleen Brown blamed her loss on a tidal 
wave of anti-Democratic sentiment. She acknowledged that the three attributes 
that propelled her to the nomination -- that she was a woman, a Democrat and a 
Brown -- turned out to be grim liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear that if people went into the voting booth voting their anger, 
their fear and their frustrations, that I couldn't win and the Democrats 
couldn't win," she said. "And voters went into the voting booth and voted their 
fears and their frustrations and their anger." 
</P>
<P>
 An election cycle that began so confidently for Democrats, on the heels of a 
1992 presidential win here for the first time since 1964 and the election of 
two Democratic senators, ended with defeats more sweeping than almost anyone 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at a train wreck with no survivors," said Bob Mulholland, the state 
party's campaign adviser. He was exaggerating, but only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, still a relatively unpopular governor in a state whose residents are 
overwhelmingly negative about where California is going, easily outdistanced 
Brown, 55% to 40%, according to unofficial returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans picked up five statewide offices, three more than they have held 
for most of the last two decades. Of the two statewide Democratic victories, 
one -- the race for controller -- was decided by a 2-point margin. Only 
Democratic veteran Gray Davis, who was elected lieutenant governor, won 
convincingly, defeating Republican state Sen. Cathie Wright by 12 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP won the governorship and the posts of secretary of state, treasurer, 
attorney general and insurance commissioner. In unofficial returns, they also 
drew even with Democrats in the Assembly, apparently winning 40 seats, and came 
within a whisper of seizing the state Senate and possibly the congressional 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few signs of optimism for Democrats was Dianne Feinstein's apparent 
reelection to the U.S. Senate by a 47%-45% margin over U.S. Rep. Mike 
Huffington. Several hundred thousand absentee votes were yet uncounted, but 
Feinstein was expected to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks Wednesday, Wilson asserted that voters had given him a "very 
clear mandate on issues" that he will pursue in his second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to my own reelection, yesterday's historic gains for the 
Republican Party are as well a clear sign that the voters want more of the 
right kind of change, the kind we have been fighting for and the kind we have 
been working with Democratic majorities to achieve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of change that I think people want is for government to do not 
everything for them but to do those things which they have a right to expect of 
government and to do them well and to give them priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said his priorities will be improving the job climate, toughening 
criminal penalties, reforming education and further overhauling the state's 
welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of his time Wednesday was spent explaining the implementation of 
Proposition 187. Wilson acknowledged that if the measure is upheld by the 
courts -- on Wednesday a judge already restrained the state from expelling 
illegal immigrants from schools -- it will cause some "dislocation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to enforce it," he said. "We also intend to do so in a way that 
produces as little dislocation as possible. But it is going to produce some 
dislocation." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor continued to frame the initiative as one that would take services 
from illegal residents and give them to legal residents. He said Wednesday that 
barring illegal immigrants from receiving prenatal care -- which he demanded in 
the executive order -- would allow the state to pay for prenatal care for 1,000 
more poor legal residents each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, in her remarks to reporters at a separate Los Angeles news conference, 
gave Wilson grudging credit for being "very shrewd" at distilling the election 
into a contest over crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wilson) found two dogs that hunt: immigration and crime," she said. "What 
I'm concerned about is how we're going to balance this budget. What I'm 
concerned about is how are we going to fix our schools and our colleges and our 
universities. Those are going to be the instruments of prosperity for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to attribute blame for her loss to anything but the overwhelming 
national tide against Democrats. But it was clear that Brown's campaign was 
weaker than Democrats had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown collected about 3.2 million votes, almost 850,000 fewer than the second 
Democrat on the ballot, Lt. Gov.-elect Davis. Feinstein and the Democratic 
nominees for secretary of state, controller and insurance commissioner also 
tallied more votes than Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brown was reluctant to cast blame on her own campaign or her own party 
Wednesday, other Democrats were not. The poor showing set off rounds of angry 
internecine criticism as Democrats sought to figure out how to cope as a 
distinctly minority party nationally and to a great extent in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democrats privately blamed the Brown campaign for a weak showing that by 
extension lowered enthusiasm for their candidates farther down the ballot. Many 
were furious about Brown's failure to run virtually any commercials over the 
last weekend before the election -- because the campaign had run out of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken losses with constitutional officers and with the Legislature and 
a big chunk of the blame has to be assigned to the gubernatorial race," said 
Darry Sragow, a strategist who ran the losing campaign of incumbent Rep. 
Richard Lehman of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what had gone wrong in the governor's race, party campaign adviser 
Mulholland said bluntly: "There was no governor's race. . . . In reality, there 
was only one team on the field and that was Wilson's." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland and Sragow were among the Democrats speaking openly Wednesday of 
the need for a fundamental rethinking of the party's future. Mulholland blasted 
national Democratic leaders of projecting an image of "corruption, perks and 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 Party Chairman Bill Press held a more optimistic view, pointing to Feinstein's 
apparent win as an indication that Democrats here held back the GOP flood tide 
better than their peers in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he acknowledged, "anybody who would deny that this is a colossal, 
hopefully temporary, realignment is just kidding themselves."

FEINSTEIN IS APPARENT WINNER IN SENATE RACE; POLITICS: EXPERTS SAY LEAD IS 
PROBABLY ENOUGH, EVEN WITH 500,000 UNCOUNTED BALLOTS. HUFFINGTON REFUSES TO 
CONCEDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Democrat Dianne Feinstein was the apparent winner in California's topsy-turvy 
race for U.S. Senate Wednesday, but the outcome remained so close that 
Feinstein declined to claim victory and Republican challenger Mike Huffington 
refused to concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic finish to the nation's most expensive congressional race in 
history, state election officials said they expect that the final outcome will 
not be known until early next week as county registrars tally at least 500,000 
absentee ballots that remained uncounted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of the outstanding ballots indicated that it was all but 
impossible for Huffington to overcome the 123,610-vote margin that Feinstein 
won on Election Day. With all of the state's precincts reporting by 4 a.m. 
Wednesday, Feinstein was ahead 46.6% to 45%, marking just the third time in 60 
years that a California senator has won with less than half of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am optimistic that we are going to win this race," Feinstein said at a news 
conference Wednesday morning in San Francisco, where she described a long and 
sleepless election night. "I believe the lead is sufficient enough to win the 
race. . . . Having said that, I recognize there are absentee ballots out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for Feinstein's confidence is that Los Angeles County was 
responsible for a plurality of the outstanding absentee ballots -- at least 
170,000. Feinstein carried Los Angeles County by more than 11% on Election Day 
and by about 1% among the absentee ballots already counted in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Huffington won the absentee ballots already counted statewide by 
about 6%, according to an exit poll conducted in California's largest 15 
counties by The Times. But to win, Huffington officials figured that they must 
carry the outstanding ballots by a margin of about 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's lead is "a big difference to overcome, . . . there is no question 
about it," said Ken Khachigian, a Huffington adviser. Khachigian said officials 
were studying the last overtime election when Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren's 1990 
victory was not declared until absentee ballot counts were released more than 
two weeks after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the long odds, Huffington would not admit defeat Wednesday, saying in 
a written statement that "it is impossible -- and completely irresponsible -- 
to declare a winner at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving his Orange County hotel where supporters had gathered the previous 
night for an election party, Huffington said he still expected to win the race. 
"I think we will be standing here together again and I'll be claiming victory," 
said the candidate, who added that he planned to spend time at Disneyland with 
his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a freshman congressman from Santa Barbara, said he did not expect 
a recount. Officials from the Republican campaign said they were not aware of 
any irregularities in the voting that would make them suspect the Election Day 
total. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to need a recount," Huffington said. "I think it 
will be clear when it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the campaign went into extra innings, strategists were giving their 
political prognosis of California's electorate. Without a doubt, experts said, 
it was a race that will become part of the state's political lore. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Senate candidates combined to spend more than $41 million on the race, 
shattering a 10-year record of $26 million set by North Carolina Sen. Jesse A. 
Helms and his opponent. Huffington, whose fortune comes from the 1990 sale of 
his family's Texas oil and gas company, spent almost $30 million from his own 
pocket, nearly double the most ever spent by a non-presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was outspent more than 2 to 1 overall and as much as 3 to 1 on 
television. In addition, her campaign faced a number of powerful obstacles. The 
senator bucked the anti-government, anti-Clinton hostility that swept 
Republicans into power in Congress; she was on the unpopular side of 
Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative, and fellow Democrat 
Kathleen Brown was losing the race for governor so badly that she was damaging 
the party's other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 At her news conference Wednesday, Feinstein said she also believed that her 
reelection was complicated by the national Republican tide, which she 
attributed at least partly to President Clinton's health care plan that she had 
co-sponsored until May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the issues out there that led to this (GOP victory) was an 
overreach on health care reform, where people saw the proposals that were made 
as just so sweeping, so broad, just too much government," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, on the other hand, spent so much of the campaign attacking 
Feinstein that polls indicated that he never made a strong connection with 
voters. In addition, his campaign was rocked by news stories critical of his 
business background, his wife's unconventional religious history and, most 
recently, his admission that he employed an illegal immigrant nanny in 
violation of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly think it would not have been so close but for Proposition 187," 
said a White House official. "Feinstein was hurt by that. . . . I also think 
that, had Huffington not had the nanny problem, he probably would have won." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times exit survey of voters on Election Day indicated that Huffington was 
helped by his support for Proposition 187, but it was not a major factor. But 
political observers said that, like Gov. Pete Wilson, Huffington's campaign 
probably would have tried to capitalize on the initiative's popularity in the 
final weeks of the race had the candidate not been caught in the controversy 
about the illegal immigrant nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, supervised by Times Poll Director John Brennan, indicated several 
demographic factors that kept the race close. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein lost the race -- by 6% -- among white voters, who accounted for 81% 
of the electorate. She carried all of the state's major ethnic groups, 
including 80% of blacks and 67% of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Women failed to turn out in greater numbers than men -- as they do 
traditionally -- despite the presence of two women candidates at the top of the 
ballot. The survey also found that self-described conservative voters turned 
out much more than self-described liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the voter opinions about the Senate candidates, however, were shaped 
by the heaviest barrage of TV commercials ever broadcast in a California 
political race. With few exceptions, both candidates used their television 
commercials to tell voters why they should not support their opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, The Times exit survey found 57% of Huffington's supporters saying 
they were voting for the "lesser of two evils." On the other hand, perhaps 
because she was better known before the race began, 61% of Feinstein's voters 
said they cast their ballot because they liked the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, Feinstein had a powerful showing in the north -- particularly in 
the Bay Area, where she served for nine years as a mayor and county supervisor 
in San Francisco. Her score in San Francisco -- 64% -- was almost the same as 
in her 1992 race. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, she outpolled Huffington by about 11%, considered by some 
experts to be the minimum necessary for a Democrat to win statewide. Feinstein 
lost almost every other county in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also failed to generate the margins he needed from major 
Republicans areas, although he was close. For example, only one Republican in 
the last 12 years has won a statewide race in California with less than 60% of 
the vote in GOP-rich Orange County. Huffington got 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also failed to carry his home county of Santa Barbara, the only 
Southern California county besides Los Angeles to side with Feinstein. 
Huffington has been a controversial figure in his hometown since he upset a 
veteran congressman in 1992 and announced his bid for the Senate just a few 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican pollster Arnold Steinberg said Huffington "came to the table with a 
lot of baggage. I think he had the right message for this year but . . . was 
the wrong messenger."

NEWS ANALYSIS; TWO PARTIES HEAR DIFFERENT VOICES IN ELECTION WIND; VOTE: 
REPUBLICANS SEE GOP TIDE AS A SLAM AGAINST CLINTON. BUT CLINTON SAYS IT WAS A 
FURTHER CRY FOR CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The voters have spoken, and what a roar it was. But what, exactly, did it 
mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Two conflicting theories already have emerged in the wake of the most sweeping 
midterm shake-up since the end of World War II. The first is the most 
straightforward: Bill Clinton was a fluke, this theory holds, an accidental 
Democratic President whose election in 1992 temporarily interrupted the 
maturing of the Republican majority that was born under Richard Nixon, reared 
under Ronald Reagan and only faltered under George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The second theory, clung to by White House aides and many other Democrats -- 
but nonetheless more than just a drowning man's imaginary lifeboat -- takes a 
more complex view of the country. It argues that the 1994 election, like that 
of 1992, was a reaction of voters against a status quo that has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, proponents of this view argued, Bush became the symbol of that status 
quo and voters rejected him, turning to Clinton. When Clinton failed to 
deliver, they argued, the Democratic Congress became the symbol of the gridlock 
that voters despise, and the electorate vented its fury once more. 
</P>
<P>
 If the first theory holds, then nothing Clinton can do over the next two years 
will avail him much. The Republican tide will not stop at his command. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the second theory holds, what then? Can either party make significant 
progress in just two years against the daunting problems at the root of the 
nation's discontent -- declining incomes for those who lack a college degree, 
economic uneasiness in the middle class, out-of-control crime rates in many 
cities and a social fabric pulled to the breaking point? And if neither party 
can meet those concerns, who will become the target of the voters' wrath next? 
</P>
<P>
 The "Clinton was a fluke" theory has the virtue of simplicity. And in the glow 
of victory, many Republican leaders rushed to embrace it. "Last night the 
American people endorsed what I believe in," said Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, a 
likely GOP presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton espoused the second view. Voters "were saying, 'Look, we just don't 
like what we see when we watch Washington, and you haven't done much about 
that,' " Clinton said at a press conference. "Democrats are in charge; we're 
holding you accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting that idea, the President's pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, noted 
that in polls done immediately before the election, including The Times Poll, 
voters consistently said that they did not favor many parts of the GOP program. 
In addition, he noted, studies by the University of Michigan on the popularity 
of the two parties showed that during the last two years "the Democrats have 
plummeted, but the Republicans have also dropped. There was no movement toward 
the Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Some evidence that voters have not turned to the GOP out of ideology also 
comes from state-by-state votes on initiatives. Although Republican activists 
have campaigned heavily against gay rights, for example, the two states with 
anti-gay-rights initiatives on the ballot, Oregon and Nevada, defeated them. 
Voters in Wyoming defeated an anti-abortion referendum while electing 
Republicans to both the governorship and a Senate seat. Voters in several 
states defeated measures that would have limited future tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, voters rejected an initiative that would have required the state 
to pay property owners if environmental regulations limited what they could do 
with their land -- another issue heavily promoted by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some Republican analysts agreed with parts of the Democratic 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election was the public finally saying to the Democratic Party: 'You 
don't get it. We're rejecting you. We're giving the other party a chance,' " 
said conservative Republican strategist David Keene. "But all they're giving us 
is a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on which part of the country one examines, election returns and exit 
polls can support both theories. In the South -- the 13 states running from 
Virginia to Texas -- Republicans won the congressional vote by a 3-2 margin, 
compared with a 54-44 Democratic edge in the region two years ago. The South 
now is the largest Republican region, providing 28% of the 33 million votes 
cast for GOP congressional candidates nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 What put the GOP over the top in the South was primarily a set of ideological 
concerns driving voters oriented toward social issues, according to exit polls 
analyzed by pollster Andrew Kohut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern electorate was heavily made up of conservatives, including large 
numbers of evangelical Christians and supporters of the National Rifle Assn. -- 
both groups that comprised large chunks of Tuesday's electorate. Those 
conservative, white voters have abandoned longstanding ties to the Democratic 
Party on the congressional level and, increasingly, in state legislatures as 
well. And they were clearly motivated by issues such as gun control, abortion, 
school prayer, gay rights and the whole complex of concerns known to 
politicians as "family values," the exit polls indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Southern shift is one that has been building for many 
years. Lyndon B. Johnson, after signing the 1965 Civil Rights Act into law, 
told aides he feared that he had turned the South over to the Republicans for a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the presidential level, he was correct. The once solidly Democratic 
South has sided with the GOP on presidential voting in nearly all elections 
since. But loyalties to long-serving congressional Democrats had delayed a 
similar switch on the congressional level until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this election, out of 137 House seats in the Southern states, the GOP 
held 52. Now they will hold either 73 or 74, depending on the outcome of a 
still-contested election in Kentucky. White Democrats, by contrast, will hold 
only 40 or 41 seats, while Democrats representing majority black (or in Texas, 
Latino) districts will hold 23. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the GOP held 12 Southern seats out of 26 before Tuesday's 
voting; now they will hold 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few elections, the number of Southern white Democrats can be 
expected to decline even more as old-time representatives such as G.V. (Sonny) 
Montgomery in Mississippi, Tom Bevill in Alabama and Sam Gibbons in Florida 
retire and, almost certainly, turn their seats over to Republicans. The region 
increasingly will be represented by Republicans from majority-white districts 
and Democrats from majority-minority districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a declining market for conservative Democrats," said Merle Black, an 
expert on Southern politics at Emory University in Atlanta. Given the choice 
between a Republican and a conservative Democrat, white Southerners now 
consistently chose Republicans, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP edge in the South has changed the complexion of the party. Southern 
members now will make up about a third of the Republican caucus in both the 
House and Senate. Those Southern Republicans have a deeply conservative, 
anti-government voice and they have given the party many of its newer leaders 
-- from Speaker-presumptive Newt Gingrich of Georgia to Gramm in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the center of gravity of the GOP, which was located in the Northeast 
and Midwest during Dwight D. Eisenhower's day and moved to the Southwest and 
Southern California under Nixon and Reagan, has now shifted southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan-era shift toward the Sun Belt, with its large and powerful defense 
and aerospace industries, presaged a change in the GOP's emphasis -- putting 
increased defense spending at the top of the party's agenda. Just so, the shift 
toward the Old South, with its large number of voters motivated by social 
issues, likely will push those topics forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing those issues, however, could cause the GOP problems with the other 
major source of its upsurge this year: economically discontented voters, who 
were particularly important to Republican gains in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting in the Midwest would support Clinton's view of the election 
results. Republicans there gained heavily among lower-income, 
non-college-educated white working men under the age of 50 -- precisely the 
people who have seen their incomes decline in the last two decades and who, as 
a result, have grown cynical about government and impatient with politicians. 
But polls have shown that they also have little patience with social 
conservatives and issues such as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of the potential for a sharp split between Southern and 
Midwestern supporters, GOP officials Wednesday took pains to limit their agenda 
-- saying virtually nothing about social issues, for example, as they described 
what they hope to do now. Instead, they emphasized items with little 
opposition, such as term limits or requiring Congress to live under the laws it 
imposes on others. 
</P>
<P>
 Those issues are at the top of very few voters' lists of priorities. But they 
have the virtue of drawing broad -- if not passionate -- support across the 
national spectrum. And for many Republicans, that is reason enough to push 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (election) is not a mandate for everything we're doing," said Republican 
pollster William McInturff. "This is a mandate saying 'We don't like the other 
guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "All parties over-interpret their mandates," he warned. "Parties tend to go to 
extremes."

NEWS ANALYSIS; STATE'S DIVERSITY DOESN'T REACH VOTING BOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For weeks, Latinos dominated the political landscape as they marched en masse 
through the streets in vehement opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Election Day came, it was white California that spoke, putting the 
racially charged measure over the top by an almost 20-point margin -- a 
landslide in a race that many believed was narrowing in recent weeks. Final 
results showed the proposal -- which cuts off government services to illegal 
immigrants -- winning comfortably throughout the state, except for the San 
Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent high-profile student demonstrations -- lauded by some Latino leaders as 
the vanguard of a new activism -- contributed to the margin of victory by 
further alienating a white voting majority, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (marchers) polarized the issue," said Dick Woodward, whose Bay Area 
consulting firm, Woodward & McDowell, handled the mainstream anti-Proposition 
187 campaign and vainly advised against the demonstrations. "Not only did 
students walk out, but there were Mexican flags, and I think that made the 
undecided voter angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably more than in any recent election, the divisive contest surrounding 
Proposition 187 has turned a spotlight on the glaring disparity between the 
California voting rolls -- dominated by whites, who accounted for 80% of the 
voters Tuesday -- and the diverse state population: 57% white, 25% Latino, 9% 
Asian Americans and 7% blacks at the time of the last census. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, as whites go, goes any election in California," said Arnold 
Steinberg, a political strategist who usually works with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote on Proposition 187 also tapped a deep populist vein, generating 
strong support among the less well-educated and the elderly -- as well as with 
conservatives and Republicans. (Almost 8 in 10 of those who described 
themselves as either Republicans or conservatives supported the measure, exit 
polls show.) Denunciations of Proposition 187 from unions, religious leaders, 
law enforcement officials, educators, health professionals and others evidently 
were not enough to change voters' minds -- nor to spur greater voter turnout by 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Although successfully capturing voter discontent, some are concerned about the 
long-term impact of the divisive debate on a region already polarized across 
racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legacy of this is going to be harmed human relations in this state for 
some time," said Joe Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference of Southern California, the civil rights group founded by 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Multicultural Los Angeles County, with its huge numbers of immigrants, voted 
in favor of Proposition 187 by a 12-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Latinos represent more than one-quarter of the state population, they 
accounted for only 8% of those voting across the state Tuesday -- despite 
much-heralded efforts to get out the vote and register voters in the weeks 
before the election. That underlines a reality of non-participation: 
Immigrants, particularly Latino immigrants, tend to be non-citizens ineligible 
to vote or too young to register. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the need to bolster voting rolls, Latino activists statewide have 
mounted a major effort promoting the values of U.S. citizenship. It is the 
vote, many recognize, that will ultimately turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost the battle, but we need to win the war," said Father Pedro 
Villarroya, who heads Hispanic ministry for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese. "We 
need to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 But the trend is not likely to change quickly. Mexican nationals, the largest 
single group of Latino immigrants, are traditionally among the least likely 
newcomers to renounce allegiance to their homeland and become U.S. citizens. An 
electorate dominated by aging white baby boomers is expected to drive 
California electoral politics at least until at least 2010, researchers 
conclude. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened yesterday is not very heartening example of what will happen in 
the future," said David Hayes-Bautista, a UCLA sociologist who has studied 
demographic trends and is opposed to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hayes-Bautista, Tuesday's vote represented white voters' decision 
to, in essence, "secede" from California -- a suggestion dismissed by 
Proposition 187 advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although exit polls showed a considerable support for the proposition among 
most voting groups -- with Latinos being the major exception, opposing it 77% 
to 23% -- it is also clear that its strongest backers are whites, almost 
two-thirds of whom said they voted for the measure. Roughly half of black and 
Asian American voters also cast ballots in favor of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold W. Ezell, a former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service official 
who was a Proposition 187 co-sponsor, scoffed at the secession argument. "What 
about all the Asians and blacks who voted with us, and even the Latinos?" he 
asked. "This is a mandate across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 While scholars and activists debated what the vote said about ethnic and 
racial attitudes, there were deep divisions apparent within the opposition 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the split more evident than at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, 
where the anti-Proposition 187 forces congregated late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the proposition's victory became likely, then certain, a mostly Latino 
audience gathered in an ornate ballroom and seemed intent on denying the 
imminent defeat that was being broadcast on the television screens. Several 
speakers even boasted of "victory" to a vociferous crowd, including many of the 
student protesters who had hit the streets the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am here today to tell you that we have defeated Proposition 187!" Gilbert 
Cedillo, general manger of Local 660 of the Service Employees International 
Union, told the roaring crowd. "We have defeated Proposition 187 because we 
have taken the spirit and heart out of that racist attack!" 
</P>
<P>
 Many expressed the viewpoint that the recent mass mobilizations of students 
and others would translate into a broad-based movement that would defeat future 
Proposition 187-type proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, however, Woodward, the veteran consultant who ran campaign by 
Taxpayers Against 187 -- the principal opposition group -- was addressing a 
central campaign image: the Mexican flag, hoisted by students and other 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cringed every time we saw it," said Woodward, who absorbed his first 
defeat in an opposition campaign in nearly three decades of consultant work. 
"We didn't want them to march, because we knew exactly what would happen, and 
we have the polling data to show that's exactly what did happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, the consultants emphasized a pragmatic approach: 
Illegal immigration was a serious problem, but Proposition 187 did nothing to 
stop it, while possibly increasing crime and spreading disease. 
</P>
<P>
 That message ended up getting less exposure than the widely televised images 
of Mexican flags and marching students. The formal campaign against the 
proposition began late and lacked funds for television advertising. In 
particular, opponents lamented that more money had not come from organized 
labor, the entertainment industry and the Roman Catholic Church, which 
denounced the proposal strongly from the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gov. Pete Wilson's support for the proposition and his highlighting of 
immigration in his victorious campaign, the anti-Proposition 187 camp was 
unable to sway enough white voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, we knew there was a huge anger out there," Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Proposition 187 is on the books, although subject to numerous court 
challenges, many say it could be an omen of other proposals to come. Over and 
over, supporters distressed by the state's changing demographics spoke of a 
range of concerns -- "multiculturalism," bilingual education, a loss of jobs -- 
that they associated with illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of latent anger out there," said former Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, the author of a Proposition 187-like ballot 
initiative that was withdrawn earlier this year. (Unlike Proposition 187, the 
former supervisor's plan did not apply to public education, a provision 
Schabarum decided would be too controversial.) 
</P>
<P>
 In casual conversations with Proposition 187 supporters, it is clear that 
their complaints go beyond illegal immigrants. Often, their comments apply 
broadly to all immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of hearing and seeing their language," said a man who gave his name 
only as Wayne, one of three plumbers on a coffee break Wednesday at the 
Downtown Civic Center mall. "Between food stamps, welfare and everything else, 
they are probably living better than me, working 40 hours a week." (In fact, 
federal law already makes illegal immigrants ineligible for welfare and food 
stamp benefits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Emigh, another Proposition 187 supporter Downtown said Wednesday that he 
voted for the measure in part because of a larger concern about the state's 
economic decline. Many of the middle-class jobs that once formed the region's 
economic backbone are gone, Emigh said, replaced by more menial slots. He 
blamed illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see a street vendor out there on the street ringing a bell to sell 
some food, I have a sad feeling and maybe a little angry feeling too," said 
Emigh, chief of computer programming unit for local office of the Army Corps of 
Engineers. "Not at the person, but just about the change and the change in the 
economy and the fact that these are the jobs that are left now." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to widespread perceptions that illegal immigration is worse than 
ever, U.S. officials say that the undocumented population actually peaked in 
1987, before implementation of a federal amnesty program that resulted in legal 
status for more than 3 million formerly undocumented residents, more than half 
of them California residents.

BROWN REIGN AS SPEAKER IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE and CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheered by erasing the Democratic majority in the Assembly, Republicans said 
Wednesday that they are poised to oust their longtime nemesis, Speaker Willie 
Brown, and take control of the lower house for the first time in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of more than $800,000 pumped into key races in the closing days 
before Tuesday's election, Republicans knocked off four incumbent Democrats, 
picked up at least four open seats previously held by Democrats, and were 
losing only one from GOP ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the party lineup in the Assembly appears temporarily deadlocked 
at 40 to 40, jeopardizing but not necessarily scuttling Brown's speakership, 
according to Democrats who in the last legislative session outnumbered 
Republicans 47 to 33. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisive factor for Brown could be the outcome of a race in the Long Beach 
and Palos Verdes Peninsula area that remains unsettled. Democratic 
Assemblywoman Betty Karnette, who won a surprise victory two years ago, led by 
64 votes, but GOP leaders predicted that a count of several thousand absentee 
ballots would make Republican Steve Kuykendall, a Rancho Palos Verdes 
councilman, the victor and give them a majority in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fully expect that Republicans will take control" when all the votes are 
counted, said Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, a 
onetime advance man for George Bush who became GOP leader two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Ventura, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County registrar and 
recorder's office, said the official vote canvass will begin today and must be 
completed by Nov. 29. She said the next update may not come until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As grim-faced Assembly Democrats gathered for lunch at a Sacramento 
steakhouse, Brown, one of California's most powerful politicians and a symbol 
of everything Republicans loathe, conceded that his record 14-year speakership 
is in danger. But, he said, "I'm going to try to get it out of jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate, unless there are 41 persons gone some other place -- I will be 
Speaker," a subdued Brown later told a crowded Capitol news conference. "My job 
was not dependent on my success in seats as long as I have (the votes)," said 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he can deliver the votes to keep his post, however, Brown would 
say only that "I don't think anyone else has 41." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also lost ground in the state Senate but held on to their majority, 
ensuring that President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer of Hayward will remain at the helm 
of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lineup will apparently be 21 Democrats, 17 Republicans and two 
independents. That would be the fewest Democrats since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Democratic defeat was dealt to Sen. Dan McCorquodale of Modesto, 
who represented suburban Silicon Valley for much of his 12 years in the Senate 
and was running in a newly reapportioned San Joaquin Valley farm district. In 
an expensive race, McCorquodale was defeated by Republican Richard Monteith. 
</P>
<P>
 In another San Joaquin Valley district, freshman Sen. Phil Wyman (R-Hanford), 
a bedrock conservative, was narrowly ousted by Assemblyman Jim Costa 
(D-Fresno). Costa had lost to Wyman in a special election last year. And in the 
Los Angeles area, Sen. Ralph Dills (D-El Segundo), first elected to the 
Assembly in 1938, survived the stiffest challenge of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 But attention in the Capitol on Wednesday was focused on the fate of Brown, 
one of the nation's most powerful African American public officials. For years, 
the liberal Brown has been a favorite election target of GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans take the Karnette seat, they will have a majority of 41 
votes in the Assembly, at least until Assemblyman Richard J. Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia) resigns to take a seat in the state Senate that he won Tuesday in a 
special election. He also won reelection to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that any challenger will need to secure 41 votes to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the magic 41 votes, Republicans would need Mountjoy to stay in the 
Assembly long enough to vote for Brulte. Under Senate rules, Mountjoy has a 
"reasonable period of time" to move to the upper house, apparently allowing him 
to back Brulte in a speakership fight in December. Mountjoy said he would favor 
Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Mountjoy moved to the Senate, the lineup would favor the GOP by a 
40-39 margin -- paralleling a situation that Brown faced in 1988 when he was 
challenged by a group of dissidents known as the Gang of Five and the house had 
only 79 members with one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time Brown barely won a fifth term because of a provision in the state 
Constitution that allows election of a Speaker with a majority of those 
actually holding office, meaning that Brown was able to win the Assembly's top 
post with only 40 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's fate is cloudy even if the Democrats hold on to the Karnette seat and 
neither party begins the next legislative session with a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claimed Wednesday that, in a deadlock, Assembly rules provide that the 
most senior member serves as the Assembly's temporary Speaker until the impasse 
is broken. The member with the longest service in the Assembly happens to be 
Brown himself. But Brown said that, under that scenario, his duties would be 
limited to presiding over the election of a Speaker, without any other 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation in the Assembly was rampant about potential defectors among the 
Republicans who might side with Brown in a nasty fight over the speakership. 
Among those whose names were being mentioned was Assemblyman Paul Horcher, a 
maverick Republican from Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher would say only that he intends to vote in the best interest of his 
district. Brown said he had not talked to any Republicans about taking any 
actions that would help him remain in the post he has occupied since 1980. 
Brulte refused to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scenario had Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), a longtime 
Brown ally, being drafted by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans to become 
Speaker in a compromise. Isenberg said Wednesday that he would reject such a 
maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years Brown has forged an alliance of convenience with Gov. Pete 
Wilson, helping him to enact highly unpopular state budgets, reform workers' 
compensation laws and pass tax credits sought by California manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte credited the success of Republicans in Tuesday's voting to strong and 
well-focused candidates, the ability of the GOP to nearly match Brown's fund 
raising from special interests and the national trend against Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any of those factors missing and we wouldn't be where we are today," said 
Brulte, whose party members are scheduled to meet in Sacramento today. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte refused to attack Brown. "I'm not aware of any Democrat who could have 
done better than the Speaker," Brulte said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, meanwhile, said he was mystified by the trouncing suffered by 
Democrats, nationally and in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker said "it doesn't make a whole lot of sense" that Democrats were 
punished for doing what they thought the voters wanted. He cited the 
improvement of the national economy, more police on the streets, enactment in 
California of the "three-strikes" law and other tough anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, he mentioned the defeat of first-term Assemblywoman Julie 
Bornstein (D-Palm Desert), who some in the Capitol thought was being groomed by 
Brown to succeed him as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democratic losers included veteran Assemblyman Bob Epple of Cerritos and 
first-termers Margaret Snyder of Modesto and Tom Connolly of Lemon Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also picked up seats that had been vacated by Democrats in Fresno, 
Santa Ana, Ventura County and the Salinas area. Democrats appeared to be 
comfortably ahead in a Stockton area seat that was vacated by a Republican.

STATE WAITS TO SEE WHAT PROP. 187 WILL REALLY MEAN; REACTION: AS MEASURE 
BECOMES LAW, EMOTIONS RANGE FROM FEAR TO ELATION. BUT THERE IS ALSO GREAT 
UNCERTAINTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 And so again, Californians awoke to the strains of upheaval -- not, this time, 
from rioting or earthquakes, but from a ballot measure, a directive of the 
people that brought a jarring shift to the political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, California tilted on its edge. It was no longer the land of 
opportunity, at least to many. It had taken on a harder edge, become more 
divided, less a melting pot, us and them . 
</P>
<P>
 By viewpoints bitterly divided, here was the bold, trend-setting state or the 
ice-hearted domain where the people had put dollar concerns ahead of 
humanitarian will, where they had finally risen up to shout, Stop! Send us no 
more of your poor -- no more of those undocumented huddled masses, streaming in 
by the thousands.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the aftermath of Proposition 187's emphatic victory, there was more 
than just pain and elation. There also was confusion and hand-wringing, a swell 
of concern about what it all might mean -- whether the initiative can be 
enforced, whether the courts will call it legal, whether anything will, or 
should, change at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the proposition stood as the focal point of one of the most 
rancorous campaigns in state history. Now, there comes a sense of disquiet -- 
everyone waiting for the fallout to settle, for the new order to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday was a time to reflect and to look ahead. From the timber forests of 
far Northern California to Smuggler's Canyon, where immigrants gather to cross 
the Mexican border, the next stage of the great debate had begun. CENTRAL 
VALLEY / Struggling to Survive 
</P>
<P>
 At the Paradise Bar on Atlantic Boulevard, pallet manufacturer Alex Gonzales 
said the measure probably would change nothing for the three undocumented 
workers he employs because few Americans are willing to do the same work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'Don't worry about it,' " Gonzales said. " 'You still have have 
a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Ladera Heights, where day laborers gather each morning, there was no change 
in their simple routine. The regular crowd of about 50 convened outside a Home 
Base store, some expressing doubt that Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
would enforce the provisions of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if they do, workers vowed to wait for jobs. After all, they said, 
they have to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be afraid. We have to confront this issue," said Juan Carlos, 30, 
the father of three children. "It is either this or starve." 
</P>
<P>
 A man who arrived looking for temporary employees said he did not believe that 
the ballot measure will make much difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about supply and demand," said the man, who was offering $7 an hour 
to help prune trees. He hired two helpers and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
 In other places, the potential impact on the pool of low-cost labor also 
loomed large. In the farm-rich San Joaquin Valley, November is dead time: 
Vineyards and fruit orchards have been picked clean and the workers, both legal 
and illegal, who did the hard toil of the harvest have returned to Mexico or 
moved on to apple orchards in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the debate over Proposition 187 moved indoors -- to places such as 
Austin's coffee shop in Sanger, where farmers took differing views on how it 
will affect a region where as much as 50% of the peak-season work force crosses 
the border illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope 187 is tied up in the courts for a long time," one raisin farmer 
said, " 'cause if they stop them from coming over, you can kiss this valley 
goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 But raisin packer Gerald Chooljian took a different view, saying he voted for 
the measure even though he considers it unconstitutional. Some undocumented 
Mexican workers, he said, fraudulently collect unemployment benefits using 
phony documents. He wanted to send a message. 
</P>
<P>
 "The politicians need to know that we're sick and tired of welfare programs," 
Chooljian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not the illegals who are abusing the welfare system," said Jim 
Jerkovich, who argued that the percentage of unemployment abusers is small. 
"They're too afraid they'll be caught and sent back." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor contractor Larry Peters, who voted against Proposition 187, was 
ebullient nevertheless. "How sweet it is," he said. "I voted straight 
Republican up and down. I didn't give a damn who they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he could reconcile a vote for Gov. Pete Wilson and a vote against 
the proposition, he smiled and said, "It doesn't make any sense at all." 
NEWPORT BEACH / A 'Great Day' 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition found much of its staunchest support among the well-heeled, 
including those at Fashion Island, the upscale mall overlooking the sea in 
Newport Beach. Voters there said they were tired of carrying the financial 
burden of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is my great day," said Mike Sawdie, a silver-haired, 48-year-old lawyer 
who had stopped at Brooks Brothers, his favorite clothing store. He was picking 
out a tie to go with a new jacket and flashy suspenders. "We have so limited 
resources today that we need to use them to take care of our own. . . . Ask the 
homeless people or elderly if we have enough resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why are we taking care of people who are here illegally? It is absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Critical-care nurse Judy Peterson, 34, was getting in some early holiday 
shopping while workers put the finishing touches on the mall's giant Christmas 
tree. "I work full time for benefits for my family, and I don't feel it is fair 
for illegals to be coming in and getting health care free," she said.

<P>
 Peterson's husband had joined her on the shopping trip to avoid driving to 
work through Los Angeles, fearing the possibility of violent demonstrations by 
Proposition 187 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him stuck in Los Angeles because of a riot," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, at a gourmet shop, Maureen Reed, 39, of Mission Viejo, said she 
is willing to accept the consequences of her vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a Mexican person who does our lawn," she observed. "I don't know if 
he is illegal or not. If it means we have to pay more for getting our lawn 
done, we will." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar strong support for the measure was felt in quiet, predominantly white 
strongholds of conservatism, where it was seen as a means of protecting the 
existing lifestyle. In the two coffee shops on California 395 that serve as the 
unofficial forums of political debate in Bishop -- a mountain town between the 
Sierra Nevada and Inyo ranges -- there was nearly unanimous support for the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop residents live on quiet streets in neatly painted homes. By 9 every 
night, almost everyone is indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we live here," said insurance agent Chuck Kilpatrick. "We don't 
want gangs and graffiti. We're proud of our town." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Fred Coburn said: "There was no doubt that 187 would pass here. 
The issue of illegal aliens comes up at every public meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 But in other cities -- especially where demographics were more varied -- 
residents tended to fear unintended effects of the proposition. Illegal 
immigrants might place a demand on government services -- but they also spend 
money; they help fill cash registers, said Rephina Louie, owner of an herbal 
medicine store in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California economy is already pathetic," Louie said. "A lot of illegal 
people who can't afford health insurance, they come to our place. Now we're 
going to lose their business. If they can't live here and get an education, 
they're not going to buy our herbal medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Louie discussed the problem while dining with friends in Monterey Park. They 
shared dim sum, tea, cigarettes and a Chinese newspaper. Alex Tsai put down his 
chopsticks, grabbed another cigarette and labeled the proposition hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passing 187 is like robbing a house and then crying robbery," he said. "The 
U.S. stole (Mexican) land now they want to kick them out. This is a big country 
with a very small heart." SAN YSIDRO / Along the Border 
</P>
<P>
 Racial tensions fostered by the initiative were apparent in towns large and 
small across the state. That was especially true in communities along the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Ysidro, on the American side, Jack Yufe was forced to close his apparel 
shop to prevent vandalism during one rowdy pre-election protest of the measure. 
Now that the initiative has passed, he is worried about more protests or 
possibly a boycott by shoppers from Tijuana, who make up 80% of his customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yufe, a Trinidadian immigrant in his 60s, thought about supporting the 
proposition when he saw protesters waving Mexican flags and threatening to burn 
American flags. He would not say how he finally voted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing worse than a bad illness is bad medicine," he said. "Yes, 
illegal immigration causes problems, but this 187 is bad medicine which will 
make it worse. The Mexicans don't understand the Americans, and the Americans 
don't understand the Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, nudged by his wife, Ruth, an immigrant from Mexico, Yufe found a 
Mexican folk phrase to describe people trying to change a big problem with a 
little solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexicans say: 'Don't try to blot out the sun with your thumb,' " he said. 
"That's what this is." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the border in Tijuana, Jose Gomez stood ready to challenge Wilson and 
California's shiny new law with the only political tools he possessed: a 
scuffed and sturdy pair of running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoes and a religious medal of the Virgin Mary were his only resources; 
every day, Gomez makes his way on foot across the barren concrete divide 
separating Mexico from the oatmeal-colored hills of California. INS officials 
ousted him from California on drunk driving charges 18 days ago, but neither 
that, nor Proposition 187, figured to slow him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure this new law will affect us, and I know it will be very serious for 
our lives," Gomez said, just a stone's throw away from the invisible border 
marking California. "But I will try to go back. I will try in the night when 
it's better to run. At this moment, I'm broke. Everything I have is over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 January is the beginning of the busy season for illegal immigrants traveling 
to the United States after Christmas, one Tijuana police officer said. By then, 
tensions may escalate, but in the meantime there is a steady trickle -- with or 
without 187. One man, waiting on the street outside the Tijuana bus station, 
conceded that the measure has created fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll go to Ensenada to look for work there instead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he and two other men, toting small bags, disappeared into a 
van. Gonzalo Perez Munoz, the depot's assistant manager, watched them depart 
with amusement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to California," he said. "Where else do you think they're 
going?" 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing arrival of immigrants added to passion for and against the 
proposition even in communities far from the border. EUREKA / Small-Town 
Tensions 
</P>
<P>
 In Eureka, a bay-front town of Victorian homes, sidewalk cafes and fishing 
boats about 250 miles north of San Francisco, the measure's passage seemed to 
widen the rift between the predominantly white population and the Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a lot of distrust," said Fernando Aguirre, chairman of 
the Eureka-based Centro de Informacion Bilingue Y Cultural, a group formed to 
promote Latino culture. He feared that all Latinos would be viewed with 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you one thing," said one non-Latino laborer at a Eureka-area flower 
farm. "The people we have working here who are questionable immigrants, they're 
the hardest workers. They bust their asses in the rain all day." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, a quaint Ventura County town lying among the rolling coastal 
hills north of Los Angeles, a solid community of Latinos outnumbers white 
residents 3 to 2. Lined up for pastries and Spanish-language newspapers at La 
Unica bakery, some called the new law misguided and discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gov. Wilson came up with a reason to get himself elected. He's a hypocrite," 
said clerk Aureo Melgoza, 49, ringing up an order. "It's unfair, too. The state 
needs (immigrant workers). The misconception that these people are milking the 
system is not really true." 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Montelongo, 35, a fruit packer from Mexico, deplored how the measure 
might affect schoolchildren. Evaristo Barajas complained that parts of the 
proposition are written so that services can be denied even if there is a 
suspicion that someone is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they going to base suspicion on?" he asked. "Our language? Our 
color? They're going to be able to lock children out of school even if they're 
citizens of the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 But the town seemed divided along ethnic lines. Cattle rancher Bill King, 74, 
was one of many who supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a contest in the courts, and I think it's going to 
lose," he said. "But I think it's going to send a message to Washington that 
(the federal government) didn't get before." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration is chaos, he said. "When they come here illegally, they 
violate our law," King added. "You try going to Mexico and getting away with 
this ----. You'll wind up in a Mexican jail." BAY AREA / The Fires of 
Resentment 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions were relatively subdued at UC Berkeley, the hub of free speech and 
radical student politics in the 1960s. No one carried pickets, but some 
students said they were "appalled" and "embarrassed" by the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks," said Eric Lopez, 24. "It's so racist. I'm a Native American. We 
didn't say anything about the whites coming." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away at a job-referral center in East Oakland, a Nicaraguan 
immigrant named Antonio, 27, sat waiting out a storm. He had been digging 
ditches for $10 an hour before rains had forced his employer to stop work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have your documents, you are always afraid," he said. 
Acknowledging that he is not a legal resident, Antonio said he believes 
Proposition 187 has fanned a fire of resentment toward illegal immigrants that 
is affecting the willingness of Americans to hire him and others like him. 
</P>
<P>
 He blames the measure for prompting a contractor to ask him two weeks ago to 
show his documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to avoid the problem," he said in Spanish. "I told him I would rather 
not stay on the job, that I don't like the job." 
</P>
<P>
 He goes to school at night to learn English, and he said the community college 
he attends informed him recently that he might have to pay for the class if 
Proposition 187 passed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is more worried about getting sick and being unable to get medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 "In two years living in the U.S., I have never been to a doctor," he said. "I 
really hope I will not have to go to the hospital now." 
</P>
<P>
 At a taco stand in South-Central Los Angeles, five Mexican immigrants said 
they expected to pull their children out of school because of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are no better than criminals," said Jose Zaragosa, a day laborer. "They 
treat us like animals." 
</P>
<P>
 But questions remained about how strongly the new law will be enforced, even 
if the courts uphold it. In the Los Angeles Police Department's South Bureau, 
where there have been almost as many murders as days this year, overworked 
detectives said Wednesday that they can't even keep up with a growing number of 
of homicides, let alone ask people for green cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have enough detectives to check on my murders. So how am I going to 
keep track of that administrative lunacy?" asked Lt. Sergio Robleto, commander 
of the bureau's homicide detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight lockers filled with notebooks stood as a grim testimony to the area's 
victims. Spanning an area from the Santa Monica Freeway to San Pedro and from 
Watts to Windsor Hills, the South Bureau is one of the bloodiest stretches of 
turf in the nation; if it were a city, the 57-square-mile zone would rank among 
the 10 deadliest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it is also home to one of the nation's fastest-growing 
Latino communities. Because many of those immigrants came from countries where 
law enforcement officials were linked to death squads or drug cartels, fear and 
mistrust of the police runs high. So LAPD officers have gone to great lengths 
to try to earn the trust of Latino residents, even establishing a storefront 
"contact center" at a local Catholic church where residents quietly meet with 
Spanish-speaking officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our job to ask people where they are from," said LAPD Officer Joel 
Morales. "We aren't the INS. We have more important things to do." 
</P>

Reflection 
</P>
<P>
 The shock waves from the passage of Proposition 187 began to rumble across the 
state Wednesday from tiny Eureka in the north all the way to the Mexican 
border. Times reporters talked with working people in eight counties to assess 
the changes the sweeping initiative will bring to their communities.

COLUMN ONE; WITH FOLEY, NOBLE ERA WILL END; AFTER THREE DECADES IN THE HOUSE, 
THE GENTLEMANLY SPEAKER FROM SPOKANE CONCEDES DEFEAT. THE POWER OF HIS POST WAS 
NO MATCH FOR A PUBLIC READY TO HATE THE CONGRESS THAT HE LOVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the ink dries on this page of history, the story winds up with an 
exclamation point. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas S. Foley concedes his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, only two 
heartbeats away from the presidency, came undone by a power greater than his: a 
scattered thousand or so swing voters who gambled their ballots on change. 
</P>
<P>
 When a sitting Speaker was last defeated for reelection, members rode to 
Congress in horse carriages and the shrub lands here were a territory, not even 
a state. To be exact, the year was 1862, and the nation worried for its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, America was split North vs. South. A great debate raged over 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the nation is also divided, us vs. them -- Americans vs. their 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 For this, Foley was the perfect target. He was a creature of the cloakroom. A 
30-year man. He loved, respected and even rejoiced in government and most of 
all the institution of Congress. He refused the popular ploy of the modern 
politician and would not deign to portray himself as some sort of populist who 
was taking sides with "us" and against "them." 
</P>
<P>
 So in this year when Congress itself went on trial, the 65-year-old Foley 
refused to cop a plea. 
</P>
<P>
 He was doing his job, he said, bringing home the bacon. He was proud of it. 
But 50%-plus of the residents here on the eastern border of Washington state 
said the smell was getting rancid. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fitting that his 5th Congressional District contest was one of the last 
to be decided -- an exclamation point to the revolt of 1994. And indeed, the 
race is not officially over. Thousands of absentee ballots remain to be 
counted, and the margin is razor thin. 
</P>
<P>
 But not thin enough to sustain Foley's hopes. At midmorning Wednesday, the 
aristocratic old war horse sat calmly at a table in his district office, joined 
by his wife and somber aides, and conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 What did he say? 
</P>
<P>
 What he always did -- he defended Congress as a noble institution. "Despite 
what some people think, the overwhelming membership of the Congress, Republican 
and Democrat, are wonderful, upstanding, talented people who carry on the 
service of their constituents with honor and effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Foley thanked the Presidents he served with, the late Richard Nixon 
and Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and 
Clinton. All of them, he said, "sought to move our country forward. Men of 
honor and integrity. I have tried to give them my best service and counsel and 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 And with his characteristic precision, Foley also noted that the final vote in 
his own race may not be announced for some days because Washington state 
residents can cast absentee ballots right up through Election Day. About 14,000 
absentee votes remained to be tallied Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me that when all the votes are counted we may fall a few votes 
short," he said. "So, there will be a somewhat prolonged counting of the 
absentee ballots. But if the final result is as it appears to be, the 5th 
Congressional District of Washington will have elected a new representative in 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley earlier telephoned to congratulate his challenger, George Nethercutt, a 
50-year-old lawyer, civic activist, former U.S. Senate aide and onetime local 
GOP leader. For now, Nethercutt prepares to go to Washington as a sobering 
symbol of just how deeply Americans fear that political power has come to work 
against them, not for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a listener, not a speaker," Nethercutt said over and over during the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only imagine how such a slogan confounded Foley, who so painstakingly 
climbed the House's seniority ladder from his first Capitol staff job in 1961 
to his inaugural congressional victory in 1964. Over the years, he has been 
everything from a reformer to the target of reformers. But never an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Foley would protest that any politician could be a listener but only 
one could be Speaker. And he might point to the wall in his Capitol office to 
the portraits of Henry Clay and Theodore Sedwick, both of them Speakers. How 
many men and women, he might ask, have passed through the chambers of the 
Capitol to be remembered as listeners? 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, this logic held sway. But in 1994, a listener in 
the Capitol seemed downright appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be misleading to suggest that somehow voters in Spokane were 
stampeded by a catchy slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 All evidence shows that voters here knew what they were doing, and did it 
thoughtfully, almost reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spokane is genuinely proud of Tom. This is not in any matter a personal vote 
against him. . . . It was a tide that swept the country," said Justin 
Quackenbush, chief U.S. District Court judge for eastern Washington state and 
Foley's friend for a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a state and a region that have benefited enormously from its clout in 
Congress over the years: Military base closures happened elsewhere not here, 
electric rates were subsidized by taxpayers in other regions, the university 
grew fat on federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's district twice in the recent past voted against term limits. The 
Speaker had reasoned with voters that some other state without term limits 
would gain seniority, and thus power, at their expense. Why, Californians might 
use their power in Congress to divert Washington's water during a drought, he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 An exit poll conducted Tuesday by Voters News Service asked whether residents 
in Foley's district believed they would be better off if Congress were composed 
of all new people. By 2 to 1, they said no. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that, however, was good enough for a 16th term for the man first in 
rank and 11th in seniority in the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear there is a sense on the part of Americans across the country that 
they are dissatisfied with the pace of change," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the exit poll, nine of 10 Democrats voted for Foley and nine of 
10 Republicans voted for Nethercutt. On the streets of Spokane, it was apparent 
that the "swing voters" -- the 20% of the electorate who decide elections in 
this district -- found their decision Tuesday uncommonly difficult. Few shared 
the rebellious certainty sounded by GOP partisans across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 By turning out a congressional leader, attorney Dave Gumaer acknowledged, "we 
give up a lot. But the federal government today is in a feeding frenzy. Look at 
Sen. (Robert C.) Byrd (D-W.Va.). He probably brings home more for his state 
than anybody. Foley was the same way. . . . Maybe I'm being idealistic, but we 
shouldn't be focusing on ourselves but the collective good. Isn't that what 
democracy is?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gumaer voted for Nethercutt. Fellow attorney Tim Mangram considered the same 
situation and went for Foley in "one of those last-minute decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Foley has done a lot for the district. . . . I just know now the district is 
going to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Foley-Nethercutt campaign had tinges of the dark streak of 
American campaign politics -- negative advertising and special-interest 
intrusion -- it never became a baited personality contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In that spirit it might be worth recording what the two men had to say about 
each other the day after the election -- sentiments less cynical and more 
decent than usually credited to politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the thrill of election as well as the honor of service," said Foley. 
He added that he and his wife "know the thrill that George Nethercutt and his 
family are experiencing today. . . . This new Congress and this new 
representative to Congress should have our support and our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nethercutt: "I'm deeply grateful to him and Mrs. Foley for being so 
gracious, for being such a good representative of this district for so long. 
He's represented us with dignity, with great respectability. He is a fine 
person and so is his wife. . . . I wish there could be two winners. I feel that 
way sincerely."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WILSON'S KEY TASK: HANDLING PROP. 187 
</P>

<P>
 Because of political skill and blind luck, Gov. Pete Wilson now has been given 
a rare opportunity for a fresh start as California's governor. But to cash in 
on his second chance, he'll need to begin implementing Proposition 187 in a way 
that does not further polarize the people. 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing Wilson or California needs is more strikes by public school 
students, angry marches by protesters carrying Mexican flags -- or worse -- and 
the inevitable backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 New beginnings are unprecedented for second-term chief executives. With or 
without term limits, it always has been assumed that any governor would be too 
beat up politically and burned out personally to run a third time. So a 
governor was an instant lame duck upon reelection and destined to become prey 
for vultures. Even Ronald Reagan limped through his final years in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson is an aberration. He already has been perceived as a lame duck. 
Indeed, he was pronounced a political corpse just 22 months into his 
Administration. Now, with an enormous comeback reelection victory, he is 
healed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his first term, Wilson will be dealing with a Legislature where power 
is shared by Republicans. Lawmakers have tempered their anger at his helping to 
pass term limits. And he won't be facing a fight over legislative 
redistricting, always the bloodiest battle of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 With the California economy on a slow mend and the GOP controlling Congress, 
Wilson actually will have more muscle starting his second term than he did on 
that first, rainy Inauguration Day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it looks in theory. In the real world of governing, however, 
187 poses potential pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, 187 passed by a landslide. And the people who backed it -- even 
if their main motivation was to "send a message" -- will be looking to both 
Washington and Sacramento to control illegal immigration. But Wilson cannot 
seem too heavy-handed or he will rile 187's opponents, including millions of 
non-voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some Wilson advisers privately had speculated before the election 
that the governor would be better off if 187 lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Implementing it will be divisive," one adviser said. "The governor will need 
to cool the atmosphere. But there's been such exaggerated political hype that 
no matter what he does will be misconstrued (in the Legislature). There could 
be enough mistrust to create gridlock. If cool heads don't prevail, 187 will be 
Pete Wilson's lodestone." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's first task of his second term, therefore, will be to try to heal the 
wounds inflicted by the painful battle over 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides accuse the other of tearing those wounds and both are correct. 
Wilson, for the most part, was bashing illegal immigration -- not immigrants . 
But his aggressive seizure of a hot issue and instinct for the jugular 
frightened many Latinos. And their anxieties were heightened by some 
self-serving politicians on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 At a post-election news conference Wednesday, the governor said some of the 
right things. The new law will be implemented "in a way that does not 
discriminate," he vowed. "There is no room in California for bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody enrolling in a public school or seeking government health care, he 
declared, will be asked to prove they're a legal resident -- not just people 
with brown faces. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Election Night, listening to Wilson's widely televised victory speech 
at a Los Angeles airport hotel, I kept waiting for some overture to 
conciliation, a few words of reassurance to the frightened watching at home. 
The governor may have thought he was offering that, but in his Marine cadence, 
the words were spewed as raw meat for the GOP faithful cheering on every 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people need to understand is this issue was never about race," Wilson 
said in part. "It is not fair to shortchange the education of our own children 
or the health care of legal residents." 
</P>
<P>
 He concluded -- in an obvious reference not only to President Clinton but to 
anti-187 Republicans William J. Bennett and Jack F. Kemp -- "We don't need 
lectures from people outside California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson ran a near-perfect campaign, focusing on the winning issues of crime, 
immigration and jobs. He also got lucky: A GOP year, a recovering economy and a 
surprisingly weak opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, ironically, he and Clinton sorely need to cooperate for their own 
self-interests. Wilson needs more federal immigration funding to balance state 
budgets. Clinton needs to carry California to win reelection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wilson -- although he'd never admit it -- needs Clinton to win reelection. 
Then there would be an open race for the presidency in the year 2000 -- when 
the then-former governor will be age 67 and free to run.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS; DEMOCRATS MAY LOSE GRIP ON DELEGATION; A TIGHT 
SOUTH BAY RACE WILL DECIDE WHETHER PARTIES EVENLY SPLIT 52 SEATS IN HOUSE. 
DEMOCRATS WENT INTO ELECTION WITH 30-22 EDGE.

 Depending on the outcome of a photo finish in a race in Los Angeles' South 
Bay, Democrats may lose control of California's congressional delegation for 
the first time since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Democratic incumbents -- Lynn Schenk of San Diego, Dan Hamburg of Ukiah 
and Richard Lehman of the San Joaquin Valley -- fell victim Tuesday to 1994's 
Republican tide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the South Bay race between Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) and 
Republican challenger Susan Brooks may not be decided until a final batch of 
absentee ballots is counted in the next few days. Brooks, a Rancho Palos Verdes 
City Council member, leads by 93 votes. Her camp is expressing optimism that 
she will prevail because in absentee ballots counted Tuesday she had an 8 
percentage point advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brooks wins, the 52-member California delegation will be split evenly with 
26 seats for each party. The Democrats went into the midterm election with a 
30-22 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 No Republican incumbents were defeated or seriously threatened Tuesday. As bad 
as the picture was for Democrats, it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Three longtime Democratic incumbents -- Anthony C. Beilenson of Woodland 
Hills, Vic Fazio of West Sacramento and George Brown of Colton -- narrowly 
survived strong challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the current chairman of the California delegation, had a simple 
analysis of the Democrats' performance in California and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got walloped in spades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other GOP triumphs in the state's House races, 
entertainer-turned-politician Sonny Bono won an open seat in the Palm Springs 
area; Ken Calvert, a first-term Republican from Riverside, was reelected 
despite being snared in a sex scandal, and Assemblywoman Andrea Seastrand from 
San Luis Obispo declared victory in the race for the seat now held by GOP 
Senate candidate Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter race, Democrat Walter Holden Capps refused to concede. Seastrand 
had a 969-vote lead, with an untold number of absentee ballots to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, New 
York Rep. Bill Paxson, attributed the GOP's strong showing in California to 
good candidates and the slumping popularity of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of a Washington-based newsletter that analyzes 
congressional contests, pointed to another potential factor. The state, he 
said, may have witnessed a kind of mid-course correction from 1992, when 
Republicans were hurt badly by then-President George Bush's abandonment of his 
California campaign in the final weeks of his losing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats overperformed two years ago," Rothenberg said, "so it's not 
surprising that the Republicans regained some seats they should never have 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman was one of those surprise winners two years ago, handily defeating a 
better-known Republican foe in a district in which registration slightly favors 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Her race this year, which attracted national party leaders from both sides, 
shaped up as one of the fall's quintessential matchups -- a freshman incumbent, 
elected on Clinton's coattails in 1992, facing a challenger who tried to 
capitalize on an anti-Clinton backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman tried to walk a fine line between characterizing herself as an 
independent and embracing the Clinton agenda. She broadcast commercials 
throughout the Los Angeles Basin -- the only congressional candidate to do so 
-- in which she declared: "My party leadership isn't always happy with me." But 
as recently as the end of last week, she was at Clinton's side when he 
campaigned in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Brooks pounded Harman for backing Clinton's deficit-reduction 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other squeaker in Los Angeles County House races, Beilenson won by 49% 
to 47% over Republican Rich Sybert, a former official in the Administration of 
Gov. Pete Wilson. Beilenson, first elected in 1976, has seen his district 
become increasingly conservative because of changing boundary lines and 
changing voter attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a 22-year House member, also won by 2 percentage points in his 
Riverside County District. He defeated wealthy Fontana businessman Robert 
Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sacramento area, Fazio faced the stiffest test of his 16-year House 
career in turning back a challenge from Republican Tim LeFever of Dixon, an 
attorney and former aide to former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, by 50% to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeating Fazio would have been particularly sweet for the GOP -- he is 
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The three definite Democratic losers -- Schenk, Lehman and Hamburg -- were 
facing uphill campaign fights even if there had not been a national Republican 
landslide. All three had opponents who were seasoned campaigners, current or 
former officeholders and longtime residents of their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk's district, which includes half of San Diego and the cities of Imperial 
Beach and Coronado, has a slight GOP registration edge. When she was elected in 
1992, she became the first Democrat to represent the district in decades and 
the first woman in history to represent San Diego County in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Democrats, she had difficulty confronting Proposition 187, the 
anti-illegal immigrant initiative. She finally came out against the measure 
while adding that she realized illegal immigration poses problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk's GOP opponent, San Diego County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, was a strong 
supporter of Proposition 187. With a combative temperament and conservative 
philosophy, he depicted the campaign as "the blue-collar Navy kid against the 
debutante from La Jolla." 
</P>
<P>
 Bilbray beat Schenk 49% to 46%. In part, he credited talk radio, where his 
brand of conservatism gets a sympathetic treatment, for his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 To some degree, Lehman was a delayed victim of reapportionment. For five terms 
he represented a "safe" Democratic district in the San Joaquin Valley. But in 
1992, in a new district where registration is split nearly evenly, he barely 
survived a challenge from a 28-year-old political novice. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken by that race, Lehman had tried to develop a political network in the 
new half of his district, returning every weekend from Washington and holding 
40 town meetings to hear constituents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district didn't like Lehman much in 1992 and they haven't learned to like 
him any more since then," said his Republican opponent, winegrower and 
ex-Mariposa County Supervisor George Radanovich, a member of a pioneer family 
in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an unbeatable message of local control, less government and lower 
taxes," Radanovich said, "plus the nationwide sweep." He won 57% to 39%. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling 1st Congressional District, where Hamburg was defeated by 
ex-congressman Frank Riggs 53% to 47%, has a recent history of political 
volatility, despite what would look like a safe registration margin for the 
Democrats. Riggs defeated long-term Democratic incumbent Doug Bosco in 1990, 
then Hamburg defeated Riggs in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs, a former police officer, was relentless in his pursuit of political 
revenge, ridiculing Hamburg as a "serial job killer" because of his voting 
record. Hamburg, a former Vietnam war protester at Stanford University, seemed 
pained at having to distance himself from Clinton. "I understand Bill Clinton," 
Hamburg said the morning after a bruising debate with Riggs. "You're talking 
about my generation." 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, criminal problems -- real and potential -- did not prove a 
hindrance to two Southern California congressmen, one Democrat, one Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) was reelected despite being under criminal 
indictment on charges of taking bribes while mayor of Compton. Tucker drew no 
Republican opponent but Libertarian Guy Wilson, a merchant seaman, garnered 
almost a quarter of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar) easily won reelection despite being under federal 
investigation because of irregularities with the funding of his 1992 campaign.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / NEWS ANALYSIS; GOP POISED TO SEIZE CONTROL OF STATEHOUSE 
IN '96 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After suffering electoral meltdown just two years ago, California Republicans 
not only achieved a remarkable turnaround Tuesday, but they may have set the 
stage for seizing full control of state government in 1996 for the first time 
in more than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 That occurrence, if it happens, might finally fulfill the destiny of the 
Ronald Reagan conservative revolution of 1966, steeped in voter anger over high 
taxes, wasteful government, social spending and student riots. That torch has 
been carried on in the passage of Proposition 13 tax cuts in 1978, term limits 
in 1990, and now into the crime and illegal immigration debates of 1994, state 
political experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 If Republicans can build on their 1994 victory and avoid the sort of internal 
warfare that led to self-destruction in the past, the state party could emerge 
in 1996 with a GOP governor and solid control of both houses of the 
Legislature, several Sacramento observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, Democrats retained narrow control of the state Senate and 
appeared headed toward a 40-40 deadlock in the Assembly. Regardless of the 
final numbers, Republican Assembly Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga noted, 
"You are going to see a much more conservative Legislature and are going to see 
Democrats who are more willing to cross over and work with us." 
</P>
<P>
 That also means that the Legislature would be more likely to support the 
programs of Gov. Pete Wilson, who rode conservative issues into a 15-point 
second term victory over Democrat Kathleen Brown after having been declared on 
political life support just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When Reagan was governor, he enjoyed razor-thin Republican control of both 
houses of the Legislature for only one year, 1971. Even then, Reagan could not 
always count on solid GOP support because there were far more Republican 
moderates in the Assembly then, and the Senate operated on a bipartisan, 
club-like basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's election was the first in which the state GOP began reaping major 
benefits of the termlimits ballot initiative and the 1991 redistricting of 
legislative and congressional districts to greatly favor Republican candidates 
in many regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The full impact of term limits will hit in the 1996 legislative elections. 
Because Democrats have dominated both houses of the Legislature for more than 
two decades, they have more to lose when those seats are vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Republicans emerged Wednesday with an asset that they have not 
possessed for decades: a well-stocked bench of up-and-coming elected officials 
who can position themselves to run credible campaigns for governor, senator or 
the U.S. House over the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a glorious day to be a Republican," said state Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren, who has been assumed to be the natural party successor to Wilson for 
the governorship in 1998, when Wilson cannot run again. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, Wilson and Lungren were the only Republicans among the seven 
statewide officeholders. That 5-2 Democratic margin has been reversed -- in 
January, there will be five Republicans and only two Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new GOP faces will be Bill Jones as secretary of state, Matt Fong as 
treasurer and Charles W. Quackenbush as insurance commissioner. As a 
high-visibility Assembly leader, Brulte also must be counted among the 
Republicans' potential statewide stars. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Berkeley political science professor Bruce Cain said Wednesday that most of 
the secondary statewide offices are essentially irrelevant from a policy 
standpoint and should not be elective. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "The real significance is they will have statewide visibility 
and name recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Cain said the new officials will join -- and compete with -- Lungren and state 
Sen. Tom Campbell, a 1992 GOP Senate candidate, in the front ranks of future 
GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 State Democratic Party official Bob Mulholland said, "This gives them a much 
stronger bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's election reaffirmed the more conservative ideological profile of the 
California electorate of the past 10 to 15 years -- with the exception of 1992, 
when Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer won U.S. Senate seats and 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown was being virtually anointed as the likely 
winner over Wilson in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "That profile is fiscally conservative, very wary of taxes, pro-death penalty, 
in favor of tougher prison sentencing . . . moderately pro-environmental and 
somewhat secular about the Christian Right agenda," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
 The anomaly of the more liberal 1992 electorate also tended to cloak the 
impact of the 1991 reapportionment plan, which was drawn by the courts after 
Wilson vetoed plans passed by Democrats in the Legislature, Cain said. The 
effect should have been more pronounced two years ago, but some Democrats 
managed to win seats in districts that really had been transformed into 
relative Republican strongholds. Several of those Democrats lost Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times Poll Director John Brennan attributed part of Tuesday's 
Republican victory to the national GOP tide. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no more Republican voters in California than before, and they remain 
in the minority. But Brennan said, "We see more Republicans voting. That's a 
drastic reversal from 1992. . . . '92 had a very strong Democratic tail wind 
and the economy dominated the issue agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 In the intervening period, Brennan said, Californians reasserted their normal, 
more conservative political proclivities. Crime and illegal immigration 
eclipsed the economy as driving issues. Wilson, who ran for governor in 1990 as 
a relative moderate -- he called himself a "compassionate conservative" -- 
tailored his campaign to the shift in mood and reached accommodation with the 
more conservative wing of the California Republican Party by putting aside 
differences over volatile social issues such as abortion rights and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's electorate was far more conservative than in 1992. Brennan said 37% 
of the voters identified themselves as conservative and 17% as liberals. Two 
years ago, 27% called themselves conservative and 22% liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson won majority support of those voters who said that they were worse off 
than four years ago and that California was on the wrong track, even though 
Wilson was governor while things went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the genius, the shrewdness of Wilson's strategy," Brennan said of the 
governor's ability to channel anger and frustration away from his own 
performance and into the issues of crime and immigration.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / STATE OFFICES; GOP VICTORIES GIVE GOVERNOR NEW ALLIES; 
WITH REPUBLICANS HOLDING A MAJORITY OF TOP POSTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 24 
YEARS, WILSON WILL HAVE LESS CRITICISM TO COUNTER. LUNGREN'S POSITION ALSO IS 
STRENGTHENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Gov. Pete Wilson looks for help from his fellow statewide officeholders 
come January, he'll find friendly Republicans occupying posts long dominated by 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in 24 years, the GOP has won a majority of the top elected 
posts in state government. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer will there be a Democrat like Wilson rival Kathleen Brown in the 
state treasurer's office to attack him for what she called a smoke-and-mirrors 
budget that hid a gaping deficit. Republican Matt Fong, who defeated former 
state Democratic Party Chairman Phil Angelides in the race to succeed Brown, 
has embraced the governor's plans to cut state spending and will probably prove 
a loyal ally. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson continues to wrangle with the Clinton Administration and Congress 
over the cost of implementing motor-voter registration requirements, Republican 
Bill Jones, who appears to have eked out a narrow victory in the secretary of 
state's race, has said he'll sit down and work things out with the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the acting secretary of state, Democrat Tony Miller, was 
threatening to take Wilson to court if he refused to order state agencies to 
implement the federal law making it easier for voters to register at places 
such as the Department of Motor Vehicles. Miller, who was trailing Jones by the 
thinnest of margins with more than 500,000 absentee ballots still to be 
counted, said, "It's not over yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Also scoring a victory in the GOP column was Assemblyman Charles W. 
Quackenbush of Cupertino, who had Wilson's financial backing in his race for 
insurance commissioner against state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush and the governor share a strongly pro-business, anti-regulatory 
outlook. "I think that the Republican message -- free markets, free enterprise, 
individual initiative -- is really resonating with the people," said 
Quackenbush, who ran on a platform of easing regulation of insurers. "I think 
voters are rejecting central government planning for the economy, across the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican insurance commissioner-elect was criticized during the race for 
taking more than $2 million in campaign contributions from the insurance 
industry -- the same interests he will have to regulate in his new post. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year of a strong Republican landslide, however, Quackenbush was able to 
breeze to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times exit poll of 5,336 voters indicated that although Torres scored 
strongly among Democrats -- and among blacks and Latinos who help make up the 
traditional Democratic base -- Quackenbush enjoyed even stronger loyalty among 
registered Republicans and had a decided edge among independent voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Wilson, the biggest Republican winner Tuesday was state Atty. Gen. 
Dan Lungren, who clobbered his Democratic challenger, Assemblyman Tom Umberg of 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who will have to vacate the office at the end of his second term in 
1996, is expected to move up the political ladder. Other attorneys general -- 
Earl Warren, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. and George Deukmejian -- successfully 
advanced to the state's highest office. But Lungren is aware of others who 
tried and failed, such as John Van de Kamp, who lost to Dianne Feinstein in the 
Democratic primary for governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked with 'Governor' Van de Kamp many times about how easy it is to go 
from attorney to governor," Lungren said. "If I do a good job I'll have options 
open to me. If I don't, I won't." 
</P>
<P>
 A former congressman, Lungren is also spoken of as a potential challenger to 
U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in 1998, but the attorney general downplays the 
possibility. "I've debated Barbara Boxer many times," he said. "But I didn't 
come to California to run back to Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after his victory appeared secure late Tuesday, Lungren was still 
smarting from an Umberg ad campaign that tried to blame Lungren for the death 
of 12-year-old kidnaping victim Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the Umberg television ads, Lungren said: "I didn't think anyone 
could bring dishonor to the Assembly, but he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times exit poll found that a small but significant number of Democratic 
voters included in the survey, 18%, had defected from Umberg to vote for the 
Republican incumbent. And 54% of the independent voters contacted said they 
supported Lungren, compared to only 32% for the Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1970, Democrats have dominated the partisan statewide constitutional 
offices. Tuesday's election reversed the tide, but there were several notable 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 State Controller Gray Davis won election as lieutenant governor by a 
comfortable margin over a relatively weak GOP opponent, state Sen. Cathie 
Wright of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that Davis becomes a standard-bearer of his party's fortunes, 
ideally positioned to lob criticism at the governor and perhaps to run for the 
office in four years when Wilson is forced out by term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Democrat, Los Angeles businesswoman Kathleen Connell, was the likely 
winner in her race against former Republican Assemblyman Tom McClintock in the 
state controller's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my first run for elective office," she said Wednesday. "To make 
one's debut on a night when there was so much carnage (among Democrats) is like 
surviving D-day on Normandy beach." 
</P>
<P>
 With a wary eye on the still uncounted absentee ballots, Connell promised 
Wednesday to be a tough financial critic of Wilson and the new Legislature. "As 
chief financial officer of the state of California, I hope to provide critical 
economic and financial leadership to deal with the state's economic problem," 
she said. "I hope to move us onto sounder fiscal economic grounds without 
sweeping them aside with accounting gimmicks." 
</P>
<P>
 In the lone nonpartisan statewide race, for state superintendent of public 
instruction, Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin of Fremont, a Democrat, won a 
convincing victory over Maureen DiMarco, who is also a Democrat but who 
continues in her present job as Gov. Wilson's secretary of education and child 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eastin and DiMarco agreed on a number of issues facing public 
education in California, the superintendent-elect clearly saw herself in 
partisan terms in an election that brought triumph to so many Republican 
candidates. "I feel like somebody who was in a terrible shipwreck and was one 
of a few who made it to shore," Eastin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave of Republican good fortune did not hit with full force at the State 
Board of Equalization, the body that oversees collection of sales taxes and 
hears appeals on tax disputes. The Democrats appear to have held on to their 
majority on the five-member board, made up of four members elected by district 
plus the state controller. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 2, Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) easily defeated state Sen. 
Robert Presley, a Democrat from Riverside, who was tagged as a carpetbagger for 
claiming a Sacramento address during his run for the office. 
</P>
<P>
 And incumbent Ernest J. Dronenburg Jr., an El Cajon Republican, handily won 
reelection in District 3 over challenger Mary Christian-Heising, a Democrat 
from La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrat Brad Sherman of Santa Monica beat back Ernie Dynda, a Republican 
from Agoura Hills, in the District 4 race. And in Northern California, 
Democratic Assemblyman Johan Klehs of San Leandro beat Republican businessman 
Robert Strawn of Pleasanton. 
</P>
<P>
 If Connell holds her lead in the controller's race, the Democrats will 
outnumber Republicans 3 to 2 on the important but little-known state 
commission.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITIONS; TOBACCO INDUSTRY POWER MAY GO UP IN SMOKE, 
FOES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In handing cigarette makers a crushing defeat at the polls, California voters 
again showed their deep distrust of the $45-billion-a-year industry and 
prompted anti-tobacco activists on Wednesday to question its future as a major 
player in the state's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry, led by Philip Morris U.S.A., doled out $18 million in an 
effort to win passage of Proposition 188, outspending opponents 18 to 1. But 
for all that money, television time and direct mail, tobacco garnered less than 
30% of the vote. Proposition 188 led in early polls, but support plummeted as 
voters realized it was funded by the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's lopsided loss on the initiative aimed at repealing California's 
smoking restrictions means that a legislatively approved ban on smoking in 
restaurants and most other indoor workplaces will go into effect across the 
state Jan. 1. The law complements local smoking bans in dozens of cities and 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 David Laufer, a Philip Morris executive in Sacramento, insisted that despite 
the loss, "we're not going to walk away." Philip Morris, he said, remains 
"committed to seeking a more equitable solution to this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jack Nicholl, who ran the anti-188 campaign, proclaimed: "They have no 
place to go. They will continue to lobby, but . . . they've got no future in 
California. They're going to be a marginal influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the sting of Tuesday's defeat, Arizona voters approved a 
40-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes. That tax is similar to Proposition 99, passed 
by California voters in 1988, which added a 25-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes. 
Voters in several California cities have turned down tobacco-backed attempts to 
repeal anti-smoking ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 While voters buried the high-priced Proposition 188, they approved by a 
72%-28% margin Proposition 184, the "three strikes" sentencing law. Backers of 
that measure raised $1.6 million, a relatively small sum for a California 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "three strikes" initiative was in the mold of the anti-tax Proposition 
13 in 1978, the anti-crime "victims' bill of rights" Proposition 8 in 1982 and 
the anti-illegal immigration Proposition 187 this year. What backers of these 
measures lacked in money to run slick campaigns they more than made up for in 
emotional appeal and timing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have something that is topical with the voters, you don't need a lot 
of money to get it passed," said Mike Reynolds, the Fresno photographer who 
pushed for the law aimed at locking up repeat felons after his daughter was 
murdered in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters turned down three of the five citizen-generated propositions on 
Tuesday's ballot, following a longtime pattern of rejecting two-thirds of such 
measures. Voters also reinforced a more recent trend -- refusing to approve 
bonds for public works projects. Voters overwhelmingly turned down Proposition 
181, a $1-billion bond for rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 They also decisively defeated Proposition 185, the environmentalist Planning 
and Conservation League's proposed 4% sales tax on gasoline to pay for mass 
transit. The group also lost a $2-billion parks bond initiative in June. 
Several school construction bonds have met similar fates in recent elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters were not just saying no on taxes, they were saying, 'What part of 
no don't you understand?' " said Gerald Meral, the Planning and Conservation 
League's executive director. "This is the first year in decades . . . that 
voters have approved no bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters' unwillingness to approve long-term debt in the form of bonds for 
public works projects may hamper California's ability to build new prisons to 
house the thousands of felons who will be sent to prison annually under the 
"three strikes" sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections estimates that the prison population, now 
126,000, will grow to more than 230,000 by the year 2000, largely because of 
"three strikes." Corrections officials have called for $6 billion worth of 
bonds to finance construction of 25 new prisons between now and the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other ballot measures, voters also overwhelmingly approved 
Proposition 190, which makes a major change in the system of disciplining the 
state's 1,500 judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commission on Judicial Performance will now have a majority of non-judges 
reviewing complaints against judges, and proceedings will become public earlier 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 A constant among the propositions this November was that all of them -- from 
well-known initiatives such as Proposition 187 and mundane ones such as 
Proposition 183, which changes an obscure provision in the Constitution dealing 
with special elections -- either won or lost by lopsided margins. A close race 
was not to be had.

<P>
 Serbian forces drove back the Muslim-led government army in northwestern 
Bosnia on Wednesday, and a rebel jet fighter joined in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb soldiers and tanks rolled down the main road linking Bosanski 
Petrovac and Bihac, entering the village of Dubovsko, about 10 miles southeast 
of Bihac, a Reuters Television crew reported.The Serbian army said it had 
captured the village of Racic, about six miles from Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. military spokesman said shelling and infantry fighting raged around the 
Serbian-held town of Bosanska Krupa in northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina, where 
the Serbs had driven the Muslims back toward high ground east of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 A jet fighter flying over rebel Serb-held territory in Croatia fired rockets 
into the mostly Muslim Bihac enclave and appeared to have hit an ammunition 
dump, a U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was preceded by significant shelling of Bihac and the surrounding 
area, the official said.

LAWMAKER'S FUNERAL SPOTLIGHTS RUSSIA CRIME; VIOLENCE: COMMUNIST DEPUTY DIED 
AFTER BEING MUGGED. HE IS THE SECOND MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT THIS YEAR TO BE 
SLAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With tearful outbursts against the erosion of legal order, colleagues and kin 
buried legislator Valentin S. Martemyanov on Wednesday in a politically charged 
goodby to one of Russia's best-known mugging victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did all he could in his life to establish legality. Now let the people in 
power do something about it!" declared Ivan B. Rybkin, chairman of the lower 
house of Parliament, from the foot of his fellow deputy's open casket in the 
stained-glass chapel of a Moscow morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rybkin's somber, defiant tone captured the mood of hundreds of mourners who 
crowded the room and spilled outside. It heralded a new showdown between 
Parliament and President Boris N. Yeltsin -- this time over crime, the issue 
that most gnaws at Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Martemyanov, 62, was walking home from work at 11:45 p.m. on Nov. 1 when he 
was felled by skull-fracturing blows a few steps from his Moscow apartment 
building. The assailant or assailants fled with his watch, briefcase and $125. 
He died in a hospital Saturday, the second member of the Parliament elected in 
December to be fatally wounded by criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 His death struck a vulnerable nerve. Unlike lawmaker Andrei Aidzedzis, a 
wealthy banker who was ambushed by a hit man in April after publishing a list 
of 200 "career criminals," the modest Martemyanov, who commuted to work on the 
subway, was apparently the victim of a random assault -- the kind most Russians 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest tragedy was magnified by Martemyanov's stature as head of the 
Moscow State Legal Academy and author of more than 200 works in his field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communist Party to which he belonged said his death reflected "the loss of 
control over the country and the paralysis of state power." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia recorded 16,000 homicides during the first half of 1994, a 12% increase 
over the same period last year. Overall crime rose at a similar rate as gunmen 
invented brazen new schemes to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandits wearing police uniforms have been flagging down truckers on Russia's 
highways and robbing them. A gang of 40 thieves stopped a train south of Moscow 
a few months ago, locked the crew in freight cars and stole 19,000 sewing 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor traffic accidents in Russia occasionally end with the shakedown of the 
weaker driver or the theft of his vehicle. When a Russian employee of the Los 
Angeles Times stopped at night last week to help three motorists start their 
stalled car, they stole his -- after holding a pistol to his head, gagging him 
and handcuffing him to a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a society with the motto 'rape, rob, steal and you will prosper,' 
" Nikolai Skatov, a friend of the slain legislator, said in a eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of violence helped an alliance of ultranationalists, Communists and other 
reform-resistant politicians win a majority of seats in Parliament in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing the issue, Yeltsin decreed a wide-ranging anti-crime bill over the 
summer. But the Draconian measure, which allows police to hold suspected 
gangsters up to 30 days without charge, hasn't made Russians feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Yeltsin has been on the defensive for the past month, since the 
ruble lost a quarter of its value in one day and a Russian journalist probing 
corruption in the army was killed by a bomb in a briefcase. Recently, the 
president barely survived a no-confidence vote in his government.

 WHO KNEW? -- The magnitude of the Republican sweep Tuesday took a lot of 
people by surprise. Were pre-election polls wrong? Actually, no. But media 
reporting about the results did pull punches. Most polls found that Republicans 
were poised to take a majority of the congressional vote for the first time 
since the Dwight D. Eisenhower Administration -- and stories on those polls 
generally noted that such a finding could well point to a GOP majority in 
Congress. The final Los Angeles Times Poll, for example, indicated that the GOP 
was ahead on the total congressional vote by a 5-point margin -- about a point 
higher than the actual vote Tuesday. But journalists, haunted by memories of 
the famous Chicago Tribune headline, "Dewey Defeats Truman," hedged their 
predictions. "You're always reluctant to predict something you've never seen 
happen," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Times Mirror Center for People and 
the Press. "And none of us have ever seen this happen." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BAILING OUT -- While Washington reeled from the Republican sweep, at least one 
ousted Democrat was seeing fairly clearly Wednesday. Oklahoma Rep. Mike Synar, 
who has had seven weeks to adjust his thinking since losing in a Democratic 
primary, says he believes a lot of Democratic lions in the House will retire 
rather than be members of that congressional lesser class -- the minority 
party. That will open still more seats to possible Republican gains. Synar also 
suggested that a number of old-line Republicans will be less than blissful 
under what is expected to be a tightly disciplined operation run by new House 
leaders Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Dick Armey of Texas. Stay tuned.

 CONVENTION DILEMMA -- With their midterm election victory under their belts, 
Republicans are looking forward to nominating their next presidential 
standard-bearer in two years -- and San Diego appears to have strong support as 
the convention site. But insiders said that it's not a done deal. Party 
officials think San Diego would be an aesthetically stunning setting and they 
are high on the symbolism of meeting in the state with the most electoral 
votes. But some worry that the Convention Center is not large enough for all 
the delegates and press and question whether the city has enough hotel rooms 
nearby. If these problems prove insurmountable, the GOP probably will stage the 
August, 1996, convention in New Orleans, with its spacious Superdome, abundant 
hotels and memories of the 1988 convention that anointed the winning ticket of 
George Bush and Dan Quayle. 
</P>

<P>
 INDEPENDENT DECLARATION? -- Growing public alienation from the Democratic and 
Republican parties, combined with the showing by Texas billionaire Ross Perot 
in the 1992 presidential race, may give rise to third-party candidacies in 
1996. Among the possible candidates is Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a former 
Republican senator who was elected Connecticut governor four years ago as the 
head of a third party. Weicker is beginning to put together an independent bid, 
according to a Connecticut politico who has spoken to Weicker. Although Weicker 
has said that he looks forward to life as a private citizen, he predicted 
recently that a building momentum will lead to "a true centrist third party."

 GERONIMO! -- The first thing one dispirited White House aide did Wednesday 
morning after surveying the Democratic electoral rubble was to change the 
screen saver on the personal computer on her desk. Where Opus the cartoon 
penguin once romped, a man bungee-jumped through the bottom of the screen.

AMERICAN ALBUM: CLAMPING DOWN ON PICKING UP LIVE SEASHELLS; FLORIDA BEACHFRONT 
COMMUNITY SEES A SCARCITY, PROPOSES BANNING COLLECTING OF SUCH SHELLS. A CRITIC 
CALLS THE LAW 'SCREWY, EXTREME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than a million visitors a year are drawn to this tiny, tranquil island 
off Florida's southwest coast, and rarely do any of them leave without a few 
souvenir seashells. Indeed, this barrier island jutting into the Gulf of Mexico 
has a reputation as one of the world's shelling hot spots, where even a novice 
beachcomber might find a calico scallop or a fighting conch. 
</P>
<P>
 But take it from Rita Groh, the shelling on Sanibel is not what it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen anything rare on the beach for the last five years," says 
Groh, who with her husband moved here from Greenwich, Conn., in 1972. "The 
shells made us famous. But I wonder: If there aren't any shells here, will the 
tourists still come?" 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by an apparent decline in the number of shells that wash up on the 
beaches here -- and haunted by questions like Groh's -- city officials have 
taken action. A law that bans the collecting of any live shells from Sanibel's 
nine-mile beachfront has been approved by the Florida Marine Fisheries 
Commission, and is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Lawton Chiles, 
effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on taking live shells is believed to be the first such law in the 
United States, and tightens a county-wide restriction that limits collectors to 
two live shells per species per day. No one has ever been prosecuted under that 
1987 statute, however, and in fact the law is considered unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanibel's proposed ban isn't. "We're not going to be walking the beaches 
and inspecting kids' buckets," said Rob Loflin, the city's natural resources 
director. "But we see some real wasteful practices out there, people taking 
massive quantities of shells. So our police would enforce this rule." 
</P>
<P>
 On a laid-back island known for its broad, sugar-sand beaches and a sea so 
calm that only a hurricane can make it roar, the live-shelling law has stirred 
a storm of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 R. Tucker Abbott, a former Smithsonian Institution conchologist and expert on 
the 275 varieties of mollusks found in the waters near here, ridicules the law 
as "screwy, extreme." He says the ban is being promoted by "people who are 
fanatical modern ecologists, the kind for whom conservation becomes a religion. 
They make their decisions on emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, director of a shell museum scheduled to open next year here, says the 
Gulf waters are rich with mollusks, which thrive along an 80-mile-wide band of 
continental shelf paralleling the Florida coast. "There is an impression that 
there are fewer shells today," Abbott said. "That may be true for the first 100 
yards out." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial shellers, who dredge the ocean for whelks, cockle shells and sand 
dollars for sale to gift shops, also oppose the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the live shelling ban concede that the law is as much symbolic 
as it is efficacious. "There is not a lot of biological information," says Lee 
Schlesinger, a spokesman for the Marine Fisheries Commission. "But we are 
erring on the side of conservation. We have a valuable resource that is still 
healthy and abundant, and we want to keep it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservationist Bob Slayton of the local Audubon Society says he hopes the law 
will instill a respect for marine wildlife among those who haul away trash bags 
full of shells that end up as borders around flower beds, in the base of a 
table lamp, or in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who pick up live shells and take them home are no different 
from those who shoot wild animals and hang their heads on the wall," said 
Slayton, a physician. "They're trophy hunters." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaches of Sanibel, the neighboring island of Captiva or anywhere along 
Florida's west coast are not short of shells. Millions of dead mollusks wash up 
daily, and the sight of scores of people performing what here is called the 
"Sanibel stoop" -- a beachcomber bent at the waist and reaching for a colorful 
treasure in the sand -- is familiar testament to the allure of one of nature's 
most fascinating animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite an abundance of empty shells, collectors often prefer live 
mollusks, with shells richer in color and less likely to be damaged. Many 
resorts here, in fact, seem to encourage live shelling by providing guests with 
facilities to boil mollusks to kill the animal inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Loflin says the ban on live shelling should have no effect on tourism here. 
"Surveys indicate that 85% of residents and tourists support the law," he said.

TURKEY OPENS GATES ON WATER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shrugging off Arab anger downstream, Turkey opened the sluice gate of one of 
the world's biggest irrigation projects on Wednesday as it continued to pursue 
an ambitious goal of doubling its agricultural wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge spout of water flooded into a canal after President Suleyman Demirel 
pushed a button to release the first water from twin tunnels, watched by most 
of the Turkish government and 1,700 guests on the fertile but sunbaked Harran 
plain. 
</P>
<P>
 The $32-billion Southeast Anatolia Project is part of a Turkish plan to 
eventually siphon off more than a third of the Euphrates River, whose waters 
originate in Turkey and flow through what are now Syria and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at our future with security, thanks to this emerald water," Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller told the crowds, who were regaled by Ottoman marching 
bands and songs by Turkey's most famous Kurdish singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a debt of honor to this troubled region and have honored it," Demirel 
said. The huge area served by the project is mainly populated by minority 
Kurds, and the government hopes the project will create 2 million jobs, thereby 
reducing support in the region for rebel guerrillas of the separatist Kurdistan 
Workers Party (PKK). 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin warned that "outside forces" had 
long attempted to stop the project with PKK terrorism -- a clear reference to 
Syria, where the PKK leadership is based. The PKK revolt, in which 13,000 
people have been killed, started 10 years ago just after work began on the 
great Ataturk Dam north of the Syrian border. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a direct link between Syria's concerns about water and the 
PKK," said Philip Robins, head of the Middle East Program at London's Royal 
Institute of International Affairs. "The Syrians have shown repeatedly that 
they are ready to turn up the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Syrian towns already suffer from Turkish dams and irrigation projects 
on the Euphrates. Turkey plans to siphon off at least 430 cubic yards per 
second through the project, more than a third of the Euphrates' average flow of 
1,180-1,310 cubic yards per second. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately the river's flow may be halved. Turkey says it will give Syria the 
other half but refuses to guarantee that in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Euphrates flows on to the Persian Gulf through Iraq, which is also 
affected. Other Arab states, such as Jordan and Egypt, that are downstream of 
major rivers are unhappy about what they see as Turkey's cavalier disregard for 
the interests of countries sharing the same waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate goal of the 30-year-old project is 4 million irrigated acres, 22 
dams and 19 hydroelectric power stations. Official projections show Turkey's 
farm production doubling and its generating capacity being increased by 
one-third.

SRI LANKAN PREMIER WINS PRESIDENCY, PARTIAL RESULTS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Apparently looking for a peaceful way to end a long-running ethnic uprising, 
Sri Lankans on Wednesday entrusted the country's supreme office to their novice 
prime minister, who has pledged to abolish the job by the summer, partial 
returns showed. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election that pitted two political widows against one other, the first 
results showed Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga winning more than 59% of 
the vote for the executive presidency. Opponent Srima Dissanayake beat her in 
only one locality, the early results showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga would be the first woman to hold the presidential post in Sri 
Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after polls closed, Dissanayake seemed resigned to losing, but 
claimed that she had been the victim of widespread vote-rigging. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Kumaratunga's People's Alliance, or the PA, forecast a landslide 
win that they said would be a popular mandate to resume talks with Tamil 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she's elected with an overwhelming majority, it endorses her peace 
policies," Housing Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga broke off groundbreaking contacts she had initiated with the 
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam after the assassination last month of 
Dissanayake's husband by a suicide bomber, a terrorist technique associated 
with the insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 Srima Dissanayake, 51, a lawyer, was then named by the United National Party 
to replace her murdered spouse as the opposition's top candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons of safety, she campaigned only through the media. She denounced as 
naive Kumaratunga's willingness to talk unconditionally to the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that a bitter, violence-marred campaign could mean trouble on election 
day, police put more than 40,000 officers on special duty. But clashes were 
reported at more than 100 polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Srima Dissanayake's supporters were reportedly stabbed to death, and a 
third was knifed but not killed. More than 100 people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The government proclaimed an island-wide curfew to prevent more violence or 
settling of political accounts. But Kumaratunga's supporters defied the curfew, 
setting off firecrackers in the streets to celebrate her expected victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissanayake accused her opponent's party of stuffing ballot boxes and 
intimidating voters. 
</P>
<P>
 She blamed the alleged harassment from the PA for an estimated turnout of 
60%-65%, low by Sri Lankan standards. Final returns are not expected until 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 For many voters, the election was a plebiscite on the first contacts in four 
years between the government and the Liberation Tigers, a group that for 11 
years has fought to establish a separate Tamil homeland on this Indian Ocean 
island. More than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything depends on what the outcome of these peace talks is," Colombo 
schoolteacher T.M.I. Mutaliph said. "Everyone is looking forward to peace. The 
prosperity of the country, its stability -- all of this depends on ending this 
ongoing war." 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga, 49, whose mother and father both served as prime minister, has 
repeatedly assured voters that if elected, she will work to abolish the 
executive presidency, which was created in 1978. That powerful post 
concentrates too much power in the hands of one person, Kumaratunga has said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said by July she will work to amend the constitution to restore the 
British-style parliamentary system Sri Lanka once had.

IRAN BOMBS KURDISH BASE IN IRAQ; 1 KILLED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Iranian warplanes bombed a Kurdish rebel base in northern Iraq on Wednesday, 
killing at least one person and wounding three. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan said a civilian woman was 
killed and three rebels were wounded. Its statement gave no details of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said its 
pilots had attacked the "command headquarters, munition depot and center of 
counterrevolutionaries." It was the second Iranian attack in three days on 
Iranian opponents in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The air strike was unlikely to draw Iraqi retaliation because both Iraq and 
Iran have been fighting Kurdish minorities that have sought autonomy for 
decades.

FAA TO TIGHTEN RULES ON SOME SMALLER PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PHILLIPS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it will tighten 
procedures to be certain that planes like the one that crashed in Indiana last 
week avoid icing conditions in flight. The action could cause delays for 
regional airline passengers connecting to some major airlines this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S.-French team will immediately begin reviewing the twin-turboprop 
ATR-42's and ATR-72's certification to fly in airline service, said Anthony J. 
Broderick, FAA associate administrator for regulation and certification. An 
ATR-72 was flying as American Eagle Flight 4184 when it crashed Oct. 31, 
killing 68 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FAA stopped short of ordering the airplane grounded whenever icing is 
even predicted, as the National Transportation Safety Board asked in an 
emergency recommendation Monday night. Broderick said the FAA believes that its 
orders will have the same effect but will consult further with the safety 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has not determined a cause for the crash. The plane had been holding 
35 minutes in an icy cloud awaiting clearance to land in Chicago. And it 
exhibited the same sudden roll as those experienced in a 1987 Italian crash and 
a 1988 U.S. incident in which the pilots recovered. Ice was blamed for both of 
those incidents. Another ATR pilot in the same area on the afternoon of the 
Indiana crash experienced the icing phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR-42 and ATR-72, made by a French-Italian consortium, are flown mainly 
by regional carriers that connect with major airlines and often fly the major 
airline colors. They include American, Trans World, Continental and Delta 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for delays in widespread icing conditions is high because the 
planes are used extensively for connections at major aviation hubs. According 
to the Regional Airline Assn., ATR-42s and ATR-72s comprise about 6% of all 
aircraft flown in regional service. But because of their seating capacity, they 
account for about 15% of the regional and commuter airlines' available seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick said the FAA will prohibit use of the autopilot in icing conditions 
because it can hide problems from the pilots.

CONSERVATIVE INTEREST GROUPS SAVOR WINS; POLITICS: NRA TARGETED 24 RACES AND 
HAS 19 TROPHIES TO SHOW FOR ITS CAMPAIGNING. RICH RETURNS ARE ALSO CITED BY 
CHRISTIAN, ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After looking over the 1994 election field, the National Rifle Assn. drew a 
bead on 24 congressional and gubernatorial candidates. The NRA called them: 
"The 12 That Gotta Go . . . and 12 We Gotta Have." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the pro-gun group spent $3.2 million on television and radio ads, 
billboards, leaflets and direct contributions to elect their friends and 
obliterate the "dirty dozen." In addition, it later deployed actor Charlton 
Heston in a television ad to help oust House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), 
a former ally. 
</P>
<P>
 In the election aftermath, the NRA and some other interest groups that 
participated heavily in the election -- often through harshly negative 
television ads -- were reveling Wednesday in the rich return on their 
investment. The anti-abortion movement and the Christian Coalition were also 
claiming substantial yields as Republicans, including many conservatives, swept 
to enough victories to give them control of both the House and Senate for the 
first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Though only one of many forces in Tuesday's political watershed election, the 
3.5-million member NRA made an impression in political circles that could again 
drive home the value of its goodwill -- or the power of its ire. Overall, 19 of 
the 24 priority races went its way, and the next GOP-led Congress clearly will 
be more sympathetic to the NRA's position -- even as the public expresses 
widespread support for measures intended to curtail firearm violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The NRA's inroads were especially sweet after it suffered major defeats in the 
103rd Congress with passage of measures that impose a waiting period for 
handgun purchases and ban certain assault rifles. The group said it felt 
particularly betrayed by Foley, who supported a crime bill that included the 
assault weapon prohibition. The Speaker was narrowly defeated this week after 
30 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Right to Life Committee, which spent about $1.5 million, also 
found many happy returns after seeing its agenda sharply undercut in recent 
years. It counted a net gain of about 35 House members and seven senators 
sympathetic to its anti-abortion position. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to compare these results to previous elections, political action 
director Carol Long replied: "I'm not sure this can be compared to anything 
because the results yesterday were so fantastic. Pro-lifers made terrific 
gains." 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Coalition, meanwhile, which was particularly active throughout 
the South and Midwest, said that 38 of 51 House seats that Republicans picked 
up were won by "candidates who embraced religious conservative themes and 
religious conservative activists." They made the same claim for eight new 
senators and seven new governors. 
</P>
<P>
 In its most ambitious effort, the group distributed 33 million voter guides 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the increased role of groups like the Christian Coalition and the 
NRA, Mike Casey of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said: "Those 
folks have mastered the art of influencing federal elections. I would not be 
surprised if . . . a good 15 to 20 races were decided by right-wing, 
third-party groups." 
</P>
<P>
 An example may well have been Georgia Rep. George (Buddy) Darden, a five-term 
centrist Democrat who was on the hit list of the NRA and the Right to Life 
Committee and whose opponent, former U.S. Atty. Bob Barr, was embraced by the 
Christian Coalition. Darden lost by 52% to 48% in unofficial returns. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the conservative groups were hardly successful in all their 
high-priority races. And some opposing interest groups question whether the 
contributions of these special interests made a significant difference amid a 
national shift to the right that produced many lopsided contests. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia, for example, Republican Oliver L. North -- who had the strong 
support of the NRA, anti-abortion groups and the Christian Coalition -- fell 
short in his $20-million bid to oust Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb. In turn, 
North's hopes may have been hurt by a shrewd eleventh-hour move by a 
single-interest group on Robb's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before the election, Robb's campaign called the National Abortion 
Reproductive Rights Action League to express concern that independent candidate 
J. Marshall Coleman was cutting into the Robb vote in the senator's northern 
Virginia stronghold, a leader of the abortion-rights group said. The 
organization promptly blasted Coleman as "a great pretender" on the abortion 
issue at a well-publicized news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb subsequently criticized Coleman's position in a television ad and NARAL 
reinforced its endorsement of Robb through telephone banks. Coleman won only 
11% of the total vote and did not hurt Robb as feared. 
</P>
<P>
 The abortion-rights group, which spent $500,000, also pointed to triumphs for 
key allies such as Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Frank R. Lautenberg 
(D-N.J.). But overall, James Wagoner, the organization's executive director, 
described Tuesday's results as "a disaster."

6 STATES BACK TERM LIMITS; OREGON AWAITS 'DEATH' VOTE; INITIATIVES: ALASKA, 
IDAHO, MAINE, NEBRASKA, NEVADA AND MASSACHUSETTS RENDER VERDICT ON INCUMBENCY. 
COLORADO SAYS NO TO CAMPAIGN REFORM.

<P>
 Despite Tuesday's proof that voters have the ability to turn incumbents out of 
office -- at least 38 were defeated in House, Senate and gubernatorial races -- 
term limit measures continued to succeed in elections across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional and other term limits were approved in Alaska, Idaho, Maine, 
Massachusetts, Nebraska and Nevada, bringing to 21 the number of states that 
have reined in their politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado tightened existing term limits, but Utah decided not to reduce its 
terms any further. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits also passed in Washington, D.C., and Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The term limit question was just one of a dizzying array of ballot measures 
decided in 37 states and the District of Columbia, as well as in scores of 
local jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some results may bring enormous change. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon may have to wait until Friday to learn if voters passed the "Death With 
Dignity" proposal, which would free doctors to prescribe lethal medicine to 
dying patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome hinges on 265,000 uncounted absentee ballots, 21% of the vote. On 
Wednesday, only 39,000 votes separated the pros and cons, for a tentative 
spread of 52% in favor and 48% opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, voters rejected anti-gay rights initiatives, casino developers, 
campaign spending caps, handgun bans and even the opportunities to control 
their taxes through the popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referendum process was part of the voter rebellion that we saw at the 
polls," Larry J. Sabato, a scholar of campaigns and elections and professor of 
government at the University of Virginia, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabato noted a libertarian streak too, citing the defeat of the anti-gay 
rights measures in Idaho and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "That says to me that the conservative wave now sweeping the country also has 
a libertarian edge to it. 'Don't tread on me, anti-government, leave the 
individual alone, to the extent possible,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a smaller jurisdiction, Alachua County, Fla., voters repealed an existing 
gay rights ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado voters said no to campaign reform, rejecting limits on campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 So did people in Massachusetts, who rejected a novel ban on corporate 
contributions to public referendums. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma voters said no to a penny entertainment tax that was to support 
breast cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado, they rejected a 50-cent hike in the cigarette tax that would have 
helped pay for health care for the poor and anti-smoking programs. Arizona 
barely passed a similar measure, which will add 40 cents to a pack of smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the chance to hold all new taxes up to voter approval, Oregon, Missouri 
and Montana backed away. Voters in Massachusetts, with an opportunity to lower 
taxes for most residents, rejected a graduated tax rate and held onto a flat 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nevada, voters decided to require two-thirds legislative approval for tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the country's grouchiness extended to crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia enacted the nation's sternest sentencing law, a "two-strikes" measure 
promising life without parole to anyone who commits a second violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon stiffened mandatory sentences for violent crimes, and Vermont made it 
easier for judges to deny bail to people accused of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio, which has 134 men on Death Row but has not executed anyone in 31 years, 
chose to speed up the execution process by removing the appeals court phase. 
Appeals will now go directly to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Floridians recoiled from the vision of 47 casinos around the state. Casino 
measures also failed in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Colorado and on the 
Navajo Reservation. Colorado said no to slot machines at airports; Missouri 
said yes to slots on riverboats. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Mexico, however, voters gave the go-ahead to video gambling and a new 
state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 The status quo was fine with some voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Seat belt laws withstood challenges in the Dakotas and Massachusetts. Wyoming 
voters rejected a broad abortion ban. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee and Kenosha 
rejected bans on handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Vermont voters approved gender-neutral language for their state 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia rid its constitution of language proclaiming that "white and 
colored persons shall not be taught in the same school." The provision had been 
void since a Supreme Court ruling 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, voters backed a measure that really had teeth: They can now 
legally buy dentures directly from manufacturers instead of through their 
dentists.

GOP VICTORIES HAVE HOSTS OF RADIO TALK SHOWS ABUZZ; MEDIA: THE CONSERVATIVES 
OFFER RHETORICAL HIGH-FIVES EVEN AS THOSE ON LEFT-LEANING PROGRAMS STRUGGLE TO 
EXPLAIN DEMOCRATS' LOSSES.

 To the strains of James Brown's "I Feel Good," Rush Limbaugh switched on his 
"gloat-o-meter" Wednesday and proceeded, well, to gloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Gleefully recounting the Republican takeover of both houses of Congress, the 
conservative radio personality hailed "one of the most massive shifts to the 
right in any country in any year since the history of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a personal, political and ideological refutation and repudiation of 
the most amazing attempt to move this country to the left we've seen in 50 
years," Limbaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Watergate burglar G. Gordon Liddy was equally ecstatic on his 
syndicated show. "This marks the beginning of the end of the dreadful, 
disastrous, venal, corrupt, sleazy Clinton presidency," he declared. "The 
American people have rescued themselves." Noting that stock prices had soared 
all morning, Liddy said: "Even Wall Street is hailing the defeat of the Clinton 
socialists." 
</P>
<P>
 What some have dubbed the talk-radio election -- a campaign in which anger and 
alienation have echoed across the airwaves -- came full circle Wednesday as 
conservative hosts did rhetorical high-fives and liberals struggled to explain 
the hurricane that blew away the likes of Mario M. Cuomo, Thomas S. Foley and 
Dan Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was proven by the election is that the sentiment expressed on talk 
radio, which so many of its critics discounted as being overblown, is in fact 
the voice of America," said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers magazine and a 
radio jock in Massachusetts. "They say, 'Oh, it's just a bunch of right-wing 
wackos.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some hosts did more than just gab about the campaign. Trash-talking jockey 
Howard Stern, who won the Libertarian Party nomination for New York governor 
but later endorsed Republican George Pataki, Wednesday claimed credit for 
Cuomo's defeat. Pataki, calling in, seemed to agree, saying many Long Island 
voters had mentioned Stern's backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did get the word out, and it was just great, and I thank you!" Pataki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are like sheep sometimes -- they've got to be told what to do," Stern 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern boasted he could have made the difference for New Jersey Republican 
Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, who lost to Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg. Haytaian had 
called several times asking for an endorsement, but Stern said he couldn't 
abide Haytaian's opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Haytaian confirmed he sought Stern's on-air blessing, in part because rival 
morning man Don Imus was backing Lautenberg. "They're important players because 
people are in their cars in our state," Haytaian said. "I'm a superstitious 
guy. Stern endorsed Christie Whitman (for New Jersey governor), and she won." 
</P>
<P>
 On programs that lean to the left, the mood ranged from somber to funereal. 
Bob Levey, a Washington Post columnist and WMAL host, was less than 
complimentary toward the GOP's new House speaker: "What do you think Newt 
Gingrich proposes to do? Snake oil, pure snake oil." 
</P>
<P>
 On Diane Rehm's WAMU program, a caller named Isaac argued that "the Democrats 
deserve everything they've gotten. This is a party that laid back and refused 
to defend their President." Rehm replied that "the White House simply was not 
able to get their message out." 
</P>
<P>
 National Public Radio sounded a bit like a group-therapy session. Jackie from 
Massachusetts told host Ray Suarez that voters are "forgetting that the 
Democrats have traditionally helped the middle class and the poor. . . . Ted 
Kennedy, thank God, did get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Marguerite from Pennsylvania described herself as "another depressed Democrat. 
I was especially depressed at the simple nature of the governor's race here, 
which seemed to be who was going to kill more people with the death penalty. 
Oliver North losing is about the only positive thing that happened."

EX-REP. HUBBARD GETS PRISON TERM FOR FRAUD, THEFT

<P>
 Former Rep. Carroll Hubbard Jr. was sentenced Wednesday to three years in 
prison by a judge who said Hubbard's crimes, including using congressional 
staffers for campaign chores, "seriously jeopardized" the public's confidence 
in government. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months after pleading guilty to three felonies, Hubbard, a Democrat from 
Kentucky, declared himself "contrite, broken, remorseful" and hard-pressed to 
pay the $153,000 in restitution ordered by U.S. District Judge Louis 
Oberdorfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard pleaded guilty in April to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government 
by lying to the Federal Election Commission, theft and conversion of government 
property and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Eicher said that Hubbard had used his political 
contributions on "hairdressers, cable TV" and his wife's 1992 congressional 
campaign.

INDEPENDENT ELECTED MAINE'S NEXT GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent candidate Angus King, telegenic former host of a highbrow current 
affairs program on public broadcasting, emerged from a four-candidate field to 
narrowly become Maine's new governor, winning 36% of the vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent governors in two other states did not run for reelection, so 
King will stand alone as the only state leader who is neither Democrat nor 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Catapulted to competitive status by the near-collapse of untested Republican 
nominee Susan Collins, King targeted front-running Democrat Joseph Brennan as 
an advocate of stale ideas left over from his previous two terms as chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing the Democrat as an echo from the past, King pledged to open up 
government to new approaches and bring fresh talent and modern management to 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who once worked as a Democratic congressional staff aide and considered 
a U.S. House bid of his own as a Democrat in 1986, withdrew his party 
enrollment in August, 1993, to enter the gubernatorial race as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 That was nine months after independent Ross Perot finished second -- ahead of 
summer resident George Bush -- in the state's 1992 presidential balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 A youthful-looking 50, King charged state government with a "gotcha" mentality 
toward developers and urged adoption of a streamlined permit process. He netted 
$8 million from the sale of an energy management company he founded and 
provided most of the money for his own campaign.

GOP TIDAL WAVE: DAZED LOOKS EVERYWHERE; ELECTIONS: FOR DEMOCRATS, IT'S A TRAIL 
OF POSSIBLY DISRUPTED CAREERS. FOR REPUBLICANS, IT'S A SHOCKING RECOGNITION 
THAT THEY'RE NOW IN CHARGE.

 Flags were at half-staff over the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in memory of 
retiring Rep. Dean A. Gallo (R-N.J.), who died over the weekend, but stunned 
Republican and Democratic congressional staff members on Capitol Hill saw the 
flag instead as a fitting symbol for a world turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in San Francisco during the earthquake and I see the same look on the 
faces of Democratic staffers today that I saw on people walking around San 
Francisco back then," said Republican aide Tom Hoope. "And even for Republican 
staffers, it's elation, pure unbridled joy -- but mostly it's disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Tuesday's revolutionary election, the overwhelming emotion of 
Democrats, Republicans and even voters in Washington and around the nation 
seemed to be a sense of genuine astonishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere it struck, the Republican storm across the nation left deeply 
personal imprints on Democrats and Republicans alike. A trail of possibly 
disrupted Democratic careers has been left in the storm's wake, while suddenly 
ascendant Republicans found themselves Wednesday morning facing the sobering 
recognition that they will be in charge in both houses of Congress for the 
first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington is a company town and this is the equivalent of Boeing closing 
down in Seattle," observed Republican consultant David Keene. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on Capitol Hill, thousands of congressional staff members faced the 
prospect of getting thrown out of once-secure committee jobs for the first time 
in more than a generation, forcing many to join what one dubbed the "U-Hall 
frequent movers club." 
</P>
<P>
 "Depression hasn't set in yet. Right now, it's shock," noted Rep. Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento). "All I know is that I got up this morning and I started 
getting ready for work and I stopped and said to myself: 'What's the rush? We 
don't control things anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I always looked at House Republicans in the minority and said to myself, I 
never want to be like that," added Matsui. "And now I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the prime beneficiaries of Tuesday's Republican tidal wave still seemed 
to be groping to come to terms with the consequences of an election that turned 
conventional wisdom on its ear and which left some of America's mightiest 
politicians on the outside looking in. 
</P>
<P>
 As he bounced from one television appearance to another, Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), for example, had the dazed look of a man who had either just been hit 
over the head with a 2-by-4 -- or who was soon to become Speaker of the House 
and second in line of succession to the Presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, Gingrich, the bomb-thrower, seemed transformed and was sounding, 
well, statesmanlike. On Wednesday, the normally combative Gingrich -- after 
just 90 minutes of sleep -- had kind words for President Clinton and 
Churchillian words of reconciliation for politicians of all stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, outside of a rally in his home district of Cobb County, Ga., 
Wednesday, Gingrich, whose movements were suddenly being closely followed by 
the national press corps, acknowledged that he was taken aback by the size of 
the Republican victory Tuesday. Indeed, the tidal wave seemed to have a 
profound effect on him. With an air of wonderment, the newly powerful Gingrich 
talked of his plans to meet with Clinton and of how he is now assuming the 
sobering responsibilities of spokesman for the whole House. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Wednesday, Gingrich's rhetoric was almost unrecognizable -- a 
politician who has long counseled colleagues to use nastiness to their 
advantage, urged that "civility is at heart of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gingrich was hardly alone. Wednesday morning, Republican Party Chairman 
Haley Barbour seemed to be biting his tongue, explaining that his wife had 
warned him "not to gloat." And Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), poised to become Senate 
majority leader, seemed to recognize that Republicans are riding to power on 
the back of an angry electorate and that, if they do not deliver, they could be 
its next prey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an historic 24 hours. Congress is under new management," said Dole. 
"But if we are going to make this work, we have got to work together. And if we 
don't, the voters will cancel our lease and we'll get kicked out for a long 
time again." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, on a human level, the biggest impact of Tuesday's vote is being felt 
among powerful Democratic committee chairmen and their staffs. Men like Rep. 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 
suddenly will go from being in charge of an empire that includes 300 staff 
members to having nothing more than a small congressional district office. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does a guy like John Dingell deal with this?" wondered Matsui. "I really 
don't know. I've already heard rumors that some Democrats will resign after 
they are sworn in, because they just won't be able to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership and staff turnover on Capitol Hill will be unprecedented 
because the size of congressional staffs have exploded since the 1950s, the 
last time the House changed hands. According to the clerk of the House, 11,600 
people are on the House payroll, excluding the staff of the architect of the 
Capitol and the Capitol police force. There are another 7,400 employees on the 
Senate payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bulk of those jobs are now up for grabs: staff jobs on the 21 House 
committees, for example, are divided roughly 2 to 1 between the majority and 
minority parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us feel like maybe this isn't real, like we are going to wake up 
tomorrow and see headlines that say 'reports of GOP gains premature,' " 
observed Hoope, an aide to Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, a 24-year Republican back 
bencher who is about to become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a (George) Bush appointee and my career crashed and burned two years 
ago," added Chris Cimko, spokeswoman for Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), the 
92-year-old lawmaker who is about to become chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. "Now, I'm suddenly moving up. . . . This is truly amazing 
that this could happen for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The election has come as just as big a shock for the many former Democratic 
lawmakers who have long mined their congressional connections for corporate 
clients. They now suddenly find themselves with little clout with the new GOP 
committee chairmen.

DOLE, GINGRICH: A LEADERSHIP ODD COUPLE; CONGRESS: ONE'S A PRAGMATIC 
LEGISLATOR, THE OTHER A FEISTY IDEOLOGUE. INSIDERS FEAR THESE TWO NEW GOP 
LEADERS MAY CLASH AS MUCH AS THEY COOPERATE.

<P>
 While Tuesday's election results decreed that the House and Senate will be 
controlled by the Republican Party next year, there is still no guarantee that 
the leadership of the 104th Congress will speak with a single voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the new governing majority on Capitol Hill is every bit as diverse and 
unpredictable as the Democratic regime it will supplant. And nowhere is that 
diversity so obvious as in the personalities of the two men who will lead the 
new majority: Newt Gingrich, the future House Speaker, and Bob Dole, the likely 
Senate majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich, 51, the conservative firebrand from Georgia who has been credited as 
the mastermind of the GOP's monumental election victory in Congress, is the 
quintessential "new Republican." As a longtime back-bencher and a member of a 
largely powerless minority, he has built his career on ideological bombast -- 
savagely attacking opponents and challenging the time-honored traditions of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansan Dole is the product of another era. 
</P>
<P>
 A disabled World War II veteran, Dole, 71, previously has served as a leader 
and master legislator both in the majority and the minority in the Senate, and 
has also run for President. 
</P>
<P>
 While his dark wit makes him every bit as adept at attacking his opponents as 
Gingrich, Dole nevertheless possesses a pragmatic statesmanship and takes pride 
in passing legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The fault line that divides Gingrich and Dole is not the same as the one that 
frequently separates moderates and conservatives in the Republican Party. While 
Dole was once viewed as a GOP moderate, his willingness to challenge President 
Clinton's policies at every turn over the last two years has left no doubt 
about his conservative credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that Dole has been influenced in recent years by the Gingrich school 
of politics. Dole -- like Gingrich -- long ago rejected the genteel country 
club-style of Republicanism adhered to by their predecessors, such as retiring 
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when it comes to leading the new Republican majority in Congress, many GOP 
congressional insiders fear that Gingrich and Dole may be like oil and water -- 
constantly at odds over the style and direction of their party. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no secret on Capitol Hill that Gingrich and Dole have never seen 
eye-to-eye on much of anything. Back in the 1980s, when Dole still served on 
the Senate Finance Committee, Gingrich won the senator's enmity by referring to 
him as the "tax collector for the welfare state." 
</P>
<P>
 In advance of Tuesday's election, the two Republican leaders sought to bury 
the hatchet. But their differences were so great that Rutgers political 
scientist Ross K. Baker described the meetings between them as "the equivalent 
of the Oslo meeting between the Palestinians and the Israelis," which 
eventually led to the peace accord signed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of their personal and political differences, political analysts noted 
that Dole and Gingrich will be leading remarkably different Republican armies 
into battle against the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 After four decades in the minority, Gingrich's House Republicans are likely to 
be pliant and ready to follow the dictates of the Speaker. Gingrich already has 
made it clear to his caucus that he expects every member to read from the 
script that he will draft for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's Senate Republicans, on the other hand, are harder to command. The 
variety of strong personalities includes such relics of a bygone era as Sen. 
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who is soon to be 92; such courtly, well-bred 
Republicans as Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), and a growing cadre of ex-House 
members who have been influenced by Gingrich's desire for confrontation, led by 
Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.). 
</P>
<P>
 While Dole still must satisfy the older, more traditional Republicans in his 
caucus, he also must placate the younger conservatives to stave off a possible 
challenge by Lott for the majority leader's job. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there is the matter of Dole's presidential ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gingrich finally will achieve the job to which he has long aspired, 
Dole's aides say that their boss has never gotten over the disappointment of 
losing the GOP presidential nomination to George Bush in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dole decides to seek the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, as 
expected, it will instantly put him at odds with other GOP contenders, 
including Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), a former House member with political 
instincts akin to that of Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Dole is said by close associates to view Gingrich as a 
politician with little or no appreciation for the art of legislating by 
compromise. While Dole's fingerprints have been on virtually every major piece 
of legislation enacted in the last decade -- including tax reform, immigration 
law and farm bills -- Gingrich has no major legislative achievements on his 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
 A former history professor, Gingrich ran for the House twice from Georgia 
before being elected in 1978. From the start of his career in Congress, he made 
it clear that he was more interested in achieving a GOP majority than passing 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's strategy, which ultimately succeeded, was to challenge the 
Democratic majority at everything, large and small. His first big success came 
in 1989 when, largely as a result of Gingrich's efforts, Speaker Jim Wright 
(D-Tex.) was forced to step down under an ethical cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 His cadre of followers, known as the Conservative Opportunity Society, quickly 
became a focal point for newly elected Republicans who dreamed of being in the 
majority. It was this group that propelled Gingrich into the leadership in 
record time. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Dole's political career has been more traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the Senate in 1968 after eight years in the House. President 
Richard Nixon appointed him in 1971 to head the Republican National Committee 
and he ran for vice president as President Gerald R. Ford's running mate in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gingrich's eyes, Dole represents the Establishment views that often have 
prevented the GOP from having wider popular appeal. Just recently, however, he 
allowed that Dole's political views had matured lately in response to pressure 
from younger conservatives in the Senate GOP caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Dole and Gingrich will meet for the first time since the election 
in an effort to forge a working relationship. So far, both of them are pledging 
cooperation.

ELECTIONS '94; 'CONTRACT WITH AMERICA' GETS CLOSER LOOK; POLICY: LAWMAKERS AND 
OBSERVERS ARE GOING OVER THE FINE PRINT OF GOP PLAN. BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENT 
IS LIKELY TO PASS, SOME SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Derided by Democrats only days ago as a campaign blunder, a document called 
the "contract with America" has become the closest thing available to a road 
map to the new Republican Congress in the aftermath of the GOP's stunning sweep 
to power on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With powerful momentum, Republicans are likely to make good on some of the 
plan's proposals and at least score a few political points on others. "It's the 
American people's revolution," Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), soon to be the House 
Speaker, declared Wednesday. He vowed to make good on a first batch of the 
proposals when the next congressional term begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans are not alone in attaching significance to the document. 
"We're going to have to pass a few copies of this around," said Sen. John B. 
Breaux (D-La.). "A lot of Democrats haven't read this as closely as they should 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-page document includes some proposals that Gingrich can impose on the 
House as Speaker and others that seem likely to succeed in passing both houses. 
But others, reflecting Gingrich's brash brand of new Republicanism, are 
probably too radical or too expensive to win passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most-likely-to-pass category are proposals to enact a constitutional 
amendment requiring a balanced federal budget and a proposal to adopt a 
line-item presidential veto. The balanced-budget amendment was beaten back in 
Congress last March, but the notion is popular with the public and many 
analysts say they believe that the election results will make members of 
Congress afraid to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional amendment must be passed by a two-thirds majority in each 
house. Then it would be sent to the states, where three-quarters of the 
legislatures would have to ratify it to make it part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some uncertainty remains about how much support the proposal would win 
from other Republican leaders. At a press conference Wednesday, Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) politely ducked a question about his plans to push 
such an amendment when he becomes majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal's critics contend that it would straitjacket policy-makers and 
force huge cuts in spending, notably in the medical programs and other 
entitlements that continue to grow rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 The line-item veto, which would allow the President to remove individual 
spending items from the budget, was endorsed by Clinton during the 1992 
campaign. But some congressional experts say they wonder whether Republican 
zeal for the proposal will continue because the new balance of power would give 
a Democratic President the authority to delete items from spending plans of 
Republican-dominated appropriations committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Also given a good chance of success is the contract's call for term limits for 
members of Congress. But the Republicans' success in the past election could 
throw doubt on the argument that incumbents have too great a hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said that during the opening days of the new Congress, he plans to 
push a series of contract proposals that he believes have unusual resonance 
with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a plan to make it tougher for convicted murderers to avoid capital 
punishment, in part by limiting judicial discretion. Another would subject 
Congress to the same federal laws -- including wage-and-hour, safety and 
family-leave rules -- to which other employers are subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Also given a good chance of success next year is the contract's call for a 
capital-gains tax reduction, long an article of faith with Republicans. The 
proposal has had substantial congressional backing, and analysts at the 
Congressional Budget Office have presented research showing that such 
preferential treatment for such earnings can spur investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But some congressional experts say they doubt that Congress would accept a cut 
of the size proposed in the contract, which suggested excluding 50% of capital 
gains from taxation and putting the maximum rate at 15%. Still, in the current 
environment, said Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), preventing a 
capital-gains tax reduction "could be a problem for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Less likely to succeed are other proposals that some in Congress would find 
too expensive. These include a series of other major tax cuts, including 
eliminating the so-called marriage penalty, which Republicans believe unfairly 
penalizes couples by forcing them into a higher tax bracket; a plan to give 
each family a $500 family tax break and a proposal to encourage savings by 
setting up a so-called super individual retirement account to shelter 
contributions of as much as $2,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem with these cuts is largely in their size. The new IRA, the 
family tax cut and cancellation of the marriage penalty combined would cost 
more than $200 billion over five years. The contract also calls for increased 
military spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Because these proposals would threaten federal budget caps, they are 
considered much less likely to win support, even from some Republican members. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract also includes tough welfare reform proposals. It would cap total 
federal welfare spending, impose two-years-and-out rules for recipients and bar 
welfare altogether for teen-age mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the welfare provisions are so tough that many doubt they could pass. 
Indeed, some Democrats believe that they are so harsh that they would drive 
moderate Republicans to embrace a more liberal Democratic proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Using his authority as Speaker, Gingrich has pledged to make a number of 
changes on the first day of the 104th Congress. These include cutting the 
number of congressional committees by a third and cutting the size of the 
congressional staff by the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
 These last proposals have shocked the 12,000 House staff members and brought 
joy to Republicans who have long resented the lopsided majority and minority 
staffing budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But veteran Republicans who have waited so long in line in hopes of inheriting 
a powerful chairmanship may not show much enthusiasm for this proposal. "These 
old bulls have been in the wilderness for so long -- now they want the fruits 
of victory," said Ross K. Baker, a congressional specialist at Rutgers 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the contract say they believe that its greatest dangers may 
lie in some relatively obscure provisions that could go a long way toward 
halting the federal government's exercise of power. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract's plans to send all proposed regulation through the Office of 
Management and Budget for approval could effectively crimp the enactment of new 
rules. And a proposal to bar the federal government from ordering state and 
local governments to take actions without paying for them "could really gut the 
processes of government," said Gary Bass, of OMB Watch, a liberal budget 
watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 And he worries that, in the current political atmosphere, such ideas might 
have a broad appeal.

ELECTIONS '94; HOUSE PLAYS MUSICAL CHAIRS; GINGRICH CALLS TUNE; CONGRESS: THE 
GOP TAKEOVER WILL BRING RADICAL CHANGES TO LEADERSHIP OF KEY COMMITTEES. MILDER 
SHIFTS ARE SEEN IN THE SENATE.

 For years, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), a staunch environmentalist, has 
battled developers as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his fight is over. Come January, Miller is expected to be replaced by Rep. 
Don Young (R-Alaska), a strong proponent of development whose peeves include 
the strict government regulation of millions of acres of federal land in his 
state. As a member of the minority, the once-powerful Miller will have little 
sway over the committee agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 As the switch on the Natural Resources panel shows, the 1995 Congress will be 
vastly different from the old. Every gavel of every committee of Congress will 
be in different hands. Conservative Republicans will take over chairmanships 
from often-liberal lawmakers and will decide what hearings are held, what 
legislation is considered and what the rules are. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, a good many committees and certainly subcommittees may no longer 
even exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The likely new Speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), has vowed to slash 
congressional staff by at least a third and radically reconfigure the committee 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, with the exception of the ascendancy of a few high profile 
chairmen such as Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Jesse Helms (R-S.C.), most 
experts predict that the differences will not be as great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these people who will be taking over the House have very little 
profile, and no meaningful legislative record other than voting," said Allen 
Shick, a professor of political science at George Mason University. "They have 
never led." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, none has ever had the opportunity to do so. It's been 40 years since 
the Republicans last controlled the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is going to be dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans can't wait. As he stood before a throng at the Westin Hotel in 
Costa Mesa on Tuesday night, Republican Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove 
tantalized the crowd. After years on the minority side, Dornan is in line to 
become a Armed Services subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chairman . . . Dornan," he said as if trying on the title for size. Then he 
produced a wooden gavel, pounded it exuberantly on the lectern and shouted to 
the back of the room: "Liberal Democrats! You shut your mouth!" 
</P>
<P>
 The list of new committee assignments includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * On the powerful House subcommittee on health and the environment, Chairman 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who has waged war on the tobacco industry and 
was getting close to banning smoking in public places, is likely to be replaced 
by Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. Bliley's Richmond, Va., district is the home of 
Philip Morris Tobacco Co., and he is one the industry's finest champions in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep Bill Archer (R-Tex.) would 
represent "a major, major, major move to the right," said Joe White, a senior 
policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Archer is 
committed to reducing broad capital gains taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), the controversial but respected heir-apparent of the 
House Judiciary Committee chairmanship, is likely to try to spearhead a federal 
version of California's anti-illegal-immigrant Proposition 187, several 
congressional analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 One outstanding question in the shuffling is how much control Gingrich will 
exert. Many observers anticipate a tense battle for the House agenda between 
Gingrich and his new Republicans and the older, somewhat more moderate 
Republicans who would take over the committees if seniority were the 
determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich has made it clear that he wants to return to the era of centralized 
power, rather than continuing the current practice of allowing decisions to 
flow from the committee chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good luck," said James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional 
and Presidential studies at American University. "I don't think anyone could do 
that in these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "his operating style is very coordinated," said Rick Shapiro, director 
of the Congressional Management Foundation, a consulting group that trains 
congressional staff. "He will appoint very few chairmen who will go off and be 
moderate." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Gingrich told reporters that he intends to bypass the seniority 
system in choosing committee chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the rumored possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) might ordinarily be in line to assume the 
chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce Committee from Rep. John S. Dingell 
(D-Mich.) Some of Gingrich's aides, however, consider Moorhead too moderate and 
suggest that he would meet with strong opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the Rules Committee, 64-year-old Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) would be 
line to head a panel that can be important in assembling the Speaker's power 
because it controls many of the levers and switches of the House. But Solomon 
staged a brief challenge to Gingrich for the Republican whip's job two years 
ago. "And Gingrich's people think he's too moderate, not a true believer," said 
a consultant employed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say Gingrich's favorite for that post is Rep. David Dreier (R-San 
Dimas), a 42-year-old member of the committee who, like Gingrich, made his name 
not legislatively but as a constant scold of Democratic methods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another senior Republican who is widely discussed as being on Gingrich's hit 
list is Bill Thomas of Bakersfield, who would normally be in line for the House 
Administration committee. "Too moderate," said one Capitol Hill aide familiar 
with Gingrich's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the Republican revolution may be gentler. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Armed Services panel, the differences between Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and 
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) will not be enormous. On the Finance Committee, there 
also is little to separate moderate Republican Bob Packwood of Oregon from 
moderate Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, said congressional 
scholar Norman Ornstein. The same applies on the Appropriations Committee, 
where Republican Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon is expected to take over from 
Democrat Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 A few moves, however, would be more fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Senate Banking Committee, D'Amato is expected to undertake high-profile 
investigations, including hearings on President Clinton's Whitewater real 
estate investment, which is currently the subject of an investigation by an 
independent government counsel. But on basic fiscal policy, D'Amato will not 
differ radically from the current chairman, Michigan Democrat Donald W. Riegle 
Jr., analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 A major change will occur when Helms takes over as head of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms has used his seat on the panel, currently chaired by Rhode Island 
Democrat Claiborne Pell, to fight State Department appointments and other moves 
he opposes. Helms' aides have already advised the State Department to drop 
Clinton's pending nomination of Robert A. Pastor, a longtime aide to former 
President Jimmy Carter, as U.S. ambassador to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to screw 'em whenever they turn around," a Helms aide said, 
referring to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Among California Republicans, the potential harvest of chairmanships is 
rivaled only by the dismantling of Democratic empires. 
</P>
<P>
 California Democrats held chairmanships of four House committees -- Armed 
Services; Natural Resources; Public Works and Transportation; and Science, 
Space and Technology. They also held many subcommittee posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) may take over the Committee on 
the District of Columbia and he may also be in line to head a subcommittee of 
Science, Space and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Appropriations Committee, which has ultimate control over House 
spending, Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) will almost certainly become one of 13 
subcommittee chairmen -- dubbed the "cardinals" for their power to influence 
spending decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) could also possibly benefit from Appropriations 
Committee chess moves and wind up in striking distance of a subcommittee 
chairmanship. New Senate Committee Chairmen 
</P>
<P>
 The party that controls the Senate and House also controls the committees that 
shape legislation, pass judgement on presidential appointees and launch 
high-profile investigations. Under the seniority system, these Republicans are 
now in line to take over key committees since the GOP has won a Senate 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
</P>
<P>
 ALFONSE M. D'AMATO of New York. An outspoken critic of Administration policies 
and personnel, D'Amato almost certainly would seek to embarrass President 
Clinton by investigating the Whitewater controversy more intensely than the 
present chairman, Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign Relations 
</P>
<P>
 JESSE HELMS of North Carolina. A conservative scourge of presidents past who 
delights in sparring with the State Department, he opposes U.S. foreign aid and 
many of Clinton's foreign policy initiatives. Helms would succeed Claiborne 
Pell (D-R.I.), a lackluster chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Armed Services 
</P>
<P>
 STROM THURMOND of South Carolina. Back in 1948, as a breakaway Democrat, 
Thurmond ran for President against Harry S. Truman as a defender of racial 
segregation. Now, approaching 92, he will be hard-pressed to oversee the 
nation's defense spending with the tireless attention to detail of the current 
chairman, Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), a serious student of Pentagon programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Finance 
</P>
<P>
 BOB PACKWOOD of Oregon. Although he is more liberal than many of his GOP 
colleagues, Packwood, who headed the Finance Committee in the early 1980s, 
probably would toe the party line in an effort to save himself from being 
sanctioned on sexual-harassment charges. He would succeed Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the quixotic economics professor-turned-politician. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appropriations 
</P>
<P>
 MARK O. HATFIELD of Oregon. Unlike other members of his party ascending to 
chairmanships, he is more liberal than the present chairman, Robert C. Byrd 
(D-W.Va.), who has used the post to gain political pork for his home state. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD G. LUGAR of Indiana. He probably would be more conservative and more 
attentive to the interests of the Midwestern grain-growing farmers than the 
current chairman, Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Budget 
</P>
<P>
 PETE V. DOMENICI of New Mexico. The chairman of the Budget Committee the last 
time the Republicans held a majority in the Senate, he is viewed as a stronger 
proponent of deficit reduction than Democrat Chairman Jim Sasser of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judiciary 
</P>
<P>
 ORRIN G. HATCH of Utah. The President's judicial nominees-particularly 
liberals-are certain to encounter tougher scrutiny by a committee chaired by a 
conservative, who would replace liberal Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). 
</P>
<P>
 * Labor and Human Resources 
</P>
<P>
 NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM of Kansas. Although she is not always as conservative 
on the issues that come before this committee as many other Republicans, she is 
certainly more conservative than the current chairman, Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.). Probable House Chairs 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy and Commerce: Carlos Moorhead, 72, who represents the 
Glendale-Burbank area 27th District, is staunchly conservative. He has been 
criticized by some party colleagues for not being aggressive enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * Judiciary: Henry Hyde, 70, is a flamboyant silver-haired former trial lawyer 
from Illinois whose name is linked with the amendment that bans federal funding 
of most abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Armed Services: Floyd Spence, 66, of South Carolina, has been in the House 
since 1970 and in 1971 became the first member to sponsor a balanced budget 
amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appropriations: Joseph McDade, 63, of Pennsylvania, is under indictment on 
racketeering and bribery charges stemming from defense contracts he allegedly 
helped secure in exchange for favors. Whether he would be able to take the 
chair would have to be decided by the party. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ways and Means: Bill Archer, 66, of Texas, who after 24 years of fighting 
Democratic tax policies will get to promote the anti-tax, free-market agenda of 
his party like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agriculture: Pat Roberts, 58, was a newspaper editor and then a House aide 
before running for his western Kansas seat in 1980. He has voted to protect 
Kansas farmers from tax reformers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking: Jim Leach, 52, was director of a federal savings and loan before 
winning his congressional seat in 1976. The Iowa representative's voting record 
makes him one of the most liberal Republicans in the House, but he is fiscally 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 * Budget: John Kasich, 42, was an Ohio state senator before being elected to 
Congress in 1982. His heart is in streamlining military expenditures and 
balancing the U.S. burden-share with European and other allies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Education and Labor: William Goodling, 66, was a public school board member 
before taking Pennsylvania's 19th District seat. Despite coming under heavy 
fire during the House banking scandal, Goodling's longstanding support of 
bipartisan education measures has kept him in office since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign Affairs: Benjamin Gilman, 71, former New York assemblyman, has held 
his seat since 1972. Known for his moderate stance on economic and foreign 
policy, he supports ending the arms embargo against Bosnia.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; MEXICO ASSAILS STATE'S PASSAGE OF PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: 
OFFICIALS SAY MEASURE 'TRAMPLES' HUMAN RIGHTS AND COMMENTATORS CALL IT 
'RACIST.' BUT PRESIDENT SALINAS STRESSES THAT IT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE 
POSITION OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. 
</P>

 "The voices of intolerance have returned," Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari declared, leading his nation in protest Wednesday after Californians 
approved Proposition 187 -- a vote that the government here officially said 
"tramples and ignores" basic human rights of migrants in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a torrent of criticism that filled Mexico's newspapers and newscasts -- 
almost universally blasting the state ballot measure as "racist" and "a 
disgrace for U.S.-Mexican relations" -- Salinas said of the undocumented 
individuals who will be denied education and medical services under the 
proposition, "What will happen to the children? Will they return to Mexico? 
Wash windshields in California? Sell newspapers on the streets or beg?" 
</P>
<P>
 But in a clear effort to blunt anti-Americanism and more attacks on American 
targets in Mexico after the vote, the president stressed in a statement that 
Proposition 187 "does not represent the will of all American citizens, nor does 
it reflect the position of the federal government in our neighboring nation." 
</P>
<P>
 His administration also vowed to adhere to its basic principle of 
non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But as officials began assessing the potential impact of Proposition 187 on 
Mexico, Salinas said the government will continue to "reject all forms of overt 
and covert discrimination and xenophobia" against Mexicans in foreign lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the rhetoric was deep concern among Mexican economists and rural 
development experts that Proposition 187, if upheld by U.S. courts, could have 
a devastating effect on Mexico's impoverished countryside, the primary source 
of the tens of thousands of undocumented Mexicans in California who will be 
affected by the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a big impact on Baja California and other states, such as 
Michoacan, Zacatecas and Guerrero, if these migrants are forced to come back," 
Enrique del Val, undersecretary of regional development, told reporters at a 
breakfast round table. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know yet how many thousands or millions of Mexicans are going to 
return," he added, but said the government is working on its 1995 budget in an 
effort to factor in future need for hospitals, roads, schools and housing for 
hundreds of thousands of undocumented Mexicans who may return if Proposition 
187 is put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the projects under discussion, he said, is a large public works program 
to employ the returning work force to build hospitals and schools that would be 
needed for them and their families -- the same services that would be denied 
them under the California initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are worried," he said, conceding that it was the lack of those basic 
services that contributed to the exodus of undocumented Mexicans to the United 
States. "Because if these services are denied them there, they will come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, Mexico's secretary of public education, said his 
ministry "is taking measures to know how many children will be affected, which 
is the demand we now would have to fulfill, particularly in the border states." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few temperate voices in the Mexican media Wednesday was that of 
television commentator Sergio Sarmiento, who said: "The truth is that our 
immigration policies are much, much more restrictive than those in the United 
States." Rather than criticizing Proposition 187, he said, "we must improve our 
own economic situation, which is the only way we can guarantee our people 
decent jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the reaction to California's vote was far more emotional and 
ideological than practical, not only in Mexico but in Central America too. 
</P>
<P>
 In El Salvador, where the government had warned that Proposition 187 could 
destroy that nation's fragile, postwar economy if it triggers a mass 
repatriation of Salvadoran workers, President Armando Calderon Sol issued a 
bulletin declaring: "We are extremely worried by the victory of Gov. Pete 
Wilson and by the fact that Proposition 187 has become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that it is an attack against human rights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He appealed for calm in his country and in California, calling on "all 
immigrants, and Salvadorans, in particular, to condemn violence and reject 
violence wherever it may come." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, there were no major demonstrations against the vote and none of the 
street violence that many analysts had feared in its aftermath. With riot 
police on alert in Mexico City, there was no repeat of Tuesday's trashing of a 
McDonald's restaurant in the capital's Zona Rosa tourist district. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no official reaction to Proposition 187's passage by Ernesto 
Zedillo, who was formally declared Mexico's president-elect early Wednesday 
after a 16-hour debate in the newly elected Mexican House of Deputies. Zedillo, 
who won the presidential election in August with just over 50% of the vote, 
will replace Salinas on Dec. 1.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; VICTORY MARGIN IS WIDE FOR OAKLAND MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris handily won a second term at the helm of his 
beleaguered city, beating Ted Dang, the unknown political upstart who had 
forced him into a runoff and a long, bitter campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' victory proves "that divisive politics would not work," Sanjiv Handa, 
spokesman for the Harris campaign, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With 100% of the precincts counted, Harris garnered 64.5% of the vote, to real 
estate developer Dang's 35.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In conceding late Tuesday, Dang warned about how polarized the city has 
become: "We have two constituencies -- one that still doesn't support him, and 
one that supports him very much. Except that one has the resources and the 
assets and the ability to help the city far more than the other sector." 
</P>
<P>
 In other major contests in the state, former prosecutor Paul Pfingst won a 
convincing victory in the San Diego district attorney's race, and voters in 
Fresno for the third time failed to embrace a school bond measure designed to 
build much-needed campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Other races were not so certain, as county workers in California struggled to 
count what is expected to be a record number of absentee ballots. Several 
exceptionally tight races hang on the results of 500,000 to 700,000 outstanding 
absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 23% to 25% of the state's voters weighed in without going to the 
polls Tuesday, according to the secretary of state's office. By Wednesday, the 
semi-official voter turnout was pegged at 58.2%; it is expected to rise to 62% 
once counting is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of two anti-homeless initiatives in San Francisco could be 
reversed by 10,000 ballots that have yet to be counted. Proposition M, which 
called for a ban on people lying or sitting on commercial district sidewalks 
between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., was voted down, 50.6% to 49.3%. Proposition N, 
which would require recipients of general assistance to spend the majority of 
the money on housing, won 51.2% to 48.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkeley, where elected officials must win with 50% of the vote plus one, 
could face three runoff elections in the next 28 days, depending on the outcome 
of absentee balloting. One election was certain Wednesday. Voters resoundingly 
turned their backs on attorney and delicatessen co-owner Thomas Burcham, 
believed to be the first avowed Republican to run for the nonpartisan City 
Council in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure F in the Bay Area city of Albany also hung in the absentee-voter 
balance Wednesday. Voters so narrowly approved the measure -- 50.6% to 49.3%, a 
margin of 83 votes -- that uncounted ballots could reverse the outcome. If 
passed, the measure will give approval to a card room beneath the grandstands 
of Golden Gate Fields racetrack.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; KEY VICTORIES HEARTEN GAY ACTIVISTS; POLITICS: FIRST 
OPENLY GAY LEGISLATOR IS ELECTED IN CALIFORNIA; OREGON AND IDAHO ANTI-RIGHTS 
INITIATIVES LOSE. LEADERS SAY HOMOSEXUALITY IS LESS OF A CAMPAIGN ISSUE.

<P>
 Countering the conservative wave that washed over much of the nation, gays 
enjoyed several key victories this week, most notably the election of a lesbian 
to the California Legislature and the defeat of anti-gay rights initiatives in 
Oregon and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the 41st Assembly District seat, Democrat Sheila James Kuehl of 
Santa Monica became the first openly gay member of the California Legislature. 
"It's a privilege to be the first of anything, and it's scary as well," said 
Kuehl, 53, a women's rights lawyer and former actress best known for playing 
Zelda in the 1960s television series "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis." 
</P>
<P>
 "I will have the opportunity to add a perspective that's never been added 
before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of other gay state legislators were elected elsewhere in the 
country, the highest-profile gay candidates were not successful. In California, 
Democratic Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller appears to have lost his bid 
to become the first openly gay person elected to a statewide office. Likewise 
in New York, lesbian attorney general candidate Karen Burstein was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, gay-rights activists were heartened by the results. "It's the first 
election I've ever been in where it was more hazardous to be an open Democrat 
than an open gay," quipped William Waybourn of the Gay and Lesbian Victory 
Fund, a national group that supports gay political candidates. "We've done 
quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 17 candidates backed by the fund, at least 12 were victors, Waybourn 
said. Among them were Teri Schwartz, elected to the Los Angeles Superior Court, 
and Bonnie Dumanis, who won a spot on the San Diego City Court. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 500,000 absentee votes yet to be counted, Miller was not ready to 
concede Wednesday. "It's not over yet," said Miller, who was trailing 
Republican Bill Jones by about 44,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the New York attorney general's contest, in which Democrat 
Burstein's homosexuality was made an issue by the opposition camp, Miller said 
his sexual orientation never became a factor in his race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly the dynamics of this race . . . were driven by a Republican tide," 
Miller said. "I think at least in California more and more people care less and 
less about personal matters such as orientation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay political activists attributed Kuehl's success to her strength as a 
coalition candidate who could reach well beyond a gay base. Long active on 
women's rights and domestic violence issues, Kuehl drew support from sources as 
diverse as the former "Dobie Gillis" cast to the legal world. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oregon, the conservative Oregon Citizens Alliance picked up more votes for 
its anti-gay Measure 13 than for a similar proposal in 1992, but the referendum 
was once again defeated, this time by a 52% majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Oregon and Idaho initiatives would have barred state and local 
government from recognizing same-sex partnerships or passing laws protecting 
gays from discrimination. They would have further outlawed the sympathetic 
treatment of homosexuality in public schools and the expenditure of public 
money in ways implying the acceptance of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho's Proposition 1 lost by only a few thousand votes. Still, it was enough 
to delight opponents. "In this groundswell of conservative victories, it's 
quite an accomplishment," said No on 1 campaign manager Diane Sands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they predict more anti-gay initiatives -- the Oregon Citizens 
Alliance has already filed ballot language for the 1996 election -- gay rights 
activists cited the election results as evidence that homosexuality is losing 
some of its steam as a hot political issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the referendums lose, but so did some candidates who attacked 
their rivals on gay issues. In the Virginia Senate race, for instance, 
Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North had denounced Democratic incumbent Charles 
S. Robb's support of gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not go away as an issue," said Ritch Colberg, president of Los 
Angeles' gay Republican Log Cabin Club. "But it's way down on the list of 
determinants that impacted how people voted."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 186; DEFEAT MAY PROVE FATAL FOR LARGE-SCALE 
HEALTH REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The massive voter rejection of Proposition 186, the initiative to impose a 
Canadian-style health care system on California, left the future of health care 
reform in California cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the initiative, already in the process of regrouping Wednesday, 
say they will continue to fight for a so-called single-payer system in 
California that would guarantee health insurance coverage to all legal 
residents of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say they believe the measure's crushing defeat, coming just 
months after President Clinton's national health reform plan stalled in 
Congress, may spell the end of large-scale proposals to overhaul the health 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 got the support of only 26.6% of those who cast ballots on the 
measure, according to final unofficial results. That means it went down even 
more decisively than the last effort at sweeping health reform in California -- 
Proposition 166, a California Medical Assn.-backed plan that lost by a 2-1 
margin two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of Proposition 186 left supporters reeling even as it had opponents 
hoping the lopsided defeat would discourage future efforts at imposing a 
similar kind of plan based on taxes and employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think (the vote) is sending a resounding message that people don't want 
government running their health care system," said Susan Neely, a senior vice 
president of the Health Insurance Assn. of America, which poured $1.5 million 
into the effort to defeat Proposition 186. 
</P>
<P>
 Health industry activists on both sides of the issue believe that although 
Proposition 186 may be dead, health reform is not because of underlying health 
care problems that led to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems that have so far defied a political solution are finding a 
way to provide coverage to the estimated 6 million medically uninsured people 
in California and figuring out how to provide coverage to those who have health 
insurance but will lose it if they lose their job, get divorced or found 
themselves outside the system because they are suffering from a serious 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 In post-election comments, most predictions were that global-type plans 
requiring strong government intervention, such as the Clinton plan and 
Proposition 186, will give way to more incremental proposals tackling smaller 
pieces of the problem. The battlefield will be Congress or the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the cumulative effects of Tuesday's election, voters are 
saying no to new taxes and no to big government," said Matt James of the Palo 
Alto-based Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the nation's largest nonprofit 
foundations that tracks health care reform. "It will be very difficult for 
something like Proposition 186 to succeed in the present political climate." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Kay Henry, director of the health care division of the Service Employees 
International Union, which contributed $200,000 toward the initiative's 
passage, said the union will not back away from health reform because it 
believes the nation's health care problems will only get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 186 was just one battle," Henry said. "Now we are trying to 
figure out how to win the war, which may mean a whole series of battles in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe this was a referendum on health care reform," said Duane 
Dauner, president of the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems and 
co-chairman of the opposition campaign, called Taxpayers Against the Government 
Takeover. "The underlying problems we have to deal with still remain."

THE POLITICAL BEAT GOES ON FOR CONGRESSMAN-ELECT SONNY BONO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Congressman-elect Sonny Bono wasn't humming "I've Got You, Babe" or 
"And the Beat Goes On" when he crawled into bed early Wednesday morning as 
California's newest celebrity-turned-officeholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he harked back to "Laugh at Me," one of the lesser-known tunes he 
sang with his former wife, Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote it after I got kicked out of a restaurant, back when people made less 
of us because of the way we dressed and didn't look at our substance, or what 
we could deliver," Bono said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Bono, 59, can muster the substance of a successful congressman remains 
to be seen. But he clearly delivered the stuff of a politician. In unofficial 
returns, Bono cruised past Democrat Steve Clute, 56% to 38%, to succeed 
retiring GOP Rep. Al McCandless in the 44th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono spent much of Wednesday fielding calls from his new congressional 
colleagues, as well as from Larry King and Jay Leno, who want him on their 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bono's side Tuesday night were his wife, Mary; their two children, son 
Chianna, 3, and daughter Chesare, 6; his daughter Christy, 35, from his first 
marriage, and daughter Chastity, 25, from his marriage to Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations from Hollywood have not been forthcoming, Bono said. "I've 
pretty much lost contact with the celebrity world, but I think they're probably 
in as much shock as I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has he heard from Cher. "But she's probably saying, 'I'll be damned. He 
did it,' " Bono said. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for Cher said she would not comment on Bono's election.

STATE SCALES BACK CLEAN-AIR PLAN IN BOW TO OIL, TRUCKING INDUSTRIES; SMOG: 
ORIGINAL VERSION WOULD HAVE FORCED THE USE OF ELECTRIC CARS AND ALTERNATIVE 
FUEL. INSTEAD, AIR RESOURCES BOARD SUBSTITUTES A VOLUNTARY AUTO SCRAPPING 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pressured by the oil and trucking industries, the staff of the California Air 
Resources Board on Wednesday scaled back key elements of its proposed clean-air 
plan that would have encouraged widespread production of electric cars and 
alternative-fuel trucks after the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of state standards and programs to foster development of cars and 
trucks running on alternative fuels after 2003, the air board staff substituted 
proposals drafted by the oil and trucking industries that would offer motorists 
voluntary incentives to scrap their old cars and heavy-duty diesel trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The major, last-minute changes in the state's proposed clean-air plan came at 
the onset of a two- to three-day hearing that began Wednesday afternoon and is 
expected to culminate in a vote by the 11-member board late today. The master 
plan for battling smog will set the course for California's powerful state and 
local air-pollution agencies for the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original version released a month ago, the board's air plan contained 
measures that would have forced two-thirds of all California cars to be fueled 
by cleaner, alternative sources such as natural gas by 2005, and would have 
required one-third to be powered by electricity. The plan also would have 
required stringent standards for heavy-duty diesel trucks aimed at the use of 
alternative fuels after 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 But the staff downgraded those proposals to backstop options, instead focusing 
on a voluntary program that would scrap an estimated 75,000 old cars a year and 
an undetermined number of diesel trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and California businesses that back alternative-fuel 
vehicles lambasted the changes as a troubling step backward in achieving 
clean-air goals and an ill-conceived strategy to accommodate the oil and 
trucking lobbies. They worry that the staff's removal of the proposals for 
post-2003 vehicles could undermine California's five-year effort to bring 
mass-produced electric vehicles to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to the October version of the plan . . . this is a hard one to 
swallow. It requires a big leap of faith," said Andrew Hirsch, an executive 
with the Southern California Gas Co., which has helped develop vehicles fueled 
by natural gas. "The auto and (trucking) and oil industries are very powerful 
groups that want to sustain the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
 But the three industries contend that the cost of meeting such standards is 
prohibitive and the technology still too uncertain, even though major 
technological advances in electric cars and fuel cells have been made in the 
past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the trucking and oil industries and the California Chamber 
of Commerce welcomed the staff's decision to pursue a scrapping program, saying 
it will clean the air without as much cost and loss of jobs as the original 
plan would have caused. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a substantial number of older trucks out there that are gross 
emitters. You have to find incentives to get them off the road," said Karen 
Rasmussen, vice president of the California Trucking Assn., which represents 
2,600 trucking companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Zaremberg, senior vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, 
said the original plan was "an overreaching of government regulations." He said 
the technology for electric cars and other clean-fuel options is too expensive 
and too unproven to require by 2003 or 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hirsch said: "We don't understand why a standard should be pushed back 
when it can already be met today by commercially available technology," such as 
natural gas cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has already adopted regulations that require 2% of cars sold in 
California by major auto companies to be electric-powered beginning in 1998, 
increasing to 10% by 2003. Those mandates would remain intact under the new 
plan, but there would be no tightening of the restrictions after 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The scrapping program is proposed to begin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But many questions remain about the scrapping approach. Can clean-air targets 
be realistically met in that way? How much will it cost and where will the 
money come from? Is it realistic to think that thousands of car and truck 
owners will be willing to scrap their vehicles? Will the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, which has final veto power over the state's plan, accept 
such an approach? 
</P>
<P>
 The board says car owners should be offered $1,000 for each old car scrapped. 
To help pay for this, the oil industry and board staff suggest adding a $7 fee 
to vehicle registrations or a $100 fee on the price of new cars. Trucking 
industry officials advocate low-interest loans to encourage truckers to buy 
new, less-polluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned that this moves the (board) away from their strong 
stands to promote technological advancements," said Paul Helliker, an engineer 
with Calstart, a consortium of industries developing alternative-fuel cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The air quality staff has been under increasing pressure from Gov. Pete 
Wilson's office to accommodate the influential trucking and oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 James Boyd, the board's executive officer, defended the scaled-back plan, 
calling it "comprehensive and very ambitious." The plan still contains, for 
example, a standard that would force California truckers to cut their emissions 
from diesel engines in half by 2002, requiring modifications in engines and 
methods of operation. The revised plan, Boyd said, still manages to bring all 
of California into compliance with air pollution health standards by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a deadline set by Congress, the state has until Tuesday to adopt a 
blueprint outlining how it will achieve air pollution health standards 
throughout the state by 2010. The state's goal is to create a strategy that can 
replace a clean-air plan developed by the Clinton Administration for the 
smoggiest regions of California that has been widely criticized as onerous and 
economically disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, the state has until 1996 to prove it can cut smog-causing 
gases by 15% from 1990 levels, and then by 3% a year thereafter.

SEX HARASSMENT SUIT AGAINST POLICE SETTLED; MEDIATION: NEWPORT WILL PAY $1.2 
MILLION TO SEVEN WOMEN. FORMER CAPTAIN, EX-CHIEF HAVE CONSISTENTLY DENIED 
ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city will pay $1.2 million to settle a lawsuit brought by seven current 
and former female Police Department employees who accused former department 
leaders of sexual harassment and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The women had accused former Capt. Anthony Villa of fondling and harassing 
them, behavior they alleged was condoned by former Chief Arb Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 The women, who will not be returning to the department, declined comment on 
the settlement through their lawyer, Steven Pingel, who said they hoped to 
begin the "healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of my clients," he said. "They have shown remarkable courage 
and have obviously contributed to the dramatic improvement in the work 
environment at the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 6 to 1 last week in closed session to settle the case 
without admitting liability, and made the arrangement final Wednesday. 
Councilman John W. Hedges cast the lone dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that there are larger issues involved," he said. "The plaintiffs 
should be required to prove their allegations in the court before a jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Robert J. McDonell, who was hired in June, 1993, to replace 
Campbell, said in a statement that he was pleased the case has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ongoing requirements of dealing with this issue have consumed an enormous 
amount of time and emotional energy from everyone involved, and even from those 
only peripherally affected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Department can now devote our energy in more productive ways which 
will benefit the entire community, and that's good news for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations, which surfaced in 1992, shook the department and the city and 
led to sexual harassment awareness training for all city employees. Mayor 
Clarence J. Turner said awareness of the issue has increased, as it has 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for us to move on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and Villa, who were fired after an investigation, have consistently 
denied all of the allegations. They ultimately were reinstated and allowed to 
resign with full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Their attorney, Jeffrey Epstein, released a statement saying they believe a 
jury would have returned a verdict in their favor but agreed to the settlement 
to avoid trial costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers Cheryl Vlacilek and Katherine Heinzel will receive settlements 
of $300,000 and $150,000, respectively, and will be allowed to take disability 
retirements from the department.  
</P>
<P>
 Officer Rochell Maier will receive $115,000 and be reinstated to her job and 
allowed to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Records supervisor Mary Jane Ruetz will receive $360,000. She, Maier and 
Vlacilek all contended they were fired on unrelated, trumped-up charges after 
spurning Villa's advances. 
</P>
<P>
 Communications supervisor Margaret McInnis will receive $100,000 and 
dispatcher Molly Thomson $95,000. Animal control officer Michelle LeFay will 
receive $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, reached through mediation, heads off an Orange County Superior 
Court trial scheduled for February. The city estimated it would have cost 
another $1.4 million to take the case to trial, which could have lasted three 
to four months. The city has spent about $2 million just on attorney fees, 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the allegations surfaced, the city had paid $275,000 to other former 
female employees of the department to settle their harassment claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest settlement is believed to have been one of the largest of its kind, 
if not the largest, involving an Orange County police department. The case was 
just one of several similar ones in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress agreed in February to pay $60,000 to settle a sexual harassment 
lawsuit filed by the Police Department's first female sergeant. In 1992, Buena 
Park lost two sexual harassment lawsuits, and last year, Garden Grove paid a 
$180,000 settlement to a former reserve police officer who said she was fired 
for ending a romantic relationship with a former police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Another large settlement came in 1993 when Long Beach paid nearly $3 million 
to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by two of that city's former 
policewomen.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / CITY COUNCILS; WINS BY LATINOS, WOMEN CHANGE POLITICAL SCENE; 
HISTORY IS MADE IN SANTA ANA, ORANGE AND OTHER RACES, BUT MANY VICTORS DOWNPLAY 
THE DIVERSITY ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just like their counterparts across the nation, voters in many of Orange 
County's local elections spelled relief C-H-A-N-G-E. 
</P>
<P>
 Women and Latinos made precedent-setting gains on several city councils. 
Numerous incumbents were turned away. Laguna Beach, the county's bastion of 
liberalism, took a decidedly conservative turn. And in the 
hard-to-figure-category, voters in Fullerton reelected a councilman who was 
booted out of office just five months ago in a $200,000 recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Tuesday's balloting, the county's political landscape was expected 
to change because of the term limits in force in several cities and the unusual 
number of veteran politicians who bowed out this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the election results, in some cases, transformed the political terrain 
more thanexpected and, on the whole, suggest that Orange County, like the rest 
of the country, will have some hills where there were valleys, and valleys 
where there were hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly have made history in the city of Santa Ana," attorney Alfred 
Amezcua said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. became Santa Ana's first Latino mayor in a 
close eight-candidate race. Despite criticism about his seemingly wavering 
views on Proposition 187, supporters say Pulido's victory heralds a new era of 
inclusion for the city's rapidly growing Latino majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Amezcua, "The Hispanic community ought to be very proud for the first 
time to have somebody who is representing our goals and aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido, who owns a muffler shop, said, "I see myself as a person who has paid 
his dues, who cares about this city, and sees that it has a lot of potential -- 
and who happens to be a Hispanic. But that is not my primary credential." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when tensions on immigration may be boiling over statewide -- in the 
wake of Proposition 187's passage -- voters in Anaheim and San Clemente also 
elevated Latinos to council seats for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real changing of the guard," Anaheim's Lou Lopez said Wednesday, 
after only two hours of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 An Anaheim police officer for 25 years, Lopez will remain on the force for the 
time being, which may make him ineligible to vote on certain budget matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made history," Lopez said. "It's a big breakthrough and I want to be a 
positive role model for the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, where ethnic relations were strained last year by a clash 
between white and Latino teen-agers at a beach parking lot that left one youth 
dead, Steve Apodaca became the city's first Latino council member. 
</P>
<P>
 A 43-year-old insurance agent, Apodaca ran on a platform of retaining 
businesses in the city and fighting crime and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The votes (I received) didn't come just from Latinos," said Apodaca, who 
vowed to represent all of his constituency. "They came from people across the 
board who are concerned about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In another first for diversity, Orange voters got their first female mayor in 
Joanne Coontz, who in 1986 became that city's first councilwoman. She, too, 
sought to downplay the diversity question. "I'm an individual; I don't worry 
about the male-female question," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in Stanton, Buena Park, and Lake Forest also rejected incumbents in 
favor of new blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers in Stanton, like those from Brea to Boston, ran anti-crime, 
lower-tax campaigns that struck a responsive chord with the electorate. 
Challengers David John Shawver, 47, a former city council member, and Brian 
Donahue, 56, director of a Regional Occupational Program in Whittier, edged out 
incumbents Don Martinez and Linda Pappas Diaz with promises to rid Beach 
Boulevard of prostitutes and cut Stanton's utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most surprising, voters in Laguna Beach rejected Mayor Ann Christoph 
in what observers there described as a conservative sweep of council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Another newcomer whose message rang true was La Habra's Dorothy May Rush, a 
60-year-old homemaker whose anti-gang rhetoric resulted in her home being 
firebombed and shot at. She was that city's top vote-getter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they made a statement by electing me," Rush said. "They are fed up 
with the mess that La Habra is in. The city is full of trash and debris and the 
gang activity is bad." 
</P>
<P>
 In the most-perplexing category: the Fullerton election results. Don Bankhead, 
a retired Fullerton police captain, was one of three council members ousted in 
a June recall election after they voted to impose the city's first utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall election cost the taxpayers $200,000, but voters apparently thought 
Bankhead was worth another try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel somewhat vindicated," said Bankhead, who said his ouster was "a very 
sad time in my life. I think that the silent majority finally spoke out." 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities did stick with the tried and true. But even then, some 
incumbents had a surprisingly tough time of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, Councilman Tony Lam, the nation's first Vietnamese American to 
win an elected office, staved off a challenge and hung on to win by a slim 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, Mayor Tom Daly cruised to a decisive victory over challenger 
Curtis Stricker in a race that proved to be a dramatic contrast to the bitter 
battle two years ago when Daly upset then-incumbent Mayor Fred Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience won out in Huntington Beach, where a near-record 22 candidates 
sought four seats, but three of the victors -- Shirley S. Dettloff, 59, chair 
of the planning commission; former Mayor Peter Green, 68, and Councilman Ralph 
Bauer -- support development of a portion of the Bolsa Chica wetlands in 
exchange for restoration of marshes, a divisive issue in that city.

IT'S MORE THAN A PIPE DREAM; EFFORT TO QUENCH SOUTH COUNTY THIRST WORRIES THOSE

 The $625-million underground pipeline would be Orange County's largest ever, 
tall enough to put a basketball hoop inside and still have three feet to spare, 
and wide enough to deliver 260 million gallons of water a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Its main section would be called the Cleveland Tunnel, an eight-mile furrow 
2,200 feet beneath Bedford Peak in the Santa Ana Mountains and the Cleveland 
National Forest. Eighteen miles in all, the pipeline would link the western tip 
of the Colorado River Aqueduct -- Lake Mathews in Riverside County -- with two 
other underground pipes near Irvine to satisfy the water demands of future 
developers and a south Orange County population expected to grow by 100,000 
people in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the board of the huge Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California (MWD) -- an agency known for its monumental water projects -- the 
pipeline would be paid for by water users in its 5,200-square-mile service area 
from Ventura through San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Project backers say it is not only vital for growth, but would also serve as 
an alternate source of imported water in an emergency, particularly an 
earthquake, which could damage water lines and interrupt service. South County 
is almost totally dependent on imported water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's critical, I'm a major proponent of it," said Peer Swan, 
president of the board of directors of the Irvine Ranch Water District, the 
county's largest district. "Right now, all the water coming into this area 
comes from one water plant. If we had an earthquake that affected that plant, 
then South County is out of water." 
</P>
<P>
 However, residents of the rural Modjeska, Williams and Silverado canyons in 
the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains, who live within yards of the tunnel 
exit, worry about what the project might do to their semirural lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although construction probably wouldn't start for several years, talk of the 
tunnel has reached a fever pitch among residents of Orange County's canyons in 
recent weeks as a Tuesday deadline looms for comments that will help shape the 
project's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-hour-a-day construction project virtually in their back yards that could 
last four years might destroy the quiet ambience of the narrow, rustic canyons, 
they say in a letter to MWD officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any chance of stopping this. There's no way in the world," said 
Toni Doscher, a postal worker, four-year resident of Silverado Canyon and a 
member of the Intercanyon League, an organization of about 900 residents from 
the three canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) we would like it to be the least disruptive to the animals and the 
trees. This is the only place left in Orange County where you can still see a 
puma . . . where your grandkids can come up and see a creek with frogs in it. . 
. . We are doing our best to keep it that way," Doscher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for 200,000 acre-feet of water a year to flow by gravity 
through the pipeline from Lake Mathews, a reservoir near Corona built in the 
1930s that stores Colorado River water. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the water would go into a connection just north of the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station that would tie into two other major feeder pipelines: the 
Allen-McColloch line and the South County pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Tunnel would enter the 136,000-acre national forest through 
Bedford Canyon in Riverside County and emerge just north of Williams Canyon in 
Orange County, the smallest of the local canyons and home to only 11 families. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline project is among $7 billion in capital improvement projects on 
the books over the next decade for MWD, the Los Angeles-based water agency that 
has built 130 miles of tunnels to distribute water throughout Southern 
California and whose board chairman is John V. (Jack) Foley of San Juan 
Capistrano, manager of the Moulton Niguel Water District in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep showing an effort for this project," Foley said. "South County 
really benefits from it. This project also allows us to bring water in at high 
(pressure) that allows us to fill all the reservoirs and shut down the pump 
stations," which saves energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the project hasn't been approved yet, preliminary work is underway 
and MWD is already acquiring land for the pipeline's right-of-way, including a 
citrus grove near Lake Mathews where a treatment plant will be constructed to 
make the lake's water safe for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the engineering hallmark of the project will be tunneling through the 
mostly hard rock under the forest. Geologist John Waggoner of Yorba Linda, the 
project's consultant, said work crews will start on both sides of the mountains 
and meet in the center, much like was done in the "Chunnel" project that 
connects England and France under the English Channel.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the traditional method of drilling and using explosives, the 
excavating and laser surveying methods of modern times make it "pretty easy to 
meet in the middle," Waggoner said. The large drills of today have more than 40 
cutters, weigh more than 200 tons and operate on about 1,000 horsepower 
generated by electricity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a machine that's basically a big drill. . . . It kind of inches 
its way forward," Waggoner said. 
</P>
<P>
 But modern technology does little to ease canyon residents' concerns over 
constant truck traffic in Silverado Canyon and on Santiago Canyon Road, which 
is the main highway to the canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are also fearful about how increased noise would affect the local 
elementary school and wildlife and the possible contamination of their 
underground water by the constant drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the U.S. Forestry Service, which oversees Cleveland 
National Forest, said its natural springs and underground waters are vital to 
the wildlife and will have to be closely monitored by MWD officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Kear, MWD's project manager, said district officials have met with the 
canyon residents in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are understandable concerns. We will continue to look for ways to 
further mitigate these problems . . . and we are counting on the canyon folks 
to help us come up with solutions," Kear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kear added "construction activity will be completely hidden from any homes" 
and MWD is studying possibly rerouting the pipeline away from the canyon areas, 
which the canyon residents strongly support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community wants to work with (MWD), but we sure don't want to be mowed 
over by them," said Judy Myers, a substitute teacher and 29-year resident of 
Silverado Canyon. She questioned who really benefits by the new water line and 
whether it would encourage further growth in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they need it for those people who are already there, but just like 
roads, once they get the water they can bring more people in," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD officials, who have held two public meetings in South County this fall, 
will review all the comments and package them into a final environmental 
document to be presented to the MWD board of directors early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the project, permits would then have to be sought from 
myriad government agencies, including the U.S. Forestry Service and the state 
Water Resources Quality Board, Kear said. Water Tunnel A proposed 18-mile 
pipeline that would deliver water from Lake Mathews in Riverside County to 
another underground pipe near Irvine involves drilling a huge tunnel through 
the Santa Ana Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest in Orange County. 
Tuesday is the final deadline set for public comment on this project. * End: El 
Toro MCAS: 600 ft. Santiago Canyon: 1,160 ft. Silverado Canyon Bedford Peak: 
3,691 ft. Bedford Canyon: 1,280 ft. Hwy. Temescal Wash: 15 Start: Lake Mathews: 
1,380 ft. * 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing Water to Orange County Water from the California Aqueduct and the 
Colorado River Aqueduct is pumped to the Diemer Filtration Plant in Yorba 
Linda, treated, and then distributed through four main pipelines to customers 
in Orange County. The proposed pipeline would connect to the Allen-McColloch 
pipeline near the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. *

JUDICIAL; MUNICIPAL COURT RACE IS TOO CLOSE TO DECLARE VICTOR; PROSECUTOR CARYL 
LEE LEADS INCUMBENT DAN C. DUTCHER BY 635 VOTES AFTER BITTER CAMPAIGN. ABSENTEE 
BALLOTS COULD TURN TIDE.

<P>
 A municipal judge refused to concede victory to a county prosecutor Wednesday 
in a bitter judicial race that both sides agreed was too close to call until 
the absentee ballots are counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher in Westminster trailed Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Caryl Lee by 635 votes -- or 0.5% -- out of more than 131,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said another 7,000 to 9,000 absentee ballot votes still must be 
counted and could put him over the top. The count is expected to be finished by 
next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a ray of hope," Dutcher said. "If we're not sanguine, we're at least 
optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee predicted her margin will hold, but acknowledged that the race, the only 
contested judicial election in Orange County, was not over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going around getting fitted for robes or anything," Lee said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The registrar of voter's office will officially certify results Nov. 29, said 
assistant registrar of voters Rosalyn Lever. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher, who ran with the support of fellow Orange County judges, said that if 
he loses the seat he has held in Westminster for the past 12 years it will be 
because Lee lied about his record during the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee has been a deputy district attorney for five years and previously was in 
private practice as a civil attorney. She has accused Dutcher of being soft on 
crime, criticizing the judge's handling of a vehicular manslaughter case last 
year where a 13-year-old boy was killed by a hit-and-run drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 A brochure Lee circulated in June claimed that Dutcher sentenced the driver to 
one year of actual jail time, even though Dutcher sentenced him to two years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee acknowledged Wednesday that Dutcher did order a two-year prison sentence 
but said the brochure was not inaccurate because the driver will actually serve 
about 14 months behind bars because of credit for good behavior. He is due to 
be released this week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a judge sentences a criminal, Lee argued, the judge should take into 
account credit for time served that can reduce a criminal's actual time behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher has sued Lee for libel because of the brochure, and on Wednesday said 
that he plans to pursue the lawsuit however the race turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 The nastiness of the contest was difficult to endure at times, said Lee, who 
added that she hopes other judges will treat her professionally if she wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 300 to 400 judicial elections in the last 16 years, only three incumbent 
judges have been defeated, said Presiding Orange County Superior Court Judge 
James L. Smith.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / MEASURE A; EL TORO AIRPORT IS APPARENT WINNER, BUT . . .; 
BACKERS ARE READY FOR ACTION AFTER NARROW VICTORY. HOWEVER, THERE'S NO 
GUARANTEE THAT A LAWSUIT OR PENTAGON PLANS WON'T KILL THE PROJECT.

<P>
 Orange County voters have apparently cleared the runway for a new commercial 
airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, but it is uncertain how soon 
-- if ever -- the plan will take off. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of inconclusive debate and competing ideas for the 4,700-acre 
base scheduled to be closed by 1999, voters stepped in and narrowly approved a 
referendum mandating that the county earmark 2,000 acres for an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 With a winning margin of only 15,103 votes, it is still possible that the 
outcome could change once election officials finish counting about 48,000 
absentee ballots, Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney said. That process may take 
until next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that Tuesday's result will stand, however, airport boosters left no 
doubt what they now expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has spoken," said Newport Beach developer George Argyros, an 
architect of the Measure A referendum, and he expressed confidence that county 
supervisors will follow through. "It is incumbent upon the board to listen to 
what the people said and act accordingly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the future of the military base remains in limbo, and political divisions 
within the county appear likely to persist. One city, Lake Forest, promises to 
sue next week to have the measure declared illegal. The Pentagon said the vote 
would have no effect on what the U.S. government does with the property. 
</P>
<P>
 County politicians also find themselves in a fix, nervous about spiting the 
voters but hopeful of sticking to a planning process for the base's future -- a 
scheme that itself was forged only after months of rancor that, like Measure A, 
largely split Orange County between North and South. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the supervisors will now have to decide what to do with 
the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, the official agency formed in March to 
establish a development plan for the base. The initiative does not require the 
dismantling of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, board members will also have to decide whether the initiative can 
legally force the county to build a commercial airport at El Toro. Earlier this 
year, the supervisors' own attorney advised that the planning agency is free to 
ignore Measure A, approved with 51.1% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is the only one recognized by the Pentagon to submit a reuse plan 
to the U.S. government for converting the Marine base to civilian use. It 
recently received $730,000 in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors will discuss the initiative's mandate at Tuesday's meeting, where 
members will debate several options for implementing the measure and keeping 
the planning process going, said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. One of the 
options calls for the supervisors themselves to assume planning 
responsibilities for the Marine base, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, who supported Measure A, said that "it's a little premature to say 
what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is (the county planning authority) out of the picture now? I can't say right 
now what's going to happen," said Wieder. "There will be several proposals 
before the board next week." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. government is not bound by the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, we're dealing only with the official reuse 
authority created to come up with a reuse plan for the base," the Pentagon's 
Glenn Flood said on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will only consider the recommendations for development presented to us by 
that authority. If they (the authority) want an airport there, we'll consider 
it. But a law requiring an airport there is not binding on the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 The county agency is made up of nine members: the five supervisors, three 
representatives from Irvine and one from Lake Forest. However, the initiative 
calls for a 13-member advisory commission to work with federal, state and local 
agencies and the air cargo industry in developing a commercial airport at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 The county counsel's memo on July 22 does not specifically address the county 
agency's future under Measure A, but it advised County Administrative Officer 
Ernie Schneider that the agency can choose to ignore the initiative if members 
want. So it is possible that the county may have two agencies drafting separate 
development plans for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo said the county agency may also be disbanded upon passage of the 
initiative, if the agency or the supervisors decide to do that.  
</P>
<P>
 Argyros said he is familiar with the county counsel memo and dismissed it as 
self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major sticking point is what to do about Irvine's and Lake Forest's 
roles in the planning process for El Toro. The councils of both cities oppose 
an airport there, and the supervisors will now have to decide whether the two 
municipalities should maintain their roles in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros said airport proponents were forced to put the initiative on the 
ballot because the current county planning authority, which includes Irvine and 
Lake Forest, is biased against the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond said supervisors "have a difficult decision 
to make" but argued that that county cannot legally disband the planning 
authority without the consent of the two cities, which "signed off on the plan 
to create the planning agency." 
</P>
<P>
 "About 300 acres of the Marine base are inside the Irvine city limits," he 
said. "As long as this land is in our city, the county can't arbitrarily do 
things on its own. Sorry, we're part of the process whether anybody likes it or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond called the initiative "in-your-face planning." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they try to exclude Irvine, we can zone those 300 acres for a 50-story 
child-care facility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Patterson, city attorney for Lake Forest, said the city will file a 
lawsuit in Superior Court next week to have Measure A ruled illegal. A judge 
rejected a previous lawsuit by the city in August on grounds that it was 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit polling conducted by The Times shows support for Measure A -- which was 
touted by backers as a way to create jobs and improve the regional economy -- 
was strongest among Republicans, men and voters age 50 and older. It was also 
strong among voters with less than a high school education and those with lower 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals were split on the issue, but among conservatives, 55% voted for it; 
52% of the Republicans supported the measure, contrasted with 49% of the 
Democrats and 48% of independents. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Leisure World retirement community near the airport had voiced 
strong opposition to the airport because it would disrupt their quality of 
life, the poll found that countywide 60% of those age 65 and over backed the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was backed by 51% of those whose income was over $60,000, but it 
was stronger by two points among those with household income under $40,000. A

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; MEDICAL STUDENTS FIRE VOLLEY AT GUN MAKER

<P>
 Fourteen students at UC Irvine's College of Medicine fell to the pavement, one 
by one, during the busy lunch hour on campus Wednesday in a demonstration 
against handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second demonstration in two months aimed by the campus chapter of 
Physicians for Social Responsibility at Bryco Arms Inc. Bryco, located in 
Irvine and Costa Mesa, is the leading U.S. manufacturer of handguns known as 
"Saturday night specials," producing more than 200,000 a year, according to the 
Violence Policy Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryco is not Tyco -- Guns are not Toys," read one of the posters held by 
second-year medical students dressed in white lab coats. Each student was 
"shot" in turn with an orange cap pistol, while other students read news 
accounts of handgun accidents, violence and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryco representatives in Irvine and Costa Mesa could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider guns in the same way we consider virus and bacteria," 
demonstrator Scott Weissman told about 30 students gathered outside the campus 
cafe. "They're all agents of disease and death." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all students were convinced that banning handguns is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is it that going to curtail the proliferation of handguns on the black 
market?" asked Justin Bristol, 22, president of Chi Alpha, a campus Christian 
fellowship group. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert C. Wesley Jr., medical school assistant dean who is co-president of 
the Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility and adviser to 
the UCI campus chapter, said lax gun laws should be of special concern to 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more years of potential life lost from gun violence than from 
cancer, heart disease and diabetes combined," he said, "because most of the 
victims are so youthful."RUSS LOAR

<P>
 Sixty teachers in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa schools will get a total of 54 
grants for projects from the Newport-Mesa Schools Foundation, a foundation 
representative told the school board this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants, averaging $846, will be presented at a breakfast Nov. 29 at the 
Balboa Bay Club.Details of the winning requests will be disclosed at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants totaling $45,664 will go to teachers in a variety of instructional 
areas at 21 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants will go for science projects, computer hardware and software, math 
programs, reading and literature programs, art and music, English and languages 
classes and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers will use the grants to meet needs the district could not fund for the 
current school year. They were required to show that the items requested would 
directly benefit students, improve the learning environment, increase the 
effectiveness of teaching and raise the expectations of teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 191 teachers, some working in teams, turned in 177 grant 
applications seeking a total of $152,223. The average amount requested was 
$860, and foundation spokeswoman Kim Kasell said the foundation tried to keep 
grants to $1,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation is a volunteer support group formed in 1981 to fill funding 
gaps left by Proposition 13 and court decisions that shifted school funding 
sources. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 One day after they were elected, Mayor Tom Daly and Councilmen-elect Lou Lopez 
and Bob Zemel already disagree over how to fill a vacant fifth seat on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth council member, who would serve out the two years remaining on 
Daly's term, may have to be selected by voters if the council cannot agree on a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy was created by the new way of selecting the mayor. The mayor's 
term had been two years and is now four, at large. Daly's reelection leaves his 
council seat vacant with two years remaining. His seat had to remain vacant 
during the election in case he lost the mayor's race, City Clerk Leonora Sohl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he is meeting with community leaders to discuss possible candidates, 
but said budget advisory commission chairwoman Shirley A. McCracken, who 
finished third among 16 candidates, would be a logical choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the third-highest vote-getter, and I feel strongly that the council 
should appoint a woman," Daly said. "I've always been impressed with Shirley's 
abilities and I think she would make an excellent appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he hopes the new council will be able to agree on an appointment in 
order to save citizens the estimated $100,000 it would cost to hold a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council cannot agree on an appointment within 60 days, then a special 
election will automatically be called, Sohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zemel said he doesn't think the vacancy has to be filled by one of the losing 
candidates and said gender and race should not figure into the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the city should hold a special election, despite the expense. GREG

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; COTTAGES MAY REPLACE ROW HOUSES IN DOWNTOWN PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
 Single-family cottages, as opposed to row-style townhouses, would be 
constructed as part of a 50-acre downtown redevelopment project under a plan 
expected to receive final City Council approval Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council tentatively agreed last week to allow Baywood Development Group to 
build 96 detached homes on Ash Street and Walnut and Madrona avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The original 1991 agreement between the city and Baywood called for 
construction of 146 row houses. But that was before the sharp downturn in the 
Southern California townhouse and condominium market. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker and council members Bev Perry and Councilman Burnie 
Dunlap supported the change from townhouses to detached dwellings. Councilman 
Carrey J. Nelson, who owns property near the proposed development, abstained 
from voting. 
</P>
<P>
 The only opposition came from Councilwoman Kathryn E. Wiser, who said the 
switch from townhouses to detached units would result in "a totally different 
project." If such a "drastic change" was approved, the city should allow other 
developers to submit proposals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, Baywood would build homes in folk Victorian and craftsman 
styles, reflective of Brea's architectural heritage from the early 1900s. The 
two-story, three-bedroom homes would range in size from 1,300 to 1,600 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimated selling prices would range from $180,000 to $220,000. Ten percent of 
the homes would be designated as affordable housing units with a maximum of 
$10,000 in assistance. The Brea Redevelopment Agency would receive more than 
$4.2 million for selling the property to Baywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Watt, president of Baywood Development, said his intent is to create an 
urban feel to the residential project. Garages would be situated at the rear of 
the property to help make the units "street friendly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very comfortable with the deal that has been put together," Perry 
said. ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WIFE'S KIDNEY TRANSPLANTED INTO AILING HUSBAND 
</P>

<P>
 Doctors successfully removed a kidney from an Orange County woman Wednesday 
and transplanted it into her husband, a gravely ill diabetic, marking yet 
another milestone in the lives of a Mission Viejo couple whose story has drawn 
national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 With network television cameras taping their every move, doctors operated on 
Victoria Ingram-Curlee, 45, for two hours, then spent another hour preparing 
four arteries in her left kidney for insertion into her husband, Randall 
Curlee, 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Mendez, chairman of the multi-organ transplant team at Sharp 
Memorial Hospital in San Diego, said the actual transplant took 3 1/2 hours -- 
about an hour longer than usual -- because surgeons were surprised to learn 
that Ingram-Curlee's left kidney contained four arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Preoperative procedures had indicated only three, meaning doctors spent 
additional time disconnecting the arteries from the aorta, the main blood 
vessel of the body. Doctors labeled this phase of the surgery "difficult" but 
said it posed no problems for the actual transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Rafael Mendez, Robert Mendez's identical twin and the head of the 
hospital's kidney transplant team, said three of the arteries "came together in 
a single chunk, very, very close to the aorta. But we were able to disconnect 
(the arteries) from the aorta in order to preserve a single opening." MICHAEL

 Police arrested a 36-year-old transient Tuesday after he allegedly fired shots 
at a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio De Jesus was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on 
a police officer and booked in the Huntington Beach City Jail on $50,000 bail, 
according to Lt. Charles R. Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 11 p.m. Monday, Officer John Mauger was driving his 
black-and-white police cruiser north on Jacquelyn Lane, near Slater Avenue, 
when he heard several gunshots. Mauger said his patrol car was hit by two 
bullets near the right rear window. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Mauger immediately left the area and called for assistance. 
Additional officers responded and officers on foot arrested De Jesus in an 
alley east of Jacquelyn Lane. Poe said arresting officers found a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistol in the suspect's waistband, as well as a fully loaded 
ammunition magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not know why the officer was fired upon and are continuing 
to investigate. MARK I. PINSKY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; DEATH PENALTY SOUGHT IN RAPE-MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney has decided to seek the death penalty 
against Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., who is accused of sexually assaulting and 
murdering a 23-year-old Huntington Beach woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was made because of the brutality of the crime and because of 
Morgan's felony record, Assistant Dist. Atty.John Conley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 28, was arrested in May in a small Northern California town where he 
had fled to elude an intensive weeklong manhunt, police said. The hunt was 
launched after the body of Leanora Annette Wong was found in the rear of a 
parking lot near an Orange nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Wong had been raped with a foreign object and suffered severe 
upper body and pelvic injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's defense attorney, Julian Bailey, could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Morgan was linked to the crime by fingerprints, 
witnesses who saw him with Wong -- whom he had met at the nightclub -- and 
other evidence, including videotape from a security camera mounted on a nearby 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The case struck a nerve with many who believe the legal system repeatedly 
failed to protect society against Morgan, who has been accused of raping four 
young Orange County women in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In all but one of the previous cases, the district attorney's office either 
declined to prosecute or allowed Morgan to plead guilty to less serious 
charges. Prosecutors say the credibility of the victims posed a problem in 
those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent case, prosecutors allowed Morgan to be sent back to prison 
for one year for parole violation instead of seeking a rape conviction that 
could have sent him to prison for nearly a decade. Morgan had been released 
after serving his time on the parole violation when Wong was slain. SUSAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MIDWAY CITY; NEW TRASH-COLLECTION SYSTEM TO START SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will be able to separate their trash from recyclable materials more 
efficiently under a new trash-collection program that the Midway City Sanitary 
District will begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Each household will receive a black 100-gallon bin for trash and a blue 
100-gallon container for aluminum cans, newspapers and other recyclable 
materials.Both containers have wheels to make collection easier. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Don Snavely said the program will enable the district to 
recycle more materials and reduce the amount of trash taken to landfills, as 
required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 law requires cities and special districts to reduce by 25% the amount 
of trash taken to dump sites by 1995. By 2000, they must achieve a 50% 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Snavely said trash collected from about 21,250 customers in Midway City, 
Westminster and portions of Garden Grove is taken to materials recovery 
facilities in Stanton and Huntington Beach, where it is sorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents will receive the containers this month to test the program in 
certain areas of the district, Snavely said. Distribution of the containers is 
expected to be completed in January, he said. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; POLLUTION WARNING SIGNS TO BE RE-POSTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signs warning surfers about polluted waters near the mouth of the San Gabriel 
River will again be posted near the popular surfing spot, two months after the 
city took down a similar sign posted by the Surfrider Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the signs will stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The original sign said, "Surf With Caution!" It was removed by the Recreation 
Department because it was not an officially sanctioned sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The city recently ordered replacement signs with identical wording. But the 
new signs will bear the logos of both the city and the Surfrider Foundation. 
Parks and recreation director Andy Seymour expects to post the new signs by 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time the city has included another entity in sharing the logo 
spot on a sign," Seymour said. "The Surfrider Foundation has worked hard 
gathering pollution data and I certainly recognize that their credibility is 
high with those that surf." 
</P>
<P>
 The signs will warn surfers that the San Gabriel River is an outlet for 
thousands of storm drains throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 With the coming of the rainy season, said physician and Surfrider Foundation 
activist Gordon Labedz, the warning signs are critical. Rain washes pollutants 
ranging from pesticides to paint thinner into the San Gabriel River. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much pavement in Los Angeles that nothing soaks into the ground," 
said Labedz, a Seal Beach resident who gets up at dawn most mornings to surf. 
"Everything comes into our storm drains and dumps out into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a light drizzle on Saturday produced bacteria levels in waters off Seal 
Beach that exceeded safety limits, according to county health officials. The 
city and the Surfrider Foundation recommend that surfers wait 72 hours after 
even small amounts of rain before entering local waters. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; DAMAGED WALL'S FATE MAY REST WITH CITIZENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officials of the Rossmoor Community Services District said Wednesday that 
efforts to preserve the Rossmoor perimeter wall now depend on private citizens, 
since voters rejected a proposed special tax to pay for the wall's upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, it's a dead issue," said Bill Sheldon, the 
district's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Final unofficial returns from Tuesday's election indicated that the tax 
initiative, Measure L, failed to muster the required two-thirds majority, 
garnering 64.3% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure sought to impose a $15 annual tax on property owners here for 16 
years to pay for repair and maintenance of the 37-year-old red brick wall, 
which was damaged by an earthquake two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion initiative, Measure K, which would have authorized the district to 
expand its duties to include repair and maintenance of the wall, received 66.4% 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-thirds vote was not necessary for Measure K to pass, but since it can't 
take effect without Measure L, both measures are considered to have failed, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure what will happen now," said John Hunt, president of the 
five-member board that oversees this unincorporated area near Seal Beach. 
"Maybe there will be some lawsuits (to determine who will be responsible for 
the wall.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/2-mile wall, built in 1957, is considered a community treasure that 
the Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. wants to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 But since a 100-foot section toppled during the 1992 Landers earthquake, the 
wall has become a hazard. Another 20-foot section crumbled about two months 
ago. Neither of the damaged portions has been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Several public agencies, including the county, have declined to repair the 
wall, which prompted the district to let voters decide through the ballot. BERT

 Stephen L. Woods, 17, died Nov. 9, 1993, three weeks after two groups of high

 The suit, filed by Kathy Woods, charges nine people with responsibility for 
her son's death, including Juan Enriquez Alcocer, 20, Hector Gutierrez 
Penuelas, 17, and Julio Perez Bonilla, 18, who have been convicted of 
second-degree murder and related charges for Woods' death. The suit also names

LOCAL ELECTIONS / DANA POINT MEASURES C AND D; VOTERS WANT HEADLANDS COAST KEPT 
CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $500-million luxury resort planned for a cherished piece of Orange County's 
coastline was handily defeated in Tuesday's election, largely because of a 
grass-roots organization that was vastly outspent during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Dana Point voters rejected Measure C and Measure D 55% to 45%, 
some partisans called it a victory for the people. Others chalked it up to poor 
timing by the developer of the 121-acre Headlands property, one of the last 
open areas on the county's coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others suggested the decisive vote mirrored a nationwide trend -- a 
repudiation of government, in this case the small-town City Council that had 
supported the development plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, the Headlands were "saved," in the words of jubilant foes 
of development who spent only about $6,600 compared to the $180,000 poured into 
the campaign by the landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Lachner, a local attorney and a member of the Dana Point group Save 
the Headlands, said Wednesday the Headlands struck a nerve with many voters 
because it symbolized South County's heavy development and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, owners of the Headlands were tight-lipped Wednesday about their 
next step but did not rule out a possible lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still private property. We have a constitutional right to use it and 
we'll be exploring just how those rights can be exercised," said a disappointed 
Dan Daniels, president of Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co., one of the 
Headlands' two owners.  
</P>
<P>
 The other owner of the Headlands is Chandis Securities Co., a firm that 
oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family. Chandis Securities is a 
major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the people of Dana Point lost a lot of opportunities yesterday," 
Daniels said. "They could have had 40-plus acres of open space at no charge. I 
don't think they'll be seeing that again." 
</P>
<P>
 The development plan included a 400-room hotel and 370 homes and had been 
crafted over a long series of public hearings before the council approved the 
plan last April. But residents launched a petition campaign that put Measure C 
and Measure D on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two referendums on the ballot because the council had approved the 
development plan in two separate actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said the plan was caught in a Catch-22 over the hotel, which he and 
many city residents did not want but was favored by the California Coastal 
Commission and the council, the two governmental agencies with jurisdiction 
over the project. The commission demanded a hotel to open the land to the 
public while the city wanted the bed tax revenues a hotel would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Save the Headlands group, however, played heavily on the idea that the 
hotel would generate traffic and bring in hundreds of low-income workers to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the hotel was the No. 1 reason (we lost)," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also a casualty of the election's outcome was the Dana Point Headlands 
Conservancy's option to buy seven prime acres of the Headlands -- including 
habitat for the endangered California gnatcatcher and the Pacific pocket mouse. 
The option hinged on the passage of the two measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the seven acres, the landowners had agreed to give the city additional 
acreage for public parks and hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Derith Madden, president of the conservancy, acknowledged Wednesday that the 
group is in disarray because members include those who also belong to Save the 
Headlands, which fought against passage of the two measures and criticized the 
conservancy's board for dealing with the landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody needs some time to regroup," Madden said, noting a 
conservancy event Saturday was canceled because of the discord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We woke up this morning and realized we don't have a deal, but that doesn't 
mean it's all over for us," Madden said. "With or without a deal, we still need 
to look at that land and purchase it somehow."

 A young man apparently under the influence of drugs was shot to death by Los 
Alamitos police Wednesday after an early morning rampage that culminated when 
he broke into a house and assaulted a woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred just moments after the suspect escaped from a nearby 
hospital, where police had taken him for treatment of a possible drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is scary," said Mac Najara, a neighbor who said he was too upset to go 
to work after the incident. "We've never had any problems like this. It bothers 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man was identified as Michael Brown, 19, of Los Alamitos. The woman 
he allegedly struck in the face and head was taken to a nearby hospital, where 
she was treated for minor facial injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
 According the Orange County Sheriff's Department, which is investigating the 
shooting, the sequence of events that led to Brown's death began at 3:45 a.m. 
when his mother, with whom he lived on Green Avenue, called 911 to report that 
her son was acting irrationally, possibly as the result of a drug overdose or 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the call, a team of paramedics determined that Brown required a 
mental health evaluation and took him to the Los Alamitos Medical Center. Two 
police officers who accompanied him to the hospital stayed a short time and 
then left. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later, according to Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini, police were 
summoned to the hospital, where Brown was reported to be "creating a 
disturbance" that could not be controlled. Officers, however, succeeded in 
calming him, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 a.m. they were summoned again after Brown, apparently agitated by the 
arrival of his mother, left the hospital against the advice of its staff, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, Brown was seen by patrol officers on Reagan Street about 
two blocks from the hospital where, after unsuccessfully trying to break into 
three houses, he kicked in the rear door of a fourth house occupied by a couple 
and their 15-year-old son, Martini said. After ransacking the kitchen, Brown 
hit the woman in the head and face, then retreated into a bathroom just as 
three police officers arrived, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown emerged from the bathroom wielding a pair of eight-inch scissors over 
his head as if to attack the officers, Martini said. Officers ordered him 
several times to drop the scissors, and when he lunged at them he was shot 
twice in the chest, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point it was just a matter of survival," Martini said. "I mean this 
guy was going at the officer holding a weapon. And the officer's intent was 
clearly to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Alamitos Police Department would not comment on the 
case, referring all calls to Martini, who said the Sheriff's Department is 
conducting a routine investigation of the shooting for the Los Alamitos Police 
Department because it involved police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The three officers involved have been placed on three-day administrative leave 
pending completion of the inquiry, in keeping with departmental policy, Martini 
said. He would not identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something very traumatic for the officers and for everyone involved," 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the apartment complex where Brown lived, relatives remained secluded. "This 
is a family tragedy," said a man answering the door who would not give his 
name. "It's our family tragedy. This isn't the time to talk."

 A survey of parents in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District shows 
that most are happy with the school district and would give their child's 
school an A or a B. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials sent a 23-question survey to every family in the district 
last spring.Of about 15,000 surveys mailed, 5,700 were returned, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the respondents gave the schools an A or B grade, with 
another 14% saying the schools are doing just a satisfactory job. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were also asked to respond to questions about school and staff 
performance, academic standards and schools' relationships with families.

O.C. POP BEAT; TO HELL AND BACK

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a fairly juicy story of rock 'n' roll decadence that Jeff Drake has to 
tell, and as he sits in a cheap neighborhood restaurant in Anaheim, unreeling 
it forthrightly over a plate of Mexican seafood, a grin sometimes plays across 
his full lips. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the tragicomic tale of the Joneses, a raunch-rocking Orange County/Los 
Angeles band that seemed like a comer on the Hollywood club scene in the 
mid-'80s as it freely copped musical styles and bad-boy attitudes from the 
Stones, the Ramones and the New York Dolls. The Joneses drew crowds and press 
attention with catchy, hell-bound songs about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll that 
Drake sang in a bratty drawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Oval-faced and apple-cheeked under a thick haystack of dyed-black hair, Drake, 
at 33, doesn't show many outward signs of having spent a decade living the life 
he sang about. Recounting the history of the Joneses in a soft, nasal, deadpan 
voice, he puts a comical spin on a saga that is part Spinal Tap and part 
William S. Burroughs, with gross-out interludes worthy of Ren & Stimpy. A touch 
of Willie Sutton is reserved for the farcical climax. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Drake doesn't gloat about behavior that he thought was glamorous at the time, 
but he isn't ashamed of it, either. He freely confesses to an eager passion for 
heroin that eventually came to rule his life, and he has no qualms about 
discussing every detail he can remember of the afternoon when, in a junkie's 
panic, he made a spur-of-the-moment decision to rob a bank. The police collared 
him easily within an hour or two, and he spent 2 1/2 years in federal custody 
for unarmed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 As it worked out, Drake says now, botching a bank robbery was one of the 
luckiest things he ever did. Had he been cut out for crime, he might not have 
lived to add another chapter to the Joneses' story -- one in which the music is 
as raunchy as ever, but the only shot he craves is a shot at a record deal for 
the recently re-formed band. 
</P>
<P>
 A dinner interview with Drake is not for the weak of stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the stories that are coming to mind are vomiting stories," he says with a 
smile when it becomes obvious that this is a common thread running through 
Joneses lore. Drake's heroin sickness tended to manifest itself at inopportune 
moments -- such as the time a couple of road-tripping Joneses fans arrived in 
L.A. from Tulsa, Okla., only to have him heave a noxious greeting at their 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage dental distress is another motif: Drake says that as his addiction 
worsened, he had a chronic problem with a loose dental crown that would come 
flying out of his mouth as he sang. Drake, whose drug budget didn't leave much 
for dental care, would have to stop the show and ask fans to help him scrounge 
for the lost crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point where I would take it out of my mouth and put it in my 
pocket when we were playing," he says. One benefit of prison was the full set 
of dentures he now sports, replacing the teeth he lost in his drug days. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his keen interest in drugs took hold during his childhood, around the 
same time he was developing a fondness for stripped-down, hard-driving rock 'n' 
roll. The oldest of three children (his younger brother Scott sings in the 
Humpers), Drake spent his early years in Anaheim and Irvine. He says he was 
only 9 when his second cousin's death from a drug overdose made a deep 
impression on him: For some reason, he says, it didn't repel him but, rather, 
planted a fascination with the idea of taking heroin that he would act on 
readily years later when he finally got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 When Drake was 12, his parents -- rock-loving record collectors who brought 
the music of Chuck Berry, the Beatles and the Doors into the house -- moved the 
family to Merced, a farming community in Central California. There, Drake 
became enthralled with his key influence, the New York Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was struck by early punk rock, which encouraged him to start banging 
on a guitar and writing songs of his own. He says such prophetically titled 
staples of the Joneses' repertoire as "Pill Box" and "Criminals" first were 
played by his high school band, named Slider after an album by the British 
glam-rock band T-Rex. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1981, he was back in Orange County, looking to get into a band. After 
playing together in a rockabilly group, Drake and bassist Steve Olson launched 
the Joneses. Drake became the singer because nobody else in the band wanted the 
job. Olson came up with the name. He wasn't thinking of the street meaning of 
jones as a term for a drug craving, but Drake certainly was -- and loving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the Joneses started -- Drake, who had been into pot, pills and 
alcohol since the age of 12 or 13 -- got his first taste of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This English guy was hanging around the band and was trying to manage us," he 
recalls. "I'd picked him up in Huntington Beach, and we were driving to a 
rehearsal in Garden Grove, and he said, 'Hey, pull over -- you want to do some 
heroin?' He put it on the corner of a credit card, and I snorted it. I was 
still high the next morning when I woke up. Everything I thought about it was 
validated. I thought, 'This is what I want.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Drake had been primed for the moment: "Keith Richards, Johnny Thunders -- 
everyone I thought was really cool was a heroin addict. When you're a 
teen-ager, you don't think you're cool, and I thought it would make me cool. 
When you're that age, adult credibility is zero, so you don't believe what they 
tell you (about the dangers of hard drugs). The warning signals were there, but 
I just put my foot down on the accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I was 23 (about 2 1/2 years later) that I had the heroin 
sickness and knew what it really was. I did it every chance I got. As the band 
got more popular, I had money, and people wanted to hang out and buy it for me. 
So I was doing it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, the Joneses were a hot item in Hollywood, drawing good crowds and 
landing a feature write-up that declared them "one of L.A.'s most talked-about 
practitioners of no-holds-barred garage rock." The band had gone on two 
do-it-yourself national tours, released a self-financed EP and had its songs 
featured on a couple of Southern California punk-rock compilations. 
</P>
<P>
 It also had begun a pattern of frequent lineup changes: Drake, the only 
constant figure in the band, estimates that 20 to 30 different musicians have 
played with him in the Joneses. Not all shared his drug habit, but enough did 
to make the band a model of instability even at its height. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake says that "the drugs had a lot to do with" the personality clashes that 
led to the revolving-door lineup. "Especially on heroin, you have these 
egotistical episodes where you think you're like God on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, he thinks that even if the Joneses had landed a major record 
deal at their peak, they wouldn't have been able to capitalize on it. "By that 
time (the mid-'80s), the drugs had become such a problem it would have screwed 
things up anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why (record companies) stayed away from us. We had a reputation for 
drugs and an outlaw lifestyle. Which is funny, because not long after that, 
they snapped up Guns N' Roses and L.A. Guns. They didn't sound like us, but as 
far as the image and posture they assumed, they were influenced by what we were 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Nation, the Joneses' lead guitarist in 1985-86, says he once got a call 
from Axl Rose, who wanted the Joneses to come to one of his band's gigs and let 
him know what they thought. After that, the Joneses played on some bills with 
the still-emerging Guns N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the Joneses finally put out an album, "Keeping Up With the Joneses" 
-- the first album released by Doctor Dream Records, which went on to become 
Orange County's best-established independent-alternative rock label. The album 
won good notices but had a miserable fate: Soon after its release, Greenworld, 
the distributor that Doctor Dream relied upon, went bankrupt and the Joneses 
hardly found their way into the marketplace. A discouraged Drake dropped out of 
rock 'n' roll for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joneses returned in 1989 with a raucous EP on an even-smaller label, 
Trigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brick Wahl, Trigon's manager at the time, recalls: "It could have been a good 
step back for those guys, but you got the impression that Jeff was really 
having problems adjusting to the idea of starting from scratch. The only way 
you were going to make it work was to play constantly, and Jeff had already 
done that. He'd been doing this rock 'n' roll paying-his-dues thing for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake says he was in no condition to mount any kind of bootstraps campaign for 
his flagging rock career: "By that time I was completely incapacitated by 
heroin. I had to be loaded every minute or I was sick. I had no business being 
a musician at that point. I could barely function as a drug addict, let alone 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first week of 1990, though, he made a small killing off his band: A 
group from Boston, also called the Joneses, was about to release an album for 
Atlantic, and Drake extracted a big settlement in return for dropping any claim 
to the Joneses name (under the settlement, the financial terms of which he says 
he agreed not to disclose, Drake renamed his band the Hollywood Joneses). Drake 
bought a 1968 Ford Mustang and went on a $200-a-day heroin binge. By the end of 
the month, he says, he had blown all the settlement money -- a bigger sum than 
he ever had seen in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The junkie business ended suddenly on April 12, 1991. It was a Friday, and 
Drake had spent his last money on bus fare to a clinic in Santa Ana, where he 
hoped to get a dose of methadone to quell oncoming heroin sickness. The doctor 
wasn't there; Drake says he was told to come back the following Monday. He 
trudged back to Anaheim on foot, resolving to beg his dealers for drugs on 
credit. He stopped to rest on a bus bench on Anaheim Boulevard, then realized 
he was sitting in front of a First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake says he had never stolen to feed his habit. Drawing on holdup tactics 
he'd picked up listening to a couple of drug-dealing robbers he knew, he walked 
into the bank and scrawled, "This is a robbery, give me the money" on a 
withdrawal slip. "The teller looked at me kind of incredulously, and I said, 
'C'mon, I'm serious, and I'm in a hurry.' She just piled a bunch of money on 
the counter, and I shoved it in the crotch of my pants." 
</P>
<P>
 He scrambled across Anaheim Boulevard, dodging cars. He discarded his baseball 
cap and leather jacket and made his way to his dealers' house, where he bought 
a gram of heroin. They shooed him away, and he retreated to the bathroom of a 
McDonald's for his fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he says, he went to a convenience store for a hot dog, soda and 
cigarettes. The police arrived soon after, responding to an electronic signal 
sent out by a tiny transponder attached to one of the stolen bills. The cash 
was still in his pants crotch; Drake says he never did count it all but found 
out later that he had made off with $3,050. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hellish 12 days in jail ("the sickness was overwhelming; I just wanted 
to die and get it over with") he was allowed to stay in a drug treatment 
facility while awaiting disposition of his case. He pleaded guilty to unarmed 
robbery and was sentenced to 33 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought it was the worst thing that happened to me, but in time I 
realized I was happy I wasn't a drug addict anymore and I wasn't dead. By the 
time I got out of prison, I realized it was the best thing that could have 
happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He says his hitches in federal prisons in San Diego and at Boron in the Mojave 
Desert were uneventful, filled mainly with reading and watching sports on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Boron, they had electric guitars and amps and drums in the recreation 
department, and a rehearsal room," Drake says. "I had a band called the Sand 
Crabs. We did a couple of Joneses songs and punk covers. We weren't very 
popular." 
</P>
<P>
 He seldom had access to a guitar after he was transferred to San Diego, a 
high-security prison where, he says, he was sent not for misbehavior but 
because the facility needed some tractable inmates who could be trusted to do 
cleanup work outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison did not bring out the songwriter in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried, but the stuff I was coming up with was just crap," he says. "It was 
real negative, whining about being in prison, and I threw it all away. Most of 
the songs I write are about real-life experience. In there I was shut off. It 
was the same thing every day." 
</P>
<P>
 He completed the last few months of his sentence in a halfway house and was 
given an early release in September, 1993. He has worked steadily in 
white-collar sales and service jobs and now lives in Pasadena with his 
girlfriend, Laurie, a petite, sweet-natured woman whose sister is married to 
Mike Occhiato, the Joneses' bassist. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Drake returned to rock 'n' roll, as the Joneses' original recording 
lineup reunited briefly to play a few club dates. By July, he had put together 
a new version of the band that he hopes can make the sustained bid for success 
that his '80s bands were in no condition to muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Occhiato, guitarist Nation and piano player Greg Kuehn, all veterans of 
previous stints with Drake, are in the band along with a new drummer, Byron 
Reynolds. They started playing shows in September and plan to record five new 
songs to be released on CD along with some older material. Honoring the 
agreement he struck in 1990, Drake says he will call the band Hollywood Joneses 
for recording purposes; for now, they are gigging under their original name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Drake's life has hardly been smooth since his release from prison. He was 
banged up in two car accidents and has been embroiled in messy child support 
and visitation-rights proceedings with the mother of a 5-year-old boy he 
fathered in a brief liaison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Laurie used to tell me," Drake says lightly, "my life is like a 
miniseries." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I talk to him it's something else," Nation, who is serving his 
third or fourth hitch in the Joneses, said in a separate interview. "It never 
seems to end, but somehow he works his way through it. He keeps his head up and 
deals with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more positive than I've ever seen him. He used to get in funks, just 
seem dead to the world. But every time I've talked to him he's been in a good 
mood and (had) high energy. He knows he had a real bad thing going there, and 
now it's good again." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got work, I've got the band, I've got Laurie -- the kinds of things 
people normally have in their lives," Drake says of the new chapter he is 
trying to write. "My short-term goals are to keep this band together, put out 
something (independently) and get a record deal. My long-term goal is to 
support myself playing music. I'd still like to give it one more shot." 
</P>

THESE TEACHERS ARE MUSIC TO STUDENTS' EARS; YOUNG JAZZMEN REDMAN AND SALVATORE 
INSPIRE MASTER CLASS WITH THEIR INSIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Who's the teacher here?" whispered a surprised listener who casually wandered 
into a Master Class at USC's Bovard Auditorium Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a little hard to tell. On stage, young jazz tenor saxophone whiz Joshua 
Redman, 22, and even younger jazz piano prodigy Sergio Salvatore, 13, were 
offering bits and pieces of professional advice to a few hundred university and 
high school students. The atmosphere was warm and friendly -- at times jovial 
and lighthearted -- from an audience that saw nothing unusual about a 
pedagogical interaction with artists of their own, or perhaps a younger, 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the questions and answers were direct and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think is the most important thing about your music?" asked one 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 For Redman, a 1991 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Harvard, the university 
environment was not unfamiliar, even though his role in it was very new. 
Thoughtful and articulate, he pondered for a moment, holding his tenor 
saxophone in one hand as he propped a foot up on the conductor's podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me," he finally replied, "it's communication. That's what I think music is 
about. Whenever I step up to play, I'm trying to express myself, sure, but I'm 
trying to express myself to the people who are out there in the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salvatore, dark-haired and long-legged, with the somewhat gawky look of a 
rapidly growing teen-ager, agreed. Still a junior high school student, his 
responses were a bit less detailed than Redman's, but no less thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Josh is right," Salvatore said. "I don't think about it too much 
while I'm playing, but I like to know that I'm connecting with the listeners." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman and Salvatore had opened the session with two easygoing jazz tunes, 
quickly establishing their musical credentials. As the class continued, they 
alternated question-and-answer segments with brief demonstrations of 
improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about your solos?" asked another student after both players had zipped 
through a medium tempo blues. "How do you approach them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a map," Salvatore answered. "You have to find your way 
around the scales and see how they move. Improvising is like you know where you 
are, but you can go other places, because you have this destination in mind. 
And if you know where you are in the tune, then you can take a lot of different 
routes to get where you're going." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman, smiling at his younger colleague's eloquence, nodded agreement before 
adding his own response. 
</P>
<P>
 "With improvisation," he said, "I think there's a fine line between being 
authoritative and obvious. I like to see one continuous stream from beginning 
to end in an improvisation -- not just a sampling of what somebody can do in a 
solo. Some solos sound like the player's trying to fit as much as they can do 
into every chorus. But to me, each solo is a different narrative, with a line 
that runs from beginning to end." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that hard to do?" asked another student. 
</P>
<P>
 "You better believe it," Redman responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC Master Class was one part of a full day of events at Bovard 
Auditorium. Earlier, Redman and Salvatore had performed as soloists with the 
American Jazz Philharmonic at a morning concert for 1,700 students bused in 
from the Los Angeles Unified School District. In the evening, the philharmonic 
event was repeated for a free community concert.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The program, conducted by Jack Elliott, the ensemble's permanent music 
director and principal guiding light, included works by Henry Mancini and Dave 
Grusin, as well as the West Coast premiere of "3 Shades of Blue," a work for 
saxophone and orchestra composed by John Clayton. The crowd was active, 
enthusiastic and, at times, in Redman's description, "boisterous." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat restless during the music's quieter passages, the young listeners 
came to life with Redman's funky, audience-arousing cadenzas in the Clayton 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, that Josh Redman is too cool," said one student, bobbing her head in 
rhythm and shouting encouragement as the saxophonist dug into a sequence of 
alternating honks and high notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids really get into it," said Elliott after the concert. "We've seen 
quiet audiences, and we've seen loud ones. But either way, they've all been 
enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong event was part of a 12-week schedule of performances by 24 
Grammy-winning artists in 10 cities for the second annual American Express Gold 
Card Grammy Festival. Among the many artists appearing in Atlanta, Boston, 
Chicago, Dallas and elsewhere were Van Cliburn, Kenny Rogers, Vince Gill, 
Indigo Girls and Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Redman-Salvatore Master Class continued, and teachers and students 
became more relaxed, the questioning turned toward more personal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you like to have Branford Marsalis' gig on the 'Tonight Show'?" asked 
one student of Redman. 
</P>
<P>
 "An emphatic 'no' on that one," he replied. "That's not to say the money 
wouldn't be nice. I grew up very poor, but I'm making a good living doing what 
I love to do, and that's enough for right now. Sure, if somebody handed me that 
money Branford's making to continue doing what I'm doing now, I'd say, 'great.' 
But nobody's going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a question directed at Salvatore: "How does it feel to be so young, 
and be playing with much older musicians?" 
</P>
<P>
 Salvatore laughed, then shrugged, "Well, the only time it's really a problem 
is when we have to pick out what tune to play. I mean, you have to remember 
that I don't have a third or even a fourth as much experience as some of the 
guys I play with. So I just don't have that large a repertoire." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As if in confirmation, the duo decided to do another tune. After choosing 
"Autumn Leaves," Redman kicked off the theme, only to have Salvatore respond in 
a totally different key. Players and audience broke up in laughter. After a 
hurried conference to determine the appropriate key, Redman finally said, "Just 
go ahead and start. I'll find it." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did. When the piece ended, Redman was asked how he had made such a 
quick shift of gears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to let thinking get in the way of the music," he replied. 
"Usually, if I can hear it, I can play it, so I don't give much thought to keys 
and structure, and so forth. I just try to let the music happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Master Class came to a close as a final questioner asked how Salvatore, an 
eighth-grader at his home in New Jersey, managed to keep up with his studies 
while he was on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on up to my room," the young pianist replied, "and I'll show you an 
80-pound backpack filled with books. I've got more than enough schoolwork to 
keep me busy until I get back to school." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fitting conclusion for an event that was as much about education, 
interaction and communication as it was about music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so sure about all this," Redman had said shortly before the class 
began. "I'm really just a beginner. And I'm not sure I feel comfortable 
teaching people about music. Especially since many of them are my age, or even 
older." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the class was over, the youthful Redman and Salvatore had 
illustrated, verbally and in performance, that talent and imagination have 
nothing to do with age, and that teaching can take place in many different 
ways.

TECHNO-ARTISTS 'TOONING UP; 'REBOOT' IS FIRST SERIES TO BE FULLY COMPUTERIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ian Pearson first dreamed of creating a computer-animated television 
show, his best effort wound up looking like a very long video game. The 
characters were blocky, their movements were stilted and the color was severely 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, the spellbinding animation of "Reboot," TV's first fully 
computer-animated series, evokes a lush world of dense color and 
three-dimensional movement.  
</P>
<P>
 Animation experts say ABC's new Saturday morning children's show is sparking 
visions of a new entertainment medium -- one not using actors or drawn by hand 
but rather developed completely inside a computer. Plans are in the works, 
these boosters say, for computer-animated feature films and an increase in the 
use of computers for animating special effects in both film and television. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what everyone has been talking about doing and wishing they could do 
for the last several years," said Mason Core, a Los Angeles-based computer 
animator who works mostly on industrial films and videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tremendous expense and snags encountered by Pearson and his partners 
-- the series has been off the air for the past few weeks because they fell 
behind in the production schedule -- raise questions about the medium's 
viability, at least in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 In its potential for pushing the envelope or winding up merely as an 
astoundingly expensive novelty, "Reboot," whose first season of 13 episodes 
cost $10 million to produce, reflects the current state of computer animation 
in film and television: It's a field whose great expectations and wild growth 
have techno-artists rubbing their hands with glee -- and financial executives 
scratching their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone's got to start it -- someone's got to take that risk," said Jennie 
Trias, president of ABC Children's Entertainment. "I hope it works out for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the network would not release exact figures, ABC paid "more than 
double the cost of a high-end priced Saturday morning show" for the right to 
air "Reboot" in the United States, Trias said. The series is set inside a 
computer, where bad guys in the form of computer viruses battle the good 
residents of a town called Mainframe. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs include the purchase of computers -- which ran to $5 million of the 
first season's budget, according to Pearson -- retraining animators to work 
with computers and a huge investment of time. It took an entire day, for 
example, to put sound behind an eight-minute sequence, Pearson said. And that 
was a tremendous leap forward from earlier versions of the technology, which 
would have required a whole day to animate a sequence that lasted just a few 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so expensive, the Vancouver-based Pearson said, that until he got the 
backing of a major entertainment company, he wasn't able to purchase any 
equipment and had resorted to making two-minute demonstration sequences on 
borrowed computers. Limelight Productions, meanwhile, which funded the initial 
effort, was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and acquired by 
Toronto-based Alliance Communications. At the time, industry experts speculated 
that the high cost of producing "Reboot" might have contributed to Limelight's 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that cost, said Seth Levinson, vice president of management information 
systems for DIC Entertainment, one of the largest producers of children's 
animated television shows, that will keep computer animation's influence 
limited in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional animation companies do use computers, he said, but only to enhance 
pen-and-ink work. For example, he said, computers are sometimes used to add 
color once an animator has drawn the outlines of a cartoon. Or computers are 
used to save money by filling in the frames between hand-drawn cels. 
</P>
<P>
 Few -- if any -- in the industry expect computer-generated animation to 
replace traditional cartoons. But the technology has already found its way into 
impressive sequences in feature films: Many of the special effects in "Jurassic 
Park" were computer generated, as was the stampede scene in "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 And enthusiasts say full-length computer-animated features are not far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an entirely new medium," said John Wright, president of Viewpoint 
Datalabs, which operates a catalogue of stock images that computer animators 
can buy for use in commercials and other works. Computer imagery, he said, is 
forming a rising tide that will exist alongside traditional animation but not 
replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a different tool, and it has its own quirks and its own strengths," 
said DIC's Levinson. Computer animation is great at creating photorealism, 
camera zooms and morphing, Levinson said. It's less successful at creating 
characters, he said, who still can look "robotic" and too perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology is developing so fast that "Reboot" has an entirely different 
look now than when it was accepted by ABC just two years ago. At that time, 
Bob, the main character, had the jerky movements and two-dimensional look 
commonly associated with computer-generated graphics. Now, aside from being 
bright blue -- a change that was based more on creative and multicultural 
concerns than technology -- Bob is three-dimensional and moves like the 
combination real person and super-hero he is meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the first few episodes in September look different from the ones to come 
as the series returns this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first three or four episodes," Pearson said, "were the equivalent of 
'Steamboat Willie' " -- the first Walt Disney cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, ABC says, audience response has been good, with the show ranking in 
the top 10 among children ages 2 to 11, its target audience. The show is also 
airing in Canada, and in January will be seen during prime time in England. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool," said William, a third-grader at Western Avenue Elementary School 
in Los Angeles, after being shown a tape of "Reboot" with his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It moves in a way that people can't move," observed Relyn, one of William's 
classmates. "It's creative." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's Trias said the network was willing to spend big money for "Reboot" to 
catch the eye of kids such as these while they are channel surfing. The network 
already has renewed the show for another season. 
</P>
<P>
 Implicit in ABC's support is the hope that the cost will go down -- and, 
indeed, now that Pearson has purchased his computers, half the cost of the 
first season will be eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've upped the ante," says Pearson, who is ready to tackle a feature 
film on computer. "I think people are going to have to try a little harder from 
now on." 
</P>
<P>
 And someday, computer boosters say, the cost of the whole process will drop 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real next shift," said Wright of Viewpoint Datalabs, "is for people to 
create the entire animation of (a show like) 'Reboot' in their basements." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Reboot" returns at 7:30 a.m. Saturday on ABC (Channels 7, 3 and 10).

'NYPD' FIGURE TRIES TO CLARIFY RACE REMARKS; TELEVISION: SERIES CO-CREATOR 
MILCH SAYS HIS COMMENTS WERE MEANT TO 'DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF WRITING AND NOT 
A STATEMENT OF POLITICAL OR SOCIAL VALUES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" has often been praised for its bluntness and honesty in dealing 
with racial issues, and the show's co-creator, David Milch, has earned several 
awards for writing that has been described as enlightened, entertaining and 
thought-provoking. 
</P>
<P>
 However, racially tinged comments that Milch made at a recent writers' 
workshop have caused him and the ABC show's other creator and executive 
producer, Steven Bochco, to issue statements in an effort to clarify Milch's 
remarks and, perhaps, to ward off any possible protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking Oct. 15 at a seminar titled "Human Values in Entertainment Writing: 
The Challenges and the Pitfalls," Milch said that he was able to write about 
the racism of one of the show's main characters because "I'm racist." Speaking 
of his empathy for Dennis Franz's character, he said "(Det. Andy) Sipowicz is a 
character for whom I feel an emotional affinity." 
</P>
<P>
 Milch also said that he held a seminar for 30 writers some years ago, and 
while some of them were successful in the industry, "none of them were black. 
None of the black writing was any good." He added that he didn't believe in 
affirmative action for writers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said, "Jews tend to do very well in this business . . . because Jews 
experience a typical emotional doubleness in relation to the dominant culture, 
which is that they are both inside and outside it . . . A black has to 
experience more anger and self-division in order to achieve the kind of 
emotional neutrality that you need to write about the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar, held at a church in Westwood, was sponsored by the Human Family 
Educational and Cultural Institute, which bestows the coveted Humanitas Award, 
given annually for television writing "that enriches and enlightens." Milch has 
won the award three times, including once for his writing of an "NYPD Blue" 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Milch's workshop comments were reported Friday in the Washington Post, which 
was provided a tape of the daylong seminar. Although there was no immediate 
uproar over the comments after the meeting or after publication of the article, 
Milch and Bochco both issued statements stressing their commitment to diversity 
and apologizing to those who may have been offended by the remarks. Milch said 
his quotes were misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seminar I gave was an attempt to describe the process of writing and not 
a statement of political or social values," said Milch in his statement. "Even 
though my comments were distorted and taken out of context, I apologize to 
anyone who now interprets them as offensive or hurtful. I have never conducted 
business in a racist manner, and Steven Bochco and I remain committed to 
finding qualified writers, minority or otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Milch declined further comment on Wednesday, but told Newsday one day prior: 
"There's an awful lot I'd like to say, but the most prudent thing is to let it 
die off." 
</P>
<P>
 Milch's comments initially drew an angry response from series co-star Jim 
McDaniel, according to Newsday's Wednesday article. McDaniel, who is black, 
plays Lt. Arthur Fancy in the popular drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor said he confronted Milch after he read the article, and the two held 
lengthy meetings over the weekend. McDaniel said after the meetings that he 
believed Milch was quoted out of context. Also, McDaniel said that Milch has 
agreed to look at the work of several of McDaniel's friends who are black 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklyn Ajaye, a veteran writer and comedian who attended the seminar, said 
that he was not offended by Milch's statements: "There was not a whole lot of 
fury in the room. I'm all for candor, not for this political correctness B.S. 
Plus I know David and his work on that show. They have done good work on racial 
issues on that drama. They've handled those issues with integrity. I wish some 
liberal writers could write that well."

TRYING TO KEEP TIME IN LEAN TIMES; MUSIC: THE L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA HAS CUT 
BACK THE NUMBER OF 1994-95 PERFORMANCES AND WORKED OUT A PLAN WITH CREDITORS 
AND MUSICIANS TO REDUCE ITS DEBTS.

 It was hardly the 25th-anniversary celebration anyone expected for the 
prestigious Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Adversely affected by everything from the riots and earthquake to a tough 
economy, last season the orchestra canceled concerts and pleaded poverty to its 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 As the orchestra starts its scaled-back 26th season tonight at Wadsworth 
Theater (repeated Sunday at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena) with violinist 
Iona Brown conducting works by Handel, Bach, Mozart and Gorecki, the backstage 
orchestrating has also been impressive. "What we have done is effectively gone 
to our creditors and worked out a plan of reorganization much as a court would 
work out for us," says longtime board member, businessman Nicholas Ciriello. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra had more than 100 creditors, Ciriello says. Some, including 
state taxing authorities, are being paid off over time, while still others are 
receiving 25 cents on the dollar. Some, too, have agreed to forgive the debt 
entirely, and by June 30, the orchestra had more than $350,000 of its debt 
forgiven, most of that by one major creditor, whose identity LACO declined to 
disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 LACO's operating budget this season is $2.4 million, down from about $3.2 
million the past two seasons. Board members have donated large amounts of time 
and expertise as well as money, staff has been cut to five from 10, and voice 
mail replaced the receptionist.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of October, LACO management and Musicians' Union Local 47 entered 
into a settlement agreement that set up a payment schedule for back wages due 
musicians. Concessions have also come from the orchestra's landlord and 
subscribers who declined refunds for canceled concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both former LACO artistic director Brown and principal conductor Christof 
Perick are conducting fewer weeks this season. Perick, whose title changed from 
music director to artistic adviser to reflect lesser responsibilities, will 
essentially donate time for program planning and auditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Management is now referring to the new, leaner organization as "right-sized." 
Accumulated deficits of nearly $1 million in January, 1994, were back to 
$652,000 by June 30, the end of their last fiscal year, says Bruce Thibodeau, 
LACO director of administration and finance. Accumulated deficits at Sept. 30 
were around $362,000, the lowest since the 1990-91 season, says Thibodeau, who 
predicts accumulated deficits to decline to about $300,000 when this fiscal 
year ends on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 LACO's decision to carry such a sizable deficit in the past instead of 
canceling programs was "a calculated risk that we'd be able to make up the 
deficit in the short term," says board president Jennifer Diener, "but the 
economy didn't cooperate."  
</P>
<P>
 "The (1992) riots forced us to cancel concerts and distracted donor money away 
from the arts. Then came the earthquake, which took away our primary Westside 
venue (UCLA's Royce Hall) and ate up a lot of people's ready cash. We weren't 
able to make it up, and we had to face reality in a very dramatic way." 
</P>
<P>
 That meant restructuring the remainder of last season and cutting back on the 
1994-95 season. The orchestra is offering two subscription series this season, 
for instance, compared with four last season. There has been a resulting drop 
in subscribers from 2,500 to 1,650, but LACO executive director Erich Vollmer 
says the Ambassador Auditorium series is already 80% sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have also stepped up fund-raising. Chief among donations were 
two challenge grants, from anonymous donors, which totaled $100,000 annually 
for five years. Those challenge grants are already "nearly met," Vollmer says, 
and new donors have come aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, LACO's new Mozart recording, "Homages," was released last month by 
Composers Recordings Inc., and the orchestra continues its occasional work with 
the Music Center Opera. The opera work, which is paid for on a fee basis, is 
what Vollmer calls an example of "the overriding effort this orchestra has to 
make to minimize the number of concerts we do that lose money." Along the same 
lines, LACO has no plans for concerts at the Japan America Theatre, a prior 
LACO venue that drew its smallest number of concert-goers. The orchestra will 
instead make three "run-out concerts" to Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 "Run-outs," non-subscription concerts in the wider community, expand the 
orchestra's visibility and permit production costs to be absorbed by either 
foundations or presenters. "We get a fee, and we don't have to sell the 
tickets," says Diener. "The musicians show up and play, and (the presenters) 
pay us." 
</P>
<P>
 Diener says she expects the orchestra's deficit to be "completely eliminated" 
within 2 1/2 years and predicts "an acceptable surplus" after five years. "When 
we have money, we can consider expanding our season and activities. But not 
until we have the money. In hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Morale among musicians, meanwhile, is "exceedingly high," says clarinetist 
Gary Gray. Adds violinist Jennifer Woodward, chair of the orchestra committee 
and a 14-year LACO veteran: "We're hopeful and looking forward to our concerts. 
We hope that things can get back to normal."

THE SPATIALIST; UCI SET DESIGNER WANTS TO DRAW AUDIENCES IN, 'NOT JUST 
INTELLECTUALLY, BUT PHYSICALLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The next time you plunk down cash for a theater ticket, look around and 
consider how your impression of the evening's performance is shaped by where 
you are and what you see there. You'll get an idea of how much some scenic 
designers manipulate not only the stage but also the entire auditorium in 
shaping the evening's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas-Scott Goheen, the UC Irvine drama department's resident designer, is 
one of those designers who tries to build each production he works on from the 
ground up. A perfect example is Shakespeare's "As You Like It," which opens 
Friday in UCI's Fine Arts Village Theatre following a preview tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "My research responsibility for 'As You Like It,' " Goheen explained in a 
recent interview, "goes beyond finding an appropriate scenic environment for 
the production. I feel compelled to take a fresh look at the medium of theater 
itself. Given the director's general interest in a theatrical approach, my 
stylistic options are nearly infinite." 
</P>
<P>
 The Village is a proscenium theater, the action taking place within a frame 
that the audience looks through. For this production, Goheen has returned to a 
pre-Renaissance-type theater layout, in which half the audience is seated in 
front of the stage, the other half behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 The action of "As You Like It," then, unfolds between two sets of viewers. The 
main playing area is a large green carpet, a postmodern indication of the grass 
in the play's Forest of Arden, with green brick pillars standing for the trees 
on which Orlando places his love notes. An eight-foot-high cyclorama with a 
military camouflage design surrounds both the action and the entire audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in having the audience (reconsider) their understanding of 
what it is to go to the theater, what it is they know about our specific 
theater, and what sort of expectations they have," he said, "not just 
intellectually, but physically, spatially, as they attend the theater with this 
particular production." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In all the productions he's designed, Goheen has insisted on the site-specific 
approach. The Village Theatre, reflecting as it does '60s notions about theater 
design, "is not quite appropriate today, unless you want to function as a 
museum," Goheen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and "As You Like It" director Robert Cohen wanted to experiment with this 
production, which has been in preparation for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've tried to do here is dis-frame this proscenium theater, to simply 
destroy that Renaissance-founded notion of what it is to see theater . . . ," 
Goheen said. "For so many years we were interested in keeping the viewer in his 
place and letting the artist make his statement in his place, and not letting 
the two mingle too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, of course, we've moved beyond that into environmental theater, and all 
that," he said. "But we're still confronted with using these proscenium spaces. 
So, by trying to remove this separation it takes us much more into the '90s, 
investigating what might be valid in the next century.

 "We really want to know that a true symbiotic relationship between audience 
and actor exists . . . ," he said. "And this does not suggest that we want to 
go back to that touchy-feely stuff of the '60s. But it is a performance 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Goheen's design work in the past few years, ranging from a 1989 staging of 
Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute" to the 1992 production of Heiner Muller's 
"Hamletmachine" has been completely non-illusionary. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the green carpet and green brick trees, he explained, represent the 
essentials of the forest or woods, the pillars "vertical elements" that are 
basic parts of a forest.

<P>
 Director Cohen, whose respect for the text keeps Shakespeare intact, has 
chosen to bring the period of the play to the 1940s in the first part, and a 
strictly contemporary 1994 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a very mixed-up idea of what they call updating Shakespeare," 
Cohen said. "When Shakespeare conceived of a tree that would be used in 
staging, as for example the tree that Orlando pins his (love) letters to, 
Shakespeare was thinking of an architectural construct, what probably would 
have been described as a Roman-type pillar holding up the canopy over the 
stage. Goheen's brick-sided pillars representing trees are very much in keeping 
with Shakespeare's own notion of staging, as is the basic neutral playing 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, you could say Goheen's design is starkly traditional 
Shakespeare, simply substituting carpet and brick for board and stone. And it's 
staunchly Elizabethan in the interplay between viewer and actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do these things separately, either one of us," Goheen said. "I'm 
always interested in reminding ourselves of some of these essences of theater, 
communal intention -- and communal result."

JONESES' DRAKE BRAKING DOWNWARD DRIFT; POP MUSIC: AFTER DRUGS, A BANK ROBBERY 
AND PRISON, THE RAUNCH-ROCKER RECONSTITUTES HIS '80S BAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a fairly juicy story of rock 'n' roll decadence that Jeff Drake has to 
tell -- the tragicomic tale of the Joneses, a raunch-rocking Orange County/Los 
Angeles band that seemed like a comer on the mid-'80s Hollywood scene as it 
freely copped musical styles and bad-boy attitudes from the Stones, the Ramones 
and the New York Dolls. The Joneses drew crowds and press attention with 
catchy, hell-bound songs about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll that Drake sang in 
a bratty drawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Oval-faced and apple-cheeked under a thick haystack of dyed-black hair, Drake, 
at 33, doesn't show many outward signs of having spent a decade living the life 
he sang about. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake doesn't gloat about behavior that he thought was glamorous at the time, 
but he isn't ashamed of it, either. He freely confesses to an eager passion for 
heroin that eventually came to rule his life, and he has no qualms about 
discussing every detail he can remember about the afternoon in April, 1991, 
when, in a junkie's panic, he made a spur-of-the-moment decision to rob a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The police collared him easily within an hour or two of that unarmed heist in 
Anaheim, and Drake spent 2 1/2 years in federal custody. 
</P>
<P>
 As it worked out, he says now, botching a bank robbery was one of the luckiest 
things he ever did. Had he been cut out for crime, Drake might not have lived 
to add another chapter to the Joneses' story -- one in which the music is as 
raunchy as ever -- but the only shot he craves is a shot at getting a record 
deal for his recently re-formed band. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Drake thinks the Joneses, which formed in 1981, wouldn't have 
been able to capitalize even if they had landed a major record deal at their 
mid-'80s peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "By that time the drugs had become such a problem it would have screwed things 
up anyway. That's why (record companies) stayed away from us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a reputation for drugs and an outlaw lifestyle. Which is funny, 
because not long after that they snapped up Guns N' Roses and L.A. Guns. They 
didn't sound like us, but as far as the image and posture they assumed, they 
were influenced by what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Joneses released an album in 1986 and an EP in 1989, both on tiny, 
independent labels. By the late '80s, rock had become an afterthought for 
Drake. "I had no business being a musician at that point. I could barely 
function as a drug addict, let alone anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he works a steady day job, lives with his girlfriend in Pasadena and is 
moving forward with a new Joneses lineup that debuted in September (the group 
plays Friday at the Blue Saloon in North Hollywood). Bassist Mike Occhiato, 
guitarist Johnny Nation and piano player Greg Kuehn, all veterans of previous 
stints in Drake's oft-changing lineups, are back in the band, along with a new 
drummer, Byron Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got work, I've got the band, I've got Laurie -- the kinds of things 
people normally have in their lives," Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My short-term goals are to keep this band together, put out something 
(independently), and get a record deal. My long-term goal is to support myself 
playing music. I'd still like to give it one more shot." 
</P>

IT'S GLOATING OF PARTISANS FOR O.C. GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER and REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 On Tuesday, Republicans swept the Congress, kicked the daylights out of 
Democratic icons and made history. On Wednesday, they gloated. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no better place to see it than in Orange County -- the most 
Republican urban county in California and a place nationally known for its 
boisterous GOP partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the birthplace of Proposition 187. It is the home of fiery Republicans 
like Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove, the angry emperor of the C-SPAN 
airwaves, who now has a chance to chair a House Armed Services subcommittee and 
perhaps, finally, pass a bill. And it is the place where the members of an 
Assembly delegation, once called "the Cavemen" for their conservative stands, 
now may be in line for committee chairmanships. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how they're licking their chops in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 For so long the outcasts, now Republican politicos are fielding fawning phone 
calls from admirers across the country. "You really want to know what they 
say?" crowed Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach before heading out for 
an afternoon of celebratory surfing. "Yeee-ha!"  
</P>
<P>
 After wandering for 40 years in a political desert where leadership of 
Congress was always a mirage, some Republicans said God is finally smiling. 
"There's a sense for all these years that we have offered this message and it's 
been so gratifying to see that now the entire county, the entire state, the 
entire nation receives and accepts it," said Thomas A. Fuentes, longtime Orange 
County Republican Party chairman. "Perhaps the response we wanted was a little 
long in coming." 
</P>
<P>
 For the county's long-suffering Democrats, meanwhile, the election results 
went far beyond the usual humiliation. Longtime Democratic stalwarts Howard 
Adler and Richard O'Neill count themselves among the bloodied survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of 1984, there were two Democrats left, me and Dick O'Neill," 
Adler said. Defeated attorney general candidate "Tom Umberg's back here now, so 
now I guess there's three of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Republican consultants who for years have seen their Orange County 
candidates returned to office, but with little power, were unnerved by the 
prospect of their clients actually having any. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they take the responsibility seriously so they don't embarrass us 
all," said Eileen Padberg, an Irvine campaign consultant. "If I were them I'd 
be saying, 'Holy Moses, what am I going to do now?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no politician was rolling in post-election glory Wednesday more than 
Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a backbencher, this is really sensational stuff," said Dornan, starting 
his ninth two-year term in Congress. "Most other people would have had an ulcer 
by now or a heart murmur. Luckily I've got a strong constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also got a strong memory for years of slights by local political pundits, 
particularly digs that he would never sit in the Speaker of the House's chair. 
Not so, Dornan chortled at high volume: "Bob Dornan gets to sit in the 
Speaker's chair and tap gently with the opposite end of the gavel and say, 
'Will my colleagues please take their conversations into the cloakroom?' . . . 
See? I've got all the dialogue in my head and I've never been able to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also will be able to lay claim to the Hill's prime real estate, 
offices lavishly redecorated by the Democratic leadership, Dornan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all voted against (the redecorated offices), but now they're all ours," 
Dornan said. "We are going to own all those little hideaways with their marble 
floors, tea rooms and ceilings painted by an Italian master." 
</P>
<P>
 And when Sen. Ted Kennedy comes back to the Hill, added Newport Beach 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson, with more than a touch of spite, he will find "his 
magnificent chambers are now located in a broom closet." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ferguson, who's spent 10 years on the conservative front line in 
Sacramento, it's pay-back time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were constantly belittled. We were constantly being treated as 
second-class citizens. . . . The ones from Orange County almost to a man were 
always denigrated," Ferguson said. "You couldn't explain it to anybody because 
you didn't want to be a crybaby." 
</P>
<P>
 Things will be different now, vowed Ferguson, who plans to vie for the state 
Senate seat vacated by Marian Bergeson, who will be installed as a member of 
the county Board of Supervisors in January. 
</P>
<P>
 And those "weak" Republicans who cooperated with the Democrats? "Crushed" 
underfoot by the new conservative force, according to Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I want to go up and win the Senate seat to pay them back," he 
said. "I'll be their worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be just the Democrats having bad dreams. Once the initial shock 
of Tuesday's political earthquake wore off, many Republicans got worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us were around when we had control of both houses," fretted Buck 
Johns, longtime member of the executive board of the conservative Lincoln Club. 
"None of us has ever been in this position. As a result we have no idea of what 
we've got ahold of here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the classic be "careful what you wish for" situation, Johns said. "These 
guys are going back not as bomb throwers but as the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said he'd been receiving faxes and phone calls all day. "The first 
(comment) is congratulatory. The second is, 'What do we do now?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For all his glee over the nationwide victories, Fuentes was equally concerned: 
"The task of being the opposition is easier than the task of governing." 
</P>
<P>
 Many local congressmen agreed. After all, few have ever passed a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all these years, we've been thinking and strategizing on how to bring 
about these changes," said Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad). "But never in our 
wildest dreams did we think we'd have the chance to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Packard and others in the Orange County delegation expect their new majority 
status to translate into leadership roles on influential committees and 
subcommittees. None is likely to be senior enough to chair House committees, 
but several local congressmen, including Packard, Dornan and Rohrabacher, are 
in line to head subcommittees when the new Congress meets next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard, for instance, is hoping to win the chairmanship of the subcommittee 
on the legislative branch, which funds various agencies on Capitol Hill, 
including the Congress and the Library of Congress. Rohrabacher will most 
likely head the Science, Space and Technology subcommittee, and Dornan says he 
expects to chair the House Armed Services' Personnel subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an honor to be Chairman Dornan for two years. It is deee-lightful," 
said a gleeful Dornan, who also serves on the Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rohrabacher: "Orange County held on to its Republican principles, even 
at the expense of having some clout. Because of that we now have enormous 
leverage. . . . People say Bob Dornan never passed a law. Well, the Democrats 
never allowed Republicans to even get votes on their laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Rohrbacher said, voters can expect the Orange County delegation not only 
to author bills, "but to actually get the votes to pass them." 
</P>
<P>
 Packard also hopes to retain his spot on the "committee on committees," which 
under Republican leadership is expected to shrink the House committee structure 
even before Congress resumes in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans could hardly wait to start cleaning the House. So eager was 
Rep. Christopher Cox that he canceled three weeks of appointments here 
Wednesday and hopped a noon flight back to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're reorganizing the Congress after 40 years," Cox (R-Newport Beach), said 
just before racing out his office door. "I've got to get back there as quickly 
as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cox and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), said they have discussed other ideas 
with the new Republican leadership of the House, including inviting a major 
accounting firm to go over the books and slash congressional staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But UC Irvine political science professor Mark Petracca provided a reality 
check for the rambunctious Republicans: Washington runs on seniority and none 
of them has it. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a strictly seniority basis, we're out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with the Republican sweep, California lost positions that its senior 
Democrats held on many key House committees, Petracca said. Among Orange County 
Republicans, he said, Cox may be the most likely to do an end run around the 
seniority obstacle, earning a leadership role based on his expertise on budget 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this cheered the county's sad-sack Democrats, however. 
</P>
<P>
 They've become accustomed to losing over the years, but the drubbing at the 
polls this time ranked right up there with the worst ever, several doleful 
party leaders said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does this mean?" mused Adler, former Orange County Democratic Party 
chair. "It means we start all over again. This is kind of like '84 when Reagan 
was reelected. It's really just as bad." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, the former state Democratic Party chair and longtime patron of local 
Democrats, said it was pretty tough to find a bright spot, with not a single 
Democrat elected from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you think about it, it only gets worse," O'Neill said. "I think the 
thing to do here is to sort of lie low and maybe catch them somehow when 
they're not looking."

WILSON ACTS TO ENFORCE PARTS OF PROP. 187; 8 LAWSUITS FILED; IMMIGRATION: THE 
GOVERNOR ORDERS PRENATAL CARE HALTED WHILE A SAN FRANCISCO JUDGE BARS EXCLUSION 
FROM SCHOOL. O.C. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS PROMISE NOT TO REPORT CHILDREN TO 
OFFICIALS.

<P>
 The battle over Proposition 187 shifted quickly from the ballot box to 
courtrooms, to government chambers and the streets Wednesday as Californians, 
in a resounding Election Day mandate, ushered in a new era of stern 
restrictions against illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting immediately to implement the measure for which he so vigorously 
campaigned, newly reelected Gov. Pete Wilson issued a toughly worded executive 
order directing health care providers to discontinue prenatal services and new 
admissions to nursing homes for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of California have passed Proposition 187, now we must enforce 
it," said Wilson at a morning press conference at a Los Angeles hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the controversial initiative had other plans, filing at least 
eight lawsuits in state and federal courts throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon, a San Francisco Superior Court judge, acting on a lawsuit 
filed on behalf of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Unified School districts 
and the California School Boards Assn., temporarily barred enforcement of the 
proposition's requirement that illegal immigrants be excluded from California 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the judge extended the order to public colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a federal district judge presiding over a legal 
challenge brought by civil rights groups ordered that he be notified of any 
"substantive" enforcement of the initiative prior to a court hearing he 
scheduled for next Wednesday. But spokesmen for Wilson and Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren said they would proceed in implementing the non-education portions of 
the initiative because the judge did not directly order them to halt such 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the rapid-fire developments Wednesday following the measure's 
overwhelming passage by a 59%-41% margin: 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County school administrators promised not to report children to 
immigration officials, urging parents to keep students in schools, while health 
and social services workers said they had no immediate plans for implementing 
the initiative. Small groups of high school and college students staged small 
rallies and discussions on campuses in Santa Ana and Fullerton, denouncing 
Wilson and the initiative and promising to get Latinos more involved in the 
political process. Local officials also pledged to join statewide lawsuits 
challenging Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles City Council voted 10-3 to direct city employees not to 
enforce any provisions of the measure, except its crackdown on the sale and 
possession of fake identity documents, until legal challenges have been 
completed. The council also voted to pursue legal action to overturn the 
initiative, which bans illegal immigrants from government-funded non-emergency 
services and requires local officials to report those suspected of being 
illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Religious leaders and city officials urged residents to remain calm and 
called on parents to continue sending their children to school. "I urge all 
Angelenos to ignore rumors and to continue to express their opinions regarding 
this law in a peaceful manner," said Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton Administration officials said they would take no "precipitous" 
action to cut federal funding to California for health, education and social 
welfare programs, saying they would prefer to wait for the results of 
litigation aimed at thwarting the measure. Analysts have said that as much as 
$15 billion in annual federal funding is at risk because of certain of the 
initiative's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several small anti-187 rallies took place, including evening demonstrations 
Downtown and at Cal State Los Angeles, where about 250 protesters appeared. 
About 20 of the campus demonstrators were arrested after staging a sit-in that 
disrupted the opening of a fine arts complex. Implementation 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson, who used illegal immigration as a central focus of his reelection 
campaign, moved quickly Wednesday to begin implementing the get-tough 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting today, we insist that California be a state that can set its own 
priorities," the governor announced at his dramatic morning press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Unveiling a two-page executive order, Wilson declared that prenatal services 
for illegal immigrants would "be discontinued as soon as legally possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The savings of about $84 million a year would be redirected to legal residents 
of California, the governor said. As a result, he said, about 1,000 additional 
working poor women could be served each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also directed that future admissions to long-term nursing home programs 
be granted only to legal residents. A spokeswoman later said the savings would 
amount to about $6 million a year since the state currently pays for relatively 
few illegal immigrants to live in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ballot measure stated that illegal immigrants could no longer be 
served by publicly funded hospitals and health clinics, Wilson said he has the 
duty, as governor, to protect the health of the public. Therefore, he said, he 
will order all precautions be taken "to deal with any threat of communicable 
disease, whether through immunization or quarantine or other measures." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also ordered a bevy of state agencies to draft emergency regulations to 
implement the ballot measure. In doing so, however, he took pains to say his 
Administration would not tolerate bigotry. The regulations, he said, would 
ensure "the rights of all legal residents are protected and the provisions of 
Proposition 187 are implemented in a manner that avoids discrimination on the 
basis of national origin." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Wilson sent a letter to President Clinton, with whom he has 
repeatedly clashed over federal payments for immigration costs, asking for his 
"full cooperation and assistance" in implementing the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trust that you will agree that the people of California, having exercised 
their right as voters to enact Proposition 187, should not as a result suffer 
any loss of federal funds," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson plunged forward, so did Atty. Gen. Lungren, who has begun 
distributing blank forms to local law enforcement departments and other 
agencies to be returned with the names of any suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that major portions of Proposition 187 will be challenged in 
both state and federal courts," Lungren declared in a statement issued late 
Wednesday afternoon. "The mere filing of these lawsuits should not be 
interpreted as an excuse to ignore the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The high state officials' sentiments were not universally shared. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the City Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to join in 
legal action to set aside Proposition 187 and directed its employees to 
continue providing services until the challenges are settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to remind us all that the distinguishing characteristic of a 
democracy is its protection of the rights of the minority," Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, who wore a white armband reading "I'm an Illegal Alien," told her 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The only dissent came from three San Fernando Valley council members, Joel 
Wachs, Hal Bernson and Laura Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opposed 187 as a voter and as a council member," said Chick. "But . . . we 
need to be very careful of how we govern." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't participate in giving what I think is a misshapen message to the 
public. Part of the message is, 'We are smarter than you are.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At an unusual gathering of Los Angeles city and county officials, in which 
leaders including Riordan and County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke called 
for calm, Police Chief Willie Williams indicated that his department had no 
intention of making any immediate any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no change in the policies and procedures and actions of the Los 
Angeles Police Department as of this morning," the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 At LAPD's South Bureau, where officers handle nearly a murder a day, 
overworked detectives said they cannot even keep up with the growing roll of 
homicide victims, let alone begin asking arrestees for green cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have enough detectives to check on my murders. So how am I going to 
keep track of that administrative lunacy?" asked Lt. Sergio Robleto, commander 
of the Bureau's homicide detail. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Clinton Administration officials, following a plan agreed on 
before Tuesday's vote, said they would make no immediate decision on how to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to see where litigation takes us," an Administration official 
said. The Courtrooms 
</P>
<P>
 In state and federal courts in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento, a 
flurry of lawsuits -- at least eight, according to the attorney general's count 
-- were filed within hours of Proposition 187's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Wednesday morning, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Stuart R. Pollak 
had issued the first temporary restraining order against the measure, saying 
that its educational bans could not be put in place before further hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was hardly a surprise. Sponsors and opponents of Proposition 187 
have long agreed that a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision that granted illegal 
immigrants the right to a free public education would have to be reconsidered 
before the initiative's education ban could take effect. Pollak, in handing 
down his temporary restraining order early in the afternoon, cited that 
decision, Plyler vs. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are serious legal questions here, to say the least, that need to be 
resolved," said Pollak, noting the Supreme Court ruling "seems to prohibit and 
invalidate at least portions of this measure." 
</P>
<P>
 California Deputy Atty. Gen. Stephanie Wald, representing Wilson, opposed the 
order and argued that it was unnecessary because Proposition 187's education 
prohibitions were not due to go into effect until January anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 However, attorneys for the plaintiffs pointed to provisions in the measure 
that did appear to take effect immediately and warned that some schools might 
try to prevent illegal immigrants from continuing in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak, considering the Los Angeles Unified suit and two others filed on 
behalf of students elsewhere, set a court date for Nov. 28 for arguments on 
whether to issue a preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday in Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. stopped 
short of formally and immediately barring implementation of the law, as a 
coalition of civil rights groups and individuals requested in four additional 
lawsuits. But he strongly indicated he wanted enforcement of the entire measure 
held in abeyance until both sides have time to present legal arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the court to be notified of any firm -- not rumor -- indication of 
enforcement of (the measure) in this time," Byrne said, extending the order to 
attorneys for both the state and the four groups of plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the impact on individuals that I'm concerned about," Byrne told Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Jon M. Ichinaga, who was representing state health agencies and 
Wilson's office. He ordered all parties to advise him in writing "of any 
substantive" action to enforce the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Byrne said state officials may proceed with "in-house" 
preparations for enforcement of the measure without "violating the spirit of 
what I'm attempting to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping suit by the civil rights groups charges that the initiative 
unlawfully intrudes on federal jurisdiction over immigration and denies various 
constitutional rights partly by encouraging discrimination against persons who 
appear or sound foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have in effect is no implementation, no enforcement of Proposition 
187," Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ichinaga interpreted the judge's words differently. He said Byrne clearly 
implied "he would raise a concern" if the measure was enforced in the next 
week. But Ichinaga added that Byrne "did not issue an issue an injunction 
against the state. It seems to me he basically wants to know if it is 
implemented, but he didn't make any express ruling that it shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the governor and attorney general quickly announced that the 
judge's action would not interfere with their implementation plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Proposition 187 contains a severability clause, some sections could 
conceivably take effect while others were still being debated in court cases. 
But legal experts say suits could tie up certain portions of the measure for 
anywhere from two to five years. Streets and Schools

<P>
 As dawn broke over California on Wednesday, it was business as usual for 
illegal immigrants who work as day laborers, kitchen employees and in other 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be afraid, we have to confront this issue," said Juan Carlos, 30, a 
father of three, as he waited for work outside a Homebase store in Ladera 
Heights. "It is either this or starve." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, a slender, grizzled man was loud and 
clear about offering fake identification documents, despite stiff new sanctions 
included in Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Micas, micas," he called out in Spanish, using the term many residents know 
applies to driver's licenses, resident alien cards or Social Security cards. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of blocks away, along another side of the park, a few young men who 
also sell illegal documents said they were keeping a lower profile than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mica" salesmen and other area residents said Proposition 187 will not change 
conditions for Latinos and others in the city who are struggling to survive. 
Most of those people will remain in the United States and will do what they can 
to earn some money, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center, meanwhile, business also proceeded 
pretty much as usual. "We haven't been notified of any cancellation of 
appointments in any of our clinics," said spokeswoman Tassie Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of introspection swept over public school campuses Wednesday morning, 
where just a week before student protests hit their peak with more than 10,000 
young people walking out of class in Los Angeles alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after Proposition 187's passage, there were only a handful of small 
protests involving fewer than 500 students. 
</P>
<P>
 On the UC Irvine campus, about 150 students marched and chanted opposition to 
187 from about 6:30 to 9 p.m. There were no incidents, campus security 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, school administrators grappled with ways to help students cope with 
the disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just too stunned to do anything," said Luz Castillo, a 17-year-old Reseda 
High School student who just two weeks ago organized an anti-187 walkout and 
forum.

O.C. MAN HELD IN SLAYINGS OF PARENTS, BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A 21-year-old gas station mechanic was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion 
of killing his parents and younger brother, whose bodies were found in a family 
car that had been doused with gasoline and set on fire outside a La Mirada high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Charles III was surprised by Fullerton police as he walked out of his 
parents' house just after 8 p.m. with his girlfriend. Officers had surrounded 
the house and had posted themselves at other homes in the neighborhood, 
"because they feared Charles might flee," Sgt. Danny Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles was under the belief that we were here to provide security for the 
family and to keep the media from getting too close to the house," Becerra 
said. "He didn't anticipate being arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that Edward Charles, 55, an electrical engineer at Hughes 
Aircraft, Dolores Charles, 47, a self-employed typist, and Danny Charles, 19, 
an opera singer and voice student at USC, were killed Sunday night and that 
their bodies were hidden in a car until Monday night, when the car was doused 
and ignited. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive was offered for the killings, which were discovered after neighbors 
of El Camino Continuation High School in La Mirada reported a fire in the 
school parking lot about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsies Wednesday showed that the father and son had been bludgeoned to 
death with a blunt instrument, and that Danny had been stabbed repeatedly -- 
though not fatally. Dolores Charles had scratches around her neck, but the 
cause of death has not yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents were found in the Honda Civic's back seat, burned beyond 
recognition. Dental records provided identification. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies had been doused with gasoline, detectives said. But while the rest 
of the car was buckled and burned to metal, the trunk and Danny Charles' body 
were unburned. Investigators speculated that closure of the trunk kept out 
oxygen for a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Wednesday, Charles had told sheriff's investigators he is innocent, 
said his lawyer, John J. Donovan of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he's distraught, as is the rest of the family," Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detectives said they were trying to 
arrange a polygraph examination for Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles was going to see us Thursday with his attorney so we could discuss 
this in a more controlled atmosphere," Lt. Ray Peavy of the Los Angeles County 
department said. "But a call came this evening to the Fullerton Police 
Department, and they made the determination that evidence may be in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Peavy said a neighbor reported that Charles had been seen washing down an area 
of the driveway that police consider a possible crime scene. Fullerton police 
acted on the tip by driving to the home on Terraza Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday evening, police surrounded the Charles house, waiting for Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies to arrive and fearful that Charles would slip 
out a back door, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peavy said Charles' grandfather last saw Danny Charles at 6 p.m. Sunday, when 
the teen-ager left his parents' home to return to his USC dorm. It is not clear 
whether Eddie Charles walked his brother to the car, nor whether he was in the 
house after the younger brother left. But the grandfather told detectives that 
Danny Charles had not called his parents by 11 p.m. that night, and they could 
not reach him. They remained up and worried as the grandfather went to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:30 p.m., a neighbor of the Charles family called 911 and told Fullerton 
police that she had heard a man's voice screaming for help from the trunk of a 
car nearby. When police arrived nine minutes later, they said, the car was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that, when the grandfather awoke the next morning, the 
parents and Edward were gone, although the parents' car was still in the 
driveway. The burned Honda belonged to Danny Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "All day Monday he was concerned about their whereabouts," Peavy said of the 
grandfather, whose daughter, son-in-law and grandson are gone, and whose 
remaining grandson is suspected of their murders. 
</P>
<P>
 A soccer and football player at Sunny Hills High School, Eddie Charles grew up 
in that part of Fullerton where homes sit on large parcels and sell for more 
than $300,000. It was not clear if he attended college, although his boss 
thought he was enrolled at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles, who stands 6 feet, 2 inches, is in good physical shape and told his 
co-workers that he worked out at a boxing gym in Fullerton and hoped to compete 
in the Olympics. He also said he was a black or brown belt in karate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Burchit, Charles' boss at a Chevron gas station, said, "I'm really nervous 
about how this is going to shake out for Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Charles' brother attracted a lot of attention because of his theater 
performances and beautiful operatic tenor voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was always coming in and asking about his brother, what he was up 
to. He never talked about him. He didn't seem particularly proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was living both at his parents' home and at the home of his 
girlfriend's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he told them he was at the girlfriend's home Monday night, which 
her mother, Jeanne Bowen, confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Charles arrived at the Bowen home early in the evening and left only 
once for a matter of minutes. She said she did not know where Charles went. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically a normal night. The football game was on and he seemed 
fine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said that she did not know the Charles family well but that Eddie 
worried about his father, who she said had prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' boss said the teen-ager had worked his regular shift Monday but then 
returned to the station, less than two miles from his parents' house, "10 or 12 
times," the last time at 9 p.m. Burchit said he had no idea why Charles 
returned to the station after work. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers at Hughes Aircraft said Charles, the father, was nearing 
retirement. With 20 years' seniority, he was just short of what the company 
calls "magic 75," which allows an employee whose age and tenure equal that 
number to retire with full benefits.

BEILENSON APPARENT WINNER OVER SYBERT; CONGRESS: CHALLENGER REFUSES TO CONCEDE 
UNTIL ABSENTEE VOTE IS COUNTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) appeared to have won a razor-thin 
victory and a 10th term in Congress on Wednesday at the same time many of his 
veteran House colleagues nationwide were being swept out of office by an 
anti-incumbent, pro-Republican tide. 
</P>
<P>
 Returns from Tuesday's election showed Beilenson receiving 49.3% of the vote 
while GOP challenger Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, got 
47.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a big margin -- 3,200 votes -- but it was big enough for the 
Beilenson team to claim a victory Wednesday even though Sybert was refusing to 
concede defeat. Sybert said he wanted to wait for a final tally of absentee 
ballots. "I haven't heard the fat lady sing yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Beilenson's apparent survival puzzled even some of his 
colleagues. "I like Tony, but I personally don't think he fits the district," 
said Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), one of many local Republicans 
who thought Sybert would win. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's 24th Congressional District, stretching from Sherman Oaks across 
the southwestern San Fernando Valley to the Conejo Valley and including Malibu, 
is not a safe Democratic seat. Although Democrats enjoy an edge in voter 
registration numbers, it is not enough to offset the greater tendency of 
Republicans to turn out at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, too, looked particularly bad for Beilenson, who faced a tenacious 
and well-financed candidate in Sybert. The challenger pumped more than $400,000 
of his own money into the race and got additional financial help from numerous 
GOP heavyweights, including U. S. Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kansas) and Rep. Newt 
Gingrich (R-Georgia). 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign probably spent $850,000, Sybert said Wednesday, although others 
have estimated the tab may reach $1 million. At the least, the challenger 
outspent Beilenson by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 If these odds weren't bad enough, Beilenson was also running as a foe of 
Proposition 187, the measure to deny illegal immigrants certain government 
benefits, which won by a large margin. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the big question Wednesday was: How did Beilenson keep his head when so 
many others were losing theirs? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not your conventional politician," said Los Angeles City Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who campaigned on President Clinton's record," he said, 
sounding a note of disbelief. "But that's the kind of person he is, and the 
voters respect him because he does stand for something. It's good to see that 
that kind of character still counts for something with voters." 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old lawmaker has capitalized on his image as a somewhat 
professorial maverick. Throughout the just-concluded campaign, Beilenson 
proudly proclaimed that he is only one of a handful of Congress members who 
refuses to take money from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beilenson and his champions cite his independence and integrity, 
critics say that there's also plenty of Machiavelli to account for Beilenson's 
political durability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it may have been his dirty politicking that pulled it out for him in 
the end," complained James Vaughn, Sybert's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly nasty, Vaughn said, was Beilenson's last-minute hit piece warning 
that Sybert had allied himself with anti-abortion extremists to support 
reimposition of the so-called gag rule, the measure that had barred physicians 
in family planning clinics from advising women about how to get an abortion. 
Sybert throughout the campaign supported a woman's right to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lie," Vaughn said of this mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson political consultants Craig Miller and Rick Taylor say 
otherwise. When he Sybert signed the GOP "Contract for America" -- the 
wide-ranging Republican legislative agenda for the future -- he agreed to 
support the gag rule, if only in the fine print, the two noted. Election

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; KUEHL SUPPORTERS CELEBRATE ASSEMBLY VICTORY THAT BUCKED 
CONSERVATIVE TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A pine tree strung with multicolored lights marked the home of Sheila James 
Kuehl in Santa Monica on Tuesday night, an appropriate beacon for the rainbow 
coalition found inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, staff workers and politicos of every hue -- gay, Republican, 
Latino, labor, lesbian, Democrat and more -- were sipping Chardonnay and Scotch 
and brandishing cigars to celebrate what one called "the one glimmer of hope" 
for right-thinking liberals on a night of conservative election victories 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, 53, a feminist lawyer and former actress, had just won the election 
that will make her the first openly homosexual member of the state Legislature, 
trouncing Republican Michael T. Meehan for the 41st Assembly District seat by 
14 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a red blazer and a nonstop smile, she schmoozed the crowd of 
supporters and media like a practiced pol. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, however, this was her first run at office after three previous 
careers: First as the brainy Zelda in the 1960s television series "The Many 
Loves of Dobie Gillis," next as a college administrator, then as an attorney, 
law professor and co-founder of the California Women's Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new role, she vowed Tuesday night to continue her work on women's 
equity issues -- nearly all of California's spousal abuse law already bears her 
stamp -- but said she also wanted to work on education, the environment and 
parkland acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Her district covers much of the western Santa Monica Mountains, stretching 
from Encino to Westlake Village and from Santa Monica to Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, who earned her law degree at Harvard University at age 37, said her 
first aim is to get on the Assembly's Judiciary Committee and work with 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) to revive the domestic partnership law 
vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her substantial credentials in law and public policy, her campaign 
mailers relentlessly, incongruously featured black-and-white photographs of her 
as the TV character Zelda -- a tactic she partly credited for her victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "People loved her!" said Kuehl, contending polls showed 76% of the district's 
voters had seen "Dobie Gillis" and liked her character -- a quick-witted 
fast-talker determined to snare the hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw her as someone smart and someone they liked. They had to reassess 
their negative feelings toward me as a gay person. It jammed their homophobic 
radar." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl's election cheered the gay and lesbian community. Said real estate 
investor and lesbian activist Gwen Baba: "The Republicans can try to turn back 
the clock, but they can't tell us we can't run for office. Now we know we can 
run and we can win." 
</P>
<P>
 Paris Poirier, who worked phone banks for Kuehl, said that many voters' 
stereotyped image of lesbians worked in the candidate's favor. "People said 
they thought she was a roll-up-your-sleeves kinda gal," said Poirier. "It was 
like they figured, if she's lesbian, she must be hard-working." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl raised nearly $500,000 from almost 5,000 individuals, according to her 
campaign manager, a remarkable total for a first-timer. She also collected 
endorsements from many law enforcement leaders, including Republican Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, and from a broad range of Southland 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the donors was Assistant U.S. Atty. Lee Michaelson, a lesbian who said 
she was almost barred from her current post because of her sexual orientation. 
Kuehl impressed her with one phone call. "Most candidates ask for money, but 
Sheila asked for my ideas too," Michaelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Perez, a Burbank-based trade-union organizer, said the importance of 
her victory would come in humanizing gay issues in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can no longer gay-bash in the Legislature," Perez said. "From now on, 
there will be a face to our community when they talk about our issues on the 
floor."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; IMMIGRATION WAS NO. 1 ELECTION ISSUE, LOCAL VOTERS SAY; 
EXIT POLL: HALF OF THOSE QUESTIONED SAID PROP. 187 WAS THE LEADING FACTOR IN 
DECIDING WHO TO VOTE FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While San Fernando and Santa Clarita valley residents generally followed 
statewide voting trends, they cited illegal immigration more often than other 
voters as the most important issue in deciding who to cast their ballots for, 
according to exit polls conducted by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of all local voters polled said illegal immigration was the deciding 
factor in the election, while only 39% of voters statewide considered it the 
most important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently due to their concern over illegal immigration, local voters walked 
lock-step with voters statewide in overwhelmingly supporting Proposition 187, 
the controversial measure to cut free state services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Local voters backed the anti-illegal immigration measure by 61%, while voters 
statewide voted 59% in support, according to interviews with 1,324 voters in 20 
polling places in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. The poll has a 
margin of sampling error of three points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Tovar, a Latino activist in the San Fernando Valley, said immigration 
strikes a nerve among middle-class residents who resent minorities moving into 
once-predominantly white neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has been a resentment because some of them have felt it was 
their Valley," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents an ethnically diverse community 
in the northeast Valley, said some voters may not be racists but simply believe 
the problem has gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that there were people of all ethnicities who made their decisions 
(based on a concern over illegal immigration) not just middle-class whites," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Brennan, director of The Times Poll, said it was not surprising that 
illegal immigration was a bigger issue among local voters while support for 
Proposition 187 was not substantially higher than statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigration and 187 are not exactly the same issue," he said, adding that 
some local voters may believe the measure will not address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, which had been the top concern of local residents in recent years, 
dropped behind illegal immigration as the most important issue, with 36% of 
voters citing it as the deciding factor. Thirty-three percent of voters 
statewide said crime was the most important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting statewide sentiments, 80% of Proposition 187 supporters in the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys said they backed the measure to send a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of local Proposition 187 supporters also said they backed the 
measure to force the federal government to face the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also showed that local voters under the age of 30 supported the 
anti-illegal immigration measure 54% to 46%, in contrast to the statewide 
opposition of 53% to 47% among the same age group. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll showed that Latinos in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys 
voted 75% against Proposition 187, compared to 77% statewide. White voters 
locally voted 65% in support of the measure, compared to 63% statewide. How the 
Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 5,336 voters as they exited 85 polling places 
across the state, including an oversampling of 1,324 San Fernando Valley and 
Santa Clarita voters. Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout in 
past general elections. The survey was by confidential questionnaire. The 
margin of sampling error for percentages based on the entire sample and the 
Valley each is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For some subgroups, the error 
margin may be somewhat higher. Because the survey does not include absentee 
voters or those who declined to participate when approached, actual returns and 
demographic estimates by the interviewers were used to slightly adjust the 
sample. Davis Market Research Services Inc. of Calabasas assisted The Times in 
this poll. The Valley Vote

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; ROGAN LEAVES CAMPAIGNING BEHIND; ASSEMBLY: FRESH FROM HIS 
THIRD WIN IN SIX MONTHS, LAWMAKER CAN NOW LOOK FORWARD TO A FULL TWO-YEAR TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale), 1994 has been a year of campaign 
after campaign after campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from his third straight campaign victory in six months -- a strong 55% 
to 41% victory over Democratic challenger Adam Schiff -- Rogan said Wednesday 
that he was anxious to finally devote himself to legislative reform in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting used to seeing my name on signs around town," said Rogan, 37, a 
former Glendale Municipal Court judge. "I'm looking forward to paying attention 
to legislative functions and not worrying about the campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 The seat, representing the 43rd Assembly District, was vacated when Pat Nolan 
was forced to resign after pleading guilty Feb. 18 to one count of 
racketeering, a charge stemming from an FBI sting operation against state 
lawmakers. Nolan is now serving a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan won a special election for the Glendale-Burbank Assembly seat in May and 
weathered a challenge in the Republican primary in June. He had filled the seat 
for only six months before Tuesday's election results gave him a full two-year 
term representing Glendale and Burbank, as well as Los Feliz, Silver Lake and 
parts of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 After a late night of watching the returns, Rogan was in his office early 
Wednesday working on his proposals for reforming the way the Assembly handles 
the crush of bills that come up for consideration. He had also purchased a 
plane ticket for Sacramento for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, meanwhile, was reflecting on his uphill fight to seize for the 
Democrats a seat that has long been in Republican hands. The 43rd District, 
reapportioned in 1992, was considered vulnerable by state Democratic leaders, 
who donated heavily to Schiff's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff, 34, a former federal prosecutor, attributed his defeat to Rogan's fund 
raising -- Rogan outspent Schiff roughly 2 to 1 -- as well as the GOP's strong 
nationwide showing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a Republican tidal wave in California and nationally," Schiff said. 
"It is tough to overcome that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan -- who had been endorsed by Glendale and Burbank police officer groups 
and the leadership of the tax-revolt movement -- downplayed the influence other 
races had on the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a conservative district and I think it's going to remain that way 
into the next century," he said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; HOGE WINS MUDSLINGING CAMPAIGN ON GOP TIDE; 44TH 
DISTRICT: BOTH ASSEMBLY CANDIDATES INVEST HEAVILY ON NEGATIVE ADS. REPUBLICAN 
WINS 52.6% TO 42.3%. 
</P>

 The slew of negative mailers, billboards and cable television spots were not 
the key to the 10-point victory Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) scored over 
Democrat Bruce Philpott, Pasadena's former police chief, in the 44th District, 
pundits said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1 is the R after Hoge's name," said political scientist Alan Heslop, a 
professor at Claremont McKenna College. "That's not a bad Republican district 
and it was a great Republican night." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic voters hold a 2% edge in the 44th District, which includes portions 
of the San Fernando Valley, Altadena, La Canada Flintridge, Pasadena, San 
Marino, South Pasadena and parts of Arcadia, San Gabriel and Temple City. But 
political wisdom holds that Republicans turn out to vote at higher rates than 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge jumped out to a substantial lead early Tuesday night and, while it 
narrowed some, he was declared the winner of the bitter race Wednesday morning. 
Returns showed Hoge winning by a 52.6% to 42.3% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked about fighting crime, fighting for jobs and fighting illegal 
immigration," said Hoge, who has written a number of anti-crime bills as a 
freshman lawmaker. "I believe that I, throughout the entire campaign, addressed 
the issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott did not return calls for comment, but campaign spokesman Jerry Jeffe 
attributed the outcome to the Republican fervor sweeping the state and the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just got caught up in a year where everything went wrong," Jeffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Hoge and Philpott both declared themselves enemies of 
crime. Hoge supported Proposition 187, which seeks to cut off some public 
services to illegal immigrants, while Philpott opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But a good portion of their resources paid for mudslinging. Hoge set the tone 
in the primary, even though he and Philpott were running unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman put out mailers accusing Philpott of abusing his standing as a 
police chief by giving two Glendale officers a tongue-lashing during a 1990 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott groused that he was justified in protesting the stop, which he said 
occurred only after the officers saw his date was an African American woman. He 
accused Hoge of hitting early to dry up his fund-raising base. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge, who declined to debate Philpott, sharpened his blows in the days before 
Tuesday's election. A Hoge mailer alerted voters to "The Bruce Philpott 
Drinking and Driving Story," though Philpott was never arrested nor cited for 
drunk driving in the 1990 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Philpott showed a knack for negative campaigning as well. The former police 
chief filmed a commercial inside a San Diego County card club and aired the 
spot on local cable television painting Hoge as a point man for gambling 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 At first avoiding interviews, Hoge surfaced in the week before the election 
and said he had done nothing wrong in accepting campaign contributions from the 
horse racing and casino industry -- about $140,000 -- while carrying 
legislation for those gambling interests, which operate in his district.

O.C. OFFICIALS KEEP PROP. 187 ON HOLD; REACTION: 'WAIT AND SEE,' SAY SCHOOLS, 
HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. LITTLE WILL CHANGE SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Orange County school, health and social service officials hurried Wednesday to 
spread a "wait-and-see" message about Proposition 187, trying to reassure 
illegal immigrant families and others that little would change in coming weeks 
as the sweeping measure is challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Social Services Agency -- which distributes welfare payments, food 
stamps and Medi-Cal benefits to the poor -- was flooded with phone calls from 
people who feared their aid would be cut off immediately, as the new law 
mandates. But agency workers had little concrete information to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've checked with the state and they told us they've had staff working on 
policy changes and will issue guidelines soon. Until they do, we will follow 
existing policies," said Larry Leaman, the county's director of social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical officials, too, said they were holding off on enforcing the 
initiative, which denies non-emergency health care, social services and public 
education to illegal immigrants. It was overwhelmingly approved by voters 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we are concerned it's business as usual," said Len Foster, the 
county's deputy director of public health, who spent most of Wednesday at the 
17th Street clinic in Santa Ana. "We are continuing to provide services to all 
comers, as we did yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators in areas with the highest immigrant populations reported 
no dips in attendance Wednesday. Officials scrambled to combat jitters over the 
passage of the initiative by sending letters to parents promising that teachers 
would not report students to immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Some school officials took to their public address systems or organized 
schoolwide assemblies where students vented their feelings, emphasizing that 
regardless of court action, the school provisions of the initiative are not 
slated to take effect until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "School has, and will be, a place where you'll get an education. We are not 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service," La Quinta High School Principal 
Mitch Thomas said over the PA system, as students rushed to class before the 
late bell Wednesday morning. "We are educators. Continue to come to school." 
</P>
<P>
 At the county's largest district, Santa Ana Unified, interim superintendent 
Don Champlin said: "We're not making any changes in anything we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep your children in our schools," Santa Ana's school board told parents in 
a statement approved during an election night meeting and distributed 
throughout the district Wednesday. "This has been an emotional, divisive issue 
that has confused many people. We now need to put those feelings aside and keep 
children in the secure, nurturing environment of our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police on tactical alert for civil disturbances, including officers 
patrolling Santa Ana streets on horseback in case demonstrations became unruly, 
found little to do Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 High school and college students staged a handful of small rallies around the 
county, but most drew just a few dozen people, in contrast to the hundreds who 
walked out of classes in the days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County voted overwhelmingly for 187, but we want to show that in 
Orange County there is opposition," said David Rojas, 22, who helped organize a 
noontime rally at the Civic Center in Santa Ana that drew about 50 people. "The 
struggle is going to continue, not just in the courts -- that's going to be one 
front -- but also in the streets and in the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Day laborers who gather alongside Laguna Canyon Road each day seeking jobs 
said their ranks were thinned Wednesday by the passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary now," said one Santa Ana resident who has been here for five years 
without a green card. Determined to stay in the United States, the man said he 
is worried about getting medical care for his wife, who is six months pregnant, 
and his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stay here. I don't want to go back to Mexico," he said. "It is nice 
here. I love America." 
</P>
<P>
 At schools throughout Orange County, Latino students lamented the measure's 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pledge of allegiance ends with the words 'with liberty and justice for 
all.' It doesn't say 'with liberty and justice for white people,' " 14-year-old 
Wendi Larsen said during a lunchtime discussion at Saddleback High in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino students at Golden West College who met before classes Wednesday said 
they will work with larger Latino groups to fight the measure in court and to 
get legal immigrants more involved in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 At a lunchtime discussion involving about 40 students and staff, Rancho 
Santiago College student Patty Ceja, 18, said, "It's hard to know what the 
future will bring. Is everyone going to get kicked out of school? What's going 
to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 School and college officials said nothing drastic is likely to happen -- at 
least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education issued a statement Wednesday reminding 
school districts that the new law provides for no changes in school policy 
until Jan. 1. A San Francisco judge issued a temporary restraining order 
Wednesday preventing schools from implementing the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a federal district judge presiding over a legal 
challenge brought by civil rights groups, ordered that he be notified of any 
"substantive" enforcement of the initiative prior to a court hearing he 
scheduled for next Wednesday. But spokesmen for Wilson and Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren said they would proceed in implementing the non-education portions of 
the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no administrative plans at this point to begin implementation," said 
Nilane Lee, president of the North Orange County Community College District 
Board of Trustees. "We're adopting a wait and see and hope attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The state memo advises school districts to carefully consider the legal and 
fiscal implications before enforcing the initiative. Civil rights groups have 
promised to sue school administrators who attempt to report illegal immigrants, 
and the federal government has threatened to cut off all funding to schools 
that follow Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's 27 school districts received $69.4 million in federal funds 
during the 1993-94 school year, according to the county Department of 
Education. In some school districts -- Anaheim, Buena Park, Centralia, Fountain 
Valley, La Habra, Savanna and Westminster elementary districts, and Garden 
Grove and Santa Ana Unified -- that money comprised more than 5% of the 
district's total general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "That money is what gives us the resources to provide extra help to kids who 
have some deficiencies in learning," said Meliton Lopez, superintendent of the 
Anaheim City Elementary District. "I would miss it. It would be a detriment to 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Most federal dollars go to programs that help disadvantaged students, 
including special education and bilingual classes, drug abuse and gang 
prevention programs, and free and reduced-price meals for poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's hard to see," Lopez said, "to see kids not eat." 
</P>
<P>
 But administrators are confident the federal government will not soon take its 
money from California schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how much federal funding Santa Ana Unified could lose, Champlin said: 
"The odds of it being implemented to affect anything this year are so slim that 
it's not worth the time to figure it out now." 
</P>
<P>
 While most schools reported calm on campus, many health care and social 
service agencies on Wednesday were barraged with inquiries about the 
initiative. Officials said they tried to assuage people's fears and continue to 
provide services as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the St. Joseph Health System, where doctors went on a hunger 
strike last week to protest Proposition 187, said they will "aggressively 
support" efforts to overturn the measure in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Nancy Hsu and Lee Romney and correspondents Leslie 
Earnest, Mimi Ko and Jon Nalick contributed to this story. Federal Funds At

 Before Tuesday's vote, the federal government threatened to withdraw all its 
funding from California schools if administrators implemented Proposition 187.

LOS ANGELES TIMES POLL; O.C. REPUBLICANS FORGET THEIR DIFFERENCES WITH WILSON; 
COUNTY GIVES THE GOVERNOR A HUGE MARGIN DESPITE FEELINGS OF MANY THAT THE STATE 
IS ON THE WRONG TRACK. HIS HARD LINE ON CRIME AND BACKING OF PROPOSITION 187 
HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was hard to tell from Tuesday's balloting that Orange County voters ever 
had any political differences with Gov. Pete Wilson. The incumbent solidly 
reaffirmed his GOP base while also capturing blocs of local moderates and even 
voters who identified themselves as liberals, a Los Angeles Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election in which local voters said the issues of immigration, taxes and 
crime guided their voting decisions, Wilson's campaign emphasis on crime and 
Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration initiative, apparently paid off, 
despite a belief by voters that the affairs of the state are "seriously on the 
wrong track." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Wilson was able to win voters across most of Orange County's 
political spectrum, Mike Huffington, the Republican running for the U.S. 
Senate, apparently fared less well, according to results of the poll, in which 
1,306 voters were questioned Tuesday as they emerged from the voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of absentee ballots still to be counted, it was unclear whether 
Huffington's local vote ratio over Democratic incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
would reach the 30-point mark traditionally needed by Republicans to go over 
the top statewide. Unofficial returns Wednesday showed Huffington leading 
Feinstein by 27 points in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas Fuentes said Wilson -- who beat 
Democrat Kathleen Brown by 41 points in local balloting compared to 15 points 
statewide -- performed better than Huffington because he is better known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to recognize that the Feinstein name has been around a long 
time," Fuentes said. "Huffington is a new name on the political front. I think 
he can be very proud of those numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 On Proposition 187, voting in Orange County was polarized along ethnic lines, 
as in the rest of the state. Seven of 10 whites in the county voted for it, 
while 72% of Latinos opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino opposition, however, was not significant because only 5% of Orange 
County's electorate is Latino -- no change from the June primary election -- 
compared to 88% who are white. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 did not motivate more Latinos to come out to vote," said 
Susan Pinkus, assistant director of the Los Angeles Times Poll. "People thought 
it would motivate them to come out. . . . It didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three out of five Orange County Democrats said they voted against the 
measure, but Democrats made up only 28% of the local vote, compared to 54% 
Republican, 15% independent and 3% other parties, according to the exit poll, 
which has a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman Dorianne Garcia said Proposition 187 
and her party's mishandling of the issue proved to be the Democrats' undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans did a real smart thing when they brought Proposition 187 to 
the front of the campaign," Garcia said. "We talked about things like the 
economy and rising crime and the Republicans kept saying, 'What about 187?' We 
played their game with their rules and we will never let that happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the exit poll showed that the economy and jobs ranked near the bottom 
of a list of issues that voters said were important to them. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to check off the two most important issues that helped them decide 
how to vote, Orange County voters placed illegal immigration at the top of the 
list, followed by taxes and crime. In statewide polling, the crime problem was 
more important than taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Proposition 187, 78% of those who voted for it said they did so because 
they wanted to "send a message" and 52% said they wanted to force the federal 
government to face the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were voting for it not because they think it's going to be enforced," 
Pinkus said. "They wanted to send a message to our governments -- to the state 
government, to the federal government. They are frustrated. They want them to 
do something about illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 In a county where conservatives' affection for Wilson was once lukewarm -- as 
demonstrated by a 43% protest vote for his Republican opponent in the June 
primary -- Proposition 187 clearly helped the governor win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who said they voted for Wilson, 29% said they were influenced by his 
position on the immigration measure. This issue was followed by "Brown's family 
record," which includes a father and brother who served as governors, and then 
by Wilson's own record as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, those who voted for Brown said they did so because of Wilson's 
record, the need for change, and because she had "good ideas." Only 10% of 
those who supported her said they did so because of her opposition to the 
illegal immigration initiative, even though she focused her campaign in the 
final days on the defeat of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's voting strength was generally across the board, except among Latinos, 
Democrats and liberals. Still, he drew almost one-third of the voters who said 
they were Democrats, while Brown received only 7% of the Republican vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also was backed by 60% of the Orange County voters who considered 
themselves "middle-of-the-road," compared to only 35% for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's base of support did show some cracks. Of those who voted for 
him, 50% said they did so because he was the "lesser of two evils" and more 
than half of his supporters -- 56% -- said the state was on the wrong track. 
Also, only 23% of the Wilson voters said they were better off financially than 
four years ago; 38% said worse; and 39% said "about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, local voters said they supported Huffington because 
Feinstein "is a tax and spender," because of her support for President Clinton 
and because of Huffington's business career, which stemmed from the empire 
built by his father, a Texas oilman. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Huffington's position on immigration was not ranked as the top reason 
voters sided with him. (Huffington supported Proposition 187, but then ran into 
trouble with the revelation that he had hired an illegal immigrant -- a charge 
he later turned on Feinstein.) 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also did not do as well as Wilson in attracting Orange County 
moderates, splitting that group with Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, Huffington made a strong showing among the major segments of the 
local electorate, garnering more support than Feinstein from men, women, voters 
of all ages and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side of the Senate race, Feinstein did a better job than 
Brown in holding on to the Democratic base of voters, with only one out of five 
Democrats crossing over to Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's supporters said they backed her because of her record in office, 
because Huffington was "trying to buy the election," and because of her support 
for Clinton. Only 8% of the Feinstein voters said her opposition to Proposition 
187 was the deciding factor. Illegal Immigration Top Concern

County How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 5,336 voters as they exited 85 polling places 
across the state, including an oversampling of 1,306 Orange County voters. 
Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout in past general 
elections. The survey was by confidential questionnaire. The margin of sampling 
error for percentages based on the entire sample each is plus or minus 3 
percentage points. For some subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher. 
Because the survey does not include absentee voters or those who declined to 
participate when approached, actual returns and demographic estimates by the 
interviewers were used to slightly adjust the sample. Davis Market Research 
Services Inc. of Calabasas assisted The Times in this poll.

WINE: PRIZE WINE: BE YOUR OWN JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buying wine, whether as a gift for someone or for yourself, can be 
nerve-wracking. You walk into a wine shop and approach the wall of wine, and 
the labels turn into a blur. You read the shelf-talkers, those little cardboard 
signs with their wonderful phrases ("distinguished and languid"). Your eyes 
glaze over. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the shelf signs says the wine got a gold medal at a wine competition. 
Wow, you think, that has to be good. Oops -- that's strike one. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two decades ago, there were only a tiny handful of wine competitions in 
the United States, and winning a gold medal was worth advertising. Today there 
are literally dozens of wine competitions. Some are good, some are not so good; 
some are small, regional events (like the one that judges only the wines of 
Alameda County), some national (Los Angeles County Fair), some worldwide (San 
Francisco International). 
</P>
<P>
 With so many events, wine lovers should not look at wines that have won a 
single gold medal, but at wines that have received multiple medals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If, for instance, you are seeking an excellent and widely appealing Cabernet 
Sauvignon, you could look at those from 1991 Benziger Winery ($12.50); 1990 
Villa Mt. Eden "Grand Reserve" ($15); 1990 Chateau St. Jean "Cinq Cepages" 
($18); 1990 Kendall-Jackson Winery "Grand Reserve" ($30); 1991 Gary Farrell 
Wines ($18), and 1991 Silverado Vineyards ($17). Each of these wines won at 
least seven medals in the 10 largest U.S. wine competitions, showing 
consistency with a wide range of panels. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, are these six wines any better than 1989 Heitz Cellar 
"Trailside Vineyard" Cabernet ($35)? The Heitz wine won only three medals, but 
each was a gold medal, and the wine was entered in only those three 
competitions! 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, a competition is only as good as its judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Most use panels of four or five persons of varying degrees of skill to 
evaluate wines without sight of the label. In larger groupings (such as those 
with 150 Chardonnays to evaluate), the panels often do a pre-tasting, screening 
wines for potential medal winners. Wines with no chance for a medal are 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This retain/eliminate round can go quickly, since a stinky aroma can 
disqualify a wine without the need to be tasted. But that doesn't mean such a 
round can be easy. At one competition a decade ago, my panel was asked to judge 
252 Chardonnays in one day, an exhausting task. 
</P>
<P>
 In the medal-evaluation rounds of a wine competition, the judges have flights 
of six to 12 wines, served side by side. Among the problems that can occur: The 
first wine of a flight seems to score slightly better than the others because 
the judges have fresher palates; lighter-styled wines judged after far 
weightier ones seem to pale by comparison; fatigue late in a flight can reduce 
the scores of the last wines. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst problem at competitions is that most wines are made to be served 
with food, and usually food is not served. And with such an essential element 
missing, can the results be as valid as when the wines are judged at the dinner 
table? 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it's difficult to get good judges to judge. One West Los Angeles 
wine buyer who has as good a palate as anyone I know judged one competition in 
1985 and was so exhausted after two days he vowed never to judge one again. "No 
amount of money. . . ." he said. And the best wine judge I know, Napa Valley 
wine author Bob Thompson, decided this year to do no more wine competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting harder and harder for me to do the job properly," says Thompson. 
"I can still get good results, but it takes a lot more effort than it used to, 
and I don't want to be Willie Mays finishing up with the Mets." 
</P>
<P>
 So we are left with the wine competitions as a guide. Here are the top 
American medal-winning wines compiled from the various 1994 wine competitions 
in each wine category. Each of the following wines won at least six medals in 
1994.

APPLE CAKE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This fresh apple cake, one of the easiest confections imaginable, is a 
variation on a recipe that has been around for years. The original version 
called for a substantial amount of oil, but my revision substitutes a little 
butter for the oil, with extra grated apples to add moistness. INCREDIBLY MOIST 
FRESH APPLE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 Flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
 Brown sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups peeled, cored, coarsely grated apples (Granny Smith and McIntosh work 
well) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart frozen vanilla yogurt or ice cream 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Spray 8-inch-square baking pan with non-stick vegetable cooking spray. Line 
with sheet of wax paper or parchment paper cut to fit pan. Spray paper with 
cooking spray. Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons flour in pan and shake to coat 
well. Shake out excess flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Cream butter in electric mixer bowl on medium speed. Gradually add 1 cup brown 
sugar, packed. Beat until well blended. Beat in egg, then vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine 1 cup flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt and baking soda in separate bowl. 
Beat into creamed mixture. Batter will be thick. Add grated apples and nuts. 
Mix just until incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees until cake is firm and wood pick inserted into center 
comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove and cool 10 minutes. Invert cake onto 
serving platter and remove pan and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare icing, combine 1/2 cup brown sugar (packed), water, 2 generous 
teaspoons flour and butter in small heavy saucepan. Cook over medium heat, 
stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Pierce top of cake 
with tines of fork and pour icing over cake. Set cake aside to allow icing to 
firm up. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, cut cake into 6 portions and top with scoops of frozen vanilla 
yogurt. Makes 6 servings.

WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY; BUSINESS: ARCADIA'S NEWEST FAST-FOOD JOINT OFFERS BAGELS 
RATHER THAN BURGERS. IT MAY BE THE COUNTRY'S FIRST DRIVE-THROUGH BAGEL BAKERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You drive up to the tinny voice box outside Arcadia's newest fast-food joint 
and blurt out your order. And hold the lox, you say. 
</P>
<P>
 The lox? 
</P>
<P>
 In a new twist on the quintessential California way of eating, Michael and 
Bridget Goldstein have opened what may be the country's first drive-through 
bagel bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's Bagel Bakery opened at 221 N. Santa Anita Ave. in September, the 
second Goldstein's outlet. The original location, a 5-year-old store in Old 
Pasadena, sells 5,000 bagels daily and the new one is even busier, said Michael 
Goldstein, a 40-year-old former stockbroker who now wears shorts and a T-shirt 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I have two kids and we use the drive-through a lot because it's 
convenient," he said. "So we decided if we opened another bakery it would be a 
drive-through." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on initial business, the Arcadia bakery is expected to generate $3 
million in sales annually, twice as much as the Pasadena location with 
one-third of the business generated by the drive-through. "Bagels have replaced 
the doughnut as the food to bring to the office," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its nod to modern eating habits, the 4,000-square-foot Arcadia bakery 
has a sign over the oven doorway that expresses its commitment to traditional 
bagel-making: "A true bagel is boiled then hearth baked." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, total bagel sales exceeded $500 million last year, according to 
the U.S. Department of Commerce and the research firm Information Resources. 
The Goldsteins have ridden the craze, acting as consultants for a new San Dimas 
bagel store -- The Bagelry -- and are talking of starting a separate fast-food 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arcadia bakery until last year was a former dry cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goldsteins leased the site and invested $500,000 in new ovens and 
bagel-making equipment, knocking down an old building behind it for a parking 
lot, creating a patio and a drive-through lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a business you can start with $20,000, I tell people who say they 
want to get in it," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time they started from a shell. In 1989 they leased the San 
Antonio Winery store at Colorado Boulevard and DeLacey Street in Old Pasadena 
and turned the shell into a bakery. In the years since it's become a success as 
the area has become the Westwood of the '90s. "I like to think Old Pasadena 
grew as the bakery grew," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The winery went to court last year in an attempt to end the bakery's lease, 
accusing it of breaching its lease terms on the now highly valuable site. After 
a jury was seated, the winery decided to settle, paying the bakery $70,000 in 
attorney's fees and providing a 40-year lease. "We put $250,000 into the site 
when Old Pasadena was zero and we weren't going to be pushed out," Goldstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "It's a lot less stressful than being a stockbroker."

SENTIMENTAL RENTALS; FOR AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER, MEN ARE FORGOING STANDARD TUXES 
IN FAVOR OF PERIOD PIECES. AS TIME GOES BY, THE CLASSIC VINTAGE OF FORMAL WEAR 
BECOMES EVEN MORE ROMANTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Men who want to stand out in a crowd at this holiday season's black-tie galas 
are skipping the contemporary tux and heading back in time. 
</P>
<P>
 They're visiting vintage clothing stores and seeking out formal wear from 
parties long past. To distinguish themselves from their tuxedo-clad fellows, 
they're sporting everything from classic morning coats of the '20s to those 
scary polyester and pastel-hued tuxedos of the '70s, a favorite with young 
fashion iconoclasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Men are not only recycling vintage tuxedos but all of the frills that go with 
them. They're wearing Art Deco-style stud sets and cuff links, '70s-era tuxedo 
shirts (a fuss of ruffles and pleats), cummerbund sets in loud '60s prints, 
spats from the '20s and top hats from all eras. 
</P>
<P>
 Such out-of-date formal wear is for men who want to be different, who are 
trying to break away from the sameness of the black tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the uniqueness, the style, the old feel to it," says Larry Craig, 
co-owner of Locals Only, a vintage clothing store in Laguna Beach that carries 
old tuxedos and accessories. "It's like you borrowed your father's tux." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there's nothing on the current formal wear market to compare with 
some of the old tuxedos. Where else but a vintage or thrift store to find a gem 
like a '60s-era tuxedo in a colorful brocade or paisley? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some formal wear from the '50s and early '60s was real flashy," Craig says. 
"I've got a tuxedo that's made of woven raw silk in three different colors -- 
black, red and rust." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '50s, tuxedos went from basic black or white to a riot of colors 
and prints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some tuxes in a wood grain moire and taffeta," Craig says. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even demand for the tacky tuxedos of the '70s, with hues like peach 
and powder blue, their wide lapels and bell-bottom pants and their strange 
fabrics. Polyester and velvet jackets are not uncommon for the era. Who would 
wear such a tux? 
</P>
<P>
 "High school kids. They love them," says Michelle Sauer, owner of 
Ragztop-Vintage in Fullerton. "I sell a lot of lime-green tuxedos." 
</P>
<P>
 Men who don't want to stray quite so far from the black-tie norm can opt for 
more classic tuxedos that date from the 1950s to as far back as the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the traditional tux-with-tails, there are cutaway coats that 
taper from the waist in front to long tails circa the 1920s and '30s. Stray Cat 
Vintage & Costume Store in Fullerton has a variety of these tuxedo styles for 
sale or rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around the holidays men like to wear them to Dickens caroling parties," says 
Anna Evans, co-owner of Stray Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to new tuxedos, vintage tuxedos are a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be cheaper to buy a vintage tux than it is to rent a new one," Craig 
says. At Locals Only, silk tuxedo jackets cost $45 and classic white tuxedo 
shirts with pleated fronts go for $17. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Stray Cat's offerings are two tuxedos from the '60s: a black tuxedo with 
an olive green silk shawl collar ($30) and a pink and black plaid tuxedo jacket 
($32). Ragztop has every kind of tuxedo jacket, including funky '70s tuxedos 
for $20 to $100, as well as tuxedo pants for about $20. Gasoline Alley's 
vintage tuxedos range from around $40 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories such as cummerbunds, canes, hats, opera gloves and spats can be 
found at many of the vintage stores. Stray Cat has spats in white felt or 
patent leather with pearl buttons that date from the 1910s to 1940s ($8 to 
$12). 
</P>
<P>
 Locals Only has Art Deco-style sterling and enamel stud sets and cuff links 
from the '30s, as well as kitschy sets adorned with bowling pins and horses 
from the '40s and '50s ($6 to $40). 
</P>
<P>
 "We even have ones with tiki heads from the '60s," Craig says. For more 
conservative tastes, there's also sets made of mother of pearl and black onyx. 
</P>
<P>
 At Gasoline Alley in Orange, there are morning coats with short waists and 
long tails, white dinner jackets, cummerbunds, bow ties, tuxedo pants, shirts 
and hats that date from the 1920s to 1970s. Among the most coveted items are 
the brocade tuxedos from the '50s with skinny shawl collars. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are something nobody else is going to offer," says Dawna Saucedo, owner 
of Gasoline Alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragztop has tuxedo shirts in sherbet hues of raspberry, peach and lemon ($12) 
as well as bow ties, from skinny '50s versions to fat '70s ones, most for only 
a few dollars. To finish the look, try a vintage top hat -- available from 
around $10 to $100 at most shops.

FIRST PERSON: BY DESIGN; THE SHOE NEXT DOOR IS STILL THE MARY JANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't have any blue suede shoes you're liable to step on, but I'd like to 
stick up for Mary Janes, now that these newly fashionable "little girl" shoes 
with a strap across the instep are being criticized by some as inappropriately 
childish for women. 
</P>
<P>
 I first fell in love with Mary Janes at age 10 or so, when my feet were trying 
to inflict permanent damage on a pair of parent-mandated lace-up Oxfords. In 
the hazy scenario Mom outlined, someday I would be able to cast off this 
supportive but ugly chrysalis and happily flaunt the high heels that magically 
transformed girls into women. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a voracious reader, I was intrigued for a while by stories about 
mermaids, who, along with their other virtues, had neatly solved the shoe 
problem. But when I opened Frances Hodgson Burnett's "The Secret Garden," my 
eye went directly to the illustrations of the young heroine -- conveniently 
named Mary -- who wore Mary Janes. 
</P>
<P>
 With their rounded toes, scooped-out tops, slim straps, pretty buckles and 
curving, flat heels, these gleaming black patent leather shoes were objects of 
intense desire. I imagined myself wearing them, skipping merrily to school, 
nonexistent pigtails flying. (Mom also had a thing about short hair.) 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, I kept a bookmark on the illustration showing the best view of the 
most perfect shoes in the world. Next to Mary Janes, even Cinderella's 
transparent pumps paled. After weeks of my pleading, my mother finally broke 
down and drove me to the local shoe store. Did I take the book along to 
compare? Probably not; the Platonic image of Mary Janes had become permanently 
imprinted on my brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the store carried only a clunky country cousin of the magic shoes. They 
were heavy, dark red, verging on the dread oxblood, and they had a thick strap. 
But my mother was disinclined to pursue the Holy Grail of Mary Janehood any 
further. Back home, I compared my clumsily shod foot to the spare, lithe image 
in the book illustrations and sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I got to college, at last old enough -- and sufficiently removed 
from Mom's watchful eye -- to wear any shoes I pleased, high heels were Out. I 
spent years in little boys' lace-up boots, the Doc Martens precursor for young 
American women with small feet. Once you developed a small, permanent callous 
about two inches above the ankle, you could walk comfortably for miles, even in 
snow country. Plus, my boyfriend thought the boots were cute. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the real world of cities, dull, entry-level jobs and massive 
insecurity, I finally became hooked by high heels. Perched painfully on stalks 
of leather-wrapped manufactured materials, mashing the tiny, slippery plastic 
heel tip into oblivion after just a week or so, I grew not only in physical 
stature but in fantasies of authority and worldliness. I tried not to be 
rattled when male strangers offered unaccustomed compliments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, I sat down a lot and begged off errands involving more than a block of 
walking. But I began to crave ever higher heels. Frequent observation of 
stylish women -- I had graduated from book illustrations by then -- suggested 
that the goal was to show off as much as possible of the inside of the heel, 
from a standing position. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, my feet just gave out. Every time I wore heels, a sharp pain radiated 
through the area my dance teacher used to call the metatarsal. My shoes spent 
more time off my feet than on. I had become Immobile Woman, a slave to vanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Years passed. I experimented with the new "comfort" pumps (too ugly), 
sliver-heeled flats, briefly in vogue a few years ago (not enough of a boost 
for a petite woman) and an assortment of low-heeled but uncomfortably 
pointy-toed alternatives. The return of the workmanlike boot was a happy event, 
but mine feel too hot and bulky to wear all day. 
</P>
<P>
 So you can imagine my delight when the shoe of shoes finally joined the 
fashion party this year. And guess what? Mary Janes are still the best. They 
can be both feminine and cool, both sexy and comfortable. They look good on 
long, skinny feet and short, stubby ones. You can get them in weighty, 
rubber-soled, "downtown" versions or in sleek, ladylike styles. 
</P>
<P>
 They come in regular leather, patent leather and imitation leather, but black 
is the color. Some actually have high heels -- but always reassuringly chunky 
ones that let you shift your weight with impunity. The strap keeps them 
securely on your foot. (I used to step right out of my pumps.) And you can buy 
'em for $30 or $130. 
</P>
<P>
 So, please, no more of this silly talk about how Mary Janes are part of the 
infantilization of women's wear, along with such other beloved (and 
flattering!) items as mini skirts and tiny sweaters. So long as we don't sit in 
the dopey, knock-kneed positions of the models in the women's magazines, we 
will look every bit as wise and worldly as we are. But we will feel just a tiny 
bit younger, prettier and fleeter with those fond tokens of girlhood strapped 
to our feet.

BY DESIGN; LEADERS OF THE PACK; SHOULDER THE LOAD WITH WHIMSY. IMAGINATIVE 
CARRY-ALLS TOTE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALISM INTO A MONKEY SUIT OR A PAIR OF WINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Backpacks have become the fashionable alternative to purses this season, 
inspiring designers from the house of Prada to fledgling street-wear labels to 
come up with interpretations that reflect the individuality of its wearer. 
</P>
<P>
 While tiny black satin packs and ones made of exotic skins have been welcomed 
by the well-heeled, the funkier, usually more affordable versions have endeared 
themselves among the young and eclectic. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule: the more unconventional the better. Apparently, no fabrication is 
passed over as designers cut packs from long-haired faux fur, patterned velour, 
metallic vinyl and even colored Astroturf. Teens and twentysomethings are 
raiding the Sesame Street and Disney stores in South Coast Plaza, or their 
younger sibling's closets. A young executive might tote her Day Runner, pager 
and Evian in the secret compartment of a fuzzy monkey on her back. 
</P>
<P>
 These aren't those utilitarian canvas carriers for hauling schoolbooks or 
hiking equipment. But they still serve a practical purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's become an important fashion item because it's much more convenient and 
lets your hands stay free," says Herbie Velez, owner of Pop Icon in New York. 
"No one can snatch it off you without a struggle, and that's something to 
consider in a nightclub or a big city." 
</P>
<P>
 And they don't compare to fanny packs (remember them?), which -- outside an 
athletic setting -- never seemed to look right on anyone. "Backpacks are a lot 
different because you can make more of a statement with them. There are so many 
styles to fit (from) casual to elegant," Velez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Icon was among the first to market the kiddie-style Mr. Friendly backpack 
to adult ravers at the turn of the decade. Accessories and images relating to 
children have long appealed to the rave culture. That childlike items such as 
Mary Janes and flowery barrettes have found a wider market among fad slaves 
this year has helped make backpacks, especially whimsical ones, into wardrobe 
staples. 
</P>
<P>
 Velez followed with "Mr. Tuff," a vinyl knapsack that resembles a washing 
detergent box. Sporting a Pop Icon pack once meant you had bagged it at the Big 
Apple, but this summer the goofy backpacks went nationwide. They will not 
appear at your local mall, warns Velez, but only cool, exclusive shops, such as 
Polyester in Laguna Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Club deejay Sean Perry began wearing a Mr. Friendly four years ago to carry 
his water bottle, keys, pictures, headphones and 45 singles. To his spin gigs 
at the Empire Ballroom in Costa Mesa and Dragonfly in Santa Monica, he now 
carries a vinyl pumpkin-orange pack his "ultra-stylish" roommate gave him 
("It's way too trendy for me," he quips). 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, 26, sees backpacks as almost a requisite accessory in the club scene.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been more out of practicality than fashion," he says. The advent 
of the trend, however, draws on "both those reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's this balance between function and fashion that makes backpacks an 
inherently '90s item in a decade that continues to be dominated by retro 
rehash. (Reports from Milan to New York hail the return of World War II-era 
glamour for spring '95.) Boots might recall the '70s, a dress the '30s and a 
hairdo the '60s, but the wild pouch in zebra velveteen is undeniably of this 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they're favored by men and women. Black Flys of Costa Mesa 
manufactured backpacks from new, vintage-inspired upholstery fabric for its 
mostly male, snowboard clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we'd do it for (guys)," says owner Jack Martinez, "but the girl's 
market just picked up on them. Now we can't keep them in stock." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a '90s thing now," confirms Dana Harvey.  
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy a custom order for a pair of angel wings a friend needed for an 
event, the Costa Mesa designer cut a pair from quilted vinyl. The response 
encouraged him to produce more for his Angel Boy label. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conceptually, it's kind of a liberating thing -- growing out of your purse, 
getting your wings and then flying free of any restrictions," Harvey says. 
"With a backpack, you just throw it on and go."

BEHIND THE SCENES: DISCO DISCOURSE, MANIFESTO DESTINY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the tradition of pairing fashion and fund-raising, about 800 trendy 
club-goers got the chance Friday to preview fall styles and groove to old and 
new disco at the Empire Ballroom in Costa Mesa -- all in the name of charity, 
of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Nightclub promoters Robert Frias and Shervin Talieh combined a can drive for 
the Salvation Army with their "Winter Style Manifesto" fashion show. Guests 
brought a can of food, saved a few bucks at the door and got to munch on 
appetizers from Piccola Cucina. In return, South Coast Plaza stores Cignal, 
In-Wear Matinique and Charles Jourdan and Laguna Beach boutique Soho showed the 
captive audience their winter wares. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the sartorial manifesto of these shops, men and women will 
suit up in basic black or a palette of earthy browns and ivory. Hemlines, for 
evening and day, show plenty of leg; trousers cut in a slim silhouette are the 
alternative. For him, the key is layers: a vest, a jacket and possibly a 
leather overcoat. 
</P>
<P>
 These clothes are wearable, practical and mostly classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion-lovers (that's with a capital F) had to wait for the second part of 
the show for the glamour and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus was supposed to close in on the chic and seductive 'dos styled by 
Carlton Hair International in Crystal Court, Costa Mesa. But it was the 
fabulous dresses by Costa Mesa designer Sandra Harvey that drove the crowd mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Models slinked down the catwalk wrapped in shiny patent jersey, velvet matte 
jersey, silk charmeuse and stretch silk velvet. Harvey included her signature 
accessory -- ostrich boas -- in a striking green. The evening touted a debut of 
the new faces of Public Models, Newport Beach's model agency. Most seemed best 
tuned for runway, while others apparently wanted to be a model or just look 
like one. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned: Organizers plan repeat performances featuring other designers and 
charities in coming months. ROSE APODACA JONES

HOT PROPS: CHARACTER EXPOSURE

 For those who take the fashion of a mood ring or Mickey Mouse tie seriously, 
there's the new Mad boutique in Long Beach. Along funky 4th Street, Mad stocks 
the kind of kitsch that makes collectors and kids alike go, well, mad. Find a 
Betty Boop coin purse ($3) and watch ($40) or a purse shaped like her head 
($22). Time watchers can also strap on a piece featuring Speed Racer, the Cisco 
Kid and Red Ryder ($58 to $64). Owner Charlie Trujillo, 28, says she looks for 
"oddities." Among reproduction and antique toys is "stuff," such as plastic 
fingertips, boxing nun puppets and vintage rhinestone jewelry. "It's for those 
who have a sense of humor," Trujillo says. Looking around the shop, her glance 
stops at a rubber rat with its bloody schnoz caught in a trap. The rat's 
motorized body contorts realistically. "You definitely need a sense of humor to 
shop here," she says. A Rebel Gets Roots 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Sam Smith has been a fixture on the county's home shopping circuit, 
driving clothes to customer's homes and offices under the Rebel Smith banner. 
Today that era comes to an end with the opening of the Rebel Smith Collection 
"more than just clothes" store in Fullerton's Villa del Sol center. "I was 
carrying too many lines, and I decided I needed a home," Smith says. "You can 
only do so much going to someone's house." And Smith will do much with the 
700-square-foot space: She will feature many designers she's carried over the 
years, in addition to jewelry boxes, pewter items, candles and picture frames. 
The grand opening tea and champagne reception will be held over three days, 
from 2 to 5 p.m. daily. Today, meet retro children's wear designer Andrea of 
Acouts Design; the program continues Friday with Jassa and Saturday with 
Claudio Pollero, both women's clothing designers. Not Just Beans 
</P>
<P>
 Coffeehouses have tried to offer more than just a frothy cup of gourmet beans 
by providing live music, games and books. But owners Dan Barrett and Robert 
Hamparyan of Not Just Java in Newport Beach want to also entertain the 
sartorial needs of their caffeine-driven customers. In addition to pool tables, 
a pinball machine, a TV and a CD juke box, NJJ has a boutique. The tiny shop is 
filled with glamorous rings, sun dresses, vintage items, J Crew bikini tops, 
vests made of old ties, cut-off Levi's, decorated bustiers, essential oils and 
beaded chokers. Local labels 26 Red and Sandra Harvey also keep a rack crammed 
with fabulous finds. "I didn't want it to be like any other coffeehouse," 
Barrett says. Located at the edge of the Lido Marina Village -- home to three 
major nightclubs -- NJJ gets its share of hipsters, especially since it closes 
long after the clubs. "It's a place where club-goers can get a cup of joe, 
browse and buy something at 3 a.m.," he says. ROSE APODACA JONES

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; NIGHT OF THE ROUND TABLES; CAMELOT-THEMED GALA AND 
AUCTION SUPPORT PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 500 lords and ladies -- all supporters of the Pediatric Cancer 
Research Foundation -- gathered at round tables Saturday for "An Evening in 
Camelot." 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeters in medieval garb heralded guests in front of the Westin South Coast 
Plaza in Costa Mesa for the foundation's 11th annual "Bid for Kids" 
dinner-dance. The $150-per-person gala was expected to net $175,000 for the 
pediatric cancer research laboratory at Children's Hospital of Orange County in 
Orange. One Brief, Shining Gala 
</P>
<P>
 The Westin's ballroom was transformed for the evening into a medieval castle, 
with imitation stone turrets, coats of armor and banners that honored the names 
of underwriters. All that was missing was a moat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose the 'Camelot' theme because it had a lot of hope in it," said Laurie 
Riggs, event co-chairwoman. "Camelot was a happy place." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were greeted by foundation volunteers dressed as knights of the realm. 
After bidding on items at a silent auction (including an autographed 8-by-10 
glossy of Robert Goulet -- King Arthur himself), they gathered like knights at 
round tables adorned with royal purple cloths and towering gold candlesticks. 
There, they raised their goblets of wine and enjoyed a "King Arthur's Feast" -- 
medallions of beef with figs and a port wine sauce and a "Sword in the Stone" 
layered lemon dessert. Fighting a Villain 
</P>
<P>
 "Bid for Kids" is a fund-raiser that helps combat what foundation president 
Jeff Dankberg described as "an intolerable villain": cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda MacDonald, event co-chairwoman, got involved with the foundation after 
losing her 12-year-old son, Michael, to cancer in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came down with leukemia and passed away 10 months later," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said honorary chairman Russell Leatherby (MacDonald's brother-in-law): "After 
you've gone through something like that, it's hard not to get involved. This is 
a night of celebrating heroes -- the kids, the families, the doctors, the 
nurses and the rest of the staff at CHOC." 
</P>
<P>
 A sobering reminder of the gala's purpose came after dinner, when a slide show 
featuring pictures of the research lab and young cancer patients was shown on a 
big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping for a fairy-tale ending -- a cure for cancer," Riggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were Mitchell Cairo, director of cancer research at CHOC, and his 
wife, Ellen; Susan Reid, executive director of the foundation, and her husband, 
Graham; Leonard and Susie Buchan, who attended with their 16-year-old son Kent, 
a cancer patient; Brian Lee, Glenn and Jane Fowler, Don and Kathi Roberson, 
Dave and Marilee Edgar, Corey and Judy Cramin, Bruce and Erin Wagner, Doug and 
Karen Murphy, Scott and Cindy Jones, Jim Weisenbach, Karen Packer, Ellen 
Jackson, Sharon Bergeron, Cary and Michelle Sarnoff, Ellen Thompson, John and 
Karen Vallely and Larry Socea. KATHRYN BOLD

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: ANOTHER OF COUNTY'S MANY SURPRISES SURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you think that you have sized up our county, taken the measure of 
the place, it does something startling: Its leaves change colors, its sunset 
over the water becomes a fluorescent shade of vermilion while its hills turn a 
stately gold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the man-made realm, new restaurants open, strip malls and civic centers 
sprout, and underwater vessels creep around the harbor. Underwater vessels? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure our readers will be as surprised as I was to learn that a submarine 
is operating off our waters," said Jeff Meyers, who wrote this week's 
Centerpiece story on the Delta, a tiny, locally owned and operated underwater 
vessel that is rented out for scientific and other research. 
</P>
<P>
 "I climbed into the Delta and checked out the instruments, but declined the 
opportunity to submerge. No, thank you. I get claustrophobic in the shower," 
Meyers said. "But inside the sub's cramped quarters, I did allow my imagination 
to shift into high gear, pretending I was 20,000 leagues under the Santa 
Barbara Channel. 'Up periscope. Ready torpedo tubes. Range 1,000 yards. Fire!' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think that this is some Trident-class nuclear submarine Meyers was 
having a Jules Verne-like fantasy in, the Delta is anything but. In fact, you 
could fit it in the trunk of the average 20-year-old American-made car, which 
isn't to say that the sub isn't well-equipped or that its owner / operators 
aren't expected to perform remarkable feats of daring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by the casual attitude of the aquamen, Rich Slater and Doug 
Privett," Meyers said. "Both are blase about their underwater exploits, 
ignoring the danger accompanying them on every dive. Their lightheartedness is 
reflected in the bumper sticker on their office wall: 'I brake for rockfish.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mapping underwater faults, taking inventories of various species of marine 
life, retrieving scientific instruments, searching for sunken treasure -- all 
in an itty-bitty contraption that looks like something that should be in Toon 
Town. It might seem like a dream job but apparently not. From what Slater said 
to Meyers, it's just another day, another sand dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though submarining may seem glamorous and romantic, Slater says it gets 
pretty routine," Meyers said. "What he said to me was, 'It's a job after a 
while. Whether you're off Santa Barbara or Tahiti, you're on the ocean. I'd 
much rather work at home. The best thing is meeting a lot of neat people over 
the years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Life: Earthwatch columnist Richard Kahlenberg was up to his 
elbows in locally grown dried beans, Fashion columnist Kathleen Williams 
examined yard ornaments, and Shop Talk columnist Julie Sawyer went through 
racks of earth- and wallet-friendly fashions.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: NAME-DROPPING IN A GOOD CAUSE; MUSICIANS WHO'VE BEEN PLAYING 
AS SKY KING AND CAUGHT RED HANDED SETTLE ON USE OF THE LATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's finally official. Fans of singer Troy Robinson and all of the previous 
incarnations of those popular country bands -- Sky King and Caught Red Handed 
-- can rest easy. The dating period is over. The engagement was a success. And 
the wedding is set for the first of the year. Meanwhile, they're happy just 
livin' together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sky King is kaput after Dec. 31 -- we're going to call ourselves just plain 
Caught Red Handed," said Rob Wilson, lead vocalist and guitarist with Sky King. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning last February from a yearlong stint as an ostrich farmer in 
his native Oklahoma, Robinson, the popular co-founder of Caught Red Handed, has 
played every gig except Lompoc and the Galleon Room with Sky King. And club 
owners wanting to cash in on his name recognition were billing the group as 
Troy Robinson "with" or "and" Caught Red Handed, disregarding Sky King 
completely. (The previous members of Caught Red Handed eventually joined other 
bands, including Sky King, after Robinson's departure for Oklahoma.) 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians finally decided to end the confusion after showing up at Port 
Hueneme for a K-Hay radio event in which they were booked as Sky King. Seeing 
Robinson with the group, "(Deejay) Mark James said, 'But this is Caught Red 
Handed,' " Wilson recalled. "The only difference was Troy was with us. But it 
was just getting too hard for the people to understand what's what." 
</P>
<P>
 So Robinson will play rhythm guitar and front the five-piece group as he did 
with his own original lineup of Caught Red Handed. Joining him are the members 
of Sky King: Wilson on lead guitar, bass player Ron Robinson (Troy's cousin), 
Alan Flaa on pedal steel guitar and Randy Guzcman on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. A great band by any other name will still be a great band. 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard them a couple of times since March and they sounded fine. The 
band's trademark vocal harmonies and Flaa's pedal steel licks really enhance 
those slow couple-clutcher dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for original tunes by the Robinson cousins and Wilson in the near future 
and more Los Angeles appearances. And after the first of the year, Caught Red 
Handed will play the Crazy Horse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Thunder 105.5 radio will be playing "Hard Work Havin' Fun," a West 
Coast Swing cut from Troy Robinson's mini compact disc. The four-song CD was 
recorded in June with Nashville-based producer Clyde Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that this is gonna be a great Caught Red Handed vocal band 
because everybody can sing lead and a lot of harmonies," said Robinson. Yep -- 
but he still gets to wear the cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Platte River Crossing has gone on to bigger and better things since moving to 
Nashville. Thunder 105.5 deejay Bob Allen just broke a second single, "High 
Life," off the band's debut CD called "Sleepin' With My Boots On." And you can 
catch them live Nov. 28 through Dec. 3 in Las Vegas at Boulder Station, a huge 
new country-western club. 
</P>

 Allen is currently playing a cut from Troy Robinson's mini CD during his 
afternoon drive-time slot. "Everywhere you go you can hear national artists," 
said Allen. "But I want to also highlight talented local people because there's 
an abundance of good local bands." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster Entertainment has the same opinion. Beginning next week, the four 
Ventura County locations of Blockbuster Music -- Thousand Oaks, Ventura, Simi 
Valley and Oxnard -- will carry tapes and CDs by local bands, including country 
bands, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 At headquarters in Florida, Blockbuster Music President Gerry Weber confirmed 
the move: "This is going to be a nationwide rollout. We're going to feature 
local artists in all of our stores to give an opportunity to local artists to 
be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said they have already been doing that in some parts of the country 
since taking over Music Plus and several other chains two years ago. The chain 
has introduced music sampling, which allows the customer to bring up any CD -- 
not tape -- to the sample bar and listen before deciding to buy. And you'll 
soon be able to sample local groups, too. According to Linda Oh, salesperson in 
the Thousand Oaks store, fans can also order tapes and CDs of local artists as 
long as they are distributed by a label -- even independents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bands can't just walk in with an armload of their stuff and expect us to 
stock it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Country music is selling so well that the Thousand Oaks store plans to double 
the section size after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cousin's Country Saloon in Simi Valley will be under new management by 
mid-December. Mark Lucatorto, one of the new owners, told me they plan to 
remodel the stage and sound system. And they'll swap the cafeteria-style chairs 
and tables for tall, round tables and stools. Lucatorto said dance lessons will 
continue: "We're bringing in some bigger name local bands and some that have 
opened for the major artists. And we're contemplating bringing in comedians one 
night a month." 
</P>

NIGHT LIFE: A HARD-WORKING HOBO MAKES CAMP IN VENTURA; THE BERKELEY POP-ROCK 
GROUP WITH PUNK INFLUENCES AND A SKA BACKGROUND JOINS A BILL AT NICHOLBY'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Big Bad Voodoo Daddy usually packs Nicholby's in Ventura, site of its CD 
release party and probably the band's favorite venue. Those fans who aren't 
fashionably late to Friday's gig can avoid the long line down the stairs and 
see a very good opening pop-rock band, Hobo. No bum jokes this time, because 
often the only difference between an upstanding citizen and a derelict is a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobo is four guys with day jobs, hoping for more night work. All Berkeley 
locals, the band consists of Eric Dinwiddie (guitar, vocals), Paul Jackson 
(keyboards, vocals), Ben Eastwood (bass, vocals) and Tom Pope (drums, vocals). 
While the majority of bands have one or no good singers, Hobo has four. 
</P>
<P>
 All but the drummer used to be in a ska band called the Uptones, which made a 
lot of people dance until Hobo came along. The band signed with its hometown 
label, S.O.B. (Son of Berserkley), a record label resurrected by the same owner 
seven years after the demise of Berserkley Records, onetime home to the Greg 
Kihn Band and Jonathan Richman, among others. Hobo has a self-titled album and 
another is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson spoke about those four bums in Hobo during a recent phone interview in 
which he said the album is "doing pretty well. It's been out a year now. We've 
been up to Oregon, Washington and British Columbia a few times -- a couple of 
stations have picked it up. It's moving us along." 
</P>
<P>
 What's Hobo music like? 
</P>
<P>
 It's like punk and pop rock in a rock 'n' roll setting. It's a four-piece that 
offers some new sounds, I think. 
</P>
<P>
 What's up with S.O.B. Records? 
</P>
<P>
 Our album was the first S.O.B. release. There's been a couple of other 
releases -- one is Linda Brady, sort of a folk singer with an all-star 
Berserkeley band backing her up. Then there's Repulsa, sort of a heavy-metal 
(band). Our next one will be the label's fourth release. With a small label, 
money is always a factor. But I only live two blocks from the office, so it's 
sort of like it's my label in a way, and not like some big bureaucracy. I've 
known the owner, Matthew Kaufman, for years. He's in it with us, so it's not 
like some voice at the other end of the phone in a big building somewhere. 
Also, I work at a lamp shop two blocks from the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a Berkeley sound? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's certainly a lot of bands coming out of this area. The Counting 
Crows are a huge success. Green Day is just taking off. Our record came out the 
same time theirs did. We hope we'll be next. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you guys quit ska too soon? 
</P>
<P>
 We were at the front of that wave. It was us -- The Uptones -- up here and the 
Untouchables down there. Then Fishbone came along, but they're not ska anymore. 
We just wanted to become more of a songwriting unit instead of just a dance 
band. But there's always going to be a market for ska because there's always 
going to be kids that want to go out and dance. But there's yet to be a ska 
hit. You have to go for it in this business, and a hit record is what we're 
after. Hobo has been around longer than I'd like to admit -- five or six years. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the plan? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the plan was to put out the first one to kind of open the door for us. 
Now we want to become more of a working live band. We're ready to record our 
second album. It's going to be a different type of album. We're going to record 
it live at our rehearsal studio. It's going to be quite a bit rawer than the 
first one. We're shooting for a January release date, but February is more 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you do when people ask for Uptones songs? 
</P>
<P>
 We do a couple of Uptones songs. There's two of them on the album, and we're 
working on a couple more. We just rock them up a little bit. When the place is 
packed, the people seem to enjoy dancing. But we're used to that because we 
were in a ska band. Others just like to sit and listen, and we always get 
applause. We're a class act. 
</P>
<P>
 What was your paying-your-dues gig? 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it had to be at Whistler, a ski resort in British Columbia. It was 
Christmastime and we thought it would be a great gig. We ended up playing for 
the bartender and one drunk guy who never turned around. And we had to play 
three sets. We were there three days, but at least the bartender got us drunk 
and we got to go skiing. That one was definitely the weirdest. I think next 
time, we'd rather have Nirvana and the Beatles open up for us at the Oakland 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the songwriting process for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Both Eric and I write and sing, pretty much 50-50. Usually, I sing what I 
write and he sings what he writes, but sometimes we trade off. Sometimes a song 
will start off as a title or a riff or just an idea, then you just go with it. 
We have, probably, 60 of our own songs. We do a couple of covers -- one by the 
Eddie & the Hot Rods, one by the Clash, one by Ian Hunter and a Beatles song. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you guys get a gig in Ventura? 
</P>
<P>
 Our booking agent, Elvis -- yes, he's still alive -- got it for us. I think he 
just sent some stuff to the venue. I'm not sure -- I work all the time. Details

SIGHTS; LANDSCAPES ARE FOCUS OF CALIFORNIA ART CLUB EXHIBIT; THOUGH THE SHOW 
LACKS STRONG POINTS OF VIEW, IT BOASTS AN ENDEARING INNOCENCE, WITH SEVERAL 
STANDOUT PIECES IN THE PACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 California, ever the youth-obsessed locale, has a love-hate relationship with 
history, especially when it comes to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the California Art Club was established in 1909, making it "the 
oldest art club west of the Mississippi River," could be taken for a sign of 
venerability. But instead, suspicions tend to arise. A lot has happened to art, 
and our definitions thereof, since 1909. 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetics in the 20th Century have often been focused on the new, the now, 
and what's next rather than on matters of longevity and bygone standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions pop up. Why a focus on California? (Members must be residents.) Why 
a club for a demographic so patently individualistic as artists? 
</P>
<P>
 The current exhibition at the Carnegie Art Museum, displaying paintings by 
early club members and new works by current members, answers these questions 
and tells a story that is sometimes fascinating, even when the art itself is 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 The club began as a celebration of the many artists in this state who relished 
the landscape by painting in the plein-air tradition. This was, of course, 
before the onslaught of cityscapes and suburbia on the Californian topography. 
Presently, plein-air in this area might well be tainted air. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back gallery we find a bounty of tranquil vintage landscapes. Works 
such as William Wendt's 1912 painting "Along the Arroyo Seco," a 
picture-perfect, idyllic green afternoon, or Colin Campbell Cooper's 
impressionistic view of the great, gentle outdoors elicit a pleasant sensation. 
Works by Cooper, Kathryn Leighton and Paul Lauritz have been brought up from 
the Carnegie's own collection. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the tide of modernism pushed artists away from 19th-Century values of 
fine art and away from the landscape tradition, the club apparently became 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a safe harbor from the shifting intellectual base of art history, an 
enclave for representational artists who were left out in the cold -- both by 
their artistic instincts and their distance from the art world brain center of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to the 1990s. Upstairs at the museum are pieces by current club members. 
As a whole, the fare here leans toward the pretty -- and pretty tame, by 
existing modern-day, post-post-modern standards. You don't get a sense of 
authority questioned or archetypes re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, there is an endearing innocence put forth in these 
landscapes and traditional subjects. Implicit in the gallery is the notion that 
painting is not dead or even ailing. But if this segment of the show, on the 
whole, suffers from a lack of muscularity or strong points of view, there are 
standout pieces in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 In John Comer's "Waves and Aloes," tiny surfers ride waves tucked away behind 
atavistic plant life choking the foreground. Meredith Abbott's "Eucalyptus and 
Country Back" is a landscape enlivened by a dramatically muted dispersal of 
light, giving it an almost mystical ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise with Richard Brodie's affectingly dreamlike "Sumac and Lone Oak in 
the Topanga Firebreak." In addition to its subtle contextual message -- beauty 
found along the firebreak -- Brodie's work is a thing of swarthy, painterly 
poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 If this exhibition is all about self-preservation of outsiders and 
club-consciousness by style and residency, the concurrent exhibition now up at 
the Carnegie goes full steam ahead in the opposite direction. Harry Hurwitz, 
who has made his mark as a filmmaker but has also worked steadily in the visual 
arts, comes across in this sizable showing of his art as a quirky and 
creatively restless sort, with a taste for the surreal and the dryly comic. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, film references leap out, from images of Chaplin to the 
parade of trench-coated men making up the pen-and-ink "Film Noir." Often, 
Hurwitz's figures and faces appear distorted, as if shot through odd camera 
lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more memorable works stem from an internal dream logic that is less 
cinematic than it is psychological. "The Secret Dreams of Plants" finds an 
apparitional turn-of-the-century dandy floating above a field of flowers. 
Better yet, a mad giddiness informs his piece, "The Clown's Dream," with its 
hollow-headed clown set, irrationally, against a forest scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative license runs charmingly amok in works such as his cigar box 
assemblages, including a self-portrait in a box. 
</P>
<P>
 Off in a corner is an etching from 1960 entitled "The Creative Process," an 
intricately rendered drawing of some fanciful edifice in which architecture 
gives way to crazed plumbing schemes, organ pipes instead of pillars, a band 
and gymnasts on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the Carnegie is "A Piece of Painting," an installation/documentation 
from Ventura-based choreographer Pamela Pilkenton. Pilkenton dutifully 
documents her 1992 performance/dance/painting piece in which dancers dance 
while painters splash their white garments. 
</P>
<P>
 That striking piece, performed in various spots in Ventura County and in Los 
Angeles, is brought back to life here through video and actual artifacts -- the 
paint-splashed fabric in question. To bring the piece up to date, in real time, 
a performance took place in the museum itself. What would the California Art 
Club founders have thought? Details

THEATER REVIEW; A FRESH-FACED SOPRANO RISES TO THE ROLE OF LILI IN 'CARNIVAL'; 
ERIN APPLING IS A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO LESLIE CARON AND ANNA MARIE ALBERGHETTI. 
THE SHOW HAS PLENTY OF TALENT AND SPECTACLE.

 A naive orphaned waif named Lili joins a down-and-out traveling carnival. She 
immediately develops a crush on the flamboyant magician, the relationship 
watched from the sidelines by an embittered puppeteer. That's the story of 
"Carnival," a colorful musical now playing at the Conejo Players Theater in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the players' current season, it was one of two ambitious musicals 
opening last weekend in Thousand Oaks -- only a few miles apart, in fact. 
Fortunately for those who feel compelled to attend "The Music Man" before it 
closes this weekend, there still will be a chance to see "Carnival," which runs 
until early December. 
</P>
<P>
 The raw material for "Carnival" began as a Saturday Evening Post short story 
by Paul Gallico and subsequently turned into the hit 1953 film musical "Lili," 
with Leslie Caron in the title role. It was then adapted as a Broadway musical 
for the 1962 season. That version had a new libretto by Michael Stewart (then 
enjoying the success of "Bye, Bye Birdie," as was director Gower Champion). The 
new songs were by veteran Tin Pan Alley tunesmith Bob Merrill, best known at 
the time for such hits as "(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window," 
"Honeycomb" and "If I Knew You Were Comin', I'd Have Baked a Cake," as well as 
Broadway shows "New Girl in Town" and "Take Me Along." He later wrote the 
lyrics for "Funny Girl" and "Sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Players' version, directed by Pamela Matheson, stars Erin Appling 
as Lili. In a role the fresh-faced soprano might have been born to play, 
Appling is a worthy successor to Caron and Broadway star Anna Marie 
Alberghetti. This is her first major musical role in the county after several 
seasons at the Moorpark Melodrama, and she certainly rises to the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Holmes and Michael Sollazzo co-star -- Holmes as the carnival's magician 
and resident Lothario, Marco the Magnificent, and Sollazzo as Paul Berthalet, 
once a famous dancer but injured in The War, crippling his leg and his ego. A 
talented puppeteer, Paul thinks of the carnival as "the bottom of the barrel; a 
hiding place for all the misfits on the planet." His sunnier side, such as it 
is, comes through when he's behind the curtain, speaking through puppets Carrot 
Top and Horrible Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 (Old-timers in the audience might spot the resemblance of Paul's act to that 
of "Kukla, Fran and Ollie," a popular show in the early days of television; 
Gallico had dedicated his story to Fran Allison and creator-puppeteer Burr 
Tillstrom). 
</P>
<P>
 Also featured are Scott Mansfield, affecting the show's only French accent as 
Paul's co-puppeteer; Natalie Holcomb as Marco's brassy longtime assistant and 
frustrated lover; and Bill Clark as the carnival's owner and ringmaster. The 
huge supporting cast and chorus include several circus-type acts, notably 
juggler Lorry Faulkner, gymnast Jodi Johnson and a dancer -- played by Lady Jan 
Faulkner -- who spends much of her time onstage with a live boa constrictor 
wrapped around her. 
</P>
<P>
 (The name of the troupe's mascot cat, Selsdon, is missing from the current 
program, and the snake appeared to be wearing a particularly contented smile on 
Saturday night. Don't worry: According to Conejo Players sources, Selsdon has 
simply retired). 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Saxer is the show's musical director, with a large orchestra hidden 
somewhere offstage, and Deirdre Richards is the choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's ambitious but unmemorable songs may be its weakest point, though 
"Carnival" did produce the sort-of hit "Love Makes the World Go Round." But 
there's plenty of talent and spectacle on hand here, and it's doubtful that any 
but the youngest viewers will be bored by this fine production. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Conejo Players Theater, 351 S. Moorpark Road, Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

CENTERPIECE: TAKING THE PLUNGE; THE DELTA, A JULES VERNE-STYLE SUB-FOR-HIRE, 
PLUMBS OCEAN DEPTHS DOING SCIENTIFIC TASKS AND SEARCHING FOR SUNKEN TREASURE 
FROM ITS BASE AT VENTURA HARBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An on-board crane gently lifts the little yellow submarine off the mother ship 
and plops it into Ventura Harbor. Climbing down to the sub, a burly 
silver-haired man squeezes into the conning tower, closes the hatch and 
circumnavigates the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists on the docks stop to gawk at the strange metal craft, no bigger than 
a compact car. Somebody asks, "Can you rent one of those?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is yes. But your harbor cruise will cost $3,500 a day, with another 
$3,000 for the mother ship, plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The sub-for-hire is the pocket-size Delta, which, despite its Disneyesque 
appearance, is a serious research vessel. Certified to dive to 1,200 feet, it 
is used primarily for scientific endeavors -- mapping underwater earthquake 
faults, tracking crab populations. But the two-man sub is also rented for more 
exotic missions, such as searching for sunken Spanish galleons or exploring 
fabled wrecks such as the Lusitania and the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to guys every year wanting us to find Amelia Earhart," says Rich 
Slater, the man inside the sub. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, a 57-old marine geologist, is not looking for the missing aviator in 
Ventura Harbor. He is taking the Delta on a short test run before its midnight 
departure aboard the mother ship Cavalier, a 110-foot utility vessel leased 
from Buccaneer Marine Ltd. of Ventura. Slater's company, Delta Oceanographics 
of Oxnard, has been contracted by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to 
find lost current-reading instruments in the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't a lot of work out there" for subs, says Slater's partner, Doug 
Privitt, a taciturn, self-taught sub-builder. "But there's enough to keep us 
busy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Delta is one of only a handful of private research subs in use today and 
probably the most active, Slater says. Stubby, ungainly but remarkably safe, 
the Delta has logged 85 dive-days and 318 dives this year and close to 3,500 
dives in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 1/2-foot, 5,000-pound steel cylinder looks like the brainchild of Jules 
Verne's Capt. Nemo in "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" but was actually designed 
and built by the 63-year-old Privitt. It has 19 bug-eyed ports and several 
protuberances, including mechanical and hydraulic arms. Eight 12-volt batteries 
power the screw, producing a cruising speed of only 1 1/2 knots, a slow walk. 
</P>
<P>
 British sports cars are roomier than the Delta. Instruments such as sonar, a 
computerized navigation system, gyroscope and Fathometer line the sub's 
interior. The pilot sits on a bench amidships, his head poking up into the 
conning (observation) tower. Wedged in, the passenger has to curl up in the 
padded nose section. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hatch is sealed shut and the Delta drops into the black ocean on a 
quarter-mile descent, the pilot and passenger look through 1 1/2-inch-thick 
Plexiglas, their field of vision illuminated for 20 or 30 feet by two 
side-mounted lights. The pilot controls his depth by either filling storage 
compartments with water or using compressed air to empty them. Regardless of 
the depth, the pressure inside the Delta remains at one atmosphere, the same as 
on land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sub's a simple design," Slater says. "Everything's mechanical." THE 
TREASURE SEEKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Slater figures that 95% of Delta's work is scientific -- it does a lot of 
diving for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -- and the 
rest of its time is devoted to "the wild-goose people." It seems everybody with 
a treasure map and a snorkel knows Delta's Oxnard phone number. Slater and 
Privitt are continually approached by speculators who want them to lower their 
rates in exchange for a percentage of the alleged booty. Occasionally, they 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gold always sounds good to us," Slater says. 
</P>
<P>
 But they haven't got rich. Once, they were lured to Florida by a treasure 
hunter's secret map, but "all we found were a lot of fish holes," Privitt says 
sardonically. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Delta went looking for the Brother Jonathan, a paddle-wheel 
steamer that sank in 1865 off the Northern California coast, supposedly with $2 
million in gold and $250,000 in U.S. Army payroll on board. With Chris Ijames 
and Slater's son Dave taking turns piloting the Delta, and Privitt along as 
observer, they found the wreck "not where it was supposed to be," Privitt says. 
"Everybody else had looked in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there treasure aboard? Nobody knows, says Slater, because the state is 
holding up exploration of the wreck pending a court battle over salvage rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater has been tempted to go after the San Jose, "the richest Spanish galleon 
of all time," he says. The ship rests somewhere at the bottom of the sea near 
Cartagena, Colombia. But treasure hunters are deterred by the Colombian 
government, which would insist on keeping the San Jose's contents and putting 
them in a museum, Slater says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people approached us about sneaking into Colombia," Tackett says. "No 
way we're going down there illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater says they could pull it off. Privitt gasps. "No way I wanna spend time 
in a Colombian prison." 
</P>
<P>
 The Delta's crew faces hazards and potential disaster on every mission, but 
the sub has never had an accident. "I don't have any worries about the 
integrity of the sub," says Ijames, a 35-year-old Santa Barbara resident who 
regularly pilots the Delta. "It's a real workhorse -- you can even bang around 
rocks. My only worry is getting tangled." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1993, Ijames got tangled. The Delta was diving off the Irish 
coast, doing work for marine biologist Robert Ballard who was filming a 
National Geographic TV special about the Lusitania, the British luxury liner 
that was sunk by a German U-boat in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Delta's second dive of the day, an old line snagged the sub's tail at 
300 feet. But Ijames didn't panic. Privitt had designed a safety feature for 
this very predicament. Ijames simply unscrewed the tail from inside the sub and 
the tail dropped off, freeing the sub, which bobbed to the surface. About an 
hour later, the crew guided the Delta -- now fitted with a backup tail -- to 
the wreck and retrieved the missing piece. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Delta becomes disabled, a 180-pound lead weight can be jettisoned, 
allowing the vessel to rise to the surface. If some alien force drags the Delta 
down, it is capable of withstanding pressure at 1,800 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaks do occur. "Minor leaks once a while," Privitt says. "No big deal. I just 
hitch up my drawers." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough oxygen is on board to keep the crew alive for 72 hours and give rescue 
workers the necessary time to reach the sub, Slater says. But despite 
precautions and safety measures, tragedy can strike without warning. In 1970, 
he and Privitt were each piloting a Nekton sub, a forerunner of the Delta, on 
an assignment to recover a racing boat off Catalina. After the boat was hauled 
up to a surface ship, it broke loose, plummeted at an angle and collided with 
the submerged Nekton. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a one-in-a-million chance of it hitting us," Slater says. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision cracked a port by Slater's head, and the glass imploded. It 
gouged the right side of his face and a rush of water flooded the sub, which 
plunged to the bottom, 225 feet below the surface. Dazed, Slater was able to 
open the hatch. He and his crewman scrambled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think was, 'I've got four kids -- I have to get back to the 
surface,' " Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crewman didn't make it, but Slater, an experienced diver, ascended for 2 
1/2 or 3 minutes before reaching daylight, he estimates. He was found floating 
face down, unconscious and not breathing. He was treated at a Catalina 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, whose face still bears the scars of the accident, is listed in the 
Guinness Book of World Records under the category "Underwater Escape . . . the 
greatest depth of an actual escape without any equipment has been from 225 feet 
by (Slater) from the rammed submarine Nekton Beta off Catalina Island, Sept. 
28, 1970." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater believes he also has the unofficial world record for making 2,500 dives 
in submersibles. "Except for the guy running the Disneyland (sub ride), nobody 
has ever made that many," Slater says. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater and Privitt first met in 1969. Privitt was designing and building 
Nekton subs for General Oceanographics in Newport Beach when Slater came aboard 
as chief scientist and sub pilot. Slater, an affable fifth-generation 
Californian who grew up in Santa Paula, has a Ph.D. in marine geology from the 
University of Sydney. The grizzled Privitt has built a dozen subs despite a 
formal education that doesn't go beyond junior college. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised on a farm in rural Missouri, Privitt grew up without electricity and 
built toy graders to amuse himself. A mechanical wizard who pilots planes and 
has competed in motocross, he got involved with minisubs in the early '50s when 
he moved to Southern California. He "met a guy with a sub in his garage," he 
said. "I had always thought about making one." Privitt's first sub was launched 
in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 Privitt, who is married and has three grown children, has made more than 800 
dives in his subs, but his main role takes place on land, "fixing things and 
keeping everything going." Working in his computerized machine shop in 
Torrance, Privitt overhauls the Delta once a year. He is currently "doing some 
thinking" about building a new sub, possibly from titanium, which would extend 
the sub's range to 3,000 feet. THE BODY IN THE LAKE 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'80s, he and Slater formed Delta. It was a risky venture: Both had 
either worked for or owned similar enterprises that had failed, including 
General Oceanographics. But Slater had spent a lot of time all over the world 
and "knew there was a need" for a research sub. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta received national publicity last summer while navigating near the wreck 
of the Edmund Fitzgerald, the iron-ore ship made famous in a 1976 song by 
Gordon Lightfoot. Filming a TV documentary, Delta's crew descended into Lake 
Superior to try to determine why the 729-foot vessel sank during a 1975 storm, 
with all 29 on board perishing. While the dive yielded no definitive answers, 
the Delta did find a body, which had been preserved under 525 feet of icy 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of lost in sediment and were trying to get our bearings when my 
passenger looked out and saw (the body) right next to us," Ijames says. "It was 
like looking at a mummy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ijames also was the pilot on the search for the missing Scripps 
current-reading instruments last month. He and Paul Harvey, a development 
engineer at Scripps' Center for Coastal Studies, looked for the devices for 
three days, combing the ocean floor off San Miguel Island. They found only one 
of three lost instruments, but Harvey calls the search a success. "We got much 
more back than the cost of the mission," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that their assignment with Scripps is finished, Slater is working on 
Delta's 1995 schedule, which may include a trip to the Galapagos Islands in the 
spring. Also in the works is a hush-hush project for a foreign government to 
find and recover a military jet that crashed in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the '95 schedule are rides around Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the late '60s and early '70s we'd take people on rides all the time," 
Slater says. "It's fun, and I'd love to do it now, but then we'd be like a 
ferry boat and need different registration from the Coast Guard. Because of 
that and liability, we just don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 A harbor cruise wouldn't be that much fun anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too murky to see anything," Slater says.

THEATER REVIEW; 'SHREW' AND 'MUSIC MAN' ARE FULL OF PEP AT CIVIC ARTS PLAZA; 
THEY GIVE A GOOD IDEA OF THE SITE'S CAPABILITIES AND DRAWBACKS AND ARE 
MICROCOSMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE THEATRICAL SCENE HERE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By far the largest theatrical space in Ventura County, the new Thousand Oaks 
Civic Arts Plaza is now in full theatrical use, with simultaneous productions 
of "The Music Man" in its main auditorium and "The Taming of the Shrew" in the 
smaller arena theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows -- both closing this weekend -- are worth seeing. They give a good 
idea of the plaza's capabilities and drawbacks and are microcosms of what's 
wrong with the theatrical scene here and (to a greater or lesser degree) across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstage production of "The Music Man" is a semi-professional effort by 
the Cabrillo Music Theatre, which sneaked into dormancy approximately two years 
ago after a series of generally worthy but financially draining productions in 
Port Hueneme's tiny Dorrill Wright Center. What a difference a couple of years 
and some personnel changes have made: The group, importing professional 
director Allan Hunt and professional actors in principal roles, has mounted a 
huge production in an 1,800-seat theater that's probably large enough to hold 
the entire Wright Center building. And the show was virtually sold out on 
Sunday afternoon, the third performance of a run that opened Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big, boisterous production, with a cast large enough to fill the huge 
stage, a big orchestra in the pit and sound that's amplified so that the vocals 
-- most of the time -- can be heard in the farthest balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Breithaupt stars as Prof. Harold Hill, the flimflamming "music man" 
who intends to sell the citizens of River City, Iowa, equipment for a boy's 
band and then skip town before delivering on his promise to teach the boys to 
play their instruments. Christine Martin, also a professional, co-stars as 
Marian Paroo, the spinster librarian who . . . well, there might be somebody 
reading this who will be surprised by the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Both actors are fine, with Breithaupt potentially hampered by a performance 
that virtually belongs to the late Robert Preston: The association of actor and 
role (in both the Broadway and film versions) is as well-defined as any in 
theatrical history, and anybody who doesn't play Hill exactly as Preston did 
is, perhaps unfairly, going to suffer by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the actors familiar to local community theater audiences, Penny Puente 
is most effective as Marian's sensible mother. Valerie Paradise Lane, Karen 
Cozen, Crystal St. Romain and Linda Smith play a flock of local ladies. And a 
group known as Double Attraction stands out as the school board members whom 
Hill turns into a barbershop quartet. Most of the other locally based actors 
are in less-prominent roles; most of the other major roles are filled in by 
actors from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, it's something else, with musical director Diann Alexander, 
conductor Dave Pier, main choreographer DeAnne Spicer, costume designer Valerie 
Baltzer and producers Ray and Cheryl Mastrovito all veterans of numerous local 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Hunt and choreographer Spicer have done some marvelous work in 
keeping the crowds under control and looking interested throughout; too often, 
members of crowd scenes simply stand there, waiting for their next cue. Also 
watch the youngest dancers, particularly during the big "Shipoopi" number -- 
top-notch work by all involved. The ensemble vocal work, too, is far above par 
for community theater. And, one last word: Don't leave before the curtain calls 
-- you'll miss one of the biggest spectacles of all. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Downstairs in the approximately 350-seat Forum Theatre, the Tour de Force 
Repertory Company is staging Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew." A riotous 
comedy that's taken on far more serious overtones with the rise of feminism as 
a social issue, it's a play that holds up particularly well through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaye Hersh, who played "shrew" Katherine at last year's Ojai Shakespeare 
Festival, here re-creates the role with perhaps even more verve. This time 
she's opposite Darren Raleigh -- previously seen locally in "Tartuffe" and "The 
Winter's Tale" -- as the dashing adventurer Petruchio. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Pearlman plays Baptista, the father who won't allow his desirable younger 
daughter, Bianca, to marry until Katherine, or Kate -- "renowned in Padua for 
her scolding tongue" -- is wed. Bianca is portrayed (and is that a bit of 
Valley Girl inflection in her voice?) by Catherina Best. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Graziano, Damian Gravino and Larry Marko play suitors of Bianca, all too 
pleased to see Petruchio win his bet that he'll "tame" and marry Katherine; 
James Leslie, Bill Hillstrom and Mark Fagundes play servants, with Hillstrom's 
and Gravino's characters switching identities so that the master can court 
Bianca -- as they say in Padua -- incognito. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very physical play, and director Terry Fishman has men fighting men, 
women fighting women and Petruchio and Kate engaging in some real free-for-alls 
with each other -- if Raleigh and Hersh didn't seem so well matched, those 
fights could be quite disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Alexander's set is simple but effective in its evocation of various 
locations, Lisa V. Foley's costumes (which are also veterans of the Ojai 
Shakespeare Festival) are colorful, and the Measure for Measure Renaissance 
Minstrels provide entertainment between set changes and during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza's theater spaces are lovely, though it will be quite a 
chore to keep the main stage from dwarfing the productions, and it will be 
interesting to see how many shows will attract audiences as big as those for 
"The Music Man." 
</P>
<P>
 The full audience for Sunday's show is a good sign for the future of theater 
in Ventura. But a full house at the plaza's main stage would be nearly 10 
nights' worth at the Conejo Players theater, more than three at the Center's 
Forum . . . you get the idea. Even if "The Music Man" is a better production 
than "Carnival" at the Conejo Players or "The Taming of the Shrew," is it as 
superior as the relative audience size would indicate? There are a lot of good 
shows out there, many of them less expensive to see than a movie. Do yourself a 
favor, and watch for them. Introduce some friends to local theater and you'll 
be doing them a favor, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Civic Arts Plaza's innovations, incidentally, is one that hasn't 
been advertised: the facility is the only entertainment venue in Ventura County 
to charge for parking -- $4 minimum. There's a dirt lot next to the theater 
that isn't lighted at night, and some street parking along Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard -- until, that is, the lot operators persuade the city to red-zone 
the curbs. Details

SOUNDS: A JAZZED-UP REUNION FOR 2 LONGTIME FRIENDS; IT'S BEEN TWO DECADES SINCE 
ROBBEN FORD AND ROGER KELLAWAY FIRST CROSSED PATHS. NOW, THEY'RE JOINING FORCES 
AT WHEELER HOT SPRINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 20 years ago today, give or take a few, that Robben Ford first fell 
into Roger Kellaway's orbit. Blame it on Joni Mitchell, who had the good 
instincts to hire them both for a celebrated tour in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The two musicians were on alternate paths, by age and musical endeavor. 
Kellaway, studied in jazz and classical music, was a well-established figure in 
jazz and studio circles and had released the first of his innovative Cello 
Quartet albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford was a new kid in town, having blown into Los Angeles from Northern 
California as part of Jimmy Witherspoon's band, and quickly began making a mark 
for himself with his extra-tasty melding of blues, jazz and other music. 
Between them, Ford and Kellaway, along with the rest of the L. A. Express, 
which served as Mitchell's band, painted a fetching backdrop of sophistication 
and lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
 A bond was born. Which makes the upcoming Ford-Kellaway reunion at Wheeler Hot 
Springs this Sunday something of a historic occasion, even though Ford may 
humbly shrug it off as a casual jazz gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have crossed paths over the years, this will be the first time 
that they have played a gig together as a duo, joined here by former L. A. 
Express drummer John Guerin and bassist Dave Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were living in New York at the same time, but both traveling a lot," Ford 
said last week in an interview. "We're rekindling an old friendship, an old 
relationship. At Wheeler, we'll probably play mostly standards. We might play a 
few original compositions. I will, of course, acquiesce to what his desires 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his own reputation has put him in the higher ranks of guitarists on 
the scene, Ford is humbled in the presence of Kellaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger became a real mentor for me," he said. "He had such a big musical mind 
and was such a brilliant pianist, and I also just liked him as a person. More 
than any other musician I've met since, he really influenced me. I was ripe for 
it at that point in my life and was looking for something a little higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a fully realized and mature musician, and I was a guy who was still 
struggling with his instrument, as far as I was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Retracing the steps of his meeting with Kellaway, Ford remembered that, before 
he was inducted into the group, "the L. A. Express was a band of studio 
musicians, basically, who came together to play, have some fun and make a 
record. Joni Mitchell's producer brought her out to hear the band, saying, 
'There are some musicians here that I think you might enjoy working with.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She did, and recorded her "Court and Spark" album with the group. But 
guitarist Larry Carlton and keyboardist Joe Sample were also in the Crusaders 
and didn't want to go on the road. Into those chairs fell Kellaway and Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kellaway never recorded with Mitchell, Ford did, and played the 
memorable guitar solo on her hit "In France They Kiss on Main Street." He 
remembers the recording session vividly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joan was always interested in experimenting. She would say, 'Why don't we try 
this or that?' I would have an opinion about it and sometimes I might say 
'sure.' But other times, it would be, 'No, you don't want to do that.' That 
happened on a few occasions, and she was always right. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guitar solo was recorded using a little MXR fuzz-tone box plugged 
directly into the recording console. Not to be using an actual guitar amplifier 
with a microphone on it just seemed absurd to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was objecting. We just sat there, and we'd take it eight bars by eight 
bars. We'd stop, she'd go back and say, 'Try something that sounds like blah 
blah blah right here.' She basically walked me through a great deal of it. 
She'd make suggestions and then I would just play. It was wild, because I was 
so against it at first." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's solo career has been a stop-start affair ever since that time 20 years 
ago when his first plans were rerouted. After the high-profile Mitchell job, he 
was lured into various sideman work with George Harrison, Michael McDonald and 
Miles Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the guitarist has a personal statement to make, as well. His 1979 album 
"The Inside Story," in the clear light of hindsight, is among the finest albums 
in the annals of fusion. That album led to formation of the Yellowjackets. 
</P>
<P>
 As a blues-vocal artist, Ford recorded the fine album "Talk to Your Daughter" 
for Warner Bros. in the mid-'80s and then slipped away from the marketplace 
again until this decade. With his Robben Ford and Blue Line, he has finally hit 
a stride and released two records for Chick Corea's Stretch label. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been projects in the cracks, such as drummer Jerry Granelli's 
inventive "A Song I Thought I Heard Buddy Sing" (Evidence), on which the band 
features both Ford and the more textural guitarist Bill Frisell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of my favorites," Ford said of Frisell. "His uniqueness makes him 
irresistible. You can't argue with something like that, in my book." The same 
could be said of the man with the kind words and good ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one to stick with a formula, Ford seems to examine whatever situation he's 
in at a given moment. For now, the Blue Line trio is keeping him busy, touring 
the world and planning to record again in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group has gone through a lot together, musically. It's an interesting 
thing, because every time I think it's about time to add somebody new to the 
group, the trio does something different." He laughed softly. "Then, it's like, 
'Why don't we do this some more?' " Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Robben Ford and Roger Kellaway will perform a dinner concert. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Dinner is at 5:30 p.m. and the show starts at 7:30.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; LOCALLY SHOT SURFING MOVIE HITS THE SCREEN; 'V2

 With cooler weather upon us, most people aren't thinking about getting into 
the water. But surfers, real surfers, are getting amped for those winter storms 
that produce big waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, to help pump up the anticipation, the Ventura Theatre is showing "V2 
and Beyond," a local surf movie produced by Scott Aichner of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the 30 minutes of tape that make up the feature, Aichner, 24, spent 
months squinting into a tripod-mounted camera or bobbing around in the waves 
with a helmet-mounted video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it the HelCam," he said. "It weighs about five pounds, but it lets me 
get in behind the surfer so I can follow him through the wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Aichner said that 80% of the video was shot in Ventura County. The soundtrack 
is strongly local also, featuring Raging Arb and the Redheads, Guy Martin and 
Rude Mood, Lion I's and Euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "V2" is the sequel to "Ventura the Surf Movie," Aichner's first video that 
premiered last year at the Ventura Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the first one I was hoping to prove myself," said Aichner, who shoots, 
edits and produces the videos by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like undressing in front of 750 people. I was up in the projector 
booth all alone. I hit 'play' and the opening sequence comes up with this guy 
disappearing into a tube. He's gone for about three seconds before he pops out 
at the other end. The audience went wild. There's no feeling like that, like 
having the crowd totally behind you." 
</P>
<P>
 The show at the Ventura Theatre starts at 8 p.m. Tickets are $10. Raging Arb 
and the Redheads will perform. The video will be on sale soon at surf shops for 
$19.95.

 Think of Sweden and what comes to mind? Enlightened social democracy, 
outstanding automotive engineering, the Nobel Prize maybe? Well, Sweden was not 
always as progressive as we imagine it, according to a film presented this 
Sunday by the Ojai Film Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Slingshot" is a story about growing up in Stockholm in the 1920s. The 
film is based on the true story of inventor Roland Schutt, whose youthful 
ingenuity gives the film its title. The 10-year-old hero makes slingshots out 
of the condoms his mother distributes illegally. Family planning was 
prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from the bastion of liberalism it is today, Sweden between the wars was a 
hotbed of repression and anti-Semitism. Roland gets picked on because of his 
father's socialist beliefs and his mother's Jewish roots.  
</P>
<P>
 It's called the best Swedish coming-of-age movie since "My Life as a Dog." We 
wonder, given the limited output of the Swedish film industry, if such billing 
is high praise or like calling someone the finest radio mime artist of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 You make the call. It's showing at 4:30 Sunday afternoon at the Ojai 
Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai Ave.

FOR THE KIDS; TAG, WITH A LITTLE ZAP AND ZOWIE; LAZERSTAR'S PULSING LIGHTS, 
FAST MUSIC, FLOATING MIST ARE USED TO LEND SURREAL FEEL TO SPACE-AGE 'MISSION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pow! Zap! Gotcha! Oh no, I'm hit! Guard the base! Watch out -- behind you! 
Gotta reload!  
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like combat, but it's really more like tag. Laser tag, that is. 
Lazerstar opened its doors in Oxnard last month, and the high-tech game of 
galactic stealth is drawing kids and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers John and Paul Henigin have created a 6,000-square-foot labyrinth 
where team members, suited up in computerized laser gear, square off -- all to 
the beat of frenetic music, pulsating black lights and wisps of mist. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bit bewildering the first time you sign on for a "mission." Players 
dart about, crouching behind walls. Streams of red light flash to signal a hit. 
It's all over in 20 adrenaline-pumping minutes. The cost? For one mission, or 
game, it's $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing quite like it in the Los Angeles area, according to the 
brothers. The closest laser-tag arenas are south in San Diego or north in the 
San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
 When you walk in, though, what you see -- and hear -- are video games and the 
roar from a road-racing game that simulates Daytona. A snack bar serves up 
pizza, ice cream and soda to players awaiting the announcement of their game 
from the mission control center. No alcohol is available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to be family entertainment," said John Henigin, the manager. He 
recommends it for anyone 10 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers don't like comparisons of Lazerstar to the paint-ball war games 
where combatants try to "kill" each other by shooting splats of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to project a Road Warrior or Rambo atmosphere," John Henigin 
said. "That war stuff is common in other laser-tag arenas." In fact, here the 
weapons are never called guns, but "laser handsets," which operate by push 
button. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday afternoon, 32 people -- an equal mix of kids, teen-agers 
and adults -- signed on for a game. (Up to 40 can play.) The mission's code 
name? "Foxtrot." The players picked code names too: "Commando," "Jester," 
"Sniper," "Burn Out," "Cowboy," to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 They watched a short video about the game before going into a briefing room 
where they divided into two teams -- red and green -- and learned the rules. No 
foul language. No running. No body contact. In fact, if players get closer than 
five feet, the laser handset won't score a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the equipment room, they strapped on bulky vests -- red or green -- with 
the computerized gizmos that make it all work. A space-age computer voice tells 
patrons when they have made a hit or been zapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the game actually begins, the idea is not only to zap opposing players 
but to hit targets at the other team's base for extra points. Players are 
supposed to cover for each other and work as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 That day the teamwork was nil. It was every player for himself. "Cover your 
bases, red team," an arena marshal yelled as green players took pot shots at 
the targets. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, the green team had won. Mission control handed out a 
printout of the game results to each player that showed who hit whom how many 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of fun," said a sweaty David Tapie of Camarillo, who was there 
with his two sons. "It's a good workout." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sarah Vernon, 10, of Camarillo it was a chance to zap her older brother, 
Scott, who was celebrating his 15th birthday. For Scott, "It was awesome, 
shooting people, running around, trying to avoid people." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Paul Henigin's idea to open Lazerstar. A certified public accountant 
who lives in Honolulu, he enlisted the help of his brother, John, who owns 
Pronto Brake and Muffler in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in a 15,000-square-foot building along the Ventura Freeway, the 
Lazerstar complex is the second-largest laser-tag facility in the country, 
according to the brothers. The game is most popular in Australia, where there 
are 250 arenas, and in England, which has 80. It's somewhat new to the United 
States, where it got its start on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Those hesitant to give it a try end up "pleasantly surprised" by the 
experience, according to John Henigin. "They want to do it again." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For something a little less intensive, Ventura Harbor Village is holding 
"Kids' Day" at the harbor 11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. There will be pony 
rides, a petting zoo, face painting, clowns, sidewalk chalk drawing and rides 
in a buggy cart drawn by a miniature horse. Children's entertainment, kite 
flying demonstrations and crafts are also on the agenda. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Lazerstar, a laser-tag facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 921 E. Ventura Blvd., Oxnard. (Just off the Ventura Freeway, between 
Vineyard and Rose avenues exits.) 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * COST: One mission, $7.50; two or more missions, $7 each. Before 6 p.m., 
Monday through Thursday, $6.50.

FASHION; LEARNING HOW TO SIZE UP THE NEIGHBORS BY THE YARD; UNLIKE INDOOR ART, 
LAWN ORNAMENTS LET OWNERS MAKE A PERSONAL STATEMENT TO THE WORLD WITHOUT HAVING 
TO INVITE FOLKS IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are many ways to take the measure of a person. We believe that one of 
the best means is through observation of that person's yard ornaments. It's 
only one criterion, but it works as well as most. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. How do you generally judge the taste and character of your 
neighbors? Perhaps through the tidiness of their grass? The use of an 
apostrophe in their signature doormat? Whether they plant weird vegetables like 
okra? 
</P>
<P>
 All of these are dubious gauges at best. Unless that neighbor makes a strong 
reactionary statement such as painting his rocks white, it's hard to know 
what's on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But not as hard as it used to be. For readily available in the marketplace is 
a truly exhaustive range of objects suitable for outdoor decoration. This 
repertoire, once limited to endearing rabbits, ducks and squirrels, now offers 
a way to make a statement to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Some statements are clearer than others. In fact, some are unmistakable. There 
are messages spelled out in wrought iron to express strong sentiment to your 
fellows, such as "Flowers, a Gift of Beauty," or the more mundane, "Is MY dog 
on YOUR lawn?" 
</P>
<P>
 While these decorations leave little doubt as to the temper of the occupants, 
others require more examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Take cow replicas. Perhaps the ornamental cow is the ultimate patriotic 
symbol. The Holstein, after all, is an all-American animal that unfortunately 
the founding fathers overlooked when choosing a national symbol. They were in a 
hawkish mood at the time and threw support to the eagle. If we all write to our 
representatives in Congress and ask for their prompt action, this slight may be 
overcome. And cows would look great on flagpoles. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, deer statues might indicate a strongly liberal stance. Those who 
use deer as garden art probably abhor firearms, campaign for snail-darter 
habitat and use tofu as a dining mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the genre of damsels with loose clothing, often carrying water 
jars. These figures might at first suggest chauvinism, but on closer analysis 
could be Republican symbols, championing the work ethic and renouncing the 
indulgence of modern plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other meaningful art includes frogs, which are probably bought by romantics, 
and oversized snails, which hint at passive-aggressiveness. Sea gulls, we 
suspect, are bought by transplanted Midwesterners. Who else would want one? 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously, collecting garden sculpture is a growing trend that cuts across 
socioeconomic lines and allows more self-expression than mere two-dimensional 
paintings can render. Besides, it's seen by more people and you don't have to 
invite them in. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are the type who wants to keep your attitude private, you can choose 
more universal symbols for your lawn, leaving neighborhood pundits confused as 
to your true sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks are useful for this purpose. Also dogs. It's hard to make a statement 
with a dog statue, although some kind of irony can be expressed with a sculpted 
fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 We learned at Green Thumb International in Ventura that hydrants are not a big 
seller, which we took as a positive indicator. Also, sales of Oriental pagodas, 
once a hot item, have fallen to a trickle. We'd like to point out that this 
coincides with the general decline of transcendental meditation, although no 
research has been reported on this theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals in general are the most popular sculptures at this westside outlet, 
but no figures are kept on sales by species. Gnomes and humans are slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Enchanted Way Nursery in Simi Valley, deer are the most 
requested sculpture, a fact that, according to our theory, flies in the face of 
the town's supposed conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell tons of them," said Chuck Tarpley, nursery co-owner, "especially the 
new deer lines that are very realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, at Green Meadow Nursery, yard-art animals are outsold by angels. 
Among animal forms, frogs may be the top seller, especially those that squirt 
water -- and sunflowers have been a close runner-up for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, we've noticed that sunflowers are fast becoming another universal 
symbol, like dogs, for those who wish their yards to be enigmatic. A few bronze 
or terra-cotta sunflowers should break up the monotony of your lawn while 
thwarting analysis of your political leanings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this strategy is not guaranteed, because some of us are constantly 
working to break the code of yard-ornament symbology. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a family moved in next door to us with a set of decorations they 
promptly displayed on their lawn. These consist of a large stone turtle, a 
six-foot windmill and a pair of lovebirds fixed to a birdbath. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a random collection, you say? Hardly. We figure it endorses slow but 
steady material growth, committed self-reliance and free love. It is obvious to 
us that these neighbors are confirmed Libertarians.

JAUNTS; VENTURA PIER TOUR OFFERS VOYAGE BACK THROUGH TIME; SAILING SHIPS LOADED 
WITH CHRISTMAS TREES ONCE DOCKED THERE. LATER, THE FIRST OIL TANKERS ARRIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to picture, but in the early days of the historic Ventura Pier, 
lumber schooners loaded with timber would tie up at the wharf. Later, oil 
tankers would dock there. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier, a third-of-a-mile long, is the longest wooden wharf in the state. On 
Saturday, you can take a two-hour walking tour of the pier and learn why its 
commercial days ended and how it became a recreational attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered by the city, the tour includes a stroll out to the end of the pier and 
back, followed by a walk to the nearby Cafe Bella in downtown Ventura for 
refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 The event begins at 1 p.m. at the entrance to the pier. The cost is $6 for 
adults, and $4 for children and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't taken a jaunt out to the end of the pier in the last year, the 
tour is also a chance to see firsthand the $3.5-million restoration it 
underwent in 1993. You can also get a close-up look at the sculpture known as 
"Wavespout," a curious 6-foot-tall fountain that spurts seawater. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all a far cry from the pier's beginnings in 1872, according to city 
historian Richard Senate, who will lead the tour. The fledgling city of San 
Buenaventura was isolated in those days, before the arrival of the railroad. 
Coming and going by sea was the only sensible way, but ships had to anchor 
offshore, relying on small barges to ferry passengers and cargo ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 So local businessmen -- Joseph Wolfson and his father-in-law, Juan Camarillo 
-- had the pier built for $45,000. Soon, vessels were landing there with lumber 
to build up the town and leaving with loads of lima beans and other local 
produce, along with cattle, sheep and hogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pier became irrelevant when the railroad arrived," Senate said. "Oil 
saved it." By the 1890s, oil was the city's main export. Oil storage tanks were 
built next to the wharf, and the world's first oil tanker was based here. 
Unfortunately, it burned in 1899 in a spectacular fire while docked at the 
pier. Firefighters hosed the wharf and it escaped serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1936, when an oil barge departed from the wharf, the pier's commercial 
years came to an end. The city bought it in 1940 for $7,000, then gave it to 
the state in 1949. The city took it back in 1990 when the state considered 
demolishing it because of high maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the time it was built, the pier has had its share of disasters. 
Damage from storms caused it to be rebuilt several times. During a storm in 
December 1914, it was cut in half when huge swells shoved the steamer Coos Bay 
against it. The ship was loaded with Christmas toys. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many bright spots in the pier's history. One of them, according to 
Senate, is the tradition of the Christmas tree schooners. Sailing down from 
Washington during the years between 1890 and 1920, they docked at the pier, 
bringing not only trees for the holidays but loads of apples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apples became synonymous with Christmas," Senate said. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Walking tour of the Ventura Pier 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 1 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Meet at the entrance to the pier, near Harbor Boulevard and 
California Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $6 for adults; $4 for children and seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Preregistration is advised but not necessary. 658-4726.

EARTHWATCH: COLORFUL AND TASTY FARE FOR THE HOLIDAYS; A VARIETY OF LOCALLY 
GROWN BEANS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF FOOD THAT IS BOTH HEALTHFUL AND FRIENDLY TO THE 
PLANET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In Somis, the roadside veggie stand operated by Underwood Ranches Inc. will be 
more colorful than usual this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the stand will look like it's stocked with open sacks of 
semi-precious stones. On closer examination, you'll discover that you're 
looking at beans -- a particularly planet- and people-friendly food staple. 
These are dried beans -- with names and coloring as diverse and exotic as 
jewels -- flageolet, yellow eye, madeiria, Jackson wonder, Swedish brown, 
French green lentil, Spanish toledano and Christmas lima. Advice on how to cook 
the legumes is available, and certain varieties will be packaged in 
combinations that taste particularly good together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Underwood firm's motto is "agricultural innovation," which is sort of 
ironic considering that an ancestor of Craig Underwood, a partner in Underwood 
Ranches, was growing beans in Ventura County in the 1870s. Perhaps the 
innovation part is that they are promoting a less-chemically grown type of crop 
-- which quite literally restores the earth by pumping nitrogen into the soil 
as part of the natural growing cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the people-friendly aspect: the realization that this ancient 
Native American staple is the world's best source of low-fat, high-fiber 
nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, according to another Underwood partner, Minos Athandossiadis, the 
bean these days is haute cuisine . Wolfgang Puck's trendy Granitas restaurant 
in Malibu is featuring spectacular bean dishes this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The humble legume lends itself to a variety of flavorings. "Ten years ago, no 
one had heard of pasta salad," Athandossiadis said, "but in five years, bean 
salads will be as widely known." 
</P>
<P>
 The Underwood firm has tested more than 70 bean varieties for possible 
cultivation in our county, focusing on about a dozen to sell here and ship to a 
widening national market. "We have our bean-cleaning equipment working full 
time," Athandossiadis said. 
</P>
<P>
 A multitude of salads, soups, side dishes, desserts and even main dishes has 
been thought up by clever cooks. Bean burgers -- not just the soy type but ones 
made with beans such as the ones grown locally -- are appearing in specialty 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Beans have a long history in Ventura County. According to Underwood, seven 
local families, including his own, claim to have introduced the lima bean to 
the United States. The California Bean Growers Assn. has been headquartered 
here for decades. And since 1919, Meridian Foods (under the Seaside Brand) has 
been packaging a dozen varieties of dried and canned beans for shipping from 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A century of using largely non-chemical means to cultivate this 
planet-friendly crop has greatly enhanced the productivity of our local farms. 
In the Midwest, growers must regularly interrupt their corn cropping and plant 
beans to repair the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, our local earth-stewardship has come to a strange turn of events. 
No amount of productivity -- even a zillion bushels an acre -- can make our 
local farmland more financially viable than a building development. So, where 
the Underwood's family originally grew lima beans, buildings -- namely the 
County Government Center -- arose. Fortunately, at least for now, the upscale 
status of beans and other designer crops is helping local growers stay in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want some new holiday food sensations, something good for the earth and 
everybody on it, but don't want to experiment -- even with the excellent new 
bean cookbooks now available -- get a prepackaged mix at a health food store or 
from Underwood Ranch. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * CUISINE: Starting this week and continuing year-round, Underwood Ranches' 
Somis location offers 14 varieties of earth-friendly dry beans -- and advice on 
how to turn them into gourmet dishes. The California Bean Growers Assn. has 
published its own guide, "Cooking With California Dry Beans," which is 
available by calling (800) 225-2326. 
</P>
<P>
 * COOKBOOKS: Earthwatch also recommends the following bean cookbooks, 
available through local bookstores: "Boutique Bean Pot," by Kathleen Mayes and 
Sandra Gottfried, Woodbridge Press, Santa Barbara, and "Romancing the Bean," by 
Joanne Saltman, Kenneth Kramer Publisher, Tiburon, Calif. The Lean Bean 
Original Flavor Burger, manufactured by Garden Valley Foods, is available at 
local health food stores.

SHOPTALK; A DOWN-TO-EARTH PLACE TO FIND CLOTHING FOR WOMEN AND KIDS; THE 
EARTHLINGS OUTLET IN OJAI OFFERS ENVIRONMENTALLY CORRECT FASHIONS AT 
ECONOMICALLY CORRECT PRICES.

 There is a real treat in store for shoppers venturing down Ojai's main drag. 
The Earthlings Outlet on Ojai Avenue offers beautiful clothing lines for women 
and children at wholesale and less than wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthlings clothing is designed by Ojai resident Dawn Ceniceros. This is a 
business with a philosophy, which is to "look for products which respect and 
honor the earth." All of the clothing is made from 100% certified organic 
cotton. There are plenty of sound reasons to buy organic, not the least of 
which are protecting water quality and preventing soil erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't assume this is clothing for hippies. Earthlings are carried by such 
upscale retailers as Barneys New York and Nordstrom department stores. The 
children's line is especially beautiful. Dresses, leggings, pinafores, T-shirts 
and hats are in wonderful colors. Prints, solids and stripes are all cleverly 
designed to be layered, mixed and matched. Dresses run from $10 to $33, pants 
and leggings from $10 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of racks of "damaged merchandise" with even greater 
markdowns. (Inspect these clothes carefully; most damaged pieces are nearly 
perfect, but some items are not worth purchasing.) 
</P>
<P>
 The baby and toddler line is also deliciously sweet. A natural cotton teddy 
bear is $12 and makes a perfect first doll. Receiving blankets made of soft, 
pure, organically grown cotton are perfect for wrapping newborn babies of 
nervous first-time parents. For another new baby gift, we chose a one-piece 
romper with matching cap, cleverly packaged in an egg crate. It cost $15, and 
this gift would have been at least $30 at a department store. 
</P>
<P>
 Store manager Leslie Martinez knows her merchandise inside and out and can 
help you find whatever you need. The women's line features natural dyes called 
"fox fibre" in beautiful shades of green and brown. A canvas "gardener's 
jacket" is $40; at Nordstrom the same jacket is $105. A long-sleeve Henley 
T-shirt is $15. Sweat shirts and leggings are $15 and $14. 
</P>
<P>
 While Earthlings clothing is environmentally correct, shopping at this outlet 
is also economically correct.

MUSIC; GWAR IS HELL -- JUST ASK THE DINOSAURS; FROM THE ROCK THEATER GROUP COME 
WEIRD CHARACTERS, BUCKETS OF BLOOD, SHARP INSTRUMENTS -- UP WITH PEOPLE IT 
ISN'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Well, Beavis and Butt-head like GWAR, and so would Vlad the Impaler, Jack the 
Ripper and Freddy Krueger. Sort of a slasher movie meets thrasher band in Sam 
Peckinpah's garage, a GWAR gig is an all-out gore fest, not for the faint of 
heart or the white of shirt. Carving its way down the West Coast, GWAR will 
headline a noisy gig at the Underground in Santa Barbara tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the sonic musical onslaught, there's a stage full of outrageous 
costumes and props and lots of ugly people with sharp instruments. And blood -- 
lots of blood -- fake blood, to be sure, but don't stand too close to the 
stage. But what could you expect with a nom-de-scream lineup that features 
Oderus Urungus (lead screamer), Balsac (loud guitar), Flattus Maximus (louder 
guitar), Jizmak de Gusha (drums), and Beefcake the Mighty (bass). There are 
more characters, but the five Richmond-based weirdos are the main culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 GWAR has a new album, "This Toilet Earth," plus a full-length film, "Skulhed . 
. . Face." The band has been around a long time, too long to some, about 
half-past forever according to their bio. Banished to Earth billions of years 
ago, space aliens, then known as the Scumdogs of the Universe and soon to 
become GWAR, killed the dinosaurs, made Stonehenge a croquet court, sank 
Atlantis and invented hair spray, the latter a capital offense if ever there 
was one. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether GWAR is a menace to society with no redeeming social value or just 
another boys-will-be-boys band gone nuts is unclear, but the fellas do have 
fans. Lots of them. But getting Oderus (Dave Brockie) to give a straight answer 
more than once in a while is as hopeless as giving Jason of "Friday the 13th" a 
season pass to the Mighty Ducks to mellow him out. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Scumbags of the Universe, you guys reportedly killed the dinosaurs? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we killed them. Dinosaurs were very intelligent -- they wore shoes and 
drove cars, but they challenged GWAR and we kicked their butts. We stretched 
their gizzards across the Grand Canyon and created music. They're making sort 
of a comeback with this "Jurassic Park" crap, but we're ready to kick their 
butts again. 
</P>
<P>
 It took four days to get from Chicago to Seattle? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, but we had to go by ('50s cannibal) Ed Gein's house in Wisconsin, then 
to the badlands where it's colder than a witch's brass monkey. We did have 
David Koresh with us for a while, but we had to kick him off the tour because 
we found out he was a better guitar player than Flattus. Now we're touring with 
the rotting corpses of Burl Ives and Boxcar Willie. 
</P>
<P>
 What, so Zamfir's on vacation? Anyway, are there more dead bodies at a GWAR 
show or a Clint Eastwood Western? 
</P>
<P>
 We try to approach what Sam Peckinpah did in "The Wild Bunch." He invented 
modern screen violence, and people being blown away and all that other 
beautiful stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 So who goes to a GWAR show, serial killers in training? 
</P>
<P>
 We get everyone from 3-year-old midgets to 48-year-old professors standing in 
the back, taking notes, trying to figure it all out. A lot of people in the 
front wear white, some even wear white virgin robes. Our fans are truly the 
scum of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the grotesque imagery detract from the alleged music? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not. It enhances it if anything -- the fury of the bloodletting and 
the musical onslaught. We're just these degenerates in these big dumb costumes 
that kept becoming more elaborate. It's still dumb, but now we pretend it's 
smart. 
</P>
<P>
 From Screamin' Jay Hawkins to the Village People to Alice Cooper to KISS to 
the Mentors, where does GWAR fit in with all that? 
</P>
<P>
 GWAR is the next step in the logical progression of expanded musical 
theatrical elements. Devo and the Tubes were into theatrics, too, and so is 
Green Jelly, but to a lesser extent. They're sort of a G-rated GWAR. 
</P>
<P>
 So who is mad at the band this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, let's see, our manager, our label, the usual. People seem to go to more 
insidious lengths to get at us these days. There's some actual censorship on 
the genitalia on the artwork inside "This Toilet Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 So no airplay and no MTV, how do you do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, we are on MTV -- we're in eight different "Beavis and Butt-head" 
episodes. That's just as good, if not better, than being in the rotation 
because they play for a longer period of time. We spend about six months a year 
on the road. We've been to Europe, and we even played some gigs in Eastern 
Europe. Prague was great. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of mail do you guys get? 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from a decapitated pig's head to 50-page term papers, so there must 
be somebody who is obviously interested. We answer all our mail even if it 
takes years. Hey, the support of the fans is what keeps us going. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do the GWAR haters say? 
</P>
<P>
 That we suck, and that we're like some stupid gimmick. I mean, we have 
literally thousands of fans, four records and a movie. We have created a genre 
unto ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Where can one find your new movie? 
</P>
<P>
 In porno booths worldwide. No, really, it's in music stores. It's 70 minutes 
long, and we're very proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
 So what scares you? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I wouldn't want to be in a plane wreck. And the kind of feeling you 
get in America . . . where someone just walks up and blows you away. 
</P>
<P>
 What if some kid cuts up his family and the survivors decide to sue GWAR? 
</P>
<P>
 We'll just hire (Robert) Shapiro and deny everything. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SELECT THE OLD GUARD FAVORITES AT THE CHANGING PIERPONT INN; 
IN TRYING TO DAZZLE, THE KITCHEN REACHES BEYOND THE FRESH AND INVENTIVE AND 
INTO A PERILOUS IDIOSYNCRASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the Pierpont Inn restaurant, gracious and genteel and the Room With 
a View, has drawn a loyal following. Today, that following has become a beloved 
Old Guard -- aging and slightly dwindling in number, perhaps, but fiercely a 
part of the Pierpont's extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the grace and curse of the place, truth be told. For the restaurant is 
trying to change and attract a new customer base while keeping the faithful 
happy and unjostled. A new chef has come on board to energize things. And his 
stylish menu is joined by a deep, well-selected wine list. 
</P>
<P>
 But in trying to dazzle and impress everyone -- both loyalist and newcomer 
alike -- the kitchen reaches beyond the fresh and inventive and into a perilous 
idiosyncrasy in which many dishes are strangely overwrought. The result is that 
the Pierpont -- a place with a venerable past and an aim-to-please future -- is 
stuck in a confusing present. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an unhappy deed to file this report. Few places receive guests with the 
warmth and grace of the Pierpont staff. Few places offer such a beautiful 
setting overlooking the Pacific. Indeed, few places sustain the level of 
unpretentious comfort that you'll encounter here, whether stopping by for a 
sunset cocktail or settling in for a long, special-occasion repast. 
</P>
<P>
 But stick to the simplest menu choices, and don't be shy about insisting on a 
basic preparation. The kitchen staff handles food capably and, if it is reined 
in a bit, you will enjoy a better meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The unequivocal hit among appetizers are the salmon cakes ($7.95), meaty, 
lightly spiced and succulent; they're grilled simply and served with a bit of 
fragrant bruschetta. The chicken quesadillas ($5.50), in which chicken, cheese 
and pica de gallo are tucked within tortillas, are outsize and heavy, though 
fresh. Fried calamari ($6.50) are lightly battered and properly cooked for 
tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Mushrooms au gratin ($7.95), in which large caps are stuffed with Dungeness 
crab and bay shrimp and topped with jack cheese, are standard issue. Not so the 
Inn-style grilled prawns ($7.95), plump and tender and charbroiled with a light 
mustard vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these dishes is accompanied by an Italian, sourdough or French-style 
bread, however, and each would be aided by it. Instead, the Pierpont serves, 
with some fanfare, crispy slices of cheese-toasted pumpernickel with hummus , 
followed by a dark multi-grain bread pungent as the wet forest floor. All the 
breads here have their specific joys. But they fail at accompanying other 
foods, least of all those bathed in herb-infused, tomato-based sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caesar salad ($4.95, half) veers toward the heavy, so go with the tossed 
garden salad drizzled in a lovely lemon-edged vinaigrette ($3.95, half). The 
best pasta is penne with grilled prawns ($14.95), although be warned that the 
dish is huge and heavy: penne rigati tossed in tomato-basil vodka cream and 
topped with prawns grilled with mustard vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel hair con pomodoro ($10.95), perhaps the most basic and classic of pasta 
dishes in which tomato, basil and garlic join olive oil on fine noodles, is 
overcooked and lacking punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrees are all over the lot. A fish special advertised as salmon fillet in 
light honey mustard glaze ($18.95) is actually salmon fillet beneath a thick 
amber mantle of mustard-heavy goo. The sauce scraped away, the fish is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disappointing of all was a weeknight special of bouillabaisse ($18.95). 
The Pierpont's version of this classic seafood stew boasts perhaps a generous 
pound of fish and shellfish in a broth so bland as to be confused with plain 
old tomato juice. There is no lobster; there is no side helping of hot sauce 
with which to enliven the brew; alas, there is no bread, as noted, suitable for 
the dipping. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalone ($16.95), described simply as "scallops and abalone in lemon butter," 
is so much more -- unfortunately. A thin pad of ground scallops and abalone is 
breaded, fried, and presented beneath a thick mantle of emulsified lemon butter 
and topped with toasted nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Confusing matters further is the adjacent pile of fresh sauteed vegetables 
adrift in mushroom cream sauce. The pairing of these sauces makes for warring 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose instead one of the Old Guard favorites. Rack of lamb ($22.95) is an 
embarrassingly huge portion -- it is unclear what profit the house can take in 
generously dishing out so many chops -- and it is roasted expertly to order, 
served with Cabernet sauce. The result is deeply satisfying, both rustic and 
elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelnut chicken ($14.95) appears to have its fans, and to them I'll nod in 
incomprehension and defer. But do note what it is: a breast of chicken sealed 
in bread crumbs, paved over in hazelnuts, then set upon a moat of 
sherry-mustard cream sauce. Two bites, and you've eaten for the week, although 
you won't especially know it was chicken that did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are average and, like some of the entrees, a bit too too. Bourbon 
pecan creme brulee ($3.95) fails to pay its New Orleans debt in being heavy, 
its bottom layer of pecans sodden and rubbery. Lemon bar tart ($3.50) is aces 
one night, soggy in the crust on another. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine list is exceptional, as are by-the-glass opportunities. In the 
latter, try the fragrant, beautifully structured Iron Horse Fume Blanc ($5.50) 
or the berry-bright Wild Horse pinot noir ($4.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking its new market niche, the Pierpont obviously is reaching for the 
stars. If it would pull back a bit -- simplify and clarify -- it just might 
find the heavens within view. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Pierpont Inn by-the-Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 550 San Jon Road, Ventura, 653-6144.

Sundays from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Dinner from 5:30 to 9 p.m. Sundays through 
Thursdays, till 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Major credit cards. Reservations suggested at all times. Dinner for 
two, food only, $35 to $70. Note: An exceptional bargain is the sunset dinner, 
available Sunday through Thursday from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m., when a three-course 
meal drawn from the main menu is available for $10.95.

 Kevin Sherry, executive chef at Camarillo's Las Posas Country Club, is feeling 
the heat as he prepares to host the annual President's Ball of the Southwest 
Assn. of Chefs & Culinarians on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of pressure because I'll be cooking for chefs," he said. But the 
general public is welcome too, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu will open with soba noodles and tea smoke shrimp in cilantro-infused 
oil and ginger syrup. Then it's a bouillon a la chionaise with petite venison 
dumplings, followed by shepherd's greens with grilled rattlesnake served with 
prickly pear vinaigrette. After a grapefruit and tarragon sorbet comes the main 
course -- Supreme of Pheasant with wild mushroom and leek ragout, pommes de 
Brazil and fall vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert, a Rainbow Extraordinaire -- teardrops of passion fruit outlined by 
white chocolate in an art deco rainbow, with white chocolate star cookies 
rainbowed in pastels -- will be prepared by La Starr Heiliger of La Starr & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocktails will begin at 6 p.m., dinner at 7. Dancing to the Tim Buley Ensemble 
will wrap up the evening. Tickets to the black-tie optional affair are $50. The 
country club is at 955 Fairway Drive.

 Movie rating -- An item on the front page of Wednesday's Calendar about this 
week's video release of the Martin Lawrence concert film, "You So Crazy," 
mistakenly reported the film's rating. The Motion Picture Assn. of America 
originally rated the movie NC-17. Miramax protested the rating, lost the 
protest and then released the film without a rating.

TIMES POLL / A LOOK AT THE ELECTORATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Times statewide exit poll shows the demographic makeup of Tuesday's 
California electorate and how the groups voted for governor, U.S. senator and 
on Proposition 187. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 5,336 voters as they exited 85 polling places 
across the state. Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout in past 
general elections. The survey was by confidential questionnaire. The margin of 
sampling error for percentages based on the entire sample is plus or minus 3 
percentage points. For some subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher. 
Because the survey does not include absentee voters or those who declined to 
participate when approached, actual returns and demographic estimates by the 
interviewers were used to slightly adjust the sample. Davis Market Research 
Services Inc. of Calabasas assisted The Times in this poll.
