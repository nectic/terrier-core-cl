 Market Overview * U.S. stocks ended mixed in quiet trading Tuesday as 
investors focused on rising long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, most markets rebounded after Monday's plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bond yields rose sharply as the Treasury launched its quarterly 
refinancing. Short rates also inched up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold staged a partial rebound from Monday's slide, but key commodity markets 
closed early because of a snowstorm in the East. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The market traded in a narrow range as investors sought firm footing, still 
reeling from last Friday's big slide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average eased 0.29 point to 3,906.03, dragged down by a 
selloff in Sears shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks had an easier time. The Nasdaq composite index gained 3.50 
points to 782.70, and winners topped losers 14 to 11 on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, winners edged losers by 12 to 9, though most 
broader blue-chip indexes lost ground with the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume totaled 318.2 million shares, down from Monday's 348.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors remain tentative after Friday's 96-point Dow drop 
following news that the Federal Reserve Board was tightening credit for the 
first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow rebounded nearly 35 points Monday, but Tuesday was "a day of gentle 
sparring between buyers and sellers," as one analyst put it. "A lot of people 
are still trying to make up their minds what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 A continuing rise in long-term bond yields didn't help sentiment Tuesday. 
Also, the winter storm in the East slowed volume in the afternoon as some 
traders left early to escape the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the Dow, industrial issues staged another rally, while consumer stocks 
were weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Among industrials, AlliedSignal jumped 1 1/2 to 77 3/8 after reporting strong 
quarterly earnings, declaring a two-for-one stock split and raising its 
dividend. Also rising sharply were Alcoa, up 1 1/4 to 79 3/8, and GM, up 1 3/4 
to 64 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, Sears plunged 3 1/4 to 47 3/4 on its quarterly earnings 
report. Other consumer losers included Philip Morris, off 1 1/8 to 58 3/4; 
Disney, down 1 to 45 5/8, and McDonald's, off 1/2 to 59 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pfizer fell 2 1/4 to 59 3/8 after the drug firm forecast 1994 earnings on 
the low side of analysts' estimates. Other drug stocks also fell. Merck lost 
5/8 to 34 1/2 and Schering-Plough dropped 1 5/8 to 60 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some food stocks were weak after Kellogg raised cereal prices. Some 
investors fear a consumer backlash. Kellogg lost 7/8 to 51 3/8, General Mills 
sank 1 1/4 to 57 3/4 and Quaker Oats was off 1/2 to 63 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southland-based Dole Food gained 1 1/4 to 30 5/8 after Merrill Lynch 
upgraded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other Southland issues, Earth Technology rose 3/8 to 13 1/4 after 
agreeing to acquire Summit Environmental in a stock swap. And toy giant Mattel 
surged 1 3/4 to 25 on a strong earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech sector, chip makers soared in advance of an industry report on 
January orders. Intel gained 1 1/2 to 63 1/2, Motorola soared 4 to 100 1/4 and 
Advanced Micro Devices surged 1 5/8 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
 * America Online jumped 3 to 73 1/2 after Apple Computer said it holds 
warrants to buy a 6.6% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, most major markets stabilized. Tokyo's Nikkei index added 236.83 
points to 20,251.23, Frankfurt's DAX index rose 27.81 points to 2,107.21 and 
London's FTSE-100 index was up 21.1 points to 3,440.20. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates were stable for much of the session but surged late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield jumped to 6.45% from 6.39% on Monday. 
Three-month T-bill yields inched up to 3.32% from 3.30% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's auction of three-year notes Tuesday, the first batch of $40 
billion in new securities to be sold this week, may have disappointed traders. 
The average yield on the notes was 4.83%, highest in 15 months and a byproduct 
of the Fed's decision last week to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury will sell 10-year notes today and 30-year bonds on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold staged a rally after Monday's dive. Near-term gold futures added $3.40 
to $382.30 an ounce on the Comex. Silver added 3.1 cents to $5.26. But the 
session was abbreviated by the eastern storm. 
</P>
<P>
 * March crude oil futures eased 4 cents to $15.21 a barrel on the New York 
Merc after erasing strong early gains on talk of cuts in OPEC and Russian 
production.

FIXATIONS: 'PILGRIM PAT' QUILTER OF LAGUNA BEACH TRADES HIS CREATURE COMFORTS 
FOR BUCKSKINS AND LIVING HISTORY, EMULATING THE RUGGED, PRE-1840 LIFESTYLE OF 
HUNTERS AND TRAPPERS; TRUE GRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grizzled mountain man Pat Quilter hefts a crude throwing tomahawk in his 
grizzled hand, his sweat-scarred buckskins rippling with the movement. In a 
face hemmed by his unkempt bushy beard and hair, his eyes narrow. His sinews 
tense, and the 'hawk slices through the air, embedding with a resounding thud 
into an upended section of tree trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 A little higher and grizzled mountain man Pat would have had to strike out for 
the wilds of his next-door neighbor's house: "Excuse me, but I believe that's 
my tomahawk stuck in your stucco." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead he walked past his gleaming BMW and into his own modern 
semi-Spanish-style Laguna house. This mountain man thing isn't what it was 150 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Quilter two decades ago, when his garage-sized Costa Mesa business 
was building guitar amps for many local bands. That company slowly grew to the 
$30 million per year QSC Audio Products (if you've gone to a movie theater, the 
Coach House or seen touring acts such as Jimmy Buffett, you've probably heard 
their pro-line gear), during which time Quilter came to be quite businesslike 
in his appearance. Though I hesitate to utter such a vile word, yuppie is a 
term Quilter has used in describing himself.  
</P>
<P>
 It was surprising, then, to run into him at Anaheim's National Assn. of Music 
Merchants trade show in January and find that he's had a hair explosion. His 
locks and beard were not merely long, but wild looking, sort of like having 
nose hair all over.  
</P>
<P>
 At least he was wearing normal clothing at the show. For a while he had taken 
to wearing his handmade buckskins to the office. "But I got so scroungy-looking 
that the guys have informed me that I really ought not to burden them with 
that," Quilter complained.  
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just the looks. A set of use-seasoned buckskins conveys an olfactory 
ambience that is rather like being in the vicinity of a dead and untidy deer. 
Quilter's buckskins are only a year old, but they are mapped with sweat, grime 
and other wash-day worries. Not that he plans on washing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's kind of heresy. You can wash them in Woolite in the cold cycle, and 
some guys do, but that's not authentic. As far as we can tell from the old 
journals, 'Unwashed save by the rains' was one of the quotes of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 The we here refers to the members of the buckskinners movement, of which 
Quilter is but a newcomer. In something of a more fun parallel to Robert Bly's 
men's movement, a lot of guys (and some women) are taking to the woods in a 
primitive manner, emulating the rugged pre-1840 lifestyle of American hunters 
and trappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilter guesses there must be thousands of buckskinners among us in the state, 
since he has seen in excess of 600 at a single gathering. Those take place over 
weekends and holidays with varying degrees of historical severity. At most of 
them, participants drive their tents, tepees and other gear into a site, then 
park the vehicles out of view some distance away. (Quilter leaves the BMW at 
home, instead taking a Citroen 2cv he's named Two Ponies. "It's only got 29 
horsepower, but it feels like 30," he claims.) 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal is that, were a stranger to walk into the scene, there would be 
nothing to give him the impression he was anywhere but in pre-1840 rustic 
America. In reality, though, at most events -- often called rendezvous or 
voyageurs -- Coleman ice chests lurk under blankets or tooled leather covers, 
and modern cigarettes dangle from more than a few mouths.  
</P>
<P>
 At the extreme end is the American Mountain Men, a hard-core buckskinning 
organization Quilter aspires to join. Their meets are held at off-road sites 
where participants must pack in their gear. Hence, shelter is often just a 
bedroll, and the food certainly doesn't come out of a cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilter has photos of an AMM meet he attended (cameras are a tolerated 
anachronism), one of which is labeled, "A Barbados sheep brought in for 
slaughter. . . . Killed quickly and clean, with due ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny; around the house I'm as squeamish as the next person," Quilter 
said. "Out there you don't think about that. When we slaughtered the sheep, the 
guy cleaning him did the 'Dances with Wolves' thing with the raw liver, cutting 
it out, taking a chunk off it and holding it out for anyone else who was 
interested in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave it a try, and it was perfectly good. Kevin Costner's take in the movie 
was authentic: You're going 'Uggh,' holding this quivering, dripping organ, but 
when you bit into it, it's chewy, kind of like wet sponge cake, and doesn't 
taste anything like cooked liver. It was mild, with a nutty taste. So you kind 
of choke down the first bite and then go, 'Hey, that's good!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what is it that leads a successful 47-year-old to go nipping at sheep 
entrails? As Spiro Agnew was wont to do, let's blame it on the hippies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember in the late '60s how hippies were going around in fringe and Indian 
outfits? (Neil Young, for one, affected that look at the time.) I never really 
made it to card-carrying hippie. I wore my hair long, but I never really left 
the family fold. I was fascinated, though, by that sort-of Indian look, and 
started wearing buckskins a lot," Quilter recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 That interest wound up on the back burner for several years as his business 
grew. He learned of the current buckskinning movement via magazines but kept 
his interest at arm's length until after he entered a sobriety program 1 1/2 
years ago. "As part of the program you are encouraged to go out and do new 
things, and that's what galvanized me to try it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to a gun show in Pomona, figuring the muzzle-loaders there could tell 
him more about getting involved. Like most of us, Quilter has an interest in 
looking like he knows what he's doing, so it wasn't the most graceful of 
entries into the buckskinning world when he tried on a too-small period shirt 
at one booth and got stuck in it. A couple of buckskinners helped him out of 
it, and rather than laugh at him, they accepted his interest and invited him to 
a gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I entered this world with trepidation, thinking it would be like joining a 
biker club where I'd have to prove my manliness or something. But we're talking 
about real gentlemen here, not in the Fred Astaire sense, but in the sense of 
people who have the basic confidence to know they don't need to be rough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are very rugged former Green Beret types, who definitely 
understand the uses of violence as much as anyone on the planet. Then there's a 
strain that is more the Deadhead type, people who want to be closer to nature, 
enjoy the outdoors and seek the spiritual side of it. And everyone I've met has 
been honorable and undemanding and possessed of a great deal of mutual 
respect," he said. Though Quilter has a very rare 1930s National resonator 
guitar that is his pride and joy, he thinks nothing of leaving it and other 
valuables unattended at his camp at rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a career Marine (who ended up a general), Quilter moved often in 
his childhood. He dreamed of having a stream to play in, but the closest he 
ever came to rustic living was when the family moved to Emerald Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his mind would wander through speculative historical adventures -- "I 
still wonder about things like 'If I was suddenly transported back to the Roman 
Empire, could I build a car there?' " -- in practice he was "a skinny kid 
growing up in the suburbs. I never felt as manly as I wanted to be. Later, even 
though with the help of other people I was working 70-hour weeks building a 
good company from scratch, I always still wondered if I had true grit ." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, he has achieved true grime. Not counting household and office 
wear, he has amassed 90 days of field use on his buckskins -- including time he 
and a new-found buckskinning friend spent building a log cabin with hand tools 
near Julian -- and they look it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a journal of where you've been," Quilter said of his weathered 
outfit (real buckskinners don't wear underwear, by the way). There also is a 
sense of living history to what he's doing: 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some records of where mountain men went and what they took with 
them, and once in a while a reflection on the privations they suffered. But you 
rarely get a record of the ordinary day-to-day things that happened, because 
they were too commonplace to them. If you keep a journal now and mention that 
you went to L.A., you don't explain how you started the car or any of the 
little things because everybody takes that stuff for granted. So the only way 
to find those things out is to re-create the lifestyle as closely as possible 
and see what happens. After a few months of hard service, you certainly see 
what happens to your clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quilter made his outfit in conjunction with an experienced buckskin 
seamstress. They used commercially tanned hides, though he supposes someday 
he'll make a set using traditional brain-tanned hides (you really don't want to 
know the squishy details of brain-tanning). He's cut his work week back to 40 
hours and hasn't turned his TV on in two months, because he's busy making camp 
chairs or tooled leather covers for the guitar and hammered dulcimer he takes 
to gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 His fellows have nicknamed him Pilgrim Pat -- meaning he's an earnest beginner 
-- though he hopes to earn a more substantial title. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my best friends and guides in this is named Spotted Owl. I think he 
got that name in something of a spirit quest or a dream. But I have another 
friend named Spotted Elk, whose outfit is make of elk skin. He came back from 
using a dark outhouse one night with wet spots on the front of his pants. 
Someone yelled, 'Hey look, it's Spotted Elk!' and by morning this name had gone 
through the camp. Sooner or later I suppose I'll do something sufficiently 
goofy to warrant a name," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more than any moniker or new duds he could hang on himself, Quilter values 
the internal changes buckskinning has brought him. For most of his life he has 
regarded himself to be a cautious loner, or, as he also put it, a nerd.  
</P>
<P>
 "Through personal insecurity or whatever I've always had some difficulty in 
reaching out to other people. If push came to shove, I'd rather withdraw. I 
feel like I'm more bonded with the rest of humanity now. Out there you do need 
to ask a lot of questions, and they are very helpful people. I've made lots 
more good friends since starting this than in the 15 years before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buckskinners in a fairly conscious way are fleeing the downside of the big 
city. And the worst part of the big city is that your enemy is other people, 
and you become very suspicious of other people. When you get out of the city, 
your enemy, if you will, is Mother Nature. That's putting it wrong, because 
nature is your friend if you know how to get along. What you're up against is 
reality . And out there, people are your friends now, someone who can help you. 
You know you have to pull together to get by." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far Quilter has only attended buckskinning events in California (an easy 
city-bound introduction to its world can usually be found each March at 
Anaheim's Hobby City, in an event called a Shivaree, though this year's has 
been canceled due to construction). This year he hopes to branch out to 
attending national events. Meanwhile, his home is slowly filling with handmade 
items he makes for his outings, such as a badger-skin camera pack.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a far cry from the circuit boards one finds in his audio amplifiers, 
neatly laid out like miniature planned communities of silicon and copper.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain my fascination for buckskinning, except that it's so much the 
opposite of my normal fussy technical personality. Getting to get out and get 
scroungy in the dirt focuses the mind in a whole different way. Instead of this 
civilized intellectual exercise, planning things out months in advance, it's 
basically, 'OK, I'm hungry, what do I have to do to be able to eat?' It's a 
purely physical thing, where you're enduring the cold, the wet and the hard 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're building a cabin, our efforts are going directly into a result 
we're going to be able to appreciate. Usually in life, you go to work, do 
something that may or may not be meaningful to you, get the money and then go 
buy things that other people have done in a factory environment that may or may 
not mean something to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real easy to lose track of the meaning of life. I can't say I have any 
handle on the meaning of life, but I think part of it is experiencing more. I 
know that I have experienced more, on a direct meaningful level, by learning 
how to do things the hard way," Quilter said. "It's been a blast, and it's 
changed my life."

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIR; AN UNSHAKABLE SOUL -- EVEN AFTER YEARS AT HARD LABOR; 
BITTER WINDS A MEMOIR OF MY YEARS IN CHINA'S GULAG, BY HARRY WU AND CAROLYN 
WAKEMAN ; JOHN WILEY & SONS, $22.95, 290 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stoop labor in the fields was the most desirable work assignment in the slave 
labor camps of the People's Republic of China during the '50s. In "Bitter 
Winds," Harry Wu's memoir of his 19-year ordeal as a "thought criminal," Wu 
explains why. 
</P>
<P>
 "While working in the irrigation ditches one morning, one of my squad members 
discovered a hole in the canal bank and called for my help," he writes. "I grew 
excited, hoping it might lead to a rat's nest full of stored rice and corn and 
wheat. . . . That would be a fortune." 
</P>
<P>
 As Wu tells us in "Bitter Wind," he was arrested on the day after his 
graduation from college in 1960 and condemned to an open-ended sentence of 
"re-education through labor." 
</P>
<P>
 His crime? Wu, a banker's son from a middle-class family in Shanghai, was 
cursed with an independent spirit, an insistently curious mind, and a love of 
freedom that made it impossible to pay obeisance to the revolution with 
sufficient fervor to satisfy the cadres of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you are very tough, very stubborn," Wu's father warned his son after 
the Communists came to power in China, "but this time you must also be very 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappily, but perhaps inevitably, we see that Wu was never careful enough. 
Even as a starved and tortured prisoner within the innermost circle of the 
Chinese gulag, his spirit was unbroken -- at one point, Wu buried a copy of 
"Les Miserables" rather than turn over his cache of "reactionary" literature 
for burning by the Red Guard, and he ended up in a coffin-like "confinement 
cell" for the audacious crime of writing a letter of protest to Mao Zedong. 
</P>
<P>
 The party demanded confession as the price of mercy, but Wu allows us to 
understand that no degree of self-abasement was great enough, no betrayal was 
complete enough, to satisfy his captors. The prison system was designed to 
eradicate every memory, to sever every link to friends and family, and to 
create a "new socialist person" whose only concern was blind service to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must begin with your father and describe how he has betrayed and 
exploited the working class," Wu was told by his police interrogators at the 
outset of his long confinement. "That way you can show that you want to become 
a true fighter for communism." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bitter Winds" deserves to be compared to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag 
Archipelago" as an achingly intimate account of what happened to millions of 
innocent men and women in the secret penal realm of the People's Republic. And 
there's a strong dose of Kafka and Orwell in Wu's tales of a world so twisted 
by revolutionary ardor that every decent human impulse became a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly the traditional practice of foot-binding came to my mind," he writes 
of a bitter revelation that came to him in his darkest hour. "We have switched 
to head-binding, I thought. . . That's why they arrested me. That's why they 
want to change me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wu's book includes his own precise and damning testimony about the crimes 
committed against "thought prisoners" by the Communist regime. Beatings and 
executions were commonplace -- one prisoner was summarily shot at a "struggle 
meeting," and then his brains were scooped out and eaten. Wu describes the 
brutal forced-feeding that he endured when he lost his appetite while in 
solitary confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Party and the government do not fear your threat of suicide," said a 
police captain as a rubber hose forced through Wu's nose and down his throat -- 
and one is reminded of a particularly vile and nightmarish manifestation of the 
Red Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Bitter Winds" so memorable, however, is not merely its meticulous 
documentation of the indignities and outrages practiced upon the Chinese people 
by an authoritarian regime. Rather, Wu shares with us the secret moments of 
life in the gulag, the hidden encounters that allowed a man such as Wu to 
survive the daily torment of mind and body for nearly 20 years, the subtle acts 
of courage and heroism by which some prisoners rescued themselves and some 
prisoners rescued their fellows. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu describes, for example, his curious marriage of convenience to a fellow 
prisoner, a woman whose crime was a relationship with an American who defected 
to China after the Korean War -- Wu and his wife lived together in a cave near 
the coal mine where they both labored, and they forged a tender bond not so 
much of love but of shared affliction. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most poignant story in "Bitter Winds" focuses on a prisoner named 
Lu, a man for whom forbidden homoerotic encounters with his fellow prisoners 
became a passion and then, literally, a matter of life and death. So frank is 
Wu in telling Lu's story that he gives us the very moment when Wu himself, 
after declining Lu's sexual overtures, makes a heartfelt but unsuccessful 
effort to entice Lu out of a suicidal despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come, put your arms around me," Wu finally said to Lu, but too late to save 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Harry Wu lives and works in the United States -- he's a 
scholar-in-residence at Stanford University -- and "Bitter Winds" is the saga 
of a man whom history tried and failed to break: "I had met the king of hell, 
but he was not ready for me," Wu writes of a coal-mine accident that nearly 
killed him -- but his words are a suitable epigram for his remarkable book.

 Quake Help for CalArts: The J. Paul Getty Trust has awarded $2 million to 
California Institute of the Arts to help repair the Valencia campus' earthquake 
damage, which is estimated at $12 million to $15 million. CalArts received 
extensive damage to its mechanical systems in the Jan. 17 quake and has been 
forced to move its 1,000 students to temporary, off-site classrooms. Most of 
the campus remains structurally intact, however, and administrators hope to 
return to full operations by September. "CalArts is recognized internationally 
as a leading educational institution devoted to the arts," Trust President 
Harold M. Williams said of the unsolicited gift. "We hope (it) will encourage 
others to support the institute as it rebuilds." MOVIES

 Vying for 'Worsts': The Madonna-Willem Dafoe picture "Body of Evidence," 
Sylvester Stallone's "Cliffhanger," the Demi Moore-Robert Redford film 
"Indecent Proposal," Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Last Action Hero" and the Sharon 
Stone-William Baldwin flick "Sliver" have been selected by the Golden Raspberry 
Award Foundation to vie for the dubious honor of the year's worst motion 
picture. Nominated for worst actress were Madonna, Melanie Griffith ("Born 
Yesterday"), Janet Jackson ("Poetic Justice"), Moore and Stone. Taking nods for 
worst actor were Baldwin, Dafoe, Redford, Schwarzenegger and Burt Reynolds 
("Cop and a Half"). The "Razzie" awards, an annual spoof of the Oscars, will be 
announced March 20, the day before the Academy Awards. And speaking of the 
Oscars, cable viewers will have two choices for live coverage of today's 5:30 
a.m. announcement of 1994 nominations. Steve Kmetko and Michael Castner will 
host the coverage on E! Entertainment Television, and Laurin Sydney and Jim 
Moret will front a special edition of CNN's "Showbiz Today."

 Violence Study Bolsters Network Claims: A new study supports the networks' 
claims that they have reduced violence on the air, and indicates that the real 
culprit in TV violence is first-run syndicated programming. The independent 
Center for Media and Public Affairs evaluated the season premieres of eight 
syndicated and 74 network series this season. It found that the eight 
syndicated programs accounted for 33% more serious violence than all 74 network 
series, and six of the 10 most violent programs were syndicated (no cable 
programming was evaluated). The findings also essentially backed the networks' 
claims that they have reduced violence in their programs: Although incidents of 
violence did increase slightly overall in comparison to the same study last 
year, incidents classified as "serious violence" -- such as armed or sexual 
assaults -- dropped by 28% and the amount of gunplay was down by nearly 58%.

 Another Jackson Case: Michael Jackson figures in yet another lawsuit, although 
for once he's not a defendant. This time, attorneys Duane Folke and Herbert 
Hafif, who represented a sound engineer who had sued Jackson for not crediting 
him properly on the "Bad" album, have turned around and sued their former 
client, Hugo Zuccarelli, alleging he agreed to settle the case and then backed 
out, wanting more. The case ended last March when Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge David Yaffe granted a summary judgment to Jackson and CBS/Sony. 
Zuccarelli reacted by punching two of Jackson's lawyers and thus receiving a 
community service sentence for misdemeanor assault. QUICK TAKES

MUSIC REVIEWS; PRAGUE'S TALICH QUARTET PREVAILS OVER OBSTACLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about triumphing over adversity, and of heroism in the face of certain 
defeat! The Talich String Quartet, pride of Prague, accomplished those feats in 
the first of three Music Guild concerts on consecutive days -- tonight they're 
at the Wilshire-Ebell -- on a particularly foul, weatherwise, Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they had to conquer a pitiless foe: the sonic launching pad/boom box 
known as Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall on the Cal State Long Beach campus, a 
venue almost comically unsuited to the Talich's intimate style. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was an airline snafu that caused violist Jan Talich's suitcase, 
containing his music (don't ever put anything vital to your livelihood into 
checked luggage!) and tux, to be sent in one direction while he went in 
another, necessitating a program overhaul -- and shirtsleeves for Talich. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of these challenges, the ensemble offered its strongest, most 
committed playing within memory, thanks in no small part to the vivifying 
presence of a young, new second violinist, Vladimir Bukac. 
</P>
<P>
 Jitters were dispatched at the outset in a scrambled reading of the 
15-year-old Schubert's E-flat Quartet, in which first violinist Petr Messiereur 
got some cloying, alt-Wien -style slides out of his system. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the concert, then, became Debussy's G-minor Quartet, in a subtle, 
faceted reading that found the artists projecting an astonishingly wide dynamic 
range within a framework that rarely exceeded what other groups might regard as 
a forte . 
</P>
<P>
 Their interpretation climaxed in a bewitchingly misterioso Adagio, 
characterized by the dark velvet of Talich's viola and the gently firm anchor 
of Evzen Rattay's cello. 
</P>
<P>
 The program concluded with Dvorak's "American" Quartet, propelled by 
Messiereur with nimble lightness of tone and sentiment, in delightful contrast 
to its lush, heroic delivery by the Tokyo Quartet, 24 hours earlier at 
Pepperdine University. HERBERT GLASS

MUSIC REVIEWS; QUARTET MAKES IMPACT IN WEST COAST DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tackling brave new territory in the conservative-leaning realm of classical 
music tradition takes a unique blend of conviction, refined talent and a bit of 
damn-the-torpedoes ambition. Those qualities are amply in evidence with the New 
Century Saxophone Quartet, not to mention a finely honed musicality deserving 
wider acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 While only half a house showed up at Ambassador Auditorium Monday night for 
the North Carolina-based quartet's West Coast debut, those in attendance proved 
a conspicuously appreciative gathering. Polish and vitality distinguish the 
group -- soprano saxophonist Michael Stephenson, altoist James Boatman (also 
the group's arranger), tenor Stephen Pollock and baritone Brad Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of jazz and theater music, saxophones have always had a rough time 
gaining respect in the classical world. As shown again in Pasadena, the bias is 
unfortunate, because this is a hybrid instrument of great luster and 
versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening with the formality of Jean Baptiste Singelee's First Quartet (1857), 
the ensemble immediately displayed its winning voice, a warm, reedy and 
creamily unified collective sound. Three short Shostakovich pieces, of marginal 
interest, established further connection with classical orthodoxy, but the most 
refreshing music came from living composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood Shaffer's handsome Sinfonia for Saxophone Quartet had the group 
contrapuntally weaving and intersecting voices, while Elliot del Borgo's 
Quartet featured both rampaging triplets and dark-toned introspection. Morton 
Gould's Pavane (from his American Symphonette No. 2) contained some of the 
evening's most overt jazz references but in a coy, quirky style. 
</P>
<P>
 Better-integrated jazz ideas came with the concert's highlight and closer, 
Russell Peck's "Drastic Measures." It begins, actually, with lilting, tender 
measures and gets brasher by the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Inherently, the New Century Saxophone Quartet is a crusading unit, spreading 
the gospel about this maligned instrument's serious aspirations. They made 
believers here. JOSEF WOODARD

TV REVIEW; 'REFLECTIONS ON ELEPHANTS' OFFERS FASCINATING MOMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SCHEIDERER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We learned long ago from "National Geographic" specials that the animal world 
can be endlessly fascinating. Tonight's program, "Reflections on Elephants" (8 
p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15, 7 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 
24) proves the point yet again. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the noted wildlife filmmaking team of Dereck and Beverly Joubert to 
thank for this involving journey. They spent a year following packs of the last 
free-roaming elephants on earth as they traversed ancient paths in Botswana on 
a never-ending quest for water and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Elephants live in a matriarchal society, with the dominant female leading the 
pack. Male elephants, it seems, are pretty much on their own except during the 
mating season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jouberts were able to film some fascinating moments: the rare (in the 
animal world) adoption of an abandoned calf by the pack; the rescue of a young 
elephant from a muddy pond by the older females, working almost as a team of 
engineers; a lone elephant calf's escape from a group of young lions; the death 
of an old bull at a crowded water hole. 
</P>
<P>
 But be prepared to have one of your favorite myths shattered: There is no 
elephant graveyard. Dying elephants lie where they fall and quickly become part 
of the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Also fascinating is the elephants' seeming reverential attitude toward the 
dead. In a haunting ritual that the narrator, actor Stacy Keach, is at a loss 
to explain, the elephants fondle the skull and ivory of a bull elephant months 
after its death. 
</P>
<P>
 The elephants' life span is just about the same as humans, but most of it is 
taken up in the search for sustenance. "Reflections on Elephants" makes their 
ceaseless travels compelling viewing.

TV RATINGS; OLD PROS AND KERRIGAN HELP CBS SKATE TO VICTORY

 ABC had the top-rated show of the week with "Home Improvement," and NBC was 
second with "Frasier," but CBS won the network race, according to figures 
released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. It was helped in large measure by its 
Sunday night movie with Joanne Woodward and James Garner, "Breathing Lessons," 
which delivered what the network said were the second best ratings for any TV 
movie this season--about 20.3 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS also won the ice-skating showdown Saturday night, with "Nancy Kerrigan & 
Friends"attracting viewers in about 12.6 million homes, compared to 9.8 million 
for ABC's "Skates of Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS continues to lead in prime time for the season as a whole, in terms of 
reaching the most homes each week, but ABC maintains that there are, on 
average, more people watching TV in each of the households it reaches, so that 
its programming is actually seen by more viewers than CBS'. ABC says it is 
averaging 18.7 million viewers in prime time compared to 18.3 million for CBS. 
NBC and Fox trail in both categories. Southland Ratings Here are A. C.

<P>
 * Appointing Robert Fiske as special counsel for the Whitewater affair (Jan. 
21) is an outrageous waste of the taxpayer's money and an egregious disservice 
to the American public. What will be accomplished by this investigation? How 
can this effort possibly help reduce our debt, pass a comprehensive health care 
program or in any way facilitate the solution of the very serious problems we 
have? 
</P>
<P>
 We have a new, vigorous President who is working hard to bring about change in 
our country. We need to support this effort. Preoccupation with events that 
took place before President Clinton took office, such as Whitewater and who 
slept with whom, is a debilitating diversion which is unnecessary, unfair and 
irrelevant.

<P>
 * Your article on the Clintons' Whitewater venture had quite a generous spin 
in favor of the Clintons (Jan. 31).  
</P>
<P>
 According to tax bills (stamps), the Clintons sold their lot for $2,000 and it 
was then resold for $35,000. After this was made public, it was claimed that 
the sales price was $33,000 and there was a simple mistake on the taxes. Isn't 
that called tax evasion? Hillary, on retainer with her investment partner, 
James McDougal, petitioned a Clinton-appointed commissioner to approve a 
recapitalization on a failing land investment with a troubled financial 
history. She "sidestepped" the law by borrowing $30,000 from a bank she was on 
retainer with and loaned it back to her investment partner, who owned that 
bank. Is this not the type of fraud that caused the savings-and-loan failures? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons are victims because they lost money on the deal; however, they 
had not claimed the loss on tax returns and the unquestioned reason was that 
the $68,900 they lost was a contribution. Get real.

SLOW WAY IS RIGHT WAY ON WARD VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Monday the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated 6.4 million acres of 
desert as critical habitat for the threatened desert tortoise. Ward Valley, a 
part of the Mojave Desert near Needles that will be included in the protected 
tortoise habitat, is also the proposed site for a low-level radioactive waste 
dump. Construction of the dump may not automatically be prevented by the 
inclusion of Ward Valley in the protected habitat, but inclusion brings the 
Endangered Species Act and the Federal Land Policy Management Act into play, 
laws that environmentalists have promised to invoke against the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Dump proponents will continue to argue that the subtraction of 1,000 acres for 
a radioactive waste dump would leave more than enough room for the tortoise, 
but this argument was considered and rejected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service when it made its decision: Habitat protection does not always work by 
simple arithmetic, and we applaud the inclusion of the Ward Valley site in the 
protected habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Less noticed was a limited ruling made Monday by California Superior Court 
Judge Robert H. O'Brien in a Ward Valley-related suit brought against 
California's Department of Health Services by the Ft. Mojave Indian tribe, 
Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Southern California Federation of 
Scientists and the Committee to Bridge the Gap.  
</P>
<P>
 This suit claims that the department violated the California Environmental 
Quality Act, the Radiation Control Act, the Atomic Energy Act and the 
California Administrative Procedure Act and also disregarded state licensing 
standards when it licensed U.S. Ecology Inc. to operate the proposed dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has promised not to transfer the federally 
owned land at Ward Valley to state ownership until the conclusion of this and 
other litigation. Only then, depending on what kind of inquiry the courts may 
require, will Babbitt be able to determine how much remains to be done before 
the safety of the site can be assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge O'Brien ruled that an "adjudicatory" hearing was not required for the 
issuance of the license, deferring to an earlier appellate court ruling. 
However, the judge did not rule that earlier hearings were adequate or that the 
license had been properly issued. Further arguments in as many as two dozen 
courts will be necessary to decide the propriety of the license. Whichever side 
wins, the other will appeal; and once the case reaches the appellate level, the 
question of the full-fledged "adjudicatory" hearing surely will be 
reintroduced. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the safety of the Ward Valley site has by no means been 
established. Babbitt was wise to postpone his own action until the pending 
civil suits are resolved. We are counting on him to act appropriately when the 
time comes but -- no less important -- to wait appropriately until that time.

CALIFORNIA CAN'T KEEP PAYING THIS TAB; PROPOSED FEDERAL BUDGET IGNORES PLEAS 
FOR IMMIGRANT AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From a national perspective, President Clinton's $1.5-trillion budget is a 
step in the right direction, emphasizing deficit reduction rather than dramatic 
new spending programs (though the uncertain factor of health care reform could 
alter Clinton's austere calculations). However, from a California perspective a 
very big element is missing -- more federal aid to reimburse the state for the 
money it spends on federally mandated services for illegal immigrants. The 
absence of additional funding is a major disappointment to California and other 
states with large immigrant populations like Florida and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson was counting heavily on an infusion of $2.3 billion in 
federal aid to help balance the state's books next year. In fairness to 
Clinton, Wilson's immigrant-aid request probably was too large. It included 
$1.7 billion for education programs, $300 million for Medi-Cal reimbursements 
and $300 million to pay for the incarceration of illegal immigrants in state 
prisons. With the exception of the illegal-immigrant population in prison, 
which can be counted easily, Wilson's request was based on population estimates 
that he should have known would be challenged by federal officials. So it 
simply was not responsible budgeting for the governor to have relied so greatly 
on so much federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not help matters that Wilson's aid request was couched in the 
stridently anti-immigrant rhetoric he has fallen into the unfortunate habit of 
using. It was all too easy for Washington to dismiss the request as political 
posturing by a governor using the immigration issue in a reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 UNBALANCED BURDEN: However, in fairness to California, the Clinton 
Administration should have looked beyond the angry rhetoric of Wilson's request 
to simple justice. For although the number of illegal immigrants and their 
positive or negative impact on U.S. society are open to debate, there is no 
disagreement over the fact that they are concentrated in California. And while 
their labor no doubt contributes to the state's economy, most of the taxes they 
pay go to Washington. Meanwhile, they use facilities like schools and county 
hospitals that must be paid for out of local tax coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The imbalance is obvious and has only grown worse in recent years, when severe 
cuts in defense spending (also mandated in Washington, it is worth remembering) 
helped send California's economy into the worst downturn since the Great 
Depression. It is this imbalance, as much as anything, that has fed the 
frustration over the immigration issue that many Californians feel -- 
frustration that in turn has spawned ugly anti-immigrant sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 UNFAIR CHOICE: The Clinton Administration has requested special help for 
California elsewhere, including $8.6 billion in aid to rebuild from the 
Northridge earthquake. And the proposed budget asks for $4.8 billion in defense 
conversion, a large part of which will be spent in California, in addition to 
$2.2 billion in Medicaid funds for indigent patients and $700 million in 
education programs for poor students, both of which can be spent on immigrants, 
legal and illegal. But that in effect is asking Sacramento to choose between 
poor citizens and poor immigrants; that is an unfair choice to ask California, 
or any other state, to make, especially in light of the fact that the 
immigration problems are not of Sacramento's doing but rather result from the 
federal failure to adequately enforce immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 It is up to California's large congressional delegation to carry on Wilson's 
fight to get more federal funding for the educational, medical and prison costs 
associated with illegal immigrants. We disagree with how the governor has waged 
the campaign to have California treated more fairly, but his cause clearly is a 
good one.

TOPANGA DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It was with outrage that we read Alexander Cockburn's Column Left, 
"Speculation vs. Democracy in Topanga" (Feb. 3). As longtime Topanga residents 
who have a history of community involvement, we feel compelled to address the 
blatant inaccuracies in Cockburn's article regarding Topanga and Canyon Oaks, 
the proposed residential and recreational project that was approved by the L.A. 
County Regional Planning Commission and awaits approval by the L.A. County 
Board of Supervisors on Feb. 10. We support the decision of the planning 
commission, which found that Canyon Oaks does conform to the L.A. County 
General Plan and the Santa Monica Mountains Area Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Cockburn's column, Topanga Canyon is not the folksy rural 
community of "largely moderate income," nor are most of its residents the 
"unpretentious environmentalists" Cockburn would have you believe. According to 
the 1990 Census, the average family income in Topanga is $100,000. The average 
home price is more than $437,000 and 99% of the population is Caucasian -- 
numbers that add up to an "elitist" population. 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of water, Cockburn claims that the proposed golf course will 
require several times the daily water use of the community. To the contrary, 
golf courses, on the average, use less water per square foot than a residential 
subdivision of the same size.  
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, if Canyon Oaks is approved, never again will water be cut 
off in Topanga by the natural disasters the canyon has suffered recently, such 
as last year's fires and the January earthquake which ruptured Topanga's sole 
water pipeline. Canyon Oaks will provide a vital secondary water source. It 
will store, not use, 1.6 million gallons of water each day.  
</P>
<P>
 As residents who live closer to and will be more affected by the project than 
those who claim opposition, we support Canyon Oaks as proposed. Our group, the 
Friends of Canyon Oaks, includes more than 200 people who live in the immediate 
area, as well as another 200 who live within a five-mile radius of the 
property.  
</P>

 Topanga 
</P>
<P>
 * Thanks to Cockburn for his commentary on Topanga's long battle against the 
powers of greed and insensitivity. After years of preliminary hearings and 
endless delays, the developer's project was denied in 1991. Within two weeks 
the denial was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Topanga Canyon Town Council and we, at the Topanga Assn. for a Scenic 
Community (TASC), initiated a meeting with the new owners to help create a plan 
that would be far less destructive. The golf course resulting from the grading 
of more than 3.5 million cubic yards of Santa Monica Mountain tops at the 
headwaters of Topanga Creek remains the most environmentally egregious aspect 
of the plan. In 1992, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy offered $10 
million to buy the land. Fair market value, alas, was not enough for the 
developer. Instead, the developer launched an expensive public relations 
campaign to discredit the community opposition; to offer handouts (called 
community benefits) intended to compensate for bulldozing 80% of the 
mountainous landscape, and to woo state decision-makers to reject the notion 
that the land be declared a worthy candidate for parkland acquisition.  
</P>
<P>
 Each year, over 10,000 schoolchildren visit Topanga State Park and the Will 
Geer Theatricum Botanicum (for Youth Drama Days). This should represent Topanga 
Canyon, not a gated enclave with annual golf club fees of $55,000.

CONCEALED GUN BILL DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a strong supporter of The Times' position on gun control, I was 
disappointed to read your Feb. 2 editorial bemoaning the Assembly's defeat of 
the Katz bill. 
</P>
<P>
 As a lawyer with a total of 21 years experience as a Los Angeles County 
prosecutor and as a private practitioner, I can say that I have never once seen 
a person convicted of the mere possession of a concealed gun receive the 
maximum penalty. Ex-felons and those possessing firearms at schools can already 
be prosecuted for felonies under existing law. What sense, then, does it make 
to quadruple the maximum sentence for non-aggravated possession, other than to 
gain votes for politicians? 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of concealed gun offenders that I have seen are ordinary, 
middle-class citizens who possessed guns in their vehicles because they were 
returning from target practice or were ignorant of the law or were paranoid 
about their safety because they had been frightened by the rhetoric of 
politicians and the media. Furthermore, they had no prior criminal records. No 
judge in his right mind would incarcerate such persons for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 You are correct that our criminal laws are inconsistent. That is because they 
are enacted piecemeal by ambitious politicians in response to whichever way the 
wind of public opinion is blowing at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 You are right also to have reservations about the various proposals to deal 
harshly with recidivists. You should recognize that the Katz bill is no more 
nobly inspired than the others. The way to deal with the problem is to prevent 
John Q. Criminal and John Q. Public from acquiring the guns in the first place. 
</P>

 * Thank you for your editorial. I have been robbed twice at gunpoint -- the 
second time was last week. I do not blame the LAPD, which is understaffed. I am 
involved with manufacturing pepper gas (OC) as an alternative to guns, which is 
now a felony in California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a veteran of the U.S. Marines, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Air Force, I am 
very capable of using small arms. My recent decision on carrying a concealed 
weapon was a choice of either "Stop, hand over your weapon" (misdemeanor), or 
"Stop, give me your money or I'll kill you" (death sentence). I've made my 
decision! 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD HATA 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * It was disheartening to read that the state Legislature decided to keep it a 
misdemeanor to carry a concealed firearm instead of making it a more serious 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, it is quite telling that politicians are more concerned with the 
interests of the National Rifle Assn. than the great mass of prosecutors and 
other law enforcement professionals. The more the public catches on, however, 
the more that will change. 
</P>
<P>
 RONALD WEBSTER 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * In response to "Guns May Pass Cars in Causing Death by Injury," Jan. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 You could have been fair and stated that of the 38,317 gun-related deaths, 
18,885 were suicides, 1,416 were accidents and 16,218 were homicides. But then 
that would change the impact of numbers for your anti-gun campaign. You also 
failed to note how many of the auto deaths were caused by drunk or other 
drug-impaired drivers. I have not seen any movement to ban alcohol or even 
impound vehicles of convicted drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 You would better serve the public if you got off this anti-gun kick and went 
after the real causes of crime and the lack of punishment.

CRIME NEWS COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am encouraged by the swelling criticism, such as Sherrie Mazingo's "The 
Bottom Line Is Also Tied to Credibility" (Voices, Jan. 17), of the media's 
sensationalist coverage of violence. I don't need to see live coverage each 
night of the latest shooting or carjacking.This violence does concern me. I 
want the media to report on long-term solutions, and how can I personally get 
involved to make our community safer. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not asking for a single story on the neighborhood watch -- although that's 
a good place to start (we're block captains). But, does my councilman have a 
plan, or a task force, to address crime in this district? Or, is there a 
program for at-risk youth, maybe painting over graffiti, that I can volunteer 
time to each month? I want to know what an average citizen can do to turn 
around the spread of the random, violent crime we all live in fear of. And the 
answer isn't buying a gun, which we won't have in the house with our 
2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope we'll see some change in media coverage and priorities.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE SUPERFUND; BRING FAIR PLAY TO TOXIC CLEANUP; MINORITY 
COMMUNITIES SUFFER THE MOST; HERE'S HOW TO BENEFIT THEM AND REVIVE OUR 
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT.

<P>
 American businesses are the most powerful force for economic equality in this 
country. Too often, though, they have viewed the concept of economic justice as 
an adversarial battle between business and minority groups. It need not be so. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, for example, the NAACP signed a historic agreement with Flagstar 
Companies, the owner of Denny's and other restaurants, after accusations of 
racial discrimination at several Denny's restaurants. The agreement committed 
the company to a far-reaching effort to recruit and train minority managers and 
staff, as well as minority-owned franchises. Flagstar also pledged to increase 
its use of minority firms for professional services such as banking and 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Flagstar agreement shows, businesses can assume a far greater role in 
the encouragement of real economic justice. It is in business' interests and in 
the country's interests that such efforts expand. One especially promising area 
for the creation of new models is in hazardous-waste cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of studies and reports, starting in 1982 with a General Accounting 
Office report and including studies by the United Church of Christ and the 
National Law Journal, found that people of color face discrimination in 
positioning and cleaning up hazardous-waste. Also, when it comes to toxic-waste 
cleanup under the federal Superfund, the law, business and the communities 
involved are often in conflict, a major cause of the Superfund's disappointing 
record: In 13 years, fewer than 150 of the 1,275 top priority sites have been 
cleaned up; thousands of lawsuits are pending and billions of dollars are being 
frittered away on activities that have nothing to do with public health. 
</P>
<P>
 As a civil-rights leader and two business executives, we think the Denny's 
experience offers some intriguing lessons and possibilities for creating 
cleaner communities and local jobs. But first, the contentious, balky Superfund 
law will have to be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superfund should be, above all, a public health and 
environmental-protection program. But that is clearly not the current focus. At 
the typical Superfund site, dozens of businesses -- small and large -- local 
governments and individuals battle with one another, with the Environmental 
Protection Agency, with state officials and with citizens over what needs to be 
done and who should pay. They battle because of strict Superfund retroactive 
liability financing, which assesses cleanup costs based on each party's 
percentage of blame. Then, many parties sue their insurers. What a colossal 
waste. Worse, it divides the community, fomenting distrust and delay. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to find a way for both business and community to view the law as 
public-health and environmental benefit as well as economic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we get to that point? Start with this set of eight core principles:  
</P>
<P>
 Shift the law's focus so its primary goal is public health and environmental 
protection; increase funding to ensure prompter cleanups; rank cleanup sites so 
those that pose the greatest danger, alone or in combination with other 
environmental hazards in the area, get addressed first; permit flexibility in 
remedy selection so that the economic and health interests of the community are 
served; replace today's counterproductive, site-by-site liability battles with 
an expanded trust fund financed by broad-based taxes on business; increase 
public participation and community empowerment early and throughout the 
process; enhance positive incentives for sound waste management, and focus 
existing health, economic and community development resources on communities 
that have been disproportionately harmed by toxic waste and emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach offers something for all stake-holders, whether their paramount 
goals are public health and environmental protection, prompt cleanup, lower 
legal costs, fairness, community participation or sound waste management. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to getting more rapid, effective cleanup, why not use a portion of 
Superfund dollars in minority and disadvantaged communities to train these 
citizens to clean up their own communities? Why not focus environmental legal 
resources on parties who break the laws today instead of endless litigation on 
yesterday's failings? 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, about 1,000 of the EPA's 3,000-plus Superfund staff are lawyers or 
provide support for lawyers. Today, it seems, lawyers are there first, last and 
always. With a larger Superfund financed primarily by business taxes, along 
with fundamental reform of the current liability system, regulators can put 
public-health hats on first and keep them on; jobs can be created and 
businesses can become the partners rather than the adversaries of communities.

ON MOURNING OUR BUILT-UP WORLD; QUAKE, FIRE AND FLOOD EXPOSE THE LIMITS OF 
HUMAN EXISTENCE. BUT OUR 'THINGS' ARE NOT JUST THE DETRITUS OF FUTILE ATTEMPTS 
TO DOMINATE NATURE. THEY ARE OUR PART IN CREATION.

<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE ADLER MARKS, Marlene Adler Marks is a columnist for the Jewish 
Journal of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to discussing the post-fire and -earthquake period in Los 
Angeles, I tell my mother: Everything is fine; we're back to normal now. But 
it's not true. Since Jan. 17, a sense of the weird has taken over. Last week, 
two friends were burned out of their home, which spontaneously burst into 
flames. A pipe bomb was found on the San Diego freeway. Cracks appear in 
exterior walls and plaster comes off ceilings as the earth continues to settle. 
And this week, floods.  
</P>
<P>
 And so Southern California life continues, swinging between two planes. Jews 
call this period shiva, mourning for the old in the midst of the new. In this 
period, we ponder how much we can control, how much we even matter. There's 
plenty of time now, on endless rides avoiding cracked freeways, to ponder 
eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, a basic premise about the way things work is up for grabs. Once I 
craved to live "in nature," amid the primeval bounties of hill and sea; but now 
it's mankind's works that I monitor and miss. The great eucalyptus grove by the 
roadside was planted; it did not just sprout. And the homes over there that are 
now rubble or cracked or otherwise red-tagged -- these are personal visions, 
testimony to what human creativity can bring. What I once thought of as 
"natural" needed human participation to come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Such appreciation is new to me. I was raised to judge harshly the human role 
on earth. My bias, received from elders like John Muir, grandfather of the 
ecology movement, is to leave alone as much of my habitat as possible. Nature 
creates. I can only mess up. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that's obviously reversed. Nature has messed up. And to restore order, 
we must begin to create. And so we come to our unfinished business. In the days 
since the fire and earthquake, acknowledging loss remains our community's 
unfinished business. But on both the personal and the civic level, it is not 
acceptable to grieve. True, fire and earthquake show us how negligible our 
lives are in the scheme of things, but we're doing our best to make them more 
negligible still. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is that we tell each other that the family heirlooms now reduced to 
glass splinters are "just things." That our condos and apartments were unsafe 
anyway and therefore unworthy. And that our freeways and shopping malls were 
unsightly examples of urban sprawl. An aura of embarrassment overtakes those 
who dare to assert that life was good, that for example, a day in the library 
or spent walking down Montana Avenue in Santa Monica represented if not true 
art, then at least a bit of harmony. Instead, the major message is that the 
works of our hands, that which we have added to the landscape, somehow violate 
the natural order. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, this question of where harmony lies and who and what shall 
rule reflects an American ambivalence about progress grounded in the late 19th 
Century. Our economic expansion has typically been justified by a literal 
interpretation of the Bible: Hasn't God given the Earth to men like Andrew 
Carnegie to rule over it? But in the same breath, with help from 
transcendentalists like Emerson and Thoreau, Genesis is reinterpreted as an 
ecological tract. By this theory, humans are intended to be low-impact 
gardeners, placed on Earth merely to "dress" and "keep it." That's why Muir, 
the gardener par excellence and friend of Emerson, fought so hard to keep 
Yosemite Valley and the national park system as pristine enclaves. And that's 
why we give ourselves so little comfort when our urban life is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a third interpretation of Genesis, kinder and more comforting, 
which can help us understand sadness with the loss of our "things." By this 
version, mankind is "co-creator" -- here to work the land and improve it, to 
complete what God purposely had left unfinished. It is this third definition 
that I think about today, in a world of broken glass. Most of us seek neither 
to dominate the world nor to leave it completely alone. And by now, we 
understand that whatever we build can be gone in a flash. But between these two 
poles -- between chaos and order -- there is creativity and even a stab at 
beauty. And the knowledge that living in nature is both work and art.

CLIPPERS FIZZLE IN SECOND HALF AS BULLS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers got an early start on the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 The All-Star break doesn't begin until Thursday, but the Clippers quit early 
and were embarrassed by the Chicago Bulls, 118-89, before 13,398 at the Sports 
Arena on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he felt after the game, a high-ranking Clipper executive responded: 
"Shellshocked." 
</P>
<P>
 He had every right to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by 58-54 at halftime, shot only 29.5% in the second 
half, making only 13 of 44 shots, and were outscored by 60-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Danny Manning, who had 22 points, including 18 in the first 
half, made only two of six shots in the second half. Guard Ron Harper, who had 
18 points, 13 in the first half, made only one of five shots in the second 
half. Guard Mark Jackson, who played only six minutes in the second half, 
missed both shots he attempted in the second half. Forward Harold Ellis, who 
played only 11 minutes, missed both of his second-half shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just completely went flat," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. "I thought we 
got some good shots early in the third quarter that didn't drop and they 
started running on us and shooting the ball great." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Michael Jordan has turned to baseball, forwards Scottie Pippen and 
Horace Grant have ensured that the Bulls' dynasty hasn't crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the Bulls' success without Jordan) is definitely the surprise of the 
league," Weiss said. "They're doing an absolutely fantastic job. The biggest 
difference I see is that when they ran their offense before, they ran it until 
Jordan got the ball. But now when they're running it, they're running with a 
lot of enthusiasm and they're trying to make things happen. They're doing a 
terrific job." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen had 22 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists as the Bulls (33-13) beat 
the Clippers (16-28) for the ninth time in a row. Chicago is 28-6 since Pippen 
returned after sitting out 10 games because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant had 22 points and eight rebounds and guard Steve Kerr had 14 points off 
the bench as Chicago won for the fifth time in its last six games. Guard B.J. 
Armstrong added 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper center Elmore Spencer, who had 16 points and six rebounds, was 
impressed after the Bulls shot 59% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just put on a shooting exhibition," Spencer said. "I don't think there 
was 20 defensive rebounds in the second half. They didn't miss a shot in the 
first three minutes of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their excellent outside shooting started demoralizing us. We began taking it 
out a little slower and started to talk amongst each other. They're just a 
great executing team, and they're very methodical. They wait for mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clippers made a lot of mistakes, committing 16 turnovers, seven in the 
second half, as their offense collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like everyone is going in different directions," said Clipper 
forward John Williams, who had eight points and five rebounds in his second 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we were more together. We helped each other out there on the court 
whether it was defensively or offensively, and that's something I don't 
recognize this year with this team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to have to make adjustments and get it together for the 
second half of the season. The intensity is up and down. Being where we are 
now, I don't think we're that good of a team where we can just turn it on like 
a light switch. We've got to come out and compete from the time the ball goes 
up, and we have to do that for 48 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 With his team trailing by four points at halftime, Weiss inserted Williams 
into the lineup for Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who skipped the first half of the season because he was in a weight 
reduction center, was assigned to check Grant, who made six of eight shots and 
scored 12 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Williams got into foul trouble and Grant scored 10 third-quarter 
points as the Bulls took an 89-72 lead into the fourth quarter. The Clippers 
shot only 30% in the third quarter, missing 14 of 20 shots as they were 
outscored by 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were having trouble inside with Scottie Pippen and Grant and both of them 
were size mismatches for us," Weiss said. "That worked (because) we contained 
those guys, but we couldn't score at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls outscored the Clippers by 12-4 at the start of the fourth quarter to 
put the game away. 
</P>

 Guard Ron Harper, who had been considered as a replacement for injured Phoenix 
Sun forward Charles Barkley in the All-Star game, said he plans to spend the 
All-Star break at his Cleveland area home. . . . The 35 points the Clippers 
scored in the second half were two shy of the team's least productive half. 
They scored only 33 points in a 98-77 loss at New York on Jan. 11.

LAKERS HAVE SUNS' NUMBER: NOW IT'S 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Sun rise, Sun set. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers watched the first part, when Phoenix ran out to 16-point leads in 
the second and third quarters, then forced the further decline of the defending 
Western Conference champions with a comeback that led to a 107-104 victory 
Tuesday night before 12,100 at the Forum and a 3-0 lead in the season series 
against the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 That comes after the Lakers took the heavily favored Suns to overtime on the 
road in the deciding Game 5 last spring in the first round of the playoffs. To 
the Lakers, that was as much a part of winning for the sixth time in the last 
10 games overall as the 48-29 rally the final 17 1/2 minutes or the 26 points 
and eight assists by Sedale Threatt off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just reflect back to last year's playoffs," Threatt said after scoring 13 
of his points in the fourth quarter. "We won the first two games and they came 
back to win the series. I think that was on their minds. I know it was on our 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team led by more than two points in the fourth quarter until James 
Worthy's jumper from the left side put the Lakers up, 101-97, with 2:50 
remaining, punctuated by Worthy jumping in the air in celebration. And when the 
Suns cut the deficit to 103-100 after Kevin Johnson sliced through the lane for 
a layup, Worthy answered again, this time hitting from the right side with 35.5 
seconds left for a five-point cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns called time out, but they didn't score again until 16.8 seconds to go 
to make it 106-102. Forced to foul, they sent George Lynch to the line, where 
he made one for a 107-102 advantage, which held up for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a team that kept both its starting guards on the bench the entire 
fourth quarter, the Suns wilted all the way to 7-9 without Charles Barkley. 
A.C. Green had a game-high 28 points for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade Divac had 19 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and seven blocked shots. 
Lynch added 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Already missing Barkley, their No. 1 scorer, and with Kevin Johnson, No. 2, in 
only his second game back after an extended absence, the Suns unexpectedly went 
without top three-point threat Dan Majerle. He was a late scratch because of 
flu-like symptoms that apparently originated during the team's bumpy flight 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns were missing some 42 points from the opening lineup -- not counting 
11 more with key reserve Danny Ainge still out -- but they didn't look the part 
in racing to a 60-49 lead at halftime after promoting Elliot Perry to starter. 
Much of the damage came from Mark West, who had 11 rebounds before 
intermission, six on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 That, along with Phoenix shooting 54.2%, was a major reason the Lakers fell 
behind by 16 points midway through the second quarter, 52-36. The Lakers' 
four-game home winning streak, their 2-0 advantage over the Suns in the season 
series -- all were heading for an early exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. The third quarter arrived, and so did the Lakers, all the way to 
a 79-79 tie with one minute left in the quarter thanks to a 20-4 charge, 
including 10-0 the last 2:43. That score held up until the end of the quarter, 
earning the Lakers a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There was more disappointing news for Doug Christie on Tuesday, when he 
dropped out of the NBA's slam dunk contest and the Lakers said he would not 
play Thursday against Sacramento. The new target for a return is Feb. 15 
against the Clippers at the Forum, the first game after the All-Star break, 
which would mean Christie will miss at least 14 games because of the sprained 
left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28 points in 25 minutes by Reggie Jordan in Sunday's victory over Utah 
made a big splash and might win him a contract for the rest of the season, but 
it doesn't necessarily earn him a permanent spot in the rotation. No matter 
what happens, though, it was a big moment for someone who didn't play 
basketball at the same Maywood, Ill., high school that produced Doc Rivers, had 
spent some 2 1/2 years in the CBA and a total of 11 minutes of NBA experience. 
"It is a real big change from the CBA," Jordan said. "This is where you want to 
be all your life, since I was a kid. Then it was like, 'I'm here, so I've got 
to fulfill my dream.' Now I want to keep it alive." Jordan had four points and 
nine rebounds in 24 minutes against the Suns.

Yellow Jackets (12-9, 3-7) in an Atlantic Coast Conference game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils used a 26-6 run over an eight-minute span to take a 46-38 lead

points and 10 rebounds, including six on the offensive end. Hill added 13 
points and Cherokee Parks 12.

 West Virginia 78, No. 8 Temple 71 -- Pervires Greene scored six of his 27 
points in overtime to lead the Mountaineers (14-5, 7-3) over the Owls (16-3, 
9-2) in an Atlantic 10 Conference game at Morgantown, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia, which ended Temple's 10-game losing streak, overcame a 13-point 
deficit in the final eight minutes of regulation.

NBA ROUNDUP; JEFF MALONE'S SHOT LIFTS JAZZ OVER NUGGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Malone's 18-foot shot from the corner with 12 seconds to play squelched a 
remarkable rally by the Denver Nuggets and gave the Utah Jazz a 96-95 victory 
Tuesday night at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz led in the final minute, 94-86, but Rodney Rogers made three 
three-point baskets in 8.8 seconds, giving the Nuggets a 95-94 lead with 20 
seconds remaining. Denver stole two inbounds passes by Karl Malone, leading to 
the second and third of Rogers' three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jeff Malone's basket, Rogers tried another shot, but it was blocked by 
Tyrone Corbin. LaPhonso Ellis got the rebound for Denver, but lost control and 
time ran out after a wild scramble under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone scored 24 points and John Stockton had 22 points and 12 assists 
for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 110, Washington 90 -- David Robinson had 31 points, 14 rebounds 
and 10 assists at San Antonio for his NBA-best fourth triple-double of the 
season, leading the Spurs to their eighth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Adams scored 25 points for the Bullets, who lost for the 18th time in 
23 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 108, Minnesota 105 -- Doug Smith scored five of his 20 points in 
overtime, including a key tip-in with 31 seconds to play, to lead the Mavericks 
at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks are 4-1 against the Timberwolves, but 1-41 against the rest of 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 106, Houston 98 -- Eric Murdock scored 28 points and led six Buck 
players in double figures at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee, with a record of only 14-33, played its best game of the season in 
winning for only the sixth time in 23 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 112, New Jersey 104 -- Mark Price scored 26 points and stifled a 
late Net threat by making four foul shots in the closing seconds at Richfield, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers' 11th victory in 15 games moved them two games over .500 for the 
first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 124, Sacramento 100 -- Clyde Drexler, who has made a career-low 40% 
of his shots this season, snapped out of a shooting slump with 21 points on 
nine-for-15 shooting in Portland's rout of Sacramento in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Williams' 15 rebounds put him over the 11,000-rebound plateau, making him 
one of only 16 NBA players to reach the milestone.

NHL ROUNDUP; ONLY 2,966 SEE ISLANDERS BEAT SABRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before only 2,966, the smallest home crowd in New York Islander history, the 
Islanders defeated the Buffalo Sabres, 3-1, at Uniondale, N.Y., on a snowy 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A blizzard in the New York area was responsible for the sparse turnout at 
Nassau Coliseum. Fans who showed up received free parking, a free program and a 
free ticket to a future game. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Flatley gave the Islanders a 2-1 lead at 1:49 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa 3, Philadelphia 3 -- Vladimir Ruzicka scored on a power play with 2:47 
to play in the third period at Ottawa, giving the Senators a tie that also 
ended the Flyers' team-record six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruzicka batted a pass from the slot behind goalie Dominic Roussel into the 
net. Ottawa stopped a four-game losing skid, but is winless in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 6, Quebec 1 -- Adam Oates scored three goals in the third period, with 
Cam Neely assisting on all three, at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1988-89 season, the Bruins have a 30-5-8 record against Quebec. 
Boston has won all four meetings between the clubs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates was benched for much of the second period by Bruin Coach Brian Sutter. 
He responded by boosting the Bruins to a 3-1 lead 22 seconds into the third 
period, firing a slapshot past goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 6, Detroit 3 -- Jimmy Carson scored twice and Cliff Ronning and 
Pavel Bure each had a goal and two assists for the Canucks at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson put the Canucks ahead, 4-3, with his second goal, at 1:53 of the third 
period. Goalie Tim Cheveldae stopped Trevor Linden's original shot, but was 
taken out of the play when teammate Dallas Drake ran into him. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 6, Winnipeg 5 -- Brett Hull had a goal and two assists as the Blues 
built a four-goal lead and then hung on at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets are in an 0-8-2 slump and haven't won since Jan. 12, falling out of 
playoff contention without injured star Teemu Selanne. They've given up 21 
goals in the last four games and 226 overall, more than every other NHL team 
except the Ottawa Senators. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 4, Chicago 3 -- Jamie Baker had a goal and an assist to help San Jose 
hold off Chicago in a sold-out, neutral-site game at Arco Arena in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Arturs Irbe made 35 saves for the Sharks. San Jose won despite taking 
only 23 shots.

GABRIEL RUELAS COMES BACK TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Awakened by being knocked down, Gabriel Ruelas eventually took control of what 
was supposed to be a meaningless undercard tune-up fight Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening's main event at the Reseda Country Club, highly-ranked 
heavyweight Lionel Butler scored a first-round technical knockout over Jerry 
Jones after opening a cut over Jones' left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most dramatic moment of the night was Ruelas, the World Boxing 
Council's No. 1-ranked junior-lightweight awaiting his second title shot, 
toppling in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 With his right hand dropped low, Ruelas was caught with a long left hook from 
journeyman Raul Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ruelas (37-2, 20 knockouts) soon was up and on his way to dominating the 
rest of the lightweight fight. 
</P>
<P>
 But not without a swollen face to remind him of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess what I learned was you can't be patient, you can't let the other guy 
get off," Ruelas said with a smile later. "I paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight was stopped at 1:17 of the seventh when Hernandez's corner threw in 
the towel with Hernandez (18-17-2) bleeding heavily from a cut over his right 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow first round, Ruelas slowly spun away from a Hernandez charge 
early in the second, dropped his right hand to throw an uppercut and was 
immediately caught flush in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas said it was the second knockdown of his career, and that he wasn't hurt 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how focused I was: First thing I thought about was how scared Joe and 
Dan must be," Ruelas said. "It was like, 'Ooooops, ' " Ruelas said. "But I 
wasn't hurt or anything. I was just lazy." 
</P>
<P>
 After fighting off Hernandez for the rest of the round, Ruelas got more 
aggressive in his counterpunching and began landing hard inside punches. Ruelas 
lost the first two rounds on the judges' cards, and, although his nose was 
bleeding lightly, won every round after that. Trainer Joe Goossen said he 
thought Ruelas, fighting six pounds over his usual fighting weight, approached 
this bout too much like a sparring session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gabe has a habit of doing that," Goossen said. "He stepped back and dropped 
his hands like nobody was going to do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the heavyweight bout, the 242-pound Butler, the WBC's No. 3 challenger, 
drove the taller, skinnier Jones into the corners and scored with short 
uppercuts and hooks to the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected more out of him," Butler said. "He's crafty and he's a good boxer. 
But once I found out he couldn't punch, I decided to just take him out." 
</P>
<P>
 The bout was halted by the attending physician after the first round. "After I 
felt his punches in the first round, I thought, 'Is this all he's got?' I felt 
sorry for him," said Butler, who is 21-10-1 with 16 KOs. Jones, who gave World 
Boxing Organization champion Michael Bentt the only loss of his career, fell to 
9-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I hurt him real bad with a left hook early, really early, and he fell 
out of his game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier fights, super-middleweight Rodney Toney (11-0-2, 5 KOs) knocked out 
Ken McCullough (4-4) at 1:43 of the second round, and P.J. Goossen (10-0, 9 
KOs) scored a technical knockout against Jerry Rosenberg (8-11-1) at the end of 
the first round.

MOLIERE GETS HOLLYWOOD TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor Moliere. Control freak that he reputedly was, he can't control his 
20th-Century translators. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor the translators who go that extra mile and adapt.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the old man has been lucky, at least in English. His 
17th-Century French farces and comedies have thrived in Richard Wilbur's 
brilliant, elastic, fluid verse translations. It's been said that Wilbur's 
versions amount to some of the finest playwriting in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But surely, slowly, like a nasty glacier, newer versions are pushing aside 
Moliere-Wilbur. A 1989 version by British playwright Neil Bartlett, written for 
the La Jolla Playhouse and Chicago's Goodman Theatre, also is starting to be 
embraced in colleges. Judging by the staging at Concordia University's Studio 
Theatre, it's not a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold, for the moment, any judgment of the student cast, under Peter Senkbeil's 
direction. The real issue is how Bartlett has taken over this masterpiece with 
a vengeance and has tried to mold it into a biting comedy about Hollywood and 
the last sincere man in town. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand how ludicrous it is to move "The Misanthrope" from the 
mid-17th-Century French court to '90s Hollywood, you have to know something 
about Moliere's hero, Alceste (played here by Brian C. Inouye). 
</P>
<P>
 In the play, he has two basic concerns: to finally win the love of the 
reluctant and self-obsessed Celimene (Kris Willson), and to state his case in a 
libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Moliere allows Alceste to declare himself in the first scene with his one true 
pal, Philinte (Chris Tornow): "I want to be a man; a man who always tries / To 
speak straight from the heart, where his true feeling lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Even given the number of real artists, from Welles to Faulkner, who tried 
Hollywood, a genuinely honest sort like Alceste -- that rare non-caricature in 
Moliere's theater -- wouldn't venture to The Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartlett betrays his British origins in more than one way, and the first is to 
think that the ideal contemporary American match for European monarchal society 
is movie-making society. A keener observer of America would know that the 
closer match lies 3,000 miles east, in the power circles of Washington politics 
or the New York art and theater worlds, where idealists are still drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The loudest clue to how wrong this transposition really is comes when Oronte 
(Dan Morton), forever currying favor, tries to impress Alceste with . . . a 
sonnet. 
</P>
<P>
 This is very funny in the original, but jarringly out of place in Bartlett's 
world. (The only thing that makes it funny here is Morton's drippingly arch 
reading, the show's best comic turn.) 
</P>
<P>
 More troublesome, though, is Bartlett's ham-fisted melding of 17th- and 
20th-Century idioms -- a trick that works much better in Tim Mueller's 
post-modern set design, humorously mixing faux-Roman columns and statuary with 
the high-tech industrial look. 
</P>
<P>
 We know we're in trouble when one of the first statements from Alceste is 
"It's not my party; but I'll cry if I want to." Elsewhere, word choices are 
uncomfortably stuck halfway across the Atlantic and time periods: "My taste's 
catholic." " . . . the fruits of moral laxity." "She's absolutely beige." "We 
discussed, at lunch, as these days one tends to / Popular morality." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Bartlett tries to be British and Californian in the same breath, as 
when Alceste asks Oronte "Being so rich, how dare you pretend / You have no 
extra 'bucks' at all to spend?" 
</P>
<P>
 The words just hang in mid-air, a contorted version of what was originally 
both fleecy and fiery writing that few if any actors could possibly contend 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, a very, very tough college assignment. Still, even allowing 
for the impossibly uphill mountain they have to climb, this young cast isn't 
ready to speak classical theater in public. (A better bet would have been to 
assign this as a class workshop.)  
</P>

 Except for Morton, the students sound unprepared both for Bartlett's pointless 
experiment and Moliere's verse and social satire. They are simply undertrained 
for Moliere's vocal demands, which call for a skillful balance of natural and 
singing delivery. It's no secret why good Moliere on stage is so rare. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Senkbeil's and his students' attempts are more encouraging 
than another safe reading of a safe play. College is where you learn to fall 
and pick yourself up. The bigger the fall -- like this one -- the more you 
learn. * "The Misanthrope," Concordia University Studio Theatre, 1530 Concordia

 There goes our Pulitzer: We revealed the other day that although Mayor Riordan 
had pledged to draw an annual salary of $1, records show he makes 4 cents per 
pay period, or $1.04 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought this undisclosed 4% pay raise qualified as one of the scoops of the 
year until Roger Davidson of L.A. pointed out that Riordan's entire salary was 
gobbled up by the federal government (see illustration). 
</P>
<P>
 "The IRS has finally achieved its goal of a 100% tax rate," Davidson 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Kelton of Paramount speculated that Riordan's tax contributions might 
have persuaded President Clinton to award $8.6 billion in quake relief to this 
area. Suddenly, we sympathize with Riordan -- especially because his paycheck 
seems to indicate he has an unforeseen problem:  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't he in arrears on his state income taxes?

 Postcards from the edge of the century: One of the period postcards embedded

 Of wintertime L.A., Darnell says simply:

 "Ocean bathing . . . no ice . . . no overcoats . . . spring suits on the

 Solved mysteries: No one had to ask Kennedy High teacher Sondra Levi Zeldin 
why the clock at the Granada Hills school stopped at just after 4:30 a.m. on 
Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zeldin says she has been "deluged with queries from my family and friends" 
who have seen photographs of the clock in the newspapers and wonder why it has 
only two numbers on the face (see photo). 
</P>
<P>
 OK, here's why. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two decades ago, Zeldin explained, she was the sponsor of a graduating 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principal, Bill Albers, wanted a clock in the quadrangle/lunch area," she 
said. "As the class gift to the school, we paid for the clock and the only 
numbers on the face are 6 and 7 -- for the Centurion class of '76."

 No one had a cow: We feared there might have been an aftershock in the 
household of Jay Olins, caused by the prize we awarded him in our latest 
contest -- a Frederick's of Hollywood calendar. A pictorial calendar.

<P>
 Olins, you might recall, had come closest to guessing the meaning of a license 
plate that said 10 COWS (it's a reference to a husband's measure of his wife's 
worth in an old folk tale.) After dispatching the lingerie-filled daybook, we 
were informed by a reader that Olins is not only married but that his wife is a 
rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 We checked with Olins to see if we had done any damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, my wife, Sally, is indeed a rabbi -- one of less than a dozen 
Conservative female rabbis," he said. "Fortunately, Sally is a 20-cow spouse. 
She is very understanding and allowed me to give my prize to an associate at my 
office." miscelLAny:

COLUMN LEFT/ RUTH ROSEN: MACKINNON DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ME; THE LEGAL SCHOLAR IS 
WRONG TO MAKE PORNOGRAPHY, NOT POVERTY, THE MOST URGENT FEMINIST ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen, a professor of history at UC Davis, is the author of 
The Lost Sisterhood: Prostitution in America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poverty, not pornography, is the most pressing feminist issue of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 But try telling that to Catharine MacKinnon, the charismatic legal scholar who 
has been waging a passionate campaign against pornography. MacKinnon is a 
superstar on the college lecture circuit, and her fans have played a decisive 
role in derailing the feminist movement from addressing women's most urgent 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is hardly new. Feminists have clashed over pornography since 
the 1970s. Some have closed their eyes and held their noses, committed to the 
principle of free speech. Others, like MacKinnon, have argued that since 
pornography causes sexual violence against women -- an unproved premise hotly 
contested by social scientists -- it should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 In her new book, "Only Words," Mac-Kinnon goes further, arguing that 
pornography is not merely speech but a hostile act that must be banned as a 
violation of women's civil rights. For MacKinnon, words are the same as acts; 
like sticks and stones, they break your bones. Her argument is seductively 
clever: If pornography is a hostile act, then protecting women from violence is 
more important than defending smut as "free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 MacKinnon's claim that sexual violence is a violation of women's civil rights 
is right on target; rape is a terrorist act that reinforces women's inequality. 
But sexual violence and pornography are not the same thing. And what if 
pornography is -- as many contend -- a symptom but not a cause of American 
society's misogynist depiction and treatment of women? Then MacKinnon's effort 
to pit free speech against women's equality creates a bogus choice. Chipping 
away at the First Amendment is rarely a good idea, and especially dangerous for 
groups committed to radical social change. Censorship, as history teaches, is 
more likely to be used to silence leftists and feminists than pornographers. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation in Canada is a case in point. In 1992, MacKinnon's analysis 
influenced the Canadian Supreme Court to permit censorship of pornography when 
it portrays "women as a class as objects for sexual exploitation." Not 
surprisingly, Canadian censors first targeted gay and lesbian bookstores. 
Uninformed and confused customs officials have seized books written by Oscar 
Wilde, Audre Lorde, Marguerite Duras and Jean Genet.  
</P>
<P>
 Poverty, not pornography, is what steals women's dreams and starves their 
spirits. The much publicized glass ceiling is not what afflicts most American 
women; it is the sticky floor that keeps so many women glued to poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. How many women would identify pornography as the source of 
their misery? Ask a single mother raising her children on minimum wage if 
pornography is her greatest problem. Ask a battered wife if pornography is what 
she most fears. Visit an illegal sweatshop and ask immigrant women if 
pornography is the cause of their degraded existence. Ask a mother who tries to 
shield her children from stray bullets if pornography is her worst nightmare. 
Go to a poor neighborhood polluted by toxic waste and ask the mothers if 
pornography is what most threatens the health of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, instead, what does affect women's daily lives: poverty and the fear 
of domestic and sexual violence. Without economic equality, women can't leave 
violent husbands. Without accessible, quality child care, women can't work -- 
or get off welfare. Without an adequate minimum wage, women can't feed their 
families. Without paid family leave, many working mothers must choose between 
survival or neglect of their babies. Without a ban against guns and assault 
weapons, women fear for their children's safety. Without a drastic change in 
the social contract, women can't walk the streets or relax at home without 
fearing violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Cold War's end, we have the political opportunity to form a 
feminist economic agenda that crosses class and race lines. Pornography is not 
the worst obscenity. Yes, it reinforces degraded views of women, but real 
obscenity is a hungry child, a teen-ager without hope, a homeless family, a 
battered wife or the permanently unemployed victims of capital flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest indecency in America is not pornography but poverty in the midst 
of plenty.

EARNINGS; RECORD PROFIT LIFTS SEARS FROM ITS WORST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. announced Tuesday that it vaulted from its worst year 
ever in 1992 to a record profit of $2.37 billion in 1993, a year in which the 
resurging retailer dropped its famous catalogue, closed stores and cut jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, equal to $6.13 per share, contrast with a loss of $3.93 billion, 
or $10.72 per share, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Sears eliminated its unprofitable "Big Book" catalogue, closed 113 
stores, cut 50,000 jobs, completed the divestiture of the Dean Witter brokerage 
and Coldwell Banker real estate businesses and revived its retail operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, Sears had net income of $544.6 million, or $1.39 per 
share, contrasted with a net loss of $1.8 billion, or $4.84 per share, in the 
fourth quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-quarter 1992 results included a $1.7-billion restructuring charge, 
a $1.9-billion charge related to a change in accounting for retiree benefits 
and a $206.7-million charge to write down the value of commercial real estate 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the fourth quarter rose 8.1% to $14.7 billion, from $13.6 billion, 
Chicago-based Sears said. Revenue for the full year, excluding the discontinued 
retailing businesses, rose 6.5% to $50.8 billion, from $47.7 billion, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 earnings include a gain of $635.1 million in the second quarter from 
the initial public offering of 19.9% of the Allstate Corp. insurance company 
and a $76.1-million favorable income tax adjustment recorded in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding these items, 1993 income from continuing operations was $1.7 
billion, or $4.36 per share.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: TIPS TO HELP MAKE YOUR TRIP A SAFE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Safe traveling is something most people consider when they go on vacation; 
they know that tourists can be easy prey for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Business travelers are just as likely to be victimized on the road, yet 
because business people tend to think of their travel as an extension of their 
work, they often consider it no more hazardous than going to the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever you travel, you are out of your habitual environment and your 
familiar safety zones, said Bill Longacre, crime prevention specialist with the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some suggestions from Longacre and from Terry Riley, a psychologist 
and founder of Applied Psychology, a Santa Cruz-based company that specializes 
in safety advice for business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, we looked at safety when renting cars and staying in hotels. This 
week, we look at walking, taking cabs and what to do if you are attacked. When 
Walking 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 safeguard for preventing attacks is to maintain an aura of 
self-assuredness and awareness," Longacre said. If you look confident that you 
know where you're going, a would-be assailant will tend to pick someone who is 
more distracted or confused. "They always go for the unaware and the 
unprepared," he said. The more aware you look, the less attractive you are as a 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 It pays, then, to become familiar with your surroundings. If you can, study a 
map ahead of time, or call ahead to get directions to where you're going. Know 
the major landmarks and a secure area, such as a busy business district or a 
police or fire station, Longacre said. It's a place you can head toward if you 
sense you are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're walking, go against traffic so someone can't drive up behind you 
and grab your briefcase or purse. If you are walking with traffic and someone 
suspicious appears to be approaching you from behind, turn around quickly and 
walk the other way and cross the street. In most cases, the car will not be 
able to change direction quickly enough to catch up with you.  
</P>
<P>
 Try to stay more than an arm's length from strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, wear comfortable shoes and don't carry a lot of packages that 
could impede your getting away.  
</P>
<P>
 As you walk, make eye contact with people as a precaution. Making eye contact 
signals anyone with the wrong idea that you would be able to identify him or 
her, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need to make a phone call, don't use phone booths or kiosks on the 
street, where someone could grab your bag or wallet and run. Go to a store or 
restaurant instead. 
</P>
<P>
 To further minimize the chance of someone taking your bag, hold it firmly and 
act like you know it's there. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, don't push a shoulder bag around behind your hip just because 
it's more comfortable. And make sure that if you are using a strap, it's over 
only your shoulder, not looped over your neck or around your wrist. You want 
the option to let go, Longacre said. Otherwise you could be dragged behind a 
moving car and lose your life instead of just your wallet. Using Taxis 
</P>
<P>
 Never get into an an unmarked or unlicensed taxi. Licensed cabs will have 
their public utility license number painted on the side of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 You can be fairly sure you're getting a legitimate cab if you choose one from 
a taxi line. If there's not a cab stand nearby, call a well-known company for 
your ride rather than just flagging one down, Longacre said. 
</P>
<P>
 And never get into a cab if there's anyone other than the driver in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, check before you get in that the windows work or that the car doors can 
be unlocked from the inside, Riley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Once you're in, tell the cabdriver where you want to go and how to get there. 
This signals that you aren't giving up control to the driver, Riley said, and 
puts the cabby on notice that you will be suspicious if the route doesn't look 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 When you get in, note the driver's name and identification number posted in 
the cab. Say something like, "Oh, No. 43287 -- what a coincidence, that's the 
same as my friend's phone number." This signals the driver that you could 
identify him or her if anything were to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, if you're uncomfortable at any time, get out and immediately 
call the cab company to report what happened. If You Are Attacked 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there is no single right way to deal with an attack, Longacre 
said. The best precaution you can take is to think through ahead of time what 
you would do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go over in your mind what you are capable of doing," Longacre said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've made a decision, then follow through," he said. If, for example, 
you've decided you can fight back enough to create a diversion to get away, 
then be mentally prepared to do it and don't hesitate.  
</P>
<P>
 The split second you hesitate could cost you your opportunity to get away, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the crime is inevitable, do what you can to be a good witness. Make note of 
physical details, but don't stare the person down in a confrontational way that 
might incite him or her to further violence. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone is attempting to kidnap you, do everything in your power not to go, 
Longacre said. "Because once you are in the suspect's car, he has full control. 
You've lost all your options."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; ANOTHER BIG HARASSMENT SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cypress has become the latest Orange County city to pay tens of thousands of 
dollars to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit by a female police officer. The 
case, which continues a disturbing trend, should put all police departments on 
notice that they must increase efforts to prevent the incidents that lead to 
such suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress will pay $60,000 to Sgt. Sandra D. Stanton, the city's first female 
sergeant, who agreed to resign from the force. The city will not contest her 
medical disability claims, so she will receive half of her $58,000 annual 
salary for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials contended that Cypress was settling only because continuing the 
lawsuit would be too expensive. Given lawyers' fees and the uncertainty of jury 
verdicts, that may be true. The city continues to deny it did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant, on leave since May, 1992, said in her lawsuit that her 
ex-husband -- who was both a police lieutenant and her supervisor -- and other 
officers taunted her with a photo of a scantily clad model. She said her 
uniform pockets were stapled shut and glass shards were dumped in her desk. All 
of those accused denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the police chief told the mayor several years ago that someone had 
tampered with Stanton's personal property and that he had warned every sergeant 
in the department against such behavior. So there was reason to believe that 
someone had singled out Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress settlement comes a month after Newport Beach paid $175,000 to two 
of 10 women employees of the Police Department who filed harassment lawsuits 
against that city, a former police chief and a former police captain. Similar 
lawsuits are pending in Irvine and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Garden Grove paid a $180,000 settlement to a fired reserve police 
officer who said she was dismissed because she ended a romantic relationship 
with the then-police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 Buena Park lost two sexual-harassment lawsuits and paid out more than 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities in Orange County instituted policies barring sexual harassment in 
the 1980s. They must do a better job of implementing these policies and holding 
the departments' top brass responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Community residents expect police officers to show respect and sensitivity. To 
ensure a public perception of fairness in dealing with our diverse society, 
police departments must accept a diverse work force inside the station house as 
well.

 * Isn't it ironic that a mouse is holding up a major resort in Dana Point 
(Feb. 2), seeing as it was a mouse that put Orange County on the map in the

IMPRISONING ADDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * (President) Clinton's "three strikes you're out" policy will be another 
straw that will help to eventually break the camel's back, which is the prison 
system. The system is already underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it true that it costs around $40,000 per year to keep a man in prison? 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is to keep them out of prison! 
</P>
<P>
 A huge percentage of violent crime is caused by gangs protecting their sales 
territory for illegl drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Addicts also have to steal to pay the high prices caused by the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 If we eliminate that black market, the crime will stop. 
</P>
<P>
 This is about freedom. If somebody wants to to kill themselves with drugs, 
they should be free to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge (James) Gray and many others are in agreement on this point. Educated 
people are pro-legalization, not the typical pot-smoking drug addict. 
</P>
<P>
 We need solutions, not dead-end prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 It was refreshing to see your editorial a while ago. An open mind and a basic 
view of the facts will show the folly of maintaining a hugely profitable black 
market.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL; RANCHO ALAMITOS' GUARANTEE LOOKS GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Janet Neuman saw the quote by her coach, Pete Pyle, in the newspaper last 
week, she had reservations about his guarantee that Rancho Alamitos would win 
the Garden Grove League title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little scared at first," Neuman said. "I thought it would look bad if 
we didn't win; it put more pressure on us, but he told us that he said it and 
it motivated us more." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos, in danger of losing its first league title since 1990, 
grabbed a share of first place by defeating 10th-ranked La Quinta, 69-51, 
Tuesday at La Quinta. Rancho Alamitos (18-6, 12-1) finishes the season Thursday 
against fifth-place Santiago; La Quinta (18-5, 12-1), league champion from 
1982-90, plays at third-place Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuman, who has made 20 three-point shots this season, was five for five from 
behind the arc -- and added three free throws after she was fouled attempting 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuman's 18 points were only part of the mix as Rancho Alamitos avenged a 
64-60 loss three weeks ago. Akilah Rodgers scored 28 points and had 16 
rebounds. Sally Vasquez added 12 points, including eight in the second quarter, 
when Rancho Alamitos overcame a 10-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main difference, Pyle said, was the defensive presence of Michelle 
Frank, who missed the first meeting because of a sprained ankle. La Quinta's 
Linda Rodriguez scored 33 points in the previous game, but had 24 Tuesday, 
including four three-pointers; her 10 first-quarter points helped the Aztecs 
take an 18-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos' defense also limited Rhonda Gondringer to 15 points, 10 fewer 
than in the previous meeting of the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos, which had made 32% of its three-pointers before the game, 
made nine of 16, including seven in the second half, after holding a 28-27 
lead. The Vaqueros opened the third quarter with an 11-1 run -- two 
three-pointers by Neuman, a three-pointer and a follow by Rodgers. The best La 
Quinta could do was pull to 49-45 with 6 minutes 16 seconds left, but three of 
the Vaqueros' next five baskets were three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That La Quinta loss was the best thing that happened to us," Pyle said. 
"Except for the game against Pacifica, when we were a little flat, we haven't 
had a better five games." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Garden Grove League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove 57, Los Amigos 25 -- Michol Murray scored 27 points, Gina Huizar 
added nine and Amanda Hall eight to lead visiting Garden Grove (10-12, 8-5). 
Carmela Zavala scored eight points for Los Amigos (1-21, 1-12). 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy 53, Bolsa Grande 20 -- Heather Cunningham had 14 points and 11 
rebounds, and Erryn Gutjahr added 12 points and 10 rebounds for host Kennedy 
(16-9, 9-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica 33, Santiago 32 -- Holly Pawlowski's two free throws with 10 seconds 
left gave visiting Pacifica (8-14, 4-9) its first lead. Pawlowski led the 
Mariners with 11 points. Jennifer Morris had 14 points for Santiago (7-16, 
4-9).

VILLAGE CHRISTIAN CLINCHES ALPHA TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time Alpha League rivals Village Christian and L.A. Baptist highs 
met, the Crusaders cruised to a 19-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team was cruising Tuesday night, however, in a league rematch at 
Canyon High. But although L.A. Baptist dominated inside and maintained the lead 
for the better part of the game, the result was the same: a Village Christian 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Spielman's free throw with 14 seconds remaining proved to be the 
difference and lifted Village Christian to a 44-43 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Village Christian (15-8), the defending league champion, 
clinched the championship outright with one game remaining, improving to 6-1 in 
league play. L.A. Baptist (14-7, 4-3) is still in contention for a playoff 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist had a chance to win in the final seconds after Spielman's free 
throw, but Jeff Baumsteiger's 30-foot shot from beyond the top of the key 
missed everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like we could have gotten a better shot there at the end," L.A. 
Baptist Coach Maury Neville said. "We wanted to try to get it in to one of the 
big kids, but Jeff said he couldn't see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Those big kids, as Neville calls them, kept the Knights in the driver's seat 
nearly the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of Kevin Aust (10 rebounds) and Nathan Wendt (eight rebounds), 
the Knights dominated inside, outrebounding Village Christian 33-19. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Knights couldn't slow Village Christian's David Gustafson (15 points) 
and Chad Hanson (13 points), who took control in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied 12 times, including four occasions in the fourth quarter. 
Baumsteiger tied it, 43-43, on a pair of free throws with 1:32 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders spread the court and Gustafson and Hanson took turns driving 
until they found a weakness in the Knights' man-to-man defense. Hanson passed 
to Spielman, who was fouled by Aust with 14 seconds to play.

 Texaco, Other Oil Companies Sign Tarim Basin Pact: In the second such 
contract, a consortium led by Agip, Italy's state-owned oil company, signed the 
agreement in Beijing to bring outside oil companies' investment and technology 
to explore the remote basin on China's western border with Russia and 
Kazakhstan. Other companies include Elf Hydrocarbures Chine of France, Japan 
Petroleum Exploration Co., Japan Energy Co. and Texaco China, part of Texaco 
Inc. William Doyle, president of Texaco Middle East/Far East, described as good 
the chances of making a commercially viable discovery in the area, which by 
some estimates could rival in size the North Sea oil discoveries. In December, 
Exxon Corp. and Japan-Indonesia Petroleum Corp. signed a contract to explore 
one of the other potential fields in the Tarim Basin.

STOCKS MIXED AS LONG-TERM YIELD CLIMBS

 Market Overview * Stocks ended mixed in quiet trading Tuesday as investors 
worried about rising interest rates and tried to find their footing following 
last week's sharp drop in share prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bond yields rose sharply, pushing prices lower as traders 
expressed anxiety about the outcome of several major auctions and the trend for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold staged a partial recovery. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks traded in a narrow range, moving between positive and negative 
territories with little firm direction. However, smaller capitalization stocks 
moved sharply higher, led by technology issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average fell 0.29 to 3,906.03. But in the broader market, rising 
issues outnumbered declines by about 11 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume totaled 318.18 million shares, down from Monday's 348.27 
million. The winter storm in the Northeast slowed volume in the afternoon as 
some traders left early to escape the snow, said Eugene Peroni, director of 
technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were still uncertain after Friday's 96-point drop in blue chip 
stocks followed by Monday's almost 35-point jump in the Dow average, said David 
Holt, director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a day of gentle sparring between buyers and sellers," one analyst said. 
"A lot of people are still trying to make up their minds what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The rising bond rates were were seen as a negative for stocks because it 
raises the cost of borrowing for companies and makes share prices less 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stocks most sensitive to the economic cycles were again among the 
winners, with autos, papers, chemical and heavy machinery issues performing 
well. As the economy has shown signs of improving, those stocks have won favor. 
</P>
<P>
 But technology shares stole the show. Most are traded on the Nasdaq index, 
which didn't recover from last week's drop as much as blue chips on Monday. The 
Nasdaq composite index rose 3.50 to 782.70, moving steadily higher all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel helped buoy the index, rising 1 1/2 to 63 1/2. Semiconductor stocks 
generally were higher ahead of the industry's January so-called book-to-bill 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft, however, didn't fare so well, falling 2 to 78 3/4. A Soundview 
Financial Group analyst lowered his rating on the stock Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among cyclicals, GM rose 1 3/4 to 64 3/4, and Alcoa advanced 1 1/4 to 79 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * But the gains in economically sensitive stocks were offset by losses in 
Sears, which was off 3 1/4 to 47 3/4 on disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco shares fell after the Canadian government hiked corporate taxes for 
tobacco manufacturers. Philip Morris dropped 1 1/8 to 58 3/4, and RJR Nabisco 
ended off 1/8 to 7 1/4 although analysts said the tax change would have little 
impact on U.S.-based multinationals. 
</P>
<P>
 AlliedSignal jumped 1 1/2 to 77 3/8 after reporting strong fourth-quarter 
earnings, declaring a two-for-one stock split and raising its quarterly 
dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pfizer fell 2 1/4 to 59 3/8 after the company told analysts it was 
comfortable with the low side of their 1994 earnings forecasts but that sales 
growth in the first quarter would not match full-year growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks abroad recovered from the previous day's sharp losses. Tokyo's Nikkei 
average ended 236.83 points higher at 20,251.23, and Frankfurt's 30-share DAX 
average closed 27.81 points up at 2,107.21. In London, the Financial Times 
100-share average closed up at 3,467.5, up 48.4 point. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Treasury yields were higher most of the session, but surged late in the 
session. Analysts didn't cite any specific factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The key 30-year bond yield soared to 6.45% from 6.39% the day before, pushing 
prices down 25/32 point, or $7.81 per $1,000 in face value, at closing. Prices 
and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's auction of $17.11 billion of three-year notes, the first batch 
of $40 billion in new securities this week that make up the quarterly refunding 
of government debt, met analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the three-year auction, the Treasury scheduled auctions of $12 
billion in 10-year notes Wednesday and $11 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is still trying to price itself at a comfortable level ahead of 
the 10- and 30-year" auctions, said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at 
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 A closely watched retail sales report, the Johnson-Redbook Service survey of 
early February sales, showed a 0.5% gain from levels in January. But Samuel 
Kahan, economist at Fuji Securities Inc., said that the figures were sluggish 
compared to last year's level and may have helped support bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts detected lingering uncertainty after the Federal Reserve boosted the 
federal funds rate last week by 0.25 percentage point to 3.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
3.125%, down from 3.313% late Monday. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices rose as some investors shook off fears that higher interest rates 
would hurt demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices rose in New York after dropping in Europe. On the New York Comex, 
gold for current delivery closed at $382.30 an ounce, up $3.40 from Monday. 
Silver for current delivery closed at $5.261, up 3.1 cents from Monday. On 
Monday, gold dropped $7.70 and silver plunged 18.7 cents in a delayed reaction 
to the Federal Reserve's decision Friday to raise short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates tend to alleviate inflation pressures and can reduce the 
incentive to own precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar rose against most major currencies on Tuesday after 
Britain cut interest rates and investors sold pounds in favor of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 March crude oil deliveries ended 4 cents lower at $15.21 a barrel on the New 
York Merc after erasing strong gains posted early in the session on talk of 
cuts in OPEC and Russian production.

 BellSouth Contemplates Bigger Role in Paramount Bid: Although the final bids 
have been submitted for Paramount Communications Inc., QVC Network Inc.'s 
backers are continuing to explore ways they might prop up the value of QVC's 
offer, a source confirmed.Short-term holders of Paramount stock are favoring 
rival Viacom Inc. because QVC refused to offer any protection against a 
downward spiral in the value of its shares in its cash-and-stock tender offer. 
Traders have been speculating that BellSouth Corp., which has already pledged 
$2 billion in support of the QVC bid, might promise to buy a specific amount of 
QVC shares within several months. "It is being explored," one knowledgeable 
source said.

 NO ESCAPE: Driving down Reseda Boulevard or Devonshire Street used to be a 
nice change from crowded freeways. That was before the quake. . . . Now, 
because of freeway damage, traffic is way up on both streets. 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEW CANNES: Cancel that flight to France and the week of schmoozing with 
Hollywood's elite. Who needs Cannes when you've got Santa Clarita? . . . That's 
right, the Santa Clarita Valley International Film Festival makes its debut in 
March, screening mostly family-oriented films (F4). . . . Despite road damage, 
organizers are optimistic that the festival will be a success. 
</P>
<P>
 YOU MAKE THE CALL: So what if the Menendez brothers' trials in Van Nuys ended 
without a verdict? Television doesn't care. . . . Last week, production began 
on a Fox TV movie about the case. Starring James Farentino and Jill Clayburgh, 
it will conclude the story just before the juries begin deliberations. "The 
facts are already present," a Fox spokeswoman said. "We'll allow the audience 
to be the judge." 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE AID: Hollywood has raised money to help disaster victims around the 
world, so it's only natural that the stars do something for their own. On Feb. 
26, Paramount Studios will hold a night of cabaret to raise funds for 
quake-damaged businesses along Ventura Boulevard. . . . Among the performers: 
Stephanie Zimbalist, Gregory Harrison and Stefanie Powers. 
</P>
<P>
 VALLEY BOY: San Fernando High has launched the careers of some great sports 
figures, including Anthony Davis and Charles White. And now one of its alumni 
has made the Basketball Hall of Fame. . . . That would be Louisville Coach 
Denny Crum, a 1955 San Fernando grad who later coached Pierce College (C8). "He 
played it, slept it and studied basketball all the time," recalled Pete Nelson, 
a coach at Kennedy High in Granada Hills who attended UCLA with Crum. Heavy

 BETTER SKIES: If you wonder how heavy Monday night's storm got, Santa Ana 
Mayor Daniel H. Young says it was the first time you could hear from inside the 
council chambers the rain hitting against City Hall. And with good timing: The 
council was adopting updated flood plain maps. . . . But you can spend the rest 
of the week drying out. Today should bring lots of sunshine, with the winds 
calming and temperatures climbing into the upper 60s. Thursday will bring back 
more clouds, but no rain, with temperatures even reaching the low 70s. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTCALLS ONLY: State officials have been critical of recruiters at Trends 
2000, a business expo in Anaheim this week, who hoped to lure California 
businesses into relocating in their states. Some considered the timing 
insensitive, in light of last month's Northridge earthquake. New Mexico has 
responded: It's ceasing all recruitment calls here. . . . But its recruiters 
will take calls. And since the quake, they say, weekly inquiries from 
California have almost doubled.

 TWO BY TWO? Steven Spielberg's Holocaust movie "Schindler's List" is expected 
to lead the pack when the Oscar nominations are announced today. But it was 
almost "Schindler's Ark." . . . . Thomas Keneally, the UC Irvine writing 
teacher who wrote the 1982 book the movie is based on, wanted to call it 
"Schindler's Ark," but his U.S. publishers talked him out of it. . . . "They 
said it implied Noah's Ark," he says. Actually, he had in mind the biblical Ark 
of the Covenant. Keneally got his way outside the U.S. The British version, 
selling worldwide, is entitled "Schindler's Ark." 
</P>
<P>
 PRIORITIES: Taking a break from a grueling murder case, Superior Court Judge 
Francisco P. Briseno Tuesday invited eighth graders from Huntington Beach's 
Talbert Middle School into his lawbook-lined chambers. He encouraged the youths 
to aspire to careers as bailiffs, stenographers and even lawyers or judges. . . 
. So what were their first questions? "Have you read all those books?" "Was 
that a real jail cell?" "Can we visit the morgue?"

<P>
 The Greek Justice Ministry refused Tuesday to pardon four aging leaders of the 
military junta that ruled the country in the late '60s and early '70s and said 
they must remain in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Ministry committee turned down requests by Stylianos Pattakos, 
George Zoitakis, Nikolaos Makarezos and Ioannis Ladas to be pardoned because of 
their failing health. 
</P>
<P>
 The four, serving life sentences, were among the leaders of a 1967 military 
coup and were senior ministers in the dictatorship that ruled Greece until 
1974.

RICHARD M. BISSELL JR.; PRINCIPAL PLANNER OF BAY OF PIGS INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard M. Bissell Jr., a former deputy CIA director and principal architect 
of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Kennedy Administration's failed attempt to 
topple Cuban leader Fidel Castro, has died. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Monday of heart failure, said his associate, Frances T. Pudlo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bissell had been on track to succeed CIA Director Allen Dulles, but after the 
Bay of Pigs debacle in 1961, President John F. Kennedy told both they would 
have to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed invasion overshadowed Bissell's other achievements at the CIA, 
where he guided the clandestine program to build the U-2 reconnaissance plane 
and its supersonic successor, the SR-71, as well as the first orbiting spy 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Bissell supervised the delivery of supplies to Allied troops around the world 
during World War II, then helped administer the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe 
after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 An economist, Bissell left the Commerce Department for the CIA in 1954, 
becoming special assistant to the director and later heading the covert 
operations program. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced out in 1962, he later formed a management consulting firm in 
Farmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Bissell took responsibility when the band of CIA-trained exiles sent to invade 
Cuba were quickly vanquished by Castro's forces. 
</P>
<P>
 A CIA review of the raid faulted Bissell, but an agency historian, Jack 
Pfeiffer, said years later the review had "deliberately distorted" the issue of 
Bissell's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy awarded Bissell the National Security Medal on the first anniversary 
of the invasion, "for a most distinguished contribution to the security of the 
United States."

WITOLD LUTOSLAWSKI; POLISH COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Witold Lutoslawski, an internationally recognized Grammy-winning classical 
composer who led the development of contemporary music in Eastern Europe after 
World War II, has died in his native Warsaw. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski, who died Monday, had been ill for some time. His last public 
appearance was in September at the Warsaw Autumn Festival of contemporary 
music, which he helped found in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man who created the great part of Polish 20th-Century music has gone," 
fellow Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki said. "He taught us Polish music 
and introduced it to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles Philharmonic planned an innovative concert of Lutoslawski 
pieces conducted by the composer in 1983, Times music critic Martin Bernheimer 
hailed Lutoslawski as "a Pole apart, a dauntless innovator, a probing musical 
philosopher and, even at (his) age, a forward-looking man of his time." 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret of Lutoslawski's enduring, and endearing, success," Bernheimer 
said, "may lie in his uncanny ability to use unabashedly progressive techniques 
to achieve unabashedly conservative ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski was last in Los Angeles a year ago to conduct the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic in the premiere of his Fourth Symphony, which the orchestra had 
commissioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was a modernist known for taking classical sound in new 
directions, Lutoslawski remained committed to the orchestra, as opposed to 
electronic substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love traditional instruments, though of course they are anachronisms," he 
told The Times last February. "Satellites run around our planet, but we still 
play bassoons. It's ridiculous. But a lot of discovery is still left in the 
symphony orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fourth Symphony, the last in Lutoslawski's small but superb output, won 
him Britain's Classical Music Award last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski's Third Symphony received a Grammy Award for the best contemporary 
composition in 1986, and won the first University of Louisville Grawemeyer 
Award for music composition in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski taught widely in Europe and the United States, ranging from 
Copenhagen Conservatory to Dartmouth College to Tanglewood to USC, where he was 
conductor in residence in 1985. He helped inaugurate USC's Polish Music 
Reference Center and donated the manuscripts of his compositions "Novelette," 
"Mi Parti," "Preludes and Fugue," "Mini-Overture" and "Paroles Tissees." 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski studied piano and violin as a child and studied mathematics at the 
University of Warsaw before turning to the study of music theory and 
composition at the Warsaw Conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
 He served in the Polish Army and was taken prisoner of war by the invading 
Nazis. Escaping to Warsaw, he spent most of the war playing piano in cafes. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the German occupation of Poland in World War II, from 1939 to 1945, 
all musical life was forbidden," he told The Times in 1985. "So we made music 
in cafes. My partner, Andrzej Panufnik, and I played two pianos. And we made 
arrangements, probably 200 in all, of all kinds of music, from Bach to Ravel's 
'Bolero.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski's problems with creative freedom did not end with the war. 
Earlier, his compositions were neoclassical with the added influence of Polish 
folk music. But at war's end he turned in new directions, attracting the anger 
of the new Communist rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 His First Symphony, which was premiered in 1948, was banned by the Communist 
government as "formalist." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the last performance of the work at the Polish National Philharmonic 
Hall in 1949, the minister of culture stormed into the conductors' room and in 
front of a dozen people announced that a composer like me ought to be thrown 
under the wheels of a streetcar," Lutoslawski told The Times four decades 
later. "It is an illustration of most artists' situation in Stalinist Poland." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was absolutely sure I would compose what I wanted," he reminisced last 
year. "But I was not at all sure it would ever be performed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lutoslawski continued composing in his unique way, performed for many 
years as a pianist, and eventually began conducting his own works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the temperament of a performer, and I don't feel myself a conductor of 
my own music," he told The Times last year. "Rather, I think of myself as the 
conductor of pieces by a younger colleague, about whom I know more than anybody 
else. It's a pleasure for an interpreter." 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski's work was known for exacting form, with structures described by 
the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians as "always logical, clear and 
well-proportioned, so as to suggest a high degree of creative discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 The composer, in a Times interview last year, downplayed such discipline: "A 
big part of everything I do is intuitive. I have some procedures and I've never 
stopped working on my sound language. I've discovered some rules, but in an 
empirical way, not thought out as doctrine. I test the sound phenomenon I 
construct with my own emotional reaction to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy to write difficult music," he said. "The real difficulty is to 
write playable music without compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Lutoslawski is survived by his wife, Maria.

ARGENTINA SEEKS TO PUNISH FALKLANDS WAR TRANSGRESSORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Argentina will insist on punishment for any British veterans of the 1982 
Falklands war who may be found guilty of crimes against Argentine prisoners, 
President Carlos Menem said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's metropolitan police are probing allegations made by veterans of both 
sides that British soldiers had tortured and shot Argentine prisoners during 
the 10-week war in the South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were first aired in 1992 by Vincent Bramley, a former British 
paratrooper, in his book "Excursion to Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentine Defense Ministry last year opened its own inquiry into the 
alleged war crimes after Scotland Yard started its probe.

STUDENTS WRITE A BILL ON ETHNICITY; EDUCATION: ALHAMBRA HIGH GROUP DRAFTS 
MEASURE REQUIRING A CLASS IN MULTICULTURAL AWARENESS FOR GRADUATION IN 
CALIFORNIA. THE PROPOSAL IS NOW IN THE LEGISLATURE.

<P>
 Concerned about why they cannot all just get along, students at Alhambra High 
School have written and offered a bill that would require students in 
California to take a class in multicultural awareness before graduating from 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 teen-agers at the school -- which is 90% minority in a school 
district that has been plagued with racial tensions and occasional violence -- 
spent last semester researching and drafting the bill with help from their 
social studies teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is being carried in the Legislature by Assemblywoman Diane Martinez 
(D-Alhambra). 
</P>
<P>
 The bill calls for students to complete 40 hours of multicultural studies, 
addressing such topics as the contributions made to American society by many 
cultures, how current events are shaped by multiracial and multiethnic conflict 
and cultural sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "On campus, people hang around with their own race, there's not a lot of 
intermingling," said Steven Jong, a 17-year-old senior who worked on the bill. 
"If this is a requirement, students will get involved with others in a 
classroom setting, which is important because in life you're not just going to 
be hanging out with your own race." 
</P>
<P>
 Also supporting the bill are Democrats from the Los Angeles area in both 
houses of the state Legislature, including Sen. Art Torres, Sen. Diane Watson 
and Assembly members Marguerite Archie-Hudson, Marta Escutia, Gwen Moore and 
Grace Napolitano. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Alhambra students met in a campus courtyard to make a three-minute 
promotional video for the bill that will be aired at the state-sponsored 
Education Summit in San Francisco Feb. 15 and 16. Several students will also 
attend the summit to explain why their idea deserves support. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill is also expected to stir controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a perfect example of politically correct thinking that will 
worsen the problems we have in our school system," says David Horowitz, a 
conservative activist who helps edit a magazine called Heterodoxy. "The most 
important thing now is to stress that we're all Americans first and to teach 
kids the common American culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors who drafted the bill will no longer be in high school if it 
becomes law. The measure must first go through Assembly subcommittees, then to 
the state Senate, before making its way to the governor's office for his 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Martinez, who has a 16-year-old daughter in the Alhambra school 
district, said she is optimistic and adds that the student-composed bill 
impressed her more than some bills written by legislators in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's compelling because it came from a multicultural group of students who 
came together and said this is what we need instead of leaving it up to a bunch 
of adults in Sacramento to tell them what they need," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the multicultural class requirement began in September, when 
Martinez met with students and offered to carry a student-written bill that 
would address the concerns of young people. The teen-agers met after class and 
discussed and discarded about 20 ideas -- including requiring seat belts on 
buses and legislating community service for high school students -- before 
settling on the multicultural theme. 
</P>
<P>
 While the California educational framework already requires teachers to weave 
multicultural ideas throughout language arts and social studies courses, some 
believe that a more direct and concentrated approach is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of students are so scared to talk about their culture to most 
people, they'll think people will think they are racist," said Marina 
Cervantes, a 17-year-old senior who worked on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Some multicultural experts concur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, these issues are not being addressed properly in the 
framework," said Chuck Acosta, a bilingual consultant for the Los Angeles 
County Office of Education. "We're supposed to cover the contributions to 
society of all ethnic groups but we all know that just doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 John McCrea, chairman of Alhambra High School's social sciences department and 
a driving force behind the project, said it is almost impossible to monitor 
whether teachers are observing the new framework. 
</P>
<P>
 He concedes that some students and school districts probably will object to 
the idea of yet one more graduation requirement but he said that it will 
provide needed focus on important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would give individual districts discretion to create an entirely new 
class or to incorporate the requirement into other classes. But even if it dies 
in Sacramento, students and educators connected with the project say it has 
been a valuable teaching tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we can put kids outside the classroom and give them real-life 
experiences the more they're going to learn," Alhambra High School Principal 
Julie Hadden said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SENATE GETS $8.6-BILLION AID PLAN; RELIEF: MAIN 
ISSUE IS ASSISTANCE TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. BILL IS LIKELY TO REACH CLINTON THIS 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Staying on its fast track, the California earthquake aid bill was sent to the 
full Senate on Tuesday with promises of upcoming skirmishes over how to pay for 
the $8.6-billion package and stricter limits on benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which would be the largest emergency aid package ever adopted, 
appeared to be headed toward President Clinton's desk by the end of the week. 
It contains funds for housing vouchers, emergency medical care, highways, 
schools and other public facilities, and loans for homeowners, renters and 
small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Before sending the bill to the Senate floor, the Appropriations Committee 
incorporated $3.44 billion in reductions in other programs to pay for part of 
the aid to quake-ravaged Southern California. This compared to $2.5 billion 
that the House recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the differences are not significant 
enough to delay the bill's adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) said he will propose a temporary 
increase in the national gas tax to help defray the costs. A similar proposal 
by Kerrey after last year's floods in the Midwest was resoundingly defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 The major remaining fight appears to loom over how the government should 
handle the volatile issue of assisting illegal immigrants victimized by the 
Jan. 17 temblor. A bruising debate, forestalled by a compromise in the House 
last week, appears likely when the Senate considers the bill today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) proposed an amendment in the Appropriations 
Committee to require federal agencies to "take reasonable steps to determine 
whether any individual seeking (earthquake aid) is lawfully within the United 
States." Reid sought to tighten a measure adopted in the House that prohibits 
longer-term assistance when it is known that an applicant is in the country 
illegally -- but does not require agencies to inquire about legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid's initiative was defeated by a voice vote in the committee. He vowed to 
pursue the proposal on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 For illegal immigrants to receive aid beyond medical or immediate emergency 
care "is simply not fair to California citizens or the citizens of this 
country," said Reid, who has sponsored a hard-line package of bills to crack 
down on illegal immigration. "The House bill'sprovision does not go far 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He called it: "Don't ask, don't tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said his measure would apply to 18-month housing vouchers for rent and 
loans for small-business owners. Feinstein responded that illegal immigrants 
were not receiving such assistance. She voiced support for the House amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way they can verify everyone's legal status at the initial 
request," Feinstein said. Citing the danger of communicable diseases among 
those left homeless and the long delays for those seeking help, she added: 
"This is not a practical solution." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros has told 
her he has a better alternative. She said he has pledged to go back and verify 
the legal status of applicants for 18-month rent subsidies after the grant is 
made. "So that the maximum that someone might be able to get away may be a 
month," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) said officials of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency told her they would have to add 20 to 30 disaster assistance 
centers and hundreds of personnel to meet the demands of checking every 
applicant's legal status. She said that could take months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very nature of the processing would delay getting assistance out to 
American citizens in a timely way," said Mikulski, who added that many victims 
had lost their documents amid the quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she turned to Reid and asked: "Senator, could you prove this 
afternoon that you are a citizen other than the fact you were elected to the 
United States Senate?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said that if an applicant could produce a driver's license or Social 
Security card, "there is a presumption that you are a citizen of the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Any differences in the Senate and House versions of the emergency aid package 
will have to be negotiated in a conference committee of legislators from each 
chamber. The bill's key proponents, seeking to finalize the measure before 
Congress takes a short recess next week, have sought to minimize disagreements 
that could extend the conference deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said that will be her goal on the floor today. 
She said she would join Feinstein in opposing Reid's amendment as well as 
Kerrey's gas tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can handle this on the floor," Boxer said. "My attempt is to get 
this moving quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Clinton, the Senate Appropriations Committee added another 
$250 million for aid for the Midwest floods -- bringing the total cost of the 
emergency spending measure to $10 billion. The bill already included $750 
million for flood relief and repairs from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, as 
well as $1.2 billion for military peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Somalia, 
Haiti, Iraq and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also voted to support a resolution calling for a bipartisan task 
force to assess methods for paying for disaster relief in the future. The House 
appointed such a panel last week. Relief Package

SOUTHWEST MUSEUM TO REMAIN IN L.A.; INSTITUTIONS: BOARD REJECTS 80 OFFERS AND 
DECIDES TO STAY IN CURRENT FACILITY AFTER OFFICIALS PROMISE TO HELP EXPAND AND 
IMPROVE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After three years of emotional debate over whether it should find a new home, 
the cramped and venerable Southwest Museum announced Tuesday that it will stay 
put after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current location was always considered to be a finalist, against which we 
would judge all other offers," said Thomas Wilson, executive director of the 
museum, which has been at the foot of Mt. Washington in northeast Los Angeles 
since 1914. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing Los Angeles, the museum board rejected about 80 other offers, 
ranging from Ventura's aggressive bid to an offer from a Fillmore rancher 
willing to ante up 20 acres and a Chumash ceremonial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said the museum board was swayed by a promise from the city to 
establish a blue-ribbon committee to help it expand and improve its present 
location. A key element of Los Angeles' bid, Wilson said, was a promise to 
support bond issues to fund museums and to help secure a museum stop on the 
Blue Line light-rail extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the city also is helping the institution acquire some nearby 
buildings that will ease the space crunch that has plagued the museum for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1907 by Charles Lummis, a colorful historian and art expert who 
was, among other things, the first city editor of the Los Angeles Times, the 
museum houses one of the nation's best-known collections of Native American 
art. Local lore has it that the museum was the product of a long walk Lummis 
took from Cincinnati to Los Angeles in the 1880s; during the trek, he fell in 
love with Native American art of the Southwest and became an avid collector. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, anthropologists considered Lummis' pieces to be more a collection of 
curios than high art. But with time, they became much more valuable from 
scholarly and financial standpoints. In 1992, a single poncho was appraised at 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the museum, however, that value never has garnered the sort 
of fame that translates into financial support. One former curator said in 1992 
that the museum was hampered, not only by its out-of-the-way locale and stiff 
competition from other museums, but by its "reputation as a funny old place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southwest has remained a standby for school field trips and visiting 
scholars, and draws about 60,000 visitors a year. But as time has passed, 
officials said, it has outgrown its imposing Spanish-style headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, a move was made to merge the collection with that of the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Natural History, but it was dropped in the face of 
public opposition. In 1991, the museum's long-range planning committee hired a 
consultant to examine its problems. The study concluded that the best way for 
the museum to improve attendance and generate new donations was to find a new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 A new site, the consultant said, would cost about $35 million, but would allow 
the museum to update its facility and exhibit a larger percentage of its 
250,000-piece collection, of which only 5% is on view. When the museum board 
issued a request this summer for proposals for a new site, it received scores 
of responses, the most enthusiastic from Ventura County, where seven cities 
expressed interest in the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But when directors announced that they would need at least $35 million to 
construct a building, only Thousand Oaks and Ventura remained in the bidding, 
and only the latter city completely followed through, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling they were just trying to drum up support for the home crowd," 
Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo said. "The game is to say that a 
famous museum is interested in relocating, and then see what you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said the debate was not a ploy to play one place off against 
another. "We were honestly looking at the best alternative for the museum," he 
said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; LEARNING CURVE; LIFE IN SHELTERS POSES SPECIAL 
HARDSHIPS FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH CLASSWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At 6:15 a.m., when the lights go on at the Mason Avenue Red Cross Shelter in 
Chatsworth, Jannet Nguyen, 11, is among the first up and out of her cot. She 
has a lot on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday I didn't do my homework because those kids, they're too noisy," 
Jannet said, her words coming out in a rush of frustration while her mother 
implored her two younger sisters to get ready for school. "I'm worried about 
that. I don't want to get a D or F. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go to school and live here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jannet is among more than 100 students in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District who are still living in shelters. They are picked up by district buses 
each day and taken to 67 schools citywide, according to Alan Tomiyama, the 
district's director of transportation.  
</P>
<P>
 The students on the shelter buses are -- along with others who have been left 
homeless but get to school in other ways -- some of the most displaced victims 
of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Their plight is a lonely one; the 
youngsters are isolated from homes and friends, and emotionally stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jannet did not want to tell her teacher that she did not finish her reading 
homework because, for now, she does not have a home. "I don't want her to know 
it because I don't want to say it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to need a lot more resources and a lot more support," said Dr. 
Loeb Aronin, the district's director of psychological services. "We've never 
had enough psychologists, or enough nurses or support personnel in general. And 
now you've got a more critical crisis situation. . . . I don't know that we 
have enough staff to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Chatsworth shelter, 23 children waited Tuesday morning to be ferried to 
school. Three buses stopped to unload students at schools along the route 
before doubling back to the shelter to pick up more pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica, 6, started on her long bus ride with three children she did not know 
who attend different schools. She did not speak to them, staring out the window 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The other children spilled out of the bus at Germain Street Elementary School, 
not far from the shelter, and ran to join their friends. Angelica, dwarfed by 
the rows of empty green seats, still had a long ride to Lassen Street 
Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 She gazed out at the Cal State Northridge tent city as the bus lumbered by. 
"My home used to be close to the school," she said, not taking her eyes from 
the window. "My mom drove me. I don't have nobody to talk to now. I don't like 
to be alone." 
</P>
<P>
 A school district bus also took Rachel Kinney, 12, from the shelter to her 
private Lutheran school in North Hollywood. Rachel and her mother, Wendy, 
decided to keep their troubles to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a church school," Wendy Kinney said. "On Sunday, everyone would say, 
'Awwww, are you OK?' It's kind of hard to take so that's why we're keeping it 
quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, other students are not as sensitive as they might be if they knew 
of her troubles, Rachel said. Classmates do not know why she has worn the same 
clothes day after day. They say things that they might not say if they knew 
about her situation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just sort of carry on with everything," Rachel said over her shelter 
breakfast of Apple Jacks and a danish. "They talk about how mean their moms are 
and they don't even know how bad it can get. They talk about how their lives 
are so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel finished breakfast in time for her scheduled bus departure at 7:20 a.m. 
A bus driver poked her head into the shelter to look for her passengers. Jannet 
and her sisters grabbed sack lunches and walked slowly to the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it to live here," Jannet said. "My sisters, they're going to school 
and I know it's hard for them because I've been their age. They need my help 
but I just can't help -- I can't even help myself."

METRO FOCUS: LOS ANGELES; TOWING FIRMS TO EVENTUALLY COMPETE FOR CITY CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved a major overhaul in its program for 
towing impounded vehicles, ending a controversial system that allowed towing 
operators to arrange exclusive, long-term deals with the city without 
competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest towing system came under scrutiny in 1991 when officials 
discovered that private towing firms were operating as virtual monopolies with 
lucrative agreements that were in apparent violation of the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17 "official police garages," which haul away cars that have been 
abandoned or wrecked, had never been audited and city officials did not know 
how much profit they were making. The reforms approved Tuesday would implement 
a competitive bidding process for the contracts beginning in four to seven 
years.

DOGNAPING OR REPOSSESSION? JURY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It started as a simple business deal, according to a Northridge podiatrist who 
claims things turned sour a few months later when several people came down with 
a nasty case of seller's remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a lawsuit, scheduled to go to trial today in Van Nuys Superior 
Court. The suit alleges that the sellers realized they had given up a valuable 
and famous commodity for a paltry $600 and then took it back by force. 
</P>
<P>
 The property in question is Shavin-Kingsmere Notty Nada, a champion bull 
terrier not unlike the party-loving Spuds McKenzie made famous in beer 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Spuds, Nada is a well-heeled animal. One expert in the case believes the 
dog, which at one time was the No. 1 bull terrier in the country, is worth up 
to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the dispute, according to court documents, is a clandestine 
raid involving an off-duty Orange County sheriff's deputy and an Anaheim man, 
who took the animal from the doctor's back yard in March, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has seen the dog for nearly four years, and the alleged dognapers will 
only say that Nada, now 5 1/2 years old, was given to shadowy figures known 
only as "Helen and Jim," according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed by Patricia Walters on April 5, 1990, calls the incident a 
dognaping, while those who admit taking the dog call it a repossession. 
</P>
<P>
 During a trial expected to last five to 10 days, a jury will be asked to 
decide whether Walters owns the dog, or if Nada is the property of the alleged 
dognapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters is asking for the return of Nada as well as unspecified damages for 
assault and the infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters claims in the suit that she was assaulted by William Edwards when he 
entered her back yard to take Nada. Edwards claims he was rescuing the animal 
from Walters, who he says intended to put the dog to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards also claims Walters attacked him with a dog leash when he entered her 
back yard to get the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Bollong also is a named in the suit 
because he allegedly grabbed the animal as William Edwards passed the dog over 
a wall from Walters' back yard. THOM MROZEK

METRO FOCUS: LOS ANGELES; RIORDAN URGES SCRAPPING LITTLE TOKYO OFFICE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan recommended Tuesday that the city scuttle a 6-year-old 
proposal to build a municipal office building in conjunction with a private 
hotel, apartment and retail development near Little Tokyo in Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the City Council, Riordan called the $151-million office tower 
too expensive. He added that the plan does not coincide with guidelines to 
bolster development in the downtrodden historic core of the city and also 
provides too much space for a city work force that has been shrinking steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council committee voted Tuesday evening to give the 
so-called First Street North project, proposed for Alameda and 1st streets, 
more study.

METRO FOCUS: PASADENA; COUNCIL ACCEPTS $140,000 IN SUPER BOWL TICKET DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena City Council voted Tuesday night to accept at least $140,000 from 
the nonprofit Los Angeles Sports Council to settle its dispute over a revenue 
shortfall associated with the sale of 700 tickets to Super Bowl XXVII. 
</P>
<P>
 The 700 tickets were among 2,500 tickets that were to be sold at premium 
prices in hospitality packages, generating $1 million for city coffers.City 
officials planned to use the money to help pay for a new $11.5-million press 
box they had built at the Rose Bowl to accommodate last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
 But packages containing the 700 tickets remained unsold several days before 
the game, said officials of the Sports Council, the coordinating group for 
Super Bowl XXVII. So the tickets were sold at face value, creating a shortfall 
of about $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials initially demanded that the Sports Council disclose who bought 
the coveted tickets at face value but dropped the issue Tuesday after receiving 
assurances that nothing had been remiss in the way the tickets were sold.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE MAYOR AND THE LABOR BOSS: EARTHQUAKE PALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a real political pro, nothing is personal. Today's enemy can easily 
be tomorrow's ally. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the lesson of the relationship between Mayor Richard Riordan, a 
Republican businessman-turned-pol, and Jim Wood, a liberal Democratic labor 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, a tall, thin man with a friendly smile and calculating eyes, is 
secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. 
This makes him one of the leading voices of organized labor in Southern 
California. It also makes him a Riordan foe. For among Wood's members are L.A. 
city workers who fear the mayor's plan to turn over much of their work to 
private companies. Riordan contends this would save money and improve municipal 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor is preparing to take on the mayor in what promises to be the biggest 
fight of his young Administration, and Wood will be leading the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood's approach to issues was evident when he began as a hard-nosed young 
assistant to then-county federation chief Bill Robertson, a back-room power in 
Mayor Tom Bradley's Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Bradley's election in 1973, the liberal new mayor and Robertson 
teamed up with L.A. business leaders on a huge plan to redevelop bedraggled 
Downtown L.A. It was another example of politics' changing alliances because 
several of these leaders had opposed Bradley's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was for Bradley's Community Redevelopment Agency to declare a vast 
area of Downtown blighted and then buy the land at low prices and sell it 
cheaply to developers. The developers would build high-rises, assuring 
thousands of building trade union members many years of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was that the political appointees on the CRA board were too green 
to be trusted to get the complicated deal straight. At Robertson's suggestion, 
Bradley appointed Wood, then just 30, to the board to keep the others in line. 
Wood hammered the Downtown redevelopment plan through and the results are 
visible in today's skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 When Robertson retired, Wood became head of a federation that had lost 
considerable clout at City Hall in the 1993 election. The unions had opposed 
Riordan for mayor. While several of the 15 council members remained union 
backers, the new mayor's quick launch of privatization studies was a strong 
sign of trouble ahead for the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-January, conflict seemed inevitable. On Jan. 15, Wood joined about 500 
union workers marching from the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Mall to Bethany Baptist 
Church to protest Riordan's plans to privatize city jobs. I talked to Wood just 
before he spoke and he sounded ready for a long fight with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the earthquake hit. And within a week, the mayor had enlisted 
Wood's help in obtaining earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Howard Berman and Julian Dixon, the L.A. congressmen guiding the 
$8.6-billion California earthquake bill through the House, asked Riordan and 
other L.A. County leaders to lobby members of Congress who were wavering. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan put together an unofficial L.A. lobbying team, with high-powered 
business leaders, including James Montgomery of Great Western Financial, Lew 
Wasserman of MCA and Lod Cook of Arco. Republican Riordan and the business 
leaders phoned conservatives trying to cut the aid. Riordan asked Wood to help 
out with another problem -- liberals who opposed a bipartisan compromise in a 
dispute over illegal immigrants receiving aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conversation was quick and to the point," Wood said. "He (Riordan) said: 
'You don't have to come to any meetings. All you have to do is make the phone 
calls. I'll give you a list of people we think you can contact.' I made the 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
 The aid bill passed the House 337 to 4 and is expected to be quickly approved 
by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Wood why he was so fast to help a mayor who wants to eliminate union 
jobs. "Privatization is a government policy issue and we will fight that out in 
the City Council," he said. "That is not the same thing as delivering blankets 
to people who are cold." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he wanted to show Riordan the value of union labor. "Public 
employees reported to their yards for duty. Traffic officers were on duty when 
there were no street lights. The city didn't have to go out and find a 
(private) contractor." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Riordan invited representatives of the major employee unions to 
the post-earthquake meeting with President Clinton in Burbank. Wood appreciated 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Wood may have a rough fight coming up. But they know another issue 
will arise some day when they will again need each other. That's why "nothing 
personal" is one of politics' most important rules.

POPE NAMES 3 AUXILIARY BISHOPS FOR L.A. ARCHDIOCESE; RELIGION: THEY SAY 
BUILDING UNITY IN ETHNICALLY DIVERSE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL BE A KEY GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II on Tuesday named three Los Angeles priests to become 
auxiliary bishops in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, all longtime priests in the nation's largest archdiocese, will 
oversee three administrative regions within the 8,761-square-mile archdiocese 
and report to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who is archbishop. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the Rev. Msgr. Thomas J. Curry, 51, director of the archdiocese's 
ethnic ministries programs; the Rev. Msgr. Joseph M. Sartoris, 66, who has 
served as episcopal vicar of the San Pedro region since the death in September 
of Bishop Carl A. Fisher, and the Rev. Msgr. Gabino Zavala, 42, rector of St. 
John's Seminary in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three bring with them a deep love for Jesus Christ, proven service to the 
church and a vigorous commitment in their pastoral work here in this 
archdiocese," Mahony said Tuesday in announcing their appointments at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In meeting the media for the first time as bishops-elect, all three said 
building unity in ethnically diverse Southern California continues as one of 
their primary tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a challenge of trying to affirm and recognize the gifts in diversity 
that we have and to come together as a people of faith," said Zavala, a native 
of Mexico who was ordained a priest in 1977 and has served on the Eastside.  
</P>
<P>
 Sartoris, a Los Angeles native whose father was an Italian immigrant, said 
building a "sense of unity and community" was foremost among his hopes. He also 
said he wanted to encourage men to enter the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Curry, a native of Ireland, came to the United States in 1967, the year he was 
ordained a priest. "In ministering here as a priest, I have tried to combine my 
experience of immigration with the knowledge I have acquired of my adopted 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony told reporters: "In a special way, the migration of two of our new 
bishops to serve the church in Los Angeles corresponds well to the history of 
California, where so many have come as immigrants and have made such 
exceptional contributions to the building up of both the church and society." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala will become regional bishop for the San Gabriel Pastoral Region, 
succeeding Bishop Juan A. Arzube, who retired last year. Sartoris will head the 
San Pedro region and Curry will lead the Santa Barbara region, succeeding 
Bishop G. Patrick Ziemann, who became bishop of Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Mahony announced that Bishop Stephen E. Blaire will become 
the new regional bishop for Our Lady of Angels Pastoral Region, which includes 
central Los Angeles and extends west to the Pacific. He succeeds Bishop John J. 
Ward, who will work more closely with the cardinal's office and continue as 
pastor of St. Timothy's Parish until his retirement in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaire will be succeeded as chancellor of the archdiocese and moderator of the 
curia by the Rev. Msgr. Terrance Fleming, who has been vice chancellor and 
pastor of St. Vibiana's Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Msgr. John Rohde becomes the new pastor of St. Vibiana's Cathedral 
and secretariat director for church ministerial services, replacing Curry in he 
latter post. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Jeremiah J. McCarthy, now vice rector at St. John's Seminary, will 
become interim rector until a permanent successor to Zavala is named. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Armando X. Ochoa will remain as regional bishop of the San Fernando 
Pastoral Region. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bishops-elect are scheduled to be formally ordained to the episcopacy 
March 19 at St. Vibiana's Cathedral. Their appointments by the Pope followed a 
lengthy process of confidential consultations by Mahony with priests and 
bishops within the archdiocese, as well as with bishops throughout the Western 
United States and the Vatican ambassador in Washington. From these 
consultations, lists of candidates were developed and sent to the Congregation 
of Bishops in Rome, which makes recommendations to the Pope. The Pope makes the 
final choice of bishops.

MAN SUSPECTED OF SLAYING WIFE AND BUSINESS PARTNER KILLS SELF

 A man suspected of killing his wife and a business partner and critically 
wounding another partner outside a Santa Ana office killed himself outside his 
home Tuesday as police moved in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 John S. Hanna, 56, shot himself to death "as he was being approached by 
officers" outside his home on East La Costa Circle, said Detective Mike 
McCarthy of the Upland Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the apparent suicide followed a daylong shooting spree Monday, and 
a series of desperate calls Hanna made Tuesday on his car phone to a clergyman 
who tried to talk him into surrendering, and to his brother, a prominent 
Toronto surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain of events began Monday when Hanna killed his wife, Irene Hanna, 65, 
at their home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna then drove to Corona for an appointment with Herbert Roy Ratch, one of 
his business partners in a failing company called North American Cogeneration 
Inc. Hanna was chief executive officer of the company, which had its corporate 
status revoked by the California secretary of state in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratch's body was found Monday afternoon in a grain storage lot in the 17000 
block of Pomona Rincon Road in Chino. "The best we can figure is that he was 
driven to Chino and dumped," San Bernardino Sheriff's Detective Robert Acevedo 
said. Acevedo would not say whether the 54-year-old Ratch had been shot, 
pending the results of an autopsy.  
</P>
<P>
 Hanna was suing Ratch and other partners in North American Cogeneration in 
Orange County Superior Court, maintaining that they misrepresented the 
financial condition of the company when Hanna invested $100,000 to become a 
majority stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Hanna's other partners at the firm was Greg Lawyer, 51, who was shot 
and critically wounded before noon Monday, police said. Lawyer was a plaintiff 
with Hanna in the suit against Ratch and other partners. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hanna and Lawyer spoke briefly at Lawyer's office at another company, 
North Canadian Marketing on North Tustin Avenue in Santa Ana, Lawyer was found 
with two bullet wounds in the upper body. He was taken to a hospital.

EAST L.A. MARKET OPERATOR CHARGED WITH FRAUD IN FOOD STAMP PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operator of an East Los Angeles market was charged with food stamp fraud 
Tuesday for allegedly paying an undercover agent $240 for coupons worth $480. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second felony case in as many days stemming from an undercover 
investigation into fraudulent use of emergency food stamps provided since the 
earthquake, according to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Sandoval, 30, allegedly bought the stamps from an agent who visited T 
& M Market at 4770 Brooklyn Ave. Sandoval could have redeemed the coupons for 
their full face value, a prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval is charged with one count of violating a section of the California 
Welfare and Institutions Code, which makes it a felony for an unauthorized 
person to use, transfer, sell, purchase or possess food stamps valued at more 
than $400.  
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated earlier case, prosecutors charged two men with buying food 
stamps from an undercover agent outside a distribution center in South-Central 
Los Angeles.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CITY COUNCIL BALKS AT OUT-OF-TOWN CONTRACTORS; 
JOBS: BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS IS ASKED TO SUBMIT NEW LIST OF LOCAL BUSINESSES TO 
HANDLE EARTHQUAKE CLEANUP AND DEMOLITION PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday delayed voting on rubble cleanup and 
demolition contracts worth up to $100 million because several private 
contractors recommended for the jobs where based outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sick and tired of contracting to businesses outside of our profit area," 
said City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who led the charge to eliminate the 
out-of-town contractors for consideration and replace them with firms based in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly an hour of debate, the council instructed the Board of Public 
Works to return to the council by Friday with a new recommended list of 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts to pick up residential debris and demolish condemned buildings 
will be awarded to three partnerships that will serve three areas for the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each contract is valued at $5 million, city officials said the value 
is likely to increase to as much as $30 million each because contracts will 
probably be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they plan to apply for federal emergency funds to 
reimburse the city for the cost of the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firms protested the move to limit work to local firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair," said Paul Womack, project manager for Construction 
Control Services Corp., a North Carolina-based construction management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the move treats his and other firms like "illegal aliens." Womack 
added that federal funds will pay for most of the city's cleanup and therefore 
companies from throughout the nation should be considered for the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to hasten the city's quake recovery, the City Council also voted to 
streamline the approval process for permits needed to rebuild seriously damaged 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, planning officials still will have the authority to call 
for a public hearing for those projects that are historically significant or 
are likely to create public controversy if they are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In other quake-related action, the council voted to waive permit fees for 
demolition jobs and for the inspection of rebuilt chimneys and block walls. 
City officials said they could not estimate how much money the city will lose 
by waiving the fees because the amount depends on how many permit fees are 
waived. An ad hoc committee on earthquake recovery is considering waiving 
additional construction fees.

DANA PARSONS: LITTLE DID WE KNOW THE TIMES THEY WERE A-CHANGIN' US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 So I'm on vacation last week, watching TV around midnight, when an infomercial 
came on commemorating this summer's 25th anniversary of Woodstock. (Can there 
be more compelling proof of our nation's spiritual decline than the fact that 
"Woodstock" and "infomercial" can now appear in the same sentence?) 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I over-invested in the revolution, but it just seemed a bit bourgeois 
that "operators are now standing by" to help me experience Woodstock all over 
again. John Sebastian, Woodstock participant and lead singer of the Lovin' 
Spoonful, was the info-host. John made it clear that I could relive the weekend 
at Yasgur's farm that changed our lives forever . . . assuming I had my Visa or 
Mastercard available. 
</P>
<P>
 A day or so later, I was driving around and a radio station was playing the 
music of Buddy Holly to mark the 35th anniversary of his death. I don't 
remember if the deejay specifically noted that Holly's death changed our lives 
forever, but Don McLean said as much when he paid homage to it as "the day the 
music died," in his 1971 song "American Pie." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a couple days later, I picked up the Sunday New York Times and read a 
front-page story on the Beatles. The article pointed out that this week (today, 
in fact) marks the 30th anniversary of the Fab Four's first appearance on the 
Ed Sullivan Show. Their performance on American television changed our lives 
forever, or as the Times put it, ". . . neither (the Beatles) nor America 
emerged from it the same." 
</P>
<P>
 I had the same feeling of remembrance last fall while watching a Madison 
Square Garden gala celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of Bob 
Dylan's first album. A galaxy of rock and country music stars -- and even ol' 
Bob himself -- spent the evening playing and singing songs from the vast Dylan 
catalogue. It was a sure-fire reminder to all of us who heard Dylan for the 
first time back in the '60s that our lives were about to be changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, there's more. 
</P>
<P>
 This year will mark the 40th anniversary of the first time a young man named 
Elvis Presley stepped into a recording studio. I won't insult your intelligence 
by reminding you that was an event that changed our lives forever. 
</P>
<P>
 History also tells us that 1954 was the year when Bill Haley originally 
recorded "Rock Around the Clock," a record that changed the face of popular 
music in America and that, yep, changed our lives forever. Stay tuned for 
details about any 40th anniversary events. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, "Sesame Street" premiered. Yes, Captain Kangaroo had 
been on the scene long before that, but Bert and Ernie changed our lives 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 As if Woodstock weren't enough, 1969 also marked the release of the movie 
"Easy Rider." You know what that means -- a 25th anniversary memoriam can't be 
far off. That was the movie that awakened a generation of pot-smoking hippies 
to the agenda of the Silent Majority, as Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper so 
graphically discovered at movie's end. It also introduced a young Jack 
Nicholson to many moviegoers. The rest, of course, is history. 
</P>
<P>
 These anniversaries in 1994 couldn't come at a worse time, following on the 
heels of the anniversaries of 1993. Topping that list, of course, was the 30th 
anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination, and the 25th anniversaries of 
Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King's murders. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer promises to be anniversary-heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, we'll celebrate the 25th anniversary of mankind's first steps on the 
moon. History wasn't the same after that. Also, Ted Kennedy drove off the 
bridge 25 years ago this July, probably changing American politics in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Brace yourself for August. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 7th, it'll be the 30th anniversary of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution 
that got the Vietnam War off and running. Then, just two days later, it'll be 
the 20th anniversary of the day Richard Nixon resigned the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you forgot, both events changed our lives forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, we're all going to be doing a lot of reflecting this year, given that 
we're going to relive so many events that changed our lives. Speaking only for 
myself, I hope I have the energy to get through them. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, maybe toward the end of the year, someone could ask the 
question: Just how often in one lifetime can our lives be changed forever?

SUSPECT IN 2 SLAYINGS KILLS SELF AFTER SPREE; DEATHS: SUICIDE OF JOHN S. HANNA 
FOLLOWS A DAY OF SHOOTINGS. HIS WIFE AND A BUSINESS PARTNER HE WAS SUING WERE 
KILLED. ANOTHER PARTNER WAS WOUNDED IN SANTA ANA. 
</P>

<P>
 A man suspected of killing his wife and a business partner and critically 
wounding another partner outside a Santa Ana office killed himself at his home 
Tuesday as police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 John S. Hanna "returned to his residence in Upland," said Upland Detective 
Mike McCarthy. "As he was being approached by officers, he shot himself and 
killed himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The suicide followed a daylong shooting spree Monday, and a series of 
desperate calls Hanna made Tuesday on his car phone to a local clergyman who 
tried to talk him into surrendering, and to his brother, a prominent Toronto 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police reconstruction of events, Hanna, 56, began the day 
Monday by killing his wife, Irene Hanna, 65, at the couple's home on East La 
Costa Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna then drove to Corona for an appointment with Herbert Roy Ratch, one of 
his business partners in a failing company called North American Cogeneration 
Inc. Hanna was chief executive officer of the company, which had its corporate 
status revoked by the California secretary of state in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratch's body was found just after noon in a grain storage lot in the 17000 
block of Pomona Rincon Road in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best we can figure is that he was driven to Chino and dumped," said San 
Bernardino Sheriff's Detective Robert Acevedo. 
</P>
<P>
 Acevedo would not say how many times the 54-year-old Ratch had been shot, 
pending the results of an autopsy scheduled for today.  
</P>
<P>
 "Where he was shot, we don't know; probably inside the car," Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna was suing Ratch and other partners in the venture in Orange County 
Superior Court, charging that they misrepresented the financial condition of 
the company when Hanna invested $100,000 to become a majority stockholder. 
Later, according to court documents, Hanna invested and loaned more than 
$150,000 to the company and the partners. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Hanna's other partners at North American Cogeneration was Greg B. 
Lawyer, 51, who invested $150,000 in the company. Lawyer was a plaintiff with 
Hanna in the suit against Ratch and other partners. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes before noon on Monday, Hanna went to Lawyer's office at another 
company, North Canadian Marketing on North Tustin Avenue in Santa Ana, 
witnesses told police.  
</P>
<P>
 The two spoke briefly and went to the building's parking structure. Witnesses 
told Santa Ana police that they heard the sound of loud voices and then two 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer was found with two bullet wounds in the upper torso and taken to the 
hospital, where he told police to warn Ratch and another partner, Bernard F. 
Kolanowski, that Hanna was probably after them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolanowski, 57, was contacted at his home in Carlsbad and locked his front 
gate, according to Carlsbad Police Lt. Greg K. Fried. But just after 2 p.m., 
Hanna drove up to his house, got out of his car and shot the lock off the gate, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolanowski told police that he was due in Riverside on Tuesday in another case 
involving Hanna. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling police, Kolanowski saw Hanna walk past his window and ring his 
doorbell, police said. Kolanowski then hid in his garage to await police. Just 
before they arrived, Hanna fired another shot into the back of the house and 
fled, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police from Carlsbad to Chino had searched for Hanna through the night.  
</P>
<P>
 Then at 8:45 a.m. Tuesday, Hanna called Dr. Walter O. Winger, pastor of the 
Brethren in Christ Church in Upland. He "was very distraught, he was crying, he 
wanted forgiveness," Winger said. "He said there's nothing to live for now, 'I 
killed my wife.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Hanna also told Winger that a business venture had cost him $360,000, and 
"there were a couple of other people he wanted to even the score with." 
</P>
<P>
 The minister said he tried to talk Hanna out of hurting himself or anyone 
else, and urged him to get rid of his gun. Hanna agreed to come to Winger's 
office at the church at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Winger called police, who sent plainclothes officers to the church for the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to take him there," Winger said, before anyone else was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna did not show up, but called Winger again about 11:30 a.m., saying there 
were still some things he had to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Winger heard nothing more until police and Hanna's brother called to say that 
John Hanna was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Winger said he first heard of Hanna, who was not a member of his congregation, 
several months ago. The minister received a call from his niece, who is married 
to Hanna's brother, Dr. Sherif S. Hanna, chief of surgery at Sunnybrook Health 
Science Center in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherif Hanna "asked me to call John because he was having some business 
problems," Winger said. "John Hanna was going to come in and talk to me, but he 
never came." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherif Hanna told Winger that his brother had been talking to him on the car 
phone as he drove up to his house. When John Hanna said he saw police, Sherif 
Hanna tried to call Upland police on another line to urge them not to approach 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:30 p.m., Hanna "pulled up in front of the garage," said Detective 
McCarthy. "When the officers approached him, that's when he shot himself. . . . 
He said nothing. The officer watching him heard his engine rev up, but didn't 
hear the shot when they approached." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers found a note in Hanna's car.  
</P>
<P>
 "He just said he was sorry for what occurred, and that was it," said Upland 
Police Lt. Walter J. Ciszek. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer remained in critical but stable condition Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Kolanowski, who had spent Monday night at an undisclosed location, was 
contacted by Lt. Fried on Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 'I told him, 'You're free to go home now.' "

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PLAN FLIES; TRAVEL: SUPERVISORS APPROVE 17 DAILY FLIGHTS OUT 
OF JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT FOR THE DALLAS-BASED CARRIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines, whose reputation for no frills service and cut-rate fares 
have made it one of the most traveled in the nation, made a smooth landing 
Tuesday into the Orange County airline market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to grant the Dallas-based airline 
17 daily flights. The familiar brown-and-orange jets could be buzzing the local 
skies above John Wayne Airport by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been interested in the Orange County market for some time," Southwest 
spokesman Ed Stewart said from his Dallas office. "The mood here is 'Let's go 
as soon as possible.' You'll see the airport stimulated because of the low 
fares that we bring." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members, however, denied Reno Air's entry to John Wayne because of the 
airport's limited capacity for carriers operating noisier aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno "just had the wrong kind of airplanes," said board Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley, whose name is affixed to the local terminal. "But getting Southwest is a 
major accomplishment in making Orange County more competitive and offering 
increased service. People have been saying that it's great to get them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although expected for months, Southwest's arrival in Orange County already had 
local travel agents inquiring Tuesday about possible travel routes and 
anticipating a new round of fare wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of clients who want a good value for an airline ticket," said 
Carol Grabski, a Costa Mesa-based travel consultant. "The other airlines will 
have to respond if they want to remain competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Other agents said they had been fielding dozens of calls from people asking 
about how they can cash in on the new service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our experienced travelers are real anxious and well aware that 
Southwest is coming," said Cindy Deibert, assistant manager of Domestic World 
Travel Inc. in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Deibert said that as many as 20% of Domestic World's leisure travel clients 
now drive from Orange County to either Los Angeles or Ontario to fly Southwest 
and take advantage of lower fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful news that they will be operating out of John Wayne," she said. 
"They have a great program and the prices are hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said Southwest has yet to decide on Orange County routes or when the 
airline would begin service. County officials said they expected service by 
June 1, and Stewart said that date was possible under Southwest's current 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, all we can say to travelers is stay tuned," he said. "We're doing 
everything in our power to get the ball rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 The airline's entry to Orange County was virtually assured when it acquired 
Morris Air in Salt Lake City last December. Morris, another low-fare carrier, 
operates two daily flights from John Wayne to Salt Lake City. With the 
purchase, Southwest became a recognized carrier at John Wayne and was entitled 
to higher priority status for the open slots. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Stewart said Morris will continue to operate the daily flights to 
Salt Lake City under Southwest's management. Under the agreement with the 
county, Southwest is entitled to two additional flight slots by April 1 and 13 
more after June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local travel agents expect Southwest to challenge other major carriers by 
offering discount fares on popular routes to Phoenix, Oakland and San Jose. 
Stewart said it was too early to say whether those cities would be among the 
routes offered out of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just great," Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said after the 
Southwest vote. "Right now, if I were going to fly to Arizona and I had a 
choice between flying American and Southwest, I'd fly Southwest to get a better 
deal. It seems like Orange County has the highest costs for plane tickets in 
the Southern California basin. I've flown out of Ontario just because of the 
fares." 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of Orange County, Southwest will fly out of nine California 
cities -- San Jose, Sacramento, San Francisco, Oakland, Burbank, Los Angeles, 
Ontario and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only person left unhappy by Tuesday's board decision was Reno Air 
Vice President Paul H. Tate. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an alternate proposal considered by the board, Tate said Reno could have 
gained entry to John Wayne if Southwest was awarded one less flight and if 
United and Alaska airlines each gave one slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely disappointed," Tate said, adding that the airline would apply 
again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Gatzke, the county's airport attorney, said Reno operates noisier MD-80 
series aircraft, making it eligible only for a limited number of flights under 
John Wayne's strict noise regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Gatzke said, two cargo carriers are preparing environmental impact 
statements in their applications for remaining slots in Reno's same noise 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatzke said the cargo carriers were on the waiting list ahead of Reno. And 
since the carriers' environmental statements were already being prepared, the 
attorney said the board decision against Reno gave the cargo carriers a "fair 
opportunity."

TOLLWAY PROTESTERS SPEND DAY HIGH WAY; DEMONSTRATION: FOUR EARTH FIRST! 
ACTIVISTS TIE THEMSELVES TO 200-FOOT-HIGH CRANES TO BLOCK FOOTHILL PROJECT. 
RAIN HAD HALTED WORK SO NO ONE IS ARRESTED.

 Earth First! activists, in their first major protest against the Foothill 
tollway project, tied themselves Tuesday atop 200-foot-high cranes being used 
to build a bridge over O'Neill Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by 25 to 30 demonstrators on the ground, the protesters hung two 
banners from the cranes, one reading: "No More Roads! Earth First!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were called to the construction site, but no arrests were 
made because the protesters didn't interrupt work, which had been halted anyway 
because of rain and muddy conditions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the sheriff got there, it was decided to let the protesters stay because 
they weren't posing any problem," said Lisa Telles, with the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies. "There was a decision not to arrest them." 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's unit did remain at the site throughout the day to keep the peace 
and prevent any injuries. There was a minor scuffle before deputies arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 By 4 p.m., the activists had climbed safely from the cranes and left the site, 
operated by FCI Constructors of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this was the first such major demonstration against the Foothill 
tollway, a 30-mile thoroughfare from San Clemente to Tustin, it was not the 
first time Earth First! activists have chained themselves to toll-road 
construction equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight activists were arrested and charged with trespassing last September 
after they chained themselves to earth movers at a San Joaquin Hills 
Transportation Corridor construction site in Laguna Niguel. Firefighters had to 
cut the activists free using "Jaws of Life" equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Hills project, separate from the Foothill tollway, is 
scheduled to connect Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano to the Corona del Mar 
Freeway in Newport Beach by March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest demonstration began before dawn when four activists, using 
harnesses and other gear, climbed nearly to the top of three cranes sitting 
next to the 1,400-foot-long bridge project spanning the Arroyo Trabuco near the 
Santa Margarita Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Another two activists used bike locks to chain themselves by the neck to lower 
sections of the cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although largely peaceful, the demonstration was marked by what some described 
as a shoving match between a crane operator and a couple of activists. Both 
sides claim the altercation was sparked by the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth First! said the dramatic act was designed to halt bridge work for the 
day and to make a public statement against construction through the wilderness 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our home," said activist Patrick Mitchell. "We're fed up with 
developers, county politicians and state politicians running wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need for any more of this," he continued. "All this is going to 
do is make for more crime, more pollution and more traffic. This road will 
perpetuate reasons why people are leaving Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Said activist Rita Mehta, who was chained to one of the cranes, "If they keep 
this up, there will be no land left for the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials, however, say the Foothill tollway is needed to ease 
traffic congestion in South Orange County. About 8,000 cars travel each day 
along the first segment of the tollway, completed in October, linking Lake 
Forest to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge project is part of the 4.3-mile-long second segment of the 
corridor, expected to open by mid-1995 and costing about $64.5 million. The 
second segment will eventually link Rancho Santa Margarita and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also say many steps, including construction of the bridge far above 
the wilderness park, have been taken to minimize any effects on the 
environment.

GRUDGE CLAIMED IN LEWIS' OPPOSITION TO APPOINTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one can accuse state Sen. John R. Lewis of amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the Orange Republican has worked behind the scenes in an 
effort to derail Gov. Pete Wilson's appointment of Rosemary E. Thakar to the 
California State University Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Thakar just happens to be the mother of Lewis' opponent in the 1992 Republican 
primary election, Newport Beach attorney Todd Thakar. 
</P>
<P>
 During that battle, the younger Thakar criticized Lewis as an effete "career 
politician" who is simply taking up space in the Capitol. Although the senator 
went on to drub Thakar by a nearly 2-1 margin in the primary, Lewis was none 
too pleased by the highly personal tone of the criticism he absorbed on the 
stump. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Thakar and his mother contend that the lawmaker's effort to block her 
appointment to the state university board is little more than a bald attempt to 
extract political pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he has a problem with me, that's fine. But don't take it out on my 
mother," said Todd Thakar, who served as intergovernmental affairs director for 
Wilson during the governor's days in the U.S. Senate. "It appears to be 
motivated strictly by revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Thakar, a San Francisco philanthropist who co-owns a furniture 
manufacturing and sales chain, was even more peeved by the efforts of Lewis, 
who persuaded Senate Republicans to hold back the confirmation last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's totally retaliatory," she said. "It's laughable. Lewis is such a 
silly man. This is so pathetically obvious I just don't see where he thinks 
he's coming from and how he can with a straight face present any objection to 
my nomination." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis could not be reached for comment Tuesday, but his top aide said the 
senator worked to block Thakar's appointment more out of concerns about her 
credentials than irritation at her offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't say politics are not a factor at all, but it's certainly not the 
principal reason the senator opposes her," said Chris Jones, chief of staff for 
Lewis. "We just believe she's not the right person for this slot." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Rosemary Thakar is not the sort of "strong taxpayer advocate" 
needed at a time when university trustees are under fire for handing out plum 
salaries and severance packages to administrators in recent years, while 
student fees continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The senator feels we need a stronger fiscal conservative, someone who is not 
afraid to shake up the administrative Establishment and make cutbacks in 
salaries and perks," Jones said. "She's more of a liberal Republican, more one 
to favor big government." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also argued that Thakar has "no special expertise" to handle the 
position. Instead, she won the appointment because she is a Republican moderate 
active in Bay Area politics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Rosemary Thakar has contributed more than $12,000 to the governor, 
according to campaign disclosure statements. She also helped her son's 1992 
campaign by loaning or contributing more than $14,000. In 1984 and again in 
1986, she ran unsuccessfully for Congress against Rep. George Miller 
(D-Martinez). 
</P>
<P>
 "We really do not believe this is the kind of person we should be putting on 
these boards," Jones concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Thakar said such critiques are well off the mark. She noted that her 
nomination was unanimously approved in committee, even earning the support of 
Democrats. Moreover, she pointed to her decade-long service on the president's 
advisory board at San Francisco State University as proof that she is well 
aware of the foibles of the university system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I bring a broad experience range," she said. "All my philanthropic 
activity has always focused on improving the lot of young people. I'm a 
lifelong volunteer, and I'm someone who has put five boys through college 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her appointment by Wilson on March 1, 1993, Thakar has been attending 
meetings of the state university board as a voting member. As are many 
gubernatorial appointees, she is eligible to fill the seat for a year before 
the Senate acts on the confirmation. The Senate will reconsider her 
confirmation Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thakar downplayed the effect her contributions to the governor may have had on 
her appointment. "Am I supposed to have influenced the governor because I made 
minor political contributions?" she asked. "I like the governor, I like what he 
has done and I contribute to his political campaigns."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: SEAL BEACH; NOT ALL ARE PLEASED BY PIER PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A slight cold, nagging arthritis and stormy weather couldn't prevent Floyd 
Henderson from making his weekly morning trek from Garden Grove to the tip of 
the Seal Beach Pier, where he looks out at the vast blue ocean and "thinks a 
lot about life." 
</P>
<P>
 But the routine that the 70-year-old Henderson has followed since retiring six 
years ago could forever change with a proposed development on the landmark 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby's, which already operates a restaurant at the end of the pier, seeks to 
build a patio dining area nearby. The project would remove about 900 square 
feet of pier space from public use. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like this is the people's place. It shouldn't be taken away," 
Henderson said. "It just doesn't feel right to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson is not alone. Concerns about the project have been mounting ever 
since the Planning Commission first took up the issue last month. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have also raised questions about the project, prompting city 
officials to delay a vote on the application until they meet with 
representatives of the State Wildlife Conservation Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed expansion would mark the largest development on the pier since 
the structure was rebuilt after being decimated by the storms of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier, the centerpiece of Seal Beach's Old Town shopping district, holds a 
special place in many residents' hearts. The public donated thousands of 
dollars toward the pier's reconstruction in the 1980s, and previous attempts to 
build additional buildings on the wooden structure have been vigorously 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents said they would welcome a patio dining area elsewhere on 
the pier, they argued that the proposed site at the tip facing the ocean is a 
special place that should be left open for public access. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is very important for people to be able to walk around that area 
and fish there," council member Frank Laszlo said. "I think it should remain a 
public area for people to visit." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Ruby's restaurant chain said their patio proposal will 
leave ample area at the end of the pier for people to fish and stroll. Doug 
Cavanaugh, president of Ruby's, said the patio would be built in an area seldom 
used by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby's has operated on the pier since 1987 and is a popular gathering spot for 
both locals and tourists. Cavanaugh said the patio would be similar to the one 
at Ruby's Balboa Pier location. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns about limiting public access on the pier persist. Laszlo said he 
has received several calls from residents that show concern over the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ruby's would rent the patio from the city, the proposal requires City 
Council approval. The issue is expected to come before the Planning Commission 
later this month.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: DECISION DELAYED ON PUBLIC CEMETERY SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday postponed a decision on the sale of the 
Magnolia Memorial Park in Garden Grove at the request of a citizens group that 
is worried about the future of the 120-year-old cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed sale of the six-acre cemetery to the Omega Society Inc. of Santa 
Ana would likely mark the first time in California history that a public 
graveyard has been sold to a private company, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that potential precedent has some local residents worried about the 
maintenance and development of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember please our heritage, the importance and sanctity of grave sites," 
Garden Grove Historical Society member Faire Sax told the board. Sax urged the 
supervisors to delay their public hearing on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
 Sax said her group, which only recently heard about the proposed sale, voted 
unanimously to ask the board for more time to prepare for the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4-1 to grant that extension, and will revisit the issue and 
invite public comment on March 1. Supervisor Thomas F. Riley cast the 
dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale was given initial approval last month when the Orange County Cemetery 
District Board of Trustees accepted Omega Society's offer of $31,000, the 
highest among 10 bids. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale would help the district weather state revenue losses that are 
projected to total $700,000 by the end of the year, said district General 
Manager Sam Randall. The losses have forced the agency to trim its staff and 
shift toward contract work for landscaping and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling the parcel, the smallest of the four cemeteries controlled by the 
district, would allow the agency to shed the annual upkeep cost of $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall, who has said the sale is like saying "goodby to a family heirloom," 
said the 3,800-grave cemetery includes the burial plots of Orange County 
pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is room at the park for 1,000 more graves, Randall said the 
cemetery has not been used often in recent years and has averaged 48 burials a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger private cemeteries that serve west Orange County have more burials 
because of on-site mortuaries, greater advertising or more elaborate 
landscaping, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, public cemeteries are restricted by state law to using only underground 
graves, while privately run parks can build mausoleums, making far more 
profitable use of space, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lichtman, an attorney for the district, said the agency will retain 
some influence over the cemetery's future by supervising maintenance and having 
final approval over any future sale.  
</P>
<P>
 The delay by the supervisors will give the public time to understand that the 
sale can only help the preservation of the cemetery by putting it in the hands 
of someone who can better afford its upkeep, Lichtman said. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CONTINUATION SCHOOL TO GET 2ND 
LOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to distance students from gang hostilities, the Capistrano 
Unified School District plans to create a second campus for its continuation 
school, outside a South County gang's territory in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Monday unanimously approved creating the Rancho Alternative 
Education Center in a San Clemente business park. The location is roughly 10 
miles from the district's continuation school, Serra High School, which is in 
the territory of the Capistrano Old Town gang in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students from San Clemente who are affiliated with that city's Varrio 
Chico gang have refused to attend Serra for fear of being hurt and have dropped 
out, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A continuation school gives individualized attention to students who are at 
risk of quitting school or have had problems functioning at regular high 
schools. Some attend full time while others take classes part time to earn 
diplomas or high school equivalency certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Anthony, assistant superintendent for secondary school operations, said 
the district is not concerned with the appearance of giving in to the gangs' 
turf battles. On the contrary, he said, providing students with a safe place to 
attend classes will give them opportunities enabling them to break free of 
local gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't possibly think that we're going to eliminate the gangs in South 
County," Anthony said. "It's a chance to get the kids back into the 
mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 The school still must be approved by city and state officials.  
</P>
<P>
 But Edward Heard Jr. of San Clemente told trustees he and other residents were 
opposed to having the school in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see how the San Clemente business park is going to solve these 
problems," Heard said. "And from our standpoint, it's going to introduce an 
element that we don't want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The school would be located in the San Clemente Commerce Center at 940 Calle 
Negocio. It would serve students in grades 10 through 12 from San Clemente High 
School or those who request transfer from Serra High. The center's two 
classrooms, activity room and two offices are expected to accommodate about 30 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides addressing gang problems, Anthony said the district also needs the 
second campus because enrollment in its continuation school program is 
outgrowing the Serra site, where about 230 full- and part-time students are 
enrolled. The Rancho campus is also needed, he said, because some continuation 
students in San Clemente have difficulty finding transportation to Serra High, 
near El Camino Real and Don Juan Avenue.RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; GAY SUPPORT GROUP MEMBERS TO SPEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of a Fountain Valley High School gay support group that won an 
emotionally charged battle last month to keep meeting on campus will speak 
tonight in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers are being hosted by Laguna Outreach, a local gay and lesbian 
group that supported the Fountain Valley High School Student Alliance when the 
organization hit a wall of opposition from students and parents who wanted the 
meetings stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Outreach President Doug Reilly said the community's reaction to 
Wednesday's meeting will help determine whether the city's gay and lesbian 
youth could benefit from additional support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to hear from (the Fountain Valley students) how they went about 
setting this whole club up and see how appropriate it might be to have 
something like that here in Laguna Beach someday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Outreach's board of directors is also considering launching a youth 
discussion group to help youngsters deal with issues involving their sexuality, 
Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something we're thinking about right now, and we'll make a decision 
fairly soon about that," he said. "This program coming up Wednesday will be a 
way of gauging interest in that concept." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fountain Valley, the uproar arose after the alliance formed in October with 
about 45 gay and non-gay members. Some students and parents bitterly opposed 
the group and demonstrated against allowing its members to meet on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, during a public hearing that attracted more than 300 people, the 
Huntington Beach Union High School District trustees voted 4-1 to allow the 
alliance to continue meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Unified School District Supt. Paul M. Possemato said Tuesday that 
such controversy is not likely to erupt in Laguna Beach, partly because young 
people in that city are taught early to accept the diversity of the community. 
Laguna Beach has a large gay population. 
</P>
<P>
 Possemato said issues involving gays and lesbians have been discussed in the 
past at Laguna Beach High School, and that the district has already moved "far 
beyond tolerance to acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Laguna Beach has a greater base from which to build receptivity and 
acceptance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, neither Possemato nor Reilly said they are sure such a support group 
is needed at the high school at this time. And Possemato said the student 
leadership should have a key role in making such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, the leader of the conservative Anaheim-based 
Traditional Values Coalition, which opposed the Fountain Valley alliance, said 
care must be taken not to "advocate and promote the homosexual lifestyle under 
the disguise of tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not encourage children to be homosexuals," the Rev. Louis P. 
Sheldon said. "We should encourage them to have reparative therapy and come out 
of the lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly, however, scoffed at the notion that support groups encourage 
homosexuality. 
</P>

 "It's never a matter of recruiting anybody," he said. "That's just absurd. 
It's really more a matter of, 'How do you help people who don't know how to 
deal with their feelings?' You shouldn't have to pretend to be anything other 
than what you are."

 The meeting will be held at the Neighborhood Congregational Church on St. 
Ann's Drive at 7:30 p.m. Non-members will be asked to donate $4. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: ANAHEIM; OFFICIALS DOUBT BOY'S FATAL ILLNESS 
SPREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is unlikely that a Rio Vista Elementary School student who died last 
weekend of a massive blood infection could have infected his classmates, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Health and school officials said they doubt the 8-year-old third-grader was 
contagious Friday, two days before he died of septic shock at Children's 
Hospital of Orange County. And in the unlikely event that he was, it is 
doubtful anyone at the school came in close enough contact with him to acquire 
the bacterium that killed him, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a rule, a school is not a likely setting for an outbreak of this disease," 
said Dr. Nick Anas, director of CHOC's pediatric intensive care unit. He said 
close, personal contact with the carrier is required to transmit the boy's 
illness. He said being directly coughed on would be one of the more likely ways 
for the disease to infect another person. "But this disease will not carry 
across the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and Dr. Hildy Meyers, epidemiologist for the Orange County Health Care 
Agency, said that parents of Rio Vista students should not be alarmed by the 
death and that only members of the boy's immediate circle of family and friends 
require preventive medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a (Rio Vista) child develops a cough or muscle aches or weakness or 
becomes lethargic, then the parents should take their child to their 
pediatrician or family doctor," Anas said. "But a perfectly well child requires 
no preventive treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Tuesday they know of no other Rio Vista student who has 
become seriously ill in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name has not been released, suddenly became seriously ill 
Saturday afternoon, officials said, when he developed a high fever, body aches 
and a rash. He was taken by his parents to an Anaheim emergency room and then 
transferred to CHOC, where he died Sunday afternoon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors determined he had been infected with a bacterium that can cause the 
life-threatening illnesses of meningitis and septic shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 2,400 and 2,700 cases of the disease are reported nationwide annually, 
according to medical texts. There were 38 cases in Orange County last year, 
Meyers said. The number of fatalities is not yet known. There were two deaths 
among a similar number of cases in 1992, she said. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: COSTA MESA; DOG PARK TO 
TAKE BOW AT FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and business people are planning to raise money this month to 
enclose a three-acre area of TeWinkle Park where dogs would be allowed to run 
off-leash. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund-raiser on Feb. 19 will include a walk for dogs and their owners through 
the proposed dog park. There will also be exhibits and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the event, people must keep their dogs on a six-foot or shorter leash. All 
dogs who participate must be licensed, but the city will license them at the 
event for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the plan for the dog park in November, but left it 
unfunded. City staff estimated that it will cost about $11,500 to fence in the 
southeast area of the park and build a parking lot. The county's only other 
"bark park" is in Laguna Beach, and many Costa Mesa residents told the council 
they drive there to unleash their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Supt. David J. Alkema said residents and local businesses have given 
$575, and the PetCare Co. in Newport Beach has offered to donate the fence, 
estimated to cost $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But some neighbors of the park are concerned that the dog park area will 
become a magnet for cars and noisy canines from Costa Mesa and other cities. 
Roy Andreen, president of the Mesa Del Mar Homeowners Assn., told the council 
Monday that overflow parking already spills into his community's streets from 
TeWinkle users. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't think it's appropriate at that park," Andreen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Search and Rescue Team will display its team of bloodhounds 
at the fund-raiser. Prizes will be given for the biggest, smallest and 
best-behaved dogs. There will be a clinic about dog-training, and vaccinations 
will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will run from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., and costs $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the city will not pay for the park, it is helping with promotion for 
the fund-raiser. The PetCare company and others are sponsoring the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to donate money for the dog park should call the Community 
Services Department at (714) 754-5300. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: ANAHEIM; CITY DELAYS DECISION ON BUS BENCH BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday postponed action on an ordinance to ban privately 
owned bus benches from the city amid complaints that it would be giving the 
owner of the city's bus shelter a monopoly on curbside advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had been asked to consider the ban by the city's Public Works 
Department, which said it has been concerned about the proliferation of 
unlicensed, broken and graffiti-covered benches throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 2,000 of the advertising-laden benches in the city, but it has 
issued licenses for only 535, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bench companies and Councilman Fred Hunter said Tuesday that the 
actual beneficiary of the removal would be the bench companies' competitor, 
Gannett Transit, which has an exclusive contract with the city to operate 120 
bus shelters. The company has agreed to donate 400 graffiti-resistant, 
advertising-free, backless benches to the city to replace those that are 
removed. Gannett Transit is a division of Gannett Co. Inc., one of the nation's 
largest media conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like quite a deal" for Gannett, Hunter said. "We'll give you 400 
benches and you get rid of our competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Gannett has said it is only donating the replacement benches because the city 
asked it to, and said it had no input into the city's decision. The company did 
not send a representative to Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe Gannett would donate anything out of the goodness of its 
heart," said Arlan Renfro, president of Coast United Advertising, which is the 
largest bench company in the city with licenses for 490 benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the bench locations, their owners have been charging between $360 
and $600 annually per seat to their advertisers, which are primarily small, 
local firms. Gannett charges advertisers -- primarily large, national companies 
-- between $2,400 and $7,200 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get rid of the benches, all we'll see in the city is ads for Marlboro 
and Dewar's Scotch," Hunter said. "They'll be the only people who could afford 
to advertise." 
</P>
<P>
 The city receives a minimum permit fee of $6 per bench for the use of its 
sidewalks, earning about $4,500 annually from the bench companies. Gannett pays 
the city a licensing fee of more than $92,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council also unanimously agreed that the city should join 
Garden Grove, Stanton and Los Alamitos in an alliance of North County cities 
that want to build a commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
after its scheduled closure in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 By joining the Orange County Regional Airport Authority, Anaheim officials are 
pushing their view that the county needs a second commercial airport and that 
El Toro should be the site. A majority of South County cities oppose that 
proposal, saying an airport would create noise and traffic nightmares in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials say they believe an airport on the site would boost the 
county's tourism industry and help businesses that rely on air freight to 
transport goods. Because of noise restrictions, John Wayne Airport bans cargo 
flights and has strict limits on the hours it can operate. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: ORANGE; STUDENTS STEP UP CULTURAL AWARENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the several hundred students who gathered around the courtyard at Chapman 
University's Argyros Forum on Tuesday afternoon, the spirited lunchtime 
exhibition was a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a whole lot of steps. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the first campus performances of its kind, sisters from the Delta 
Sigma Theta sorority hopped, stomped and danced in unison, demonstrating an art 
form known as stepping. The intricate dance, with origins in African tribal 
dance, is popular primarily with African American college students in 
fraternities and sororities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's stepping program kicks off a monthlong observance of Black History 
Month at the local university. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of students here are from diverse cultures," said Kendra Jones, a 
university student activities coordinator. "We want to show them this is one 
aspect of black culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, where about 4% of its 2,500 undergraduates are African American, has 
no black fraternities or sororities. The four sisters who performed Tuesday are 
from a Delta Sigma Theta chapter based at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassandra Smith, 22, who is in the sorority but attends Chapman University, 
said she hopes the step exhibition will help encourage the creation of a black 
Greek organization on campus. Smith, a senior chemistry and biology major, said 
the sorority sisters practiced the five-minute dance routine she choreographed 
for about 10 days before Tuesday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," said Smith. "It enhances our camaraderie and for students of 
different ethnic groups, it informs them about black sororities." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the students enjoying the show Tuesday afternoon, the step 
performance was definitely something new. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never seen anything like that before," said Adam Riffe, 20, a junior 
accounting major. "It was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Varghese, a freshman majoring in political science, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs like this "teach us to be more accepting, which is good since that's 
what it's going to be like in the real world," said the 18-year-old, who is in 
Chapman's Alpha Phi sorority. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating Black History Month at Chapman is part of a larger university 
effort to strengthen campus ties among students of different racial and ethnic 
groups, say campus administrators. Similar programs celebrating the 
contributions of Asians, Latinos and women are planned later this year. MARTIN 
MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: LA HABRA; EATERY DENIED PERMIT FOR ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed with residents and refused to grant an 
entertainment permit to Casa Carillo restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, numerous residents have complained about noise, 
loitering, littering, public urination, graffiti and inadequate parking.They 
presented a petition signed by 143 people, urging the council to deny owner 
Jose Carillo's request for an entertainment permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit would have allowed Carillo to hire bands to play dance music, as he 
did on weekends from 8 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. in 1992. Because of residents' 
complaints, however, the council revoked Carillo's permit last year, and the 
restaurant has been closed since. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should give us a chance," Carillo pleaded with the council. "If we don't 
have music, our place is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Carillo said past problems have been rectified, but that next time he applies 
for a permit, which will be soon, he will also offer to hire four security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members suggested that the loud and popular Banda music Carillo 
proposed be replaced with softer mariachi music, which does not require 
amplification. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had something like that, I would consider" the permit, Councilman Juan 
M. Garcia told Carillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William D. Mahoney said some of Carillo's customers had been found 
drinking alcohol outside the restaurant, loitering in the adjacent neighborhood 
and urinating.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: COSTA MESA; MESA VERDE 
LIBRARY TO GET ROOF REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mesa Verde Library's leaky roof held up under strong rains Monday, and 
could be repaired on Friday when the library is closed, said branch Manager 
Gladys Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously this week to pay for emergency roof 
repairs, estimated to cost between $24,000 and $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A leak was discovered two weeks ago when a patron pulled a soggy technical 
book off the reference shelf. Library staff later found that more than a dozen 
books, all out of print, had been destroyed by water, Lorenzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers placed a temporary patch on the roof and covered bookshelves with 
plastic. "It's been holding, but we're not going to take the plastic off," 
Lorenzo said. "I hope it gets done before we get another big leak." 
</P>
<P>
 The library, at 2969 Mesa Verde Drive East, is operated by the county, 
although the city owns and maintains the buildings. Lorenzo said about 500 
people use the library each day, and more than 10,000 books are checked out 
from the library each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The library had to reduce its operation last July from 59 hours weekly to 29 
hours weekly because of county budget cuts. WILLSON CUMMER

ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE'S FOES RAISE QUESTIONS; ELECTION: BUT DEMOCRAT TED R. MORENO 
DOWNPLAYS HIS LINK TO REPUBLICAN REP. JAY C. KIM, WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The race for Orange County's 69th Assembly District seat has barely begun, but 
already some local Democrats say Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno has 
stumbled out of the starting blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, local politicos have wondered aloud about the 26-year-old 
Democrat's role in the 1992 congressional campaign of Rep. Jay C. Kim, the 
Diamond Bar Republican under federal investigation for alleged violations of 
campaign, labor and tax laws. Democrats are grumbling simply because Moreno 
worked for a GOP candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's campaign manager recently quit after learning of Moreno's involvement 
with Kim. And some within the party question Moreno's chances because two other 
Latino candidates could splinter his support in Santa Ana's ethnically diverse 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the first-term councilman has collected about $24,000 in campaign 
contributions, a fraction of what will be needed to capture the hotly contested 
central county district, which includes parts of Santa Ana, Anaheim and Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not that serious a candidate," said Dan Wooldridge, a Costa Mesa-based 
political consultant and a Democrat. "Clearly, Ted has a long ways to go in 
terms of his fund raising and his record. A lot of questions are being raised 
about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Some go even further. George Urch, chief of staff for Assemblyman Tom Umberg, 
the Garden Grove Democrat who is vacating the 69th-District seat to run for 
state attorney general, bluntly suggested Moreno ought to pull out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a good kid who's a little bit over his head and a little naive," 
Urch said. "If Ted was smart, he'd fold the tent on this puppy, pack it up and 
take care of these problems with the Kim campaign, gain some experience on the 
council and then maybe run in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, however, remains undeterred, saying he has no intention of being 
forced out of the Assembly race by critics. Moreno suggested he is being 
targeted because foes see him as the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was not the top contender in this race, they wouldn't care about that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno also downplayed criticism from fellow Democrats for his role in Kim's 
Republican campaign. He said he briefly helped Kim in early 1992 as a favor to 
a friend who managed the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big deal. How else are we supposed to solve the problems of California if we 
can't get along with Republicans?" Moreno said, adding that he has not been 
contacted or questioned by the FBI about his involvement in the Kim campaign. 
"There's nothing there. They are trying to make an issue out of nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 As Moreno sees it, he is experiencing the same sort of opposition he weathered 
during his quest for City Council in 1992. Despite opposition from Santa Ana 
Mayor Dan Young and other well-entrenched politicians, Moreno managed to win a 
council seat. And he says he will fight to the end for the Assembly: "I am 
going to work the hardest of anybody."  
</P>
<P>
 For now, he will be working without a professional campaign manager. Jerry 
Seedborg, a Long Beach political consultant, was handling Moreno's campaign up 
until he learned last month that the candidate had been a bookkeeper in Kim's 
campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 "He very well may have done nothing wrong. I just didn't want to be involved 
with him after learning about that," Seedborg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all Democrats have given up on Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone told him not to run for City Council, and he worked his butt off and 
won," said John Hanna, a Santa Ana attorney and former Orange County Democratic 
chairman. "The guy is motivated, he's a hard worker and he feels he can 
overcome this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorianne Garcia, Orange County Democratic chairwoman, said Moreno has "a step 
up" on the other contenders because he holds public office. "It remains to be 
seen whether he's made up of the stuff that's needed to get elected," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said his chief obstacle right now is critics such as Urch, who has made 
no secret of his support for Mike Metzler, the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce 
president who also is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 69th Assembly 
District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Urch, however, suggested that Moreno has no idea what he faces in a race 
against the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's dreaming if he thinks he has half a chance in this race," Urch said. 
"He's never been involved in a partisan race where the Republicans spend $1 
million to defeat you and go through your background to find out if you swore 
at your first-grade teacher so they can use it against you. They'll nail him on 
this Kim thing."

UMBERG PLANS RUN FOR STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; POLITICS: DEMOCRAT'S ANNOUNCEMENT 
LEAVES THE RACE OPEN FOR HIS ASSEMBLY POST. NINE CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN OUT 
PAPERS FOR THE 69TH DISTRICT SEAT.

<P>
 Preparing for what many believe to be an uphill battle, Orange County's only 
Democrat in the state Legislature, Assemblyman Tom Umberg, officially declared 
his intent to run for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Grove Democrat paid his filing fee Tuesday and next week will 
formally kick off his campaign to unseat Republican state Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's entry into the statewide race officially opens up the 69th state 
Assembly seat, which already has drawn interest from a pack of Democrats and 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Republicans hoping to replace Umberg tried Tuesday to become the 
first Orange County candidate running for a major partisan office to collect 
enough signatures instead of paying the filing fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgel L. Nickell, 51, of Santa Ana entered the race by submitting to the 
county registrar of voters 1,750 signatures of Republican voters within the 
district instead of paying the $525 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, county officials found that Nickell had submitted enough valid 
signatures to meet the 1,500 minimum requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We verified (the signatures) up to the required amount," said Beverly Warner, 
election section supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Tanney, registrar of voters, said, "I'm not aware of any major party 
assembly candidate qualifying by signatures in lieu of a filing fee," a 
provision that came as a result of a 1976 court action. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some minor parties without adequate funding may have submitted 
petitions instead of paying the fee in the past, Tanney said, adding that 
records tabulating this go back to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the deadline for candidates for the state Legislature, judicial 
posts, state constitutional offices or insurance commissioner to file their 
declarations of intention to run. If the incumbents do not seek reelection, 
candidates have until Monday to file papers for those seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, 38, a former federal prosecutor and three-year assemblyman, is not 
only taking on a Republican incumbent, but is expected to face a tough fight in 
the June 7 primary against San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, who narrowly 
lost to Lungren in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, Umberg downplayed the odds, claiming that coming out of the 
starting gate, he has more in his campaign fund than Smith: $298,000 in his 
account, compared to Smith's $36,000 "cash on hand." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not doing it to finish second," said Umberg, who sees himself as the 
best candidate to challenge Lungren in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, I think it's a campaign, but we will win the campaign," Umberg 
added. "I think people are looking for something other than the same way we 
have been doing it for the last 10, 20, 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 His departure from the state Assembly creates political peril for the local 
Democratic Party, which faces an intra-party battle for the seat while fighting 
off the Republican Party's attempts to recapture the only legislative seat now 
held by a Democrat. Democrats make up 53% of the registered voters in the 69th 
Assembly District and Republicans 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, nine candidates had taken out papers for the Assembly race, 
with five already filing their fees or signatures from registered voters. They 
include two Democrats, Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno and Santa Ana Chamber 
of Commerce President Michael Metzler, who was encouraged by Umberg to run; two 
Republicans, Jim Morrissey of Anaheim, who formed the Republican Small Business 
Assn., and Nickell; and Libertarian candidate George Reis of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican field is expected to widen. Santa Ana school board member 
Rosemarie I. Avila took out candidate papers, and Costa Mesa attorney Martin 
Ageson, a longtime Republican Party activist, is expected to formally announce 
his candidacy this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to potential supporters, Ageson said he is running because 
the first two Republican candidates have not succeeded "in attracting much 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to get (the Republican Party establishment's) backing," Ageson said 
Tuesday, "but I was not asked to do this. This is my idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell, meanwhile, positioned himself as the Republican candidate with 
community support. 
</P>
<P>
 "This number of signatures should amply demonstrate that I have the 
grass-roots Republican support in this district to win in June and go on to win 
in November," Nickell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickell, a Vietnam naval veteran and assistant to the executive director of 
Veterans' Charities of Orange County, said he wants the voters, not money, to 
get him on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes candidates . . . are sponsored by some other legislator (so) 
extensively that the ties are too close. I consider myself very much a maverick 
-- I'm a people candidate."

AIR QUALITY TASK FORCE WILL EXAMINE CAR-POOL STRATEGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A task force will examine options and alternatives to Southern California's 
car-pooling regulations to find new ways of removing solo drivers from the 
roads and ease the burden of compliance on businesses, an Orange County air 
quality official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry W. Wedaa, chairman of the governing board of the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, said he wants to convene the first meeting of the newly 
formed task force later this month. Two of the three task force members have 
backgrounds in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa, a Yorba Linda city councilman who represents Orange County cities on 
the board, called for the group to look into three areas: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reducing the cost and time required for businesses to comply with 
regulations; 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing a menu of options for businesses to meet state and federal laws 
that would curb solo driving; 
</P>
<P>
 * Suggesting how current laws might be changed, or new ones proposed, to help 
achieve ride-sharing goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa has been on the AQMD board for six years but has come under fire 
recently for his strong stances on protecting air quality. Although supporters 
praise his willingness to deter businesses from polluting, opponents -- 
especially conservatives -- say he is overzealous and harmful to industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been the subject of several heated arguments recently at local 
California League of Cities meetings. Under new state law, the mayors of Orange 
County cities must vote to either reelect or replace Wedaa as an AQMD board 
member by March 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa will lead the task force but has appointed three vice chairmen from the 
private sector to oversee the review of each area. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointees, Wedaa said, are Hugh Hewitt, an Irvine attorney, commentator 
and frequent critic of the AQMD; Bruce Nestande, a former state assemblyman and 
former Orange County supervisor; and Robert Wyman, an attorney with Latham & 
Watkins in Los Angeles and chairman of the Regulatory Flexibility Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman will head a study on current regulations, Hewitt will examine 
alternatives and Nestande will oversee legislative remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD's ride-sharing rule adopted six years ago, companies in Orange, 
Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties with more than 100 employees 
must set up programs that encourage employees to car pool, take mass transit or 
use other means to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule has been unpopular because thousands of offices and other 
non-industrial businesses must spend large sums of money to create elaborate 
ride-sharing strategies.

POLICE ARE SEEKING SOURCE OF RACIST FLYERS AT 2 SCHOOLS; BIAS: ABOUT 500 
HANDBILLS DENIGRATING LATINOS AND URGING THEIR DEPORTATION ARE FOUND IN LOCKERS 
AT COSTA MESA AND CORONA DEL MAR HIGHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police are trying to learn who tucked several hundred racist flyers into 
student lockers at two local high schools, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 flyers that denigrated Latinos and called for their deportation were 
found at Costa Mesa and Corona del Mar high schools Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloyde McKinley (Mac) Bernd, superintendent of the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District, said he suspects outsiders were responsible. The flyers list a phone 
number in the 818 area code. 
</P>
<P>
 A recording at the number gives a post office box in Covina for WAR, or White 
Aryan Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the flyers as "just the worst kind of derogatory, inflammatory 
rhetoric," Bernd promised that once the distributors are found, they will be 
punished -- with expulsion if they are Newport-Mesa students and with criminal 
prosecution if possible. Bernd said it would have been fairly easy for 
non-students to stuff the flyers into the lockers, which are located outside on 
the village-style campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers, Bernd said, are "disgusting hate propaganda that nobody around 
here has the slightest bit of interest in." 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously if you're an Hispanic student or a student who is new to this 
country and you're confronted with something like this, I think you become very 
confused and you wonder how anyone could put out this filth," Bernd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said the flyers were "basically a lot of 
sick stuff." His department is working with Costa Mesa police and the school 
district to investigate the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Alvarado, a counselor who works with gang members and youths at risk of 
joining gangs, said several students brought copies of the flyer into his 
counseling session at Costa Mesa High on Monday and discussed the matter 
animatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just ran the gamut from angry and confused to scared and upset," 
Alvarado said. "I think mostly they were confused. So I gave them an 
opportunity to vent -- you make them angry and let them get rid of that anger, 
before they go back into the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward H. Decker, Newport-Mesa school board president, said Tuesday, "If you 
are Latino, that is a relatively disturbing thing to find in your locker on a 
Monday morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos make up about 29% of the students attending schools in the district, 
according to the Orange County Department of Education.  
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar Principal Tom Jacobson said his school holds assemblies and 
activities to promote good ethnic and racial relations. A local group that 
fosters racial understanding has approached Jacobson about the possibility of 
posting flyers at the school to encourage appreciation of diversity, to combat 
the message of Monday's flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Kennedy, director of the county's Human Relations Commission, said 
people find hate literature on various local school campuses several times each 
year. Flyers like those distributed in Costa Mesa and Corona del Mar this week 
were discovered at Laguna Beach High School and a San Juan Capistrano middle 
school last month, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hostile anti-Hispanic stuff," Kennedy said. "We've seen the same 
kinds of blatant hate literature in high schools and middle schools around the 
county in the past -- and not just here but all around the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Students at high schools in Agoura Hills, San Fernando and Santa Clarita in 
northern Los Angeles County have also found flyers in their lockers in the last 
few months.

DELAYED TALL SHIP IS EXPECTED TO DOCK AT DANA POINT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fierce winds that buffeted the Southland have delayed the appearance of a 
replica of an 18th-Century trading vessel in the Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 On both Monday and Tuesday, the Lady Washington was on the open sea heading 
toward Orange County from San Diego, only to be turned back by strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 112-foot tall ship is expected to set out again for Dana Point, and 
Orange County Marine Institute officials hope the Lady Washington will dock at 
their mooring sometime after noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the heavy winds and high seas, they decided it was the better part of 
valor to return back to San Diego," said Dan Stetson, assistant executive 
director of the marine institute. "If the weather holds, we hope to see her in 
here sometime during the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lady Washington is a full-size replica of the first colonial American ship 
to reach the West Coast in 1788. It will be met off the coast of Dana Point by 
the Californian, a replica of a 19th-Century trading vessel, before docking at 
the marine institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally docked at Grays Harbor Historical Seaport in Aberdeen, Wash., the 
Lady Washington can be viewed the next two weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the Orange County Marine Institute at (714) 
496-2274.

SPUTTERING PUTTER; WATSON'S SHAKY OLD FRIEND COSTS HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Tom Watson found himself in a greenside bunker Tuesday during a practice round 
at Riviera Country Club, site of the $1-million Nissan Los Angeles Open that 
gets under way Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He holed out from 60 feet, prompting his caddie, Bruce Edwards, to say: " Now 
you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one hole too late for such a dramatic shot. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been nice to have won with this kind of flair last Sunday, but 
bunkers weren't his main obstacle in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. It was a 
different problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson had put himself in position to win with some excellent ball-striking 
and fine putting for most of the 72 holes over the three Monterey Peninsula 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the right guy on the ropes -- Johnny Miller, a 46-year-old player who 
rarely practiced and was more comfortable working in a TV tower. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the right course -- Pebble Beach, site of his 1982 U.S. Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
 And he had a one-stroke lead with three holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had the wrong club in his hands. His untrusty putter. 
</P>
<P>
 The putter that won him five British Opens, two Masters and one U.S. Open 
couldn't get anything right on the last three greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson three-putted from 10 feet at the 16th, three-putted the 17th and left 
an eight-footbirdie putt short on the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it was disappointing," Watson admitted. "It was a setback, throwing it 
away like Idid." 
</P>
<P>
 But more surprising than throwing it away was that Johnny Miller was there to 
pick up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was surprising," Watson said, "but you have to remember something. Johnny 
Miller has always had tremendous talent. He knows how to play Pebble Beach and 
there was no reason for him to be nervous. He had nothing to lose. He was there 
to have fun and he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, if it had come down to a Watson-Miller playoff, Watson would have had 
every reason to feel confident. He has won twice in playoffs with Miller, the 
last time in 1982 in the L.A. Open at Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 That tournament was similar to Pebble Beach, except that it was Miller who 
lost a two-stroke lead in the last three holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Johnny making a tactical mistake at the 17th hole," Watson said. 
"He was trying to get close to the (par-five) hole with his third shot, but his 
ball didn't hold and he wound up in the fringe above the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was unable to get down in two to save par, and when he three-putted the 
18th for abogey, it opened the door for Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson had to make a four-foot par on the final hole to send it into a 
playoff. During the playoff, Watson stayed alive by making an eight-foot putt 
at the 15th, then got up and down from a bunker at the 16th. He won it with a 
45-foot birdie putt at the 17th. 
</P>
<P>
 It was vintage Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what makes last week's loss so hard to swallow. The old Watson would 
have run the table over the last three holes and won going away. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was very uncharacteristic of him," said Edwards, who was also Watson's 
caddie during his glory years in the late 1970s and early '80s. "He was making 
a lot of putts last week. That's how he got to be in that position in the first 
place. But that's OK. At least we can see the light up ahead now." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long time since Watson has seen any light. His last victory came 
in 1987 when he won the Nabisco Championship, ending a three-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he hasn't finished higher than 39th on the money list in the past 
seven years, Watson did see some improvement in his play last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He tied for fifth in the U.S. Open at Baltusrol and was fifth in the PGA 
Championship, the only major that has eluded him, at the Inverness Club in 
Toledo, Ohio. Last March, he closed with a 68-69 to finish 10th in the Players 
Championship at Ponte Vedra, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball-striking has been there for a while," Watson said. "I'm not worried 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson has been striking the ball so well, he said last week that he was 
certain he was going to win a tournament this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson considers Riviera a ball-striker's course, and that's what he is doing 
well right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "You also have to make some putts," he said, "but before you make them, you 
have to put yourself in position." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said he learned something from last week's experience at Pebble Beach: 
"I didn't handle (the pressure) too well on the last three holes. I will handle 
it better next time." 
</P>
<P>
 He has one other thing going for him this week: Johnny Miller will be in the 
NBC booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Sutton, who won the 1983 PGA Championship at Riviera, said the course 
brings back pleasant memories. But Sutton, who hasn't won since the Memorial in 
1986, is having trouble now with his driving. "I don't care what anybody says, 
if you can't drive the ball, you can't win," he said. Sutton pointed to PGA 
Tour statistics that showed him to be one of the most consistent tee-to-green 
players through most of his career. "For 11 years, I was always in the top 20, 
maybe even the top 10," he said. Over the past two years, he has dropped out of 
the top 100. He blames it on his driving, which was short (256-yard average) 
and off-line (64.8%, ranked 150th). Sutton has been working on some swing 
changes and feels good about the progress he has made. . . . The pro-amateur 
will be held today, with the tournament's first round set for Thursday. Tee-off 
times begin at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Chip Beck won his second consecutive Merrill Lynch Shootout Tuesday with a par 
on the final hole to beat Phil Mickelson, who made a bogey. The victory was 
worth $5,000 . . . Earlier in the day, Beck was on hand to present Cindy Park 
with a $12,500 Chip Beck Scholarship. Funding for the scholarship program came 
from the $1-million bonus he received for shooting a record-tying 59 in the 
1991 Las Vegas Invitational. The scholarship is designed to assist caddies in 
obtaining a college education. Park, a sophomore at Loyola Marymount, caddied 
for Beck during the Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it rained heavily Monday night, the course was in excellent condition 
Tuesday, and the greens, which were rebuilt last summer, stood up well under 
their first test from professionals. . . . "I wish we could have had more 
time," said Ben Crenshaw, who helped to replicate the greens and bunkers to 
their original specifications. "It was fascinating work, and everything was 
done to get every little break perfect. That's one of the things about the 
greens at Riviera. They're so tough to read because of all the subtle breaks, 
and from listening to what others have had to say, I think we did a pretty good 
job."

COUNTDOWN TO THE WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER '94; BODINE IS THE LATEST TO 
GIVE SHIMER A PUSH; BOBSLED: NASCAR RACER'S EFFORTS GIVE U.S. A SHOT AT A 
MEDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time, before and during the 1992 Winter Olympics, when Brian 
Shimer became known as the driver to the stars -- Herschel Walker, Willie Gault 
and Edwin Moses. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer could never be sure who was in his lineup as the U.S. Bobsled 
Federation campaigned for stronger, swifter and more illustrious athletes to 
help attract sponsors and propel Shimer down the hill faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, push came to shove: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moses stormed out in a controversy over selection procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gault failed to qualify in final '92 push trials. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walker joined Shimer in USA I at the Winter Games in Albertville, France, 
but his inexperience contributed to a seventh-place finish, and he was benched 
for the four-man event, in which a U.S. team driven by Randy Will finished 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer, 31, a Floridian who played football at Morehead State, approaches 
these Games as driver of USA I in both the two-man and four-man events. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, Gault and Moses are gone. Shimer has basically operated with the same 
pushers and brakemen for two seasons, experiencing unprecedented success in the 
winter of 1992-93 and major disappointment this season while preparing for 
Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has not won an Olympic medal in bobsled since 1956, and it 
is impossible to measure Shimer's chances off the disparity of the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The only certainty is that much of the attention will continue to focus on the 
sled itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since '56, the United States will use U.S.-made sleds -- 
courtesy, for the most part, of NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine, who became 
interested while watching the Albertville Games on television and has since 
spent $130,000 to seed development and production of six Bo-Dyn sleds and 
stimulate interest in what is known as the Bobsled Project, raising $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Win or lose (in the Winter Olympics), the project is a success," Bodine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Translated: U.S. sledders, often operating in the past with European 
hand-me-downs or incurring years of debt to buy their own German- or 
Italian-made models -- Shimer spent $20,000 on a two-man sled -- will not have 
to shop elsewhere or shop, period. The financial foundation should enable them 
to drive in the comparative lap of luxury, with the best of U.S. technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ridiculous, depressing," Bodine said of a situation in which U.S. 
Olympians were often sent out with second-rate equipment and the pressure of a 
second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 He was exposed to it after the '92 Games, during which he kept thinking that 
he could do a better driving job than the ones he was seeing on TV. He went to 
Lake Placid, N.Y., to prove it and, he said, "scared myself to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of more than $7 million on the NASCAR circuit, Bodine started from 
halfway down the hill and ultimately left a sled borrowed from driver Bruce 
Rosselli resembling the sourest lemon on a used-car lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked to find that it was kind of a piece of junk to start with, but 
I told Bruce I'd build him a new one," Bodine said. "I'm sure he didn't believe 
me. I know they'd all heard it before." 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with Bob Cuneo at Chassis Dynamics in Oxford, Conn., where 
Bodine had built some of his race cars, Bodine proved to be a man of his word 
and wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 The sleds, incorporating the latest in computer technology and ongoing input 
from the sledders themselves, have been delivered with a pit crew and IBM 
support team, freeing the athletes from the often time-consuming 
before-and-after dirty work. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shimer: "I'll take the ice at 90 m.p.h. anytime. It's the three or four 
hours working on the sled after a full day of training that wears you down."  
</P>
<P>
 The first Bo-Dyn was scheduled to make its debut in a World Cup race last Feb. 
24. Test runs convinced Shimer, "It was the difference between a Yugo and 
Porsche," but it was disqualified for technical reasons by the 
European-dominated International Rules Committee before the races. Cuneo made 
the required changes, and the sled passed inspection in July, when Shimer 
unofficially blistered the Lillehammer track record in the World Cup tour 
trials, enhancing Olympic optimism and the euphoria generated by Shimer's World 
Cup championship of the previous winter. 
</P>
<P>
 That euphoria, however, soon began to deflate. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer and two-man partner Randy Jones, a former Duke football captain, 
finished no better than seventh in four World Cup races, and his four-man team 
of Jones, former Iowa track all-American Karlos Kirby and former Indiana State 
hurdler Bryan Leturgez finished no better than 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 The desultory performance by the entire U.S. team during almost two months in 
Europe prompted the federation to rework the January schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of returning to Europe for the last of five World Cup races and 
remaining there to conduct U.S. Olympic trials and final preparations, the team 
has spent the last four weeks in trials and training at the 1988 Olympic 
facilities in Calgary, Canada, where there has been a rebirth of optimism amid 
significantly improving start times plus a fresh physical and mental outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that we're back where we were at the start of last season," Shimer 
said, referring to his World Cup championship campaign. "Hopefully, we'll 
continue to progress now. I feel better about our situation. We still have time 
to get to where we want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic two-man competition doesn't begin until Feb. 19. Shimer said there 
has been considerable improvement since early December, when he questioned the 
dedication and desire of his teammates in an interview with The Times. Then, he 
suggested that they were riding the World Cup success of the previous winter, 
seemingly satisfied merely to go to the Olympics instead of working hard toward 
winning a medal, a view endorsed at that time by Coach Joey Kilburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset, and justifiably so," the intense Shimer said. "The attitude is 
better now, but the focus should have been there from the start. Of course, 
there were a lot of distractions, and that contributed to it. The way the World 
Cup schedule was this (season), we were really burnt out by the time we got 
back from Europe. We hadn't eaten well, slept well or been able to train well, 
we were over there so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer was also troubled by a leg injury that affected start times throughout 
the season and ultimately prompted him to bring in a neuromuscular specialist 
to maximize his training during January's Calgary encampment. Then, too, there 
was the debut of the Bo-Dyns, which reacted differently to the different 
conditions of different courses, requiring mid-competition adjustment and an 
ongoing process of fine tuning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was recently decided, in fact, that the Bo-Dyn sleds to be driven here by 
Shimer and Jim Herberich will use the footing and axle from federation-owned 
Italian sleds because they were found to be more flexible than the original 
Bo-Dyn steel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drawback (to the sleds) is that we haven't had enough time to do as much 
research as we would have liked, but (the developers and crew) have worked 
great under pressure," Shimer said. "They've been receptive to every 
suggestion. I mean, in 1988 the federation probably blew a million dollars 
hiring scientists to build a new sled, but they never talked with the athletes. 
It was amazing the thing even went down hill. If these sleds aren't faster than 
what we've been using, it can't be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodine was told it couldn't be done when he first proposed his project. He was 
told about the hours and money wasted on previous projects and received little 
encouragement from the U.S. Olympic Committee or the U.S. Bobsled Federation, 
whose executive director, Matt Roy, now says the sleds have become "a rallying 
force." 
</P>
<P>
 "People told us we were nuts," Bodine said. "Now I travel around the country 
and am overwhelmed by the interest. I couldn't be prouder. 
</P>
<P>
 "As racers, we know it should be impossible to walk in and beat a country 
that's been building sleds or cars forever, but that's where we are (with the 
bobsled project) in less than two years. We have a chance, and that makes it 
even more special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I always wanted to be an Olympic athlete but was too small and too 
slow, so that to feel now like I'm part of it, to have done something for the 
country, that everyone seems to have gotten behind, is a real honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodine will be driving at Daytona Beach, Fla., when the American-made sleds 
carrying his name race on the Olympic track at Hunderfossen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third Winter Olympics for Shimer, who said he probably would be 
teaching industrial arts and coaching high school wrestling and football if he 
hadn't responded to a federation letter seeking a few good men years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 How did a Floridian -- there is now the incongruity of a hometown Naples 
Bobsled Club to help raise funds and cover his debts -- take to the snow, ice 
and daunting challenge of a bobsled run? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that I had ever considered myself a daredevil, but I liked the 
speed and challenge," Shimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A pattern of controversy and corruption has plagued the U.S. Bobsled 
Federation's pursuit of the ultimate dream, a return to the Olympic medal 
stand. Walker, Moses and Gault represented $250,000 to the federation in a 
sponsorship deal with McDonald's, but when all three failed to make the team, 
McDonald's patriotic gesture was to cut its contribution to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation eventually decided it couldn't run athletes in on a whim, that 
continuity and training were critical. Now a U.S. bobsledder must compete on 
the World Cup circuit to be eligible for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Herschel had made bobsledding his No. 1 sport, he probably would have 
become the best pusher in the world, but we didn't have even one race together 
prior to the ('92) Olympics," Shimer said. "It was assumed we'd have the 
fastest start in the world, but it didn't happen because it comes down to 
technique and timing. It's like running me into the Super Bowl. You can't just 
climb into a sled and be the fastest down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had superior athletes to the Europeans, but they produce the 
better starts because they stay together and work on it for years at a time. 
This has been the first time in my eight years that the same team has trained 
together for more than a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer remains confident that this continuity will produce a medal. If so, 
Geoff Bodine will have to be looked upon as an equally driving force.

HUSKIES' SUIT CHALLENGES PAC-10 FOOTBALL PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most University of Washington football fans, Ron Neubauer thinks his 
beloved Huskies got a raw deal when they were banned from bowls for two years 
by the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have to do is read the penalties meted out to Syracuse, Auburn, Texas 
A&M and UNLV," he said, citing several infractions cases recently processed by 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the old argument: The punishment doesn't fit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Neubauer isn't just blowing smoke when he says the Pac-10 was way out of 
line. A Seattle attorney who has done legal work for Husky coaches and players, 
he is hoping to make his case in front of a jury in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Neubauer is representing a variety of plaintiffs, including five Washington 
football players, who have filed a class-action suit against the Pac-10 in U.S. 
District Court in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Dec. 15, stems from the conference's ruling last August that 
the Huskies would be prohibited from appearing in bowls after the 1993 and '94 
seasons as a result of NCAA rules violations. The ruling so angered Washington 
Coach Don James that he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the suit's claims is the contention that the conference's 
investigation of the Washington program violated the due process rights of 
Husky players. The suit seeks an injunction lifting the sanctions against the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 is the only major conference that investigates and rules on 
infractions cases. The Washington suit marks the first time that a Pac-10 
infractions case has been challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a trial date has been set for Oct. 3, Pac-10 officials believe the 
suit lacks legal standing and will be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think it will go (to trial)," said Tom Hansen, Pac-10 commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the suit is clearly an irritant for the conference, reviving a touchy 
situation that coaches and administrators -- including those at Washington -- 
believed had been put to rest months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "What bothers me," said Chris Burford, Pac-10 legal counsel, "is the waste of 
money and resources for all involved. (The suit) kind of keeps this thing 
rolling around when half the penalties are already over." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference's legal fees, which could reach more than $100,000, will come 
from football and basketball television revenue that would otherwise have been 
distributed to the 10 conference schools, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger issue, in Hansen's view, is one of perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (the suit) impacts the conference particularly, but I 
definitely think it impacts the University of Washington," he said. "One of the 
reasons why the conference members want the conference to conduct this 
(enforcement) program is because we can close these cases down as quickly as 
possible, get our problems resolved or eliminated . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Now, because of this (lawsuit), the (Washington) case has a continuing public 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 When the suit was filed, the school noted its opposition in a two-sentence 
statement by James Collier, vice president for university relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The University of Washington is not a party to the lawsuit . . . nor does the 
university support it," Collier said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Times, in an editorial, later urged the university to take a 
stronger stand against the suit, which the newspaper described as "misguided" 
and "specious." 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial stated: "The Pac-10 didn't make an improper loan to former 
(Husky) quarterback Billy Joe Hobert. It did not give jobs to athletes and 
expect no work. Overzealous boosters were the villains. They are the ones who 
fouled up the program." 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources within the university and the conference, Washington 
officials, while strongly opposed to the suit, have taken a relatively low-key 
approach because of the involvement of the five players, all of whom have 
eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as plaintiffs are guard Frank Garcia, running back Jovan McCoy, 
linebacker Jaime Weindl and defensive backs Russell Hairston and Kyle Roberts. 
Also named as plaintiffs are two businesses that sell Husky merchandise, and a 
Washington season-ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy told the Seattle Times that most Husky players support the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the final count at the (team) banquet," he said. "Russell (Hairston) 
took the (vote). If the majority of the players said no, we weren't going to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neubauer is no stranger to the Pac-10 enforcement process. He was drawn into 
the Washington inquiry through his representation of Seattle businessman Herb 
Mead, a prominent Husky booster and key figure in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Neubauer said he became involved in the lawsuit when "concerned parents" of 
Husky players came to him for advice. "This has absolutely nothing to do with 
the boosters," he said. "The genesis of this case came from parents of players 
-- present players -- including the parents of some of the five (bringing the 
suit)." 
</P>
<P>
 Neubauer declined to identify the players whose parents approached him. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his fees, he said he and his co-counsel, Henry Jameson, took the case 
strictly on a contingency basis. "We think we're going to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the lawsuit is a compilation of many of the issues that 
inflamed Washington supporters when the sanctions were announced last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit states that Pac-10 administrators and chief executive officers, who 
have the final say in infractions matters, cannot discipline conference members 
"without both the appearance and the reality of prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also claims that the Pac-10 has no rules governing its investigations 
and did not adhere to guidelines governing NCAA investigations in its handling 
of the Washington case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, Pac-10 investigator David Price "made no pretense of 
impartiality," openly stating that he believed allegations of impropriety 
reported by The Los Angeles Times to be true and that he intended to prove 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, Pac-10 associate commissioner, would not comment except to say: "I've 
taken the position that this is in the hands of the lawyers. The (enforcement) 
process was fair, and we'll vigorously defend it." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference is expected to file a motion for dismissal today on grounds 
that the plaintiffs have no standing without the involvement of the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Van Kampen, a Seattle attorney representing the Pac-10 in the matter, cited 
several cases in which courts have ruled against athletes who brought suits as 
a result of NCAA sanctions against their schools. "The courts, as a rule, do 
not interfere (with NCAA infractions rulings)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A ruling on the conference's motion could come next month, Van Kampen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ron Neubauer readies for a fight. He expects to tell a jury how the 
Pac-10 enforcement process went awry last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very fortunate and happy that the judge gave us an Oct. 3 trial 
date," he said. "That gives us a chance to get this thing to trial and get it 
determined before the end of next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw where Price or Hansen -- one of those guys -- said there's a cloud 
hanging over the university because of this lawsuit. Well, we feel the cloud is 
hanging over the Pac-10."

IT SIMPLY TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH; RACIAL INCIDENT HELPS TURN KENNEDY INTO MORE 
THAN ANOTHER LUGE RACER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here he is, coming up to the Winter Olympics with a legitimate chance to be 
the first American to win a medal in luge, and he is still questioned more 
about race relations than race results. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan Kennedy turns that phrase with the same ease that he believes he has 
turned a corner on his passive and disappointing performances in the 1988 and 
1992 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Having placed second overall in the six-race World Cup series -- after 
finishing third last winter and second the winter before -- Kennedy has proven 
again that he belongs with the sport's elite and will put his back to the 
Norwegian wall of ice, he maintains, with a confidence and aggressiveness 
missing in his two previous Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fly or die," is his motto. 
</P>
<P>
 Bold for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to cheat myself," he said. "I'd rather risk a mistake or crash 
than play it safe again. There's nothing to be gained by being apprehensive. I 
was too timid the last time (when his 10th place at Albertville, France, was 
the highest ever for a U.S. man but a significant disappointment considering he 
was ranked second in the world). 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected to medal and was too cautious. Maybe I was overwhelmed, but I know 
my best races come when I'm aggressive and attack the course." 
</P>
<P>
 At 26, it has been 15 years since Kennedy was given a year or two to live by 
doctors who believed that he had an inoperable brain tumor and his mother took 
out a loan so that Kennedy, wearing an eye patch and walking awkwardly, could 
go to Europe and see his luge idols one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the kid who built luge runs in the back yard of his Lake Placid, N.Y., 
home has a flaming red, white and blue "U.S. luge" tattoo on his left biceps 
plus a surfing tattoo on his lower left leg, and maintains that his career has 
been a series of "little steps and ground-breakings," leading to his current 
confidence and aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 He disputes the big-bang theory of some that this confidence and 
aggressiveness were created in one burst last Oct. 29 when he confronted a 
group of about 15 skinheads taunting and threatening a black teammate, Robert 
Pipkins, in Oberhof, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never been in a fight, never been punched, but I've always had the 
nasty habit of standing up for what I believe in, so I don't think it was out 
of character," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does his mother, Betsy, who recalled that the youngest of her four 
sons would often see skinheads on "Geraldo" and other TV shows, and remark how 
they were "jerks and punks," meaning his "convictions became reality in 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy Kennedy also recalled a night in Pompano Beach, Fla., when she faced an 
armed robber demanding her purse and jewelry and had the temerity to warn this 
mugger that he'd better leave because she was going to scream. She did, he did 
-- and Betsy Kennedy jumped in her car in a futile attempt to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police gave me hell, but maybe there's some of that in Duncan's genes," 
she said. "Of course, it could be any of my boys. I've always told them not to 
let people push you around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The events of last October have made Kennedy an international celebrity of 
sorts, and he feels a responsibility to talk about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important enough issue for everyone to be concerned," he said of the 
skinheads. "Too many people don't take them seriously enough. Too many parents 
think it's just a phase, but these guys have gone beyond shaved heads. They're 
into weapons training and paramilitary operations and menacing people. They're 
a real threat. I don't even think of them as neo-Nazis because that softens who 
they are and what they are. They're Nazis, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Five members of the U.S. team in Oberhof had gone to a bar to celebrate the 
birthday of one. Gordy Sheer, who is Jewish and half of the best U.S. doubles 
team, noticed a swastika hanging in the bar and immediately went to his hotel 
room, barricading the door. Kennedy and Pipkins said they weren't concerned 
until the number of skinheads began to increase and they began to make monkey 
gestures and sounds directed at Pipkins, while shouting racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipkins, hobbling on a sore foot injured in a training accident, made his way 
up the stairs of the basement bar and back to his hotel room, under the 
impression that Kennedy was right behind him. Kennedy, however, said he was 
thinking that "Robert would definitely be killed," so he stopped in the doorway 
of the bar, giving Pipkins time to escape as the skinheads marched at Kennedy, 
chanting, "Heil Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," Kennedy said in reflection. "I couldn't believe that 
someone would have to run because of the color of their skin. I was hoping that 
with Robert gone, maybe they'd lose interest, but they kept coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was knocked to the ground in the bar's parking lot and kicked in the 
ribs, legs and face. He suffered a mild concussion, bruised ribs and battered 
nose. His teeth have only recently stopped hurting, and he still has a measure 
of trouble breathing through his nose, a significant problem in competition 
since he wears a visor that already makes it difficult to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why or how, but they let up long enough to let me get away," 
Kennedy said. He fled to his hotel room and called police, who asked him to 
return with them to the bar to make identifications. Now, however, he was 
confronted by twice as many skinheads and forced to take sanctuary in a locked 
police car. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, I wish I had swallowed my morals and ID'd all of them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy did identify three skinheads, two of whom went to trial in mid-January 
when he and the U.S. team returned to Oberhof under tight security for a World 
Cup event. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he was greeted by schoolchildren carrying flowers and apologetic 
townspeople expressing affection. He testified at the Jan. 17 trial, and the 
older of the two assailants was sentenced to 33 months in prison, while the 
younger, sentenced to one year, is free on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have to get beat up to make people aware of how serious and 
dangerous this problem is, and it's not just Germany," Kennedy said. "We see it 
everywhere, and too many people are still too quiet and too afraid to speak 
out. As something of a public figure, I feel I have a responsibility to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he also is strengthened by his role in the events but would have 
arrived at this level of confidence and aggressiveness without it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been second twice and third in the World Cup over the last three years," 
he said. "It's come down to me, (Germany's Georg) Hackl, (Austria's Marcus) 
Prock and Wendel (Suckow, a U.S. teammate), so I have to think I belong. I 
mean, we used to go to Europe knowing we couldn't compete, but now we know we 
can, and the Europeans know it, too. Now we get credit there for what we do, 
which is a real indication we belong. It took time, but we earned it. There was 
a long period when they just wouldn't acknowledge anything we accomplished. 
They regarded it as a fluke, and that was pretty upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining course through subtle use of centrifugal force and a delicate 
blend of passive aggressiveness, the luge driver hurtles down the ice chute at 
speeds up to 90 m.p.h., lying on his or her back while only inches above the 
refrigerated track. In the long winters of Lake Placid, Kennedy became hooked 
while serving as a gofer for ABC during the 1980 Winter Olympics there, and 
used the money he earned to buy his first sled. 
</P>
<P>
 "All kids think sleigh riding is pretty cool, and this is the ultimate sleigh 
ride," said Kennedy, nicknamed "Speed." "It was awesome, addictive. I had just 
turned 12 and I couldn't believe how exciting it was." 
</P>
<P>
 He won three national junior titles at 13, but his progress was retarded for a 
time after he awoke one morning violently sick, soon to experience double 
vision and partial paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors were unsure, but the best guess was a tumor. Kennedy was given a 
year or two at most. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give your son a death sentence and it's pretty traumatic," Betsy Kennedy 
said. "We weren't sure he'd see the fall colors again. The worst part was that 
it was kind of a diagnosis by exclusion. No one could say for certain what it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 In time, Kennedy's symptoms dissipated, the medical opinion turning to a 
dissolving blood clot. Kennedy and his mother had made that last-hurrah trip to 
Europe on borrowed money, but in retrospect, she said, it may have been the 
most profitable of many expenditures -- "the bank owns me," said Betsy Kennedy, 
who does computer graphics -- because it accelerated her son's learning 
process. Now 5 feet 11 and 175 pounds, the healthy Kennedy has been sliding on 
a regular basis ever since, escaping occasionally in the summer to Santa Cruz 
to surf, and quitting briefly amid "burnt out emotions" in the winter of 
1989-90 after finishing 14th in the '88 Winter Games at Calgary, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I eventually missed the atmosphere and the people," Kennedy said of his 
return. "The World Cup circle is like a family. I came back stronger than ever 
mentally. I'll keep sliding as long as it's fun, then I want to go into 
coaching and design." 
</P>
<P>
 The construction by York International of a $1.1-million indoor training 
complex, with three start ramps, in Lake Placid, and the coaching of Wolfgang 
Schadler is also credited by Kennedy with enhancing his development, as well as 
that of other U.S. sliders. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Kennedy is still something of a free spirit, but what he does on the 
sled is more significant now than the Bart Simpson stickers he previously used 
as decorations on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said an official of the U.S. Luge Assn.: "Everyone has always admired Duncan's 
ability, but for a long time he was kind of a laid-back kid who didn't seem to 
want a leadership role and would rebel occasionally over the smallest things." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy upset the principal luge sponsor before the '88 Games, for instance, 
by protesting the use of 3M-made aerodynamic tape on the bottom of the U.S. 
sleds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was the incident in Germany," the official continued, "but 
he's definitely more aggressive, confident and focused now. It's an individual 
sport to a large extent, but everyone seems to be feeding off his energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy may have been too energetic and aggressive in the last World Cup race 
on Jan. 29, as he careened into ninth place, losing an opportunity to become 
the first American to win the season-long World Cup title. He won't back off, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's a lot of expectations on me again, but I'm confident I know 
how to handle it now, to make it work to my advantage," he said. "Maybe I gave 
in to it in '92, but that won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 This much is certain: Duncan Kennedy will lie down on the job in Norway having 
already delivered a stand-up performance in the chilling arena that was 
Oberhof, Germany, on Oct. 29.

MORNING BRIEFING: BARNES PUTS HIS SPIN ON HARDING SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Barnes, 6 feet 3 and 305 pounds, sees a similarity between himself and 
Tonya Harding, 5-1 and 105: 
</P>
<P>
 Presumption of guilt.  
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, world record-holder in the shotput, served a two-year suspension from 
1990-92 for steroid abuse, a charge he denies to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding is the figure skater some believe should be removed from the U.S. 
Olympic team for a presumed role in an attack on teammate Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, her case is like mine," Barnes said.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's a person who has some rough edges, so people assume guilt based just on 
that. With me, people thought: 'Well, he's so big . . . he must be using 
steroids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Where his case differs is in a recent offer by Nike, the shoe firm, to pay 
$25,000 of Harding's legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent $125,000 defending myself," Barnes said. "When I read (about the Nike 
offer to Harding), I almost threw up. No one offered to help me.  
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about justice. When it was all over, I guess I got the best justice I 
could afford." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: When Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in 1927, what was his salary? 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky break: Many football fans regretted the early retirement of Jim Brown, 
who left the Cleveland Browns for Hollywood at 29. 
</P>
<P>
 But not his old blocking back, Leroy Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brown left, Kelly won two NFL rushing titles in a row. Recently, he was 
voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have been here (at a Hall of Fame news conference) if he hadn't 
retired," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just wondering: Whatever happened to high school milers? 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 fastest miles ever run by California high school athletes, the most 
recent was 1986. Tim Danielson of Chula Vista is still the state's only 
four-minute miler. In 1966, he ran 3:59.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those 10 fastest miles (from 3:59.4 to 4:06.5), six were run in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic facts: Lillehammer, 110 miles north of Oslo, is in Norway's Troll Park 
Area, a region popular for skiing and named after mischievous creatures of 
local legend.  
</P>
<P>
 Lillehammer's most famous native, by some accounts, is Thor Bjorkland, 
inventor of the cheese slicer. 
</P>
<P>
 In environmentally sensitive Norway, spectators at Olympic venues will be 
eating off plates that will be fed later to Norway's pigs.  
</P>
<P>
 The concessionaires' plates are made of potato starch, a main course for 
Norwegian farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Double ace: "I hit a very straight shot," golfer Marina Barnard said, to which 
her partners said, "No kidding!" last week, after she aced two consecutive 
holes at Heartwell Golf Course in Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 On the 121-yard No. 6, Barnard, 62, used a five-wood. On the 121-yard No. 7, 
she used a driver. Both went into the cup on the fly.  
</P>
<P>
 Barnard, a three-times-a-week Heartwell golfer, went on to shoot a 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy to please: Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun, on Buddy Ryan becoming 
coach of the Phoenix Cardinals: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan will do three things -- win 10 games a year, make the playoffs and sell 
tickets. In Phoenix, that's more than enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: $70,000. 
</P>

O'Brien why she decided not to seek a second consecutive Olympic gold medal in 
figure skating: "Safer." EARL GUSTKEY

FORMER FULLERTON COACH AWARDED $1.35 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Huffman's two-year legal battle with Cal State Fullerton paid off Tuesday 
when an Orange County Superior Court jury awarded $1.35 million to the former 
Titan women's volleyball coach in his wrongful-termination suit against the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's teams were 25-80 during his three years as Fullerton coach in 
1989-91, but he improved to 2-0 in lawsuits against the school. 
</P>
<P>
 His suit in February of 1992 successfully blocked Fullerton's attempt to drop 
volleyball on grounds that the move would violate state sex-discrimination 
laws. Huffman claimed that his firing on March 23, 1992, was in retaliation for 
speaking out against the school's record on gender equity and initiating legal 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this case sends a clear message to coaches all across the U.S. that 
they can stand up for gender equity, for women's rights," said Kirk Boyd, one 
of Huffman's attorneys. "And if they suffer any retribution for doing so, then 
they'll be compensated." 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.35-million award -- $350,366 in economic damages and $1 million in 
non-economic damages -- could grow today when the 10-woman, two-man jury 
reconvenes to determine punitive damages. Huffman is eligible for such 
additional damages because jurors determined that Bill Shumard, Fullerton's 
athletic director, had acted with fraud, malice or oppression in the 
termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard, a defendant along with Milton Gordon, university president; Jack 
Bedell, the school's vice president for academic affairs; Barry Munitz, Cal 
State University chancellor, and the CSU Board of Trustees bore the brunt of 
the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard was the only defendant found guilty of the most serious offenses in 
the case -- acting with malice, and interfering with Huffman's state civil 
rights, through threats, intimidation or coercion.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After occupying the cellar two years ago, Tom Lasorda got a letter from the 
grandson of the last Dodger manager to finish last. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He said that his grandfather (Ned Hanlon) was a winner and that I was, too," 
Lasorda said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hanlon had a .508 record and won two National League pennants in seven 
seasons, although his last Brooklyn team was 48-104 in 1905. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Lasorda will begin working toward improving upon a .526 record in 
17 seasons and winning a fifth pennant when he welcomes pitchers, catchers and 
rehab players to Vero Beach, Fla. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me if I have the same enthusiasm as when I started," he said. "If 
anything, I've got even more. My only regret is that I know my career 
eventually will have to end and I don't want it to. It's year-to-year now." . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda envisions this batting order on opening day, April 5, against the 
Florida Marlins at Dodger Stadium: 1 -- Brett Butler, CF; 2 -- Jose Offerman, 
SS; 3 -- Delino DeShields, 2B; 4 -- Darryl Strawberry, LF; 5 -- Mike Piazza, C; 
6 -- Eric Karros, 1B; 7 -- Raul Mondesi, RF; 8 -- Tim Wallach, 3B; 9 -- Orel 
Hershiser, P. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got an improved lineup because of the speed that DeShields and Mondesi 
bring us," Lasorda said. "Speed on the bases does four things for you -- it 
takes some of the concentration away from the pitcher; it forces the pitcher to 
throw more fastballs; it makes one of the two middle infielders leave his 
position, and it allows you to stay out of the double play." . . . Of course, 
DeShields didn't come cheaply from Montreal. The Dodgers had to give the Expos 
Pedro Martinez, who gave them terrific middle relief pitching last season. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "The key is Todd Worrell," Lasorda said. "If he is able to return to form, 
he'll be our closer, and we can move Jim Gott into the set-up role." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the questions about Strawberry, who has become the most 
unpopular ballplayer in Los Angeles history. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that he will be healthy and productive and that the fans will 
forgive him for some of the things he has said," Lasorda said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks, who expect to sell out the rest of the season, will average 
about 17,000 per date at Anaheim Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 During their first season of 1967-68, the Kings averaged 7,621 for home games 
at the Forum, Sports Arena and Long Beach Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Indiana gets no home-court advantage at Assembly Hall when the visiting team 
is shooting free throws. Bob Knight won't allow waving, taunting or booing by 
the fans sitting behind the basket. . . .

for the first time in this country Sunday in the 1 1/8-mile $250,000 San

<P>
 Of the 58 stakes races at Santa Anita this season, 32 begin with either "San" 
or "Santa." . . .

WINTER OLYMPICS / NOTEBOOK; USOC'S HEARING ON HARDING IS TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Committee has notified figure skater Tonya Harding's 
attorneys that an administrative hearing to determine whether she can 
participate in the Winter Olympics will be held next Tuesday, three days after 
the opening ceremony but eight days before she is scheduled to begin 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be held in Oslo, 110 miles south of here. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC announced the decision to ask Harding to appear before the 13-member 
Games Administrative Board on Tuesday, three days after receiving between 300 
and 400 pages of documentation from the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.'s 
investigation into Harding's role in the Jan. 6 attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of hearing more, it's a matter of giving Tonya Harding a 
chance to respond, which she has not had a chance to do," USOC President LeRoy 
Walker said on NBC's "Today" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, who did not respond to an invitation to appear before the USFSA's 
investigative panel last Friday and Saturday in Colorado Springs, Colo., has 
not said whether she will attend the USOC hearing. Her attorney, Robert Weaver, 
said Tuesday in Portland, Ore., that he was reviewing the USOC's hearing 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC is believed to be focusing on possible code of conduct violations 
relating to Harding's Jan. 27 admission that she learned afterward that 
associates were involved in the attack on Kerrigan but did not immediately 
report the information to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC Executive Director Harvey Schiller said the board probably will be more 
concerned with "sportsmanship and fair-play aspects rather than criminal 
culpability." 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC has until Feb. 21, two days before the women's figure skating 
competition begins in Hamar, Norway, to name a replacement for Harding. The 
first alternate is Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, who was authorized by the 
USFSA to leave for Norway Saturday or Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 It appears more likely that she will not leave until the middle of next week, 
possibly arriving in Oslo as Harding is departing. Whether Harding's 
destination is home to Portland or to Hamar for the Olympics is the question 
before the USOC's administrative board. RANDY HARVEY

 At the cold and wind-swept luge track in Hunderfossen, about 12 miles from 
Lillehammer, there were numerous gripes about the condition of the course, 
according to Duncan Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was (complaining)," the U.S. sledder said."It was really bumpy at 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get upset when the track wasn't in shape, but not anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has undergone a metamorphosis in that regard, so he wasn't complaining 
on a blustery morning when the weather and track conditions impacted practice 
runs for Sunday's first two heats of the men's singles competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy finished 12th and teammate Wendel Suckow 14th in Tuesday's timed runs. 
Markus Prock of Austria, the World Cup champion, was 30th. Atsushi Sasaki of 
Japan had the best time of 50.917 seconds.

 Bert Isatitsch of Austria, president of the International Luge Federation 
(FIL) and known as "the Father Luge," died Thursday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
 Isatitsch was scheduled to be honored on the 30th anniversary of luge becoming 
an Olympic event. Bob Hughes, U.S. vice president of the FIL, said without 
Isatitsch's efforts, "Luge would not exist as an Olympic discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 The FIL board will meet this week to discuss naming a successor. ROSS NEWHAN

 It wasn't easy, but Harper Phillips finally made the U.S. Alpine team for the 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was the 22nd and final selection, although not among the skiers named 
Sunday when the U.S. team was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, of Waitsfield, Vt., had mathematically earned the last spot based on 
qualifying criteria, but could have been bumped in favor of teammate Daron 
Rahlves had the latter won a giant slalom Sunday in Rossland, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the race in British Columbia was completed, Phillips had to sweat it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahlves was leading the GS at one point, but could not hold on, cinching the 
spot for Phillips.

 To avoid further price-gouging, Norway's Ministry of Government Administration 
announced that it was freezing prices on lodging, food and beverages in the 
Lillehammer area during the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said in a statement that establishments cannot receive more for 
services than were charged Monday. The freeze will be in effect until Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The government intervened, according to the statement, to "prevent an 
undesirable rise in prices which might hurt Norway's reputation as a tourist 
country." CHRIS DUFRESNE

U.S. LUGERS FIND NICHE AS BOY SCOUTS

<P>
 The luge competition in the Winter Games will have special significance for 
Boy Scout Troop 302 in Marquette, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Next-door neighbors Wendel Suckow and Chris Thorpe, two of the main U.S. medal 
hopes, were introduced to the sport on a Troop 302 outing to a small luge track 
in Marquette, the only U.S. track besides the Olympic layout in Lake Placid, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old Suckow (SUE-ko), an Eagle Scout and assistant scoutmaster when 
time permits, has definitely put the luge manual to work. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing ninth in doubles and 12th in singles at the 1992 Winter Games, 
he became the first American to win the world championship in the 1993 
competition at Calgary. He comes to Norway after a fourth-place finish in the 
six-race World Cup series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to make the team in '92," he said. "I definitely feel I can 
slide with any of these people now. I feel I'm one of the seven or eight (in 
the world) who can medal on any given day." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the most highly regarded U.S. luge lineup ever, with Suckow and Duncan 
Kennedy legitimate medal hopes in singles, Thorpe and Gordy Sheer having been 
in the thick of World Cup doubles competition, and Cammy Myler given an outside 
shot in the women's competition despite a series of shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has never won a luge medal, but Suckow believes he and 
Kennedy may help lift one another to new heights. They have already, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We push each other in training and competition," he said. "It's been good for 
us and the team. We can generally look at each other's times and tell how the 
rest of the world is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we're complete opposites aside from our dedication and desire. 
He's more aggressive, I'm more passive. I can only slide fast if I control my 
emotions. It's 90% mental. When you're going 90 m.p.h. with your back six 
inches off the ice, the key is staying calm under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Suckow competed in cross-country and track, and toted a tuba in the high 
school band, but nothing had grabbed his heart, he said, until that Boy Scout 
outing with Thorpe at the comparative old luge age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell in love with the speed and reaction," he said. "I got hooked on the 
first run."

WINTER OLYMPICS / SLED PREVIEW; LOOK TO '92 BECAUSE NOTHING'S NEW  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the high-speed luge and bobsled runs, a G-force still stands for Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed and much has not since the 1992 Winter Olympics at 
Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, which will be seeking its first medal in luge and first 
since 1956 in bobsled, has had promising moments on the World Cup circuit in 
the last two years but faces tough sledding to overcome the German, Swiss and 
Austrian domination of these sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not be a surprise, in fact, if the '92 winners were to repeat here. 
The two-year turnaround is not likely to produce significant turnover, though 
the U.S. competitors are not without hope. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief look: LUGE 
</P>
<P>
 Singles -- Wendel Suckow became the first American to win the World 
Championship in 1992-93, and Duncan Kennedy finished second overall on the 
1993-94 World Cup circuit, losing the lead when he was ninth in the last of the 
six races. 
</P>
<P>
 Suckow and Kennedy obviously can challenge, but under Olympic pressure, they 
face the specter of Germany's Georg Hackl, the '92 champion, and Austria's 
Markus Prock, the silver medalist who won his fourth consecutive World Cup 
title when Kennedy faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubles -- Germany's Stefan Krausse and Jan Behrendt will attempt to repeat 
their '92 victory, having won the World Cup title as a tuneup. Gordy Sheer and 
Chris Thorpe of the United States were a promising fourth in World Cup after 
finishing 12th in the '92 Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian brothers Tobias and Markus Schiegl, and the Italian team of Hans 
Raffl and Norbert Huber, third in '92, are among the formidable obstacles to a 
U.S. medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's -- Cammy Myler of the United States, fifth in '92 and plagued by a 
series of shoulder injuries, scored a stunning upset in the final World Cup 
race on Jan. 30 to tie for fifth in the standings. She was the fourth woman to 
win on this season's World Cup circuit, indicating a wide-open Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Austrian sisters Doris and Angelika Neuner, 1-2 in '92, are back, but the 
three medal favorites are Germany's Gabi Kohlisch and Jana Bode, who were 1-2 
in the World Cup, and Italy's Gerda Weissensteiner. BOBSLED 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Shimer had a spectacular World Cup campaign in 1992-93, winning the 
overall four-man title and combined two-man and four-man honors as well, a U.S. 
first. Shimer and crew, however, were disappointingly short of that this winter 
-- plagued by injuries, questions of attitude and lack of familiarity with a 
new sled. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Joey Kilburn was confident that a month's encampment at the 1988 Olympic 
facility in Calgary, Canada -- the U.S. team was scheduled to leave for Norway 
today -- had restored his team. Given a competitive push, Shimer has proven he 
can drive with the best, and the U.S.-made Bo-Dyn sled has turned in record 
runs in previous time trials on the Olympic track, but driver and sled are up 
against some bobsled legends here. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are Switzerland's Gustav Weder, who won the Olympic two-man event 
in '92, was third in four-man; Germany's Wolfgang Hoppe, 35, who has won medals 
in four-man competition in three Olympics, and Austria's Hubert Schosser, who 
won this winter's overall four-man World Cup title.

THE LINGCOD DOESN'T MAKE A PRETTY TROPHY, BUT IT'S LARGE, TASTY AND PLENTIFUL 
THESE DAYS, MAKING THE DISTINCTIVE FISH . . . ; TOPS ON THE BOTTOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The lingcod's teeth, as well as the gillrakers, are extremely sharp and can 
cause serious injury to the fingers of careless anglers. Unless you are wearing 
heavy gloves, NEVER put your fingers into the mouth or gill chamber of a 
lingcod. -- Department of Fish and Game 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Mueller's lingcod came over the rail nearly four feet long, with a mouth 
almost as big as its head and a set of jaws that could double as a bear trap. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take a fisheries biologist to figure out that this fish should be 
handled with care, as suggested by the DFG in its sportfish identification 
booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 But by looking at the lingcod, with its cavernous mouth and its bulging brown 
eyes, its mottled brown skin and a greenish tint on its otherwise white 
underbelly, you wouldn't think it would be such a hit among Southland anglers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when Mueller's catch hit the deck, those aboard the Pacific Dawn were all 
smiles as they bounced their lures off the bottom hoping that they, too, would 
hook such a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best thing going in Southern California right now," said Mueller, 
29, of Thousand Oaks. "There's nothing else like it." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. The water is too cold for tuna. The time isn't quite right for 
yellowtail and white seabass. It's the dead of winter, and most of the action 
is on the bottom, whether it's 50 feet or 350 feet.  
</P>
<P>
 And while anglers may be able to fill their sacks with a variety of bright-red 
rockfish that thrive at such depths, they would much rather latch onto a 
lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm mostly a tuna man myself," said Mike Burens, 33, who came from Lancaster 
to see what this lingcod madness was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Burens, like the others who boarded the Pacific Dawn for its 1 a.m. run to the 
deep-water fishing grounds off Santa Rosa Island, had been reading the fish 
counts.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had 83 on one trip (early last month)," said John Shull, 36, 
owner-operator of the CISCO Sportfishing-based vessel. "Two-thirds of the boat 
had their (five-fish) limits. Guys were throwing back 20-pounders." 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller took the largest lingcod on that trip, a 44 1/2-pounder that was 
nearly as big around as it was long. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have put a football in its mouth," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 And chances are, it would have burst the pigskin. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-tackle world record lingcod is a 69-pounder caught off British 
Columbia in 1992. That one could have swallowed the pigskin. 
</P>
<P>
 Shull refers to the fish as "gators," and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingcod, actually a member of the greenling family, are caught from Alaska to 
Baja California, and have been taken from as deep as 2,700 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 They are extremely territorial and will attack anything that poses a threat or 
represents a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day Shull's customers bagged 83 lingcod, the fish couldn't stay away 
from the heavy metal jigs used by Bob Neil, 39, a Pacific Dawn regular from 
Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil caught 11, six of which were taken on one drift over one of the many high 
spots of 300 feet in an otherwise seemingly bottomless Pacific. And he lost 11 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was only one guy who didn't catch any," Neil said. "But he was sleeping 
over that last drift." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shull: "We had them hanging onto rockfish (hooked) on (multi-hooked) 
gangions, and they would let go and swim back down when we'd try to gaff them. 
We had some that would hold onto the lure for 300 feet and spit it out right 
before they got to the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 And thus expectations were high among the 24 anglers who paid $60 each to 
board Shull's boat shortly after midnight, wake up twice in the dark to try 
unsuccessfully to catch bait near Santa Cruz Island, then rise again at dawn to 
try for lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with 10- to 16-ounce chrome and painted jigs that sell for $5 to $12 
apiece, the groggy fishermen attached them to their Dacron line -- necessary to 
fish such depths because it doesn't stretch like monofilament -- and sent them 
over and to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller, bouncing his hand-painted, zebra-colored jig off the bottom, reeling 
as the boat drifted over the peaks and ridges and letting line out to reach the 
bottom when it drifted over canyons and valleys, felt a tug within minutes. He 
set the hook and gave a few quick reels, enough to turn the head of the fish 
and keep it from the rocks.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of pumping and reeling -- the method used for most gamefish -- Mueller 
merely tried to keep a tight line, reeling fast when the fish would swim toward 
the surface and holding tight when it would make a dash for the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 His patience paid off when after several minutes he had the fish within range 
of a gaff. It was hauled on board, carried down the rail past envious 
onlookers, and stuffed in his sack. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil hooked up a bit later and after a few minutes had his lingcod at the 
surface. Others watched in disbelief as he instructed the crew to release the 
fish, whose flesh, green as it sometimes is while raw, cooks up a succulent, 
flaky white. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil claimed to be doing his part to protect the fishery, but the fact that he 
still had lingcod fillets in his freezer from previous trips might have had 
something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller and Neil took turns catching lingcod while most of the others settled 
for such listless -- but equally delicious -- rockfish as chilipepper, 
vermilion rockfish (commonly called red snapper or red rock cod) and bocaccio. 
None of the fishermen, regardless of experience, would escape with all tackle 
intact, decorating the rocky bottom with about $200 worth of shiny lures by 
day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the sun set, Burens, the tuna man, hooked into a lingcod that 
worked his arms for several minutes before coming to gaff and over the rail, 
measuring only about three feet but so full of eggs that it weighed 29 pounds 
and edged Mueller's fish for the daily jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 After several more drifts, Shull, realizing that it was a four-hour trip to 
the landing, said he would make two more before calling it a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller had already caught six lingcod and Neil five, but both fished intently 
trying to get one bigger than Burens'. 
</P>
<P>
 The action increased, but the fish being brought over the rail were mostly 
small rockfish, many of them bocaccio, also called salmon grouper and the 
least-prized among the anglers because their flesh sometimes contains worms, 
which may cook out in the oven but do little for the appetite.  
</P>
<P>
 "I once saw a fillet crawling across the fillet board," Mueller exclaimed as 
he bounced his jig along the bottom, "and I wasn't even drinking, but that made 
me want a drink." 
</P>
<P>
 Shull was happy because the sacks were being filled, which would satisfy his 
customers. And after one more drift, as the high spot disappeared from his 
meter and the bottom dropped steadily, he said it was time to reel in. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 19 lingcod were landed, not as many as on previous trips but a good 
total nonetheless for a species generally caught only incidentally. 
</P>
<P>
 The rods were stored, the engines fired up, and a course was set for Oxnard. 
Soon the setting sun was turning the horizon red and gray whales spouted in the 
distance. Many of the passengers retired to their bunks, while others wandered 
about the stern deck, taking a last look at the day's catch before the 
deckhands turned it into fillets. 
</P>
<P>
 Burens, the tuna man and lingcod king for a day, used both arms to lift his 
fish out of the gunny sack. Staring into its massive mouth, he smiled in awe 
and muttered to himself, "You can see why anything's fair game with these 
suckers."

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: MARLIN LIKELY TO REMAIN CATCH OF YEAR OFF CABO SAN 
LUCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like shooting billfish in a barrel . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not quite, but fishing for striped marlin in the Golden Gate Banks area off 
Cabo San Lucas is currently as exciting as the sport gets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it is now, the fish are on the surface, and when (skippers) see the 
birds diving (above the feeding marlin), everyone races to the area," said 
Tracy Ehrenberg, owner of the Pisces Fleet. "It's fun, as long as they avoid 
crashing into each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrenberg, who has run the fleet for the last 10 years, said she has not seen 
fishing this good in at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fleet caught 132 marlin in the past week, releasing 116. Dave Bishop of 
Chicago, fishing with a friend aboard the Tracy Ann, caught and released nine 
striped marlin in one day, using 20-pound and even lighter line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrenberg, who said all of her boats returned Tuesday flying two or more 
marlin flags, added that she has no reason to believe there will be a letup 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This past week was the most exceptional," she said. "But it's been like this 
for the last 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Giant yellowfin tuna are cooperating at the Revillagigedo Islands 300 miles 
southwest of Cabo San Lucas, though not in the quality or quantity of the last 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Qualifier Excel returned Tuesday from a 17-day trip with 202 tuna -- the 
largest a 328 1/2-pounder caught by Dennis Braid of Palmdale -- and only 32 
wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that so far, it's mediocre at best," skipper Randy Toussaint 
said. "That was only our third fish over 300 (pounds)." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the wahoo, which usually abound near the islands, "They just weren't 
around," Toussaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Could this be the year of the albacore? 
</P>
<P>
 It could, according to Tim Barnett, oceanographer at Scripps Institute. 
Barnett gave his annual albacore report to members of the Sportfishing Assn. of 
California last week and said that with the El Nino all but over, conditions 
are prime for an albacore run of the magnitude not seen off the Baja California 
coast in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said conditions are similar to those preceding good albacore fishing years 
in the past," SAC President Bob Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett added his usual disclaimer, saying it is too early to tell for sure 
whether this would be one of those years. The last albacore run of any 
significance was in 1989, when 29,728 fish were landed aboard California-based 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 North America's fastest land animal is the pronghorn antelope, which can reach 
speeds of 60 m.p.h. And with the end of the drought followed by the relatively 
mild winter thus far, experts say the stage is set for a speedy comeback for 
the animals in Northeastern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The antelope -- an estimated 7,908 in January of 1992 -- suffered significant 
losses during the harsh winter of 1992-93, but recent aerial surveys in Modoc, 
Lassen and parts of Siskiyou and Shasta counties turned up 5,160 animals, 75 
more than were counted in the same ranges last January. The increase is not 
enough, Department of Fish and Game officials say, to warrant an increase in 
tags for the fall hunting season. The early '92 count was the highest in 29 
years of DFG surveys in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unfair advantage: Hunting guide Don Holleman, a former professor at the 
University of Alaska Fairbanks, was sentenced to 10 months in prison for 
hunting grizzly bears from an airplane. Western Outdoors magazine reported that 
Holleman, who pleaded guilty, was fined $10,000 and ordered to forfeit his 
$47,000 plane to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 FISHING -- Locally, bottom fishing remains the best bet, but the past week had 
its moments. Anglers aboard Long Beach Sportfishing's Victory were in the right 
place last weekend -- near Horseshoe Kelp -- when schools of barracuda made an 
unseasonable run through the area. They landed 121, the largest an 
eight-pounder caught by Dan Anderson of Duarte. Sand bass fishing has been 
steady in the Santa Monica Bay, primarily in the Redondo Beach area, where 
anglers aboard the Redondo Special put 95 sand bass in the sacks Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSERVATION -- Operation Bighorn: Volunteers planning to help with 
construction of a water guzzler for the animals in the Sheep Hole Mountains 
east of Twentynine Palms this weekend are in for more of an an adventure than 
otherwise planned. Ground access to the site has been disallowed, and the work 
force of 40 or 50, after a camp-out in the desert, will be flown in at dawn and 
out at dusk by helicopter. Helmets and flight jackets will be provided, after a 
mandatory safety meeting. Flight space is limited, so prospective volunteers 18 
or older should confirm by calling (213) 256-0463. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Fly-tyer A.K. Best will be the guest speaker at the Long Beach 
Casting Club's meeting next Wednesday at Recreation Park in Long Beach. 
Details: (310) 549-1556. . . . Joe Humphries, fly-fishing author and instructor 
at Penn State, will be the guest speaker at Sierra Pacific Flyfishers' meeting 
on Feb. 17 at the Encino Glen in Encino. Details: (818) 785-7306. . . . Art's 
Tackle in Gardena will give its annual rock cod seminar, focusing on jig and 
gangion fishing in deep and shallow water, on Feb. 19 at 10 a.m. The seminar 
will be followed by a two-day charter. Details: (310) 323-3339.

STATE AGENCY OFFERS TO HELP RETAIN RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Trade and Commerce Agency, the state's lead organization for 
business attraction and retention, has offered to assist the city of Anaheim in 
negotiations to keep the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have announced that they plan to invoke the 15-month notice on their 
escape clause with Anaheim Stadium in May.The NFL team has been courted by 
ownership groups in other cities, including Baltimore, St. Louis and Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trade and Commerce Agency has contacted Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly's office 
about forming a committee of local, state and corporate officials to help 
design a financial package to keep the Rams, agency spokesperson Mike Marando 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have extended our hand to the mayor, and we are waiting for a call back," 
Marando said. "The Rams have been an institution for years, and we certainly 
don't want to see them leave Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Marando said the agency could help the city negotiate with the team on such 
issues as the stadium lease and skybox sales. The agency assists California 
businesses in dealing with workmen's compensation costs and obtaining building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if state funds might be used to help keep the Rams in Anaheim, Marando 
said: "I can't comment on that. It's still in the early stages. We must first 
see if a (committee) is feasible for this situation. That's why we're waiting 
for a call back from the mayor's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly was in meetings Tuesday and did not return phone calls.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: ARENA HAS BIG OPENING NIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During its construction, the new Student Recreation Center at UC Riverside has 
served as a reminder of what the school's athletic programs could not have. 
</P>
<P>
 Built with student funds, the center may be used only for intercollegiate 
athletic events that the current UC Riverside gym is not capable of holding -- 
in other words, sellouts. That means one or two men's basketball games a year 
and probably no volleyball or women's basketball.  
</P>
<P>
 The gym's capacity is about 900. The center is a 3,000-seat arena. It's new, 
it's better and, mostly, it's forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday, it was home sweet home. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Riverside set a school attendance record for an athletic event Saturday 
night when 2,455 saw the men's basketball team beat Cal State Bakersfield, 
61-56, at the Student Recreation Center. The victory moved the Highlanders 
(14-6 overall, 6-2 in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn.) ahead of 
Bakersfield (17-4, 5-2).  
</P>
<P>
 "The place was just finished literally at 2 p.m. Saturday, and we played that 
night, so it was as new as it could be -- they haven't even put the backs on 
the seats yet," said John Masi, UC Riverside men's basketball coach and 
athletic director. "It was kind of a neutral site, but obviously it was a UCR 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Masi was concerned about how the players would adjust to a new setting against 
the defending Division II national champions. Going into the game, Riverside 
had lost seven consecutive games to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing there was a concern. To go over there was kind of unnerving," Masi 
said. "Neither team shot well, although both teams play very good defense. Then 
there was a lot of stuff going on around the game, it was homecoming and there 
was a lot of hoopla." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Bakersfield made only 38% of its shots, Riverside only 32%. Riverside 
led, 32-20, at halftime.  
</P>
<P>
 As usual, UCR's Bob Fife led the way. The 6-foot-11 senior center scored 23 
points and had 15 rebounds, including 12 defensive rebounds, and blocked six 
shots. He is eighth nationally among Division II players in blocked shots, 
averaging nearly three a game.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a critical game," Masi said. "We couldn't afford to lose. If we did, 
we would have been two behind in the loss column, and I don't think we could 
have made that up. You never expect Bakersfield to lose when they play 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's victory capped a notable fortnight for Masi. He gained his 300th 
victory in a game against Patten College on Jan. 24 and has a record of 303-120 
in 15 seasons. He has five consecutive 20-victory seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you you reach the round figures, it's a great milestone," Masi said. 
"I've had some great kids and good assistant coaches, so it's not just me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope there's a lot more than 300." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Master's College is off to its best start in men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 At 22-3, The Master's is already one victory away from matching the school 
record for victories in a season.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not a big surprise -- the Mustangs have won at least 20 games in each of 
the past four seasons -- but with a new coach, an adjustment period was 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we would be good but I didn't think we would jell as quickly as we 
did," Coach Bill Oates said. "With a new coach and some new players, I thought 
it would take a little more time. But we've just been consistent night in and 
night out." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a successful coach at NCAA Division I, NCAA Division III, Athletes 
in Action and high school levels, and has a record of 620-255. 
</P>
<P>
 But he started from scratch at The Master's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I knew nothing about the program," Oates said. " Everything has 
been a pleasant surprise. This is a group that is very motivated. We've had 
different people step forward in different games." 
</P>
<P>
 Emeka Okenwa, a senior forward from Nigeria, leads the Mustangs with averages 
of 16 points and nearly 10 rebounds a game. Senior point guard Andy Thompson is 
averaging 6.6 assists, and sophomore forward James Mosley is averaging nearly 
15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA ruled that four players in the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo baseball 
program should be suspended for varying numbers of games because of improper 
financial aid that the students received from groups not associated with the 
university.  
</P>
<P>
 The names and the details of the penalties were not released, but the athletes 
are to repay the money they were given. Neither the NCAA nor Cal Poly SLO would 
say how much money was involved, but apparently the athletes were unaware that 
they were receiving money improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly SLO is conducting an internal investigation of the matter, and Coach 
Steve McFarland has voluntarily taken leave from the program to avoid any 
perceived obstruction. Assistant coaches Kent Agler and Doug Noce are coaching 
the team until the investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly SLO opened its season by sweeping a three-game series from visiting 
Cal State Northridge last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier hired Kirk Hoza as its football coach, replacing Ken Visser, who left 
to coach Chapman next season. Hoza had been an assistant coach at Redlands 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Brandon Bryce of Cal Poly Pomona set a school record with seven 
three-point goals in an 83-72 victory over Cal State San Bernardino on Jan. 29.

MIKE PENNER: HERZOG LEAVES A GRIM LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitey Herzog is out of here, probably frolicking on some well-packed ski run 
at this very moment, but he is in every Angel fan's thoughts today as Bill 
Bavasi and Buck Rodgers try to figure out what to do with that exorbitant 
parting gift Whitey left behind, Joe (Rhymes With Kelly Gruber) Magrane. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, expected to be the No. 3 starter in Rodgers' pitching rotation this 
season, underwent arthroscopic elbow surgery Tuesday morning -- 12 days before 
pitchers and catchers report to training camp and less than five months after 
Whitey signed Magrane to a guaranteed $3-million contract that is worth, 
potentially, up to $13.3 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Gruber, whose shoulder and neck injuries ambushed the Angels last 
winter, Magrane's arm problems are a matter of public record. Magrane underwent 
reconstructive elbow surgery in March of 1991, missed all of the 1991 season 
and appeared in only five major league games in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This was with the St. Louis Cardinals, who nursed Magrane through those two 
seasons, and 20 more starts in 1993, before signing off on the rehabilitation 
project last Aug. 15, tendering Magrane his release. 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked grim for Magrane, once a promising sinkerballer who won 18 games 
in 1989, but, fortunately, he had a friend in Whitey. Together, they won a 
pennant in 1987. Almost won a World Series, too. Good times, they were. Whitey 
remembered them well. 
</P>
<P>
 What this called for was a round of drinks. Or a testimonial dinner. Share a 
few laughs, give Magrane a gold watch, thank him for his meritorious service. 
</P>
<P>
 Most general managers in baseball would have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 But not good buddy Whitey. 
</P>
<P>
 Good buddy Whitey felt he had to set Magrane up for life, which he did last 
Sept. 21 with a contract agreement so outlandish that it wasn't second-guessed 
at the time, it was first-guessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years, plus an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Three million guaranteed over two seasons, with incentives that could swell 
the jackpot to $9 million over three seasons and $13.3 million over four. 
</P>
<P>
 All this after watching Magrane make six starts for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, three of those starts were victories. 
</P>
<P>
 And they did come in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel veterans were apoplectic. Luis Polonia kicked and screamed his way out 
of town. Chili Davis, the team RBI leader, whose 1994 contract option would be 
picked up by the team and nothing more, could only shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
 What if Magrane's arm goes out again?  
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, well, Whitey isn't around to answer that one now. The deed has been 
done, the deal has been signed, and now Magrane's out six to eight weeks, 
minimum, sending Rodgers to Tempe not to pick up the pieces, but first to find 
some. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody asked me today, 'What's your starting rotation going to be?' " 
Rodgers said Tuesday. "I told him, 'Your guess is as good as mine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, it's a two-man rotation, Chuck Finley and Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
 After that? 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd like to give Phil Leftwich an outstanding chance to be our No. 3 
starter," Rodgers said. Leftwich, 24, made 12 starts for the Angels last 
season. He finished 4-6 with a 3.79 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 And after that? 
</P>
<P>
 "From there, I don't know," Rodgers said. "We got about six guys, including 
(Hilly) Hathaway, (Russ) Springer, (John) Dopson and (John) Farrell. You name 
it, we got it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to give them all a shot, so when we get back from Arizona to 
start the season, your guess is as good as mine as to who's going to be our 
Nos. 4 and 5 starters." 
</P>
<P>
 Some numbers to ponder: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hathaway, in 1993: 4-3, 5.02. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Farrell: 3-12, 7.35. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Springer: 1-6, 7.20. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dopson: 7-11, 4.97. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers has pondered, and it has given him a Magrane headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you got a guy with a bad arm, it's not unusual for him to have something 
that needs to be cleaned up from time to time," Rodgers said. "It's the timing. 
You figure he has the surgery after the season, something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't figure the Tuesday before Valentine's Day, with 30 to 35 starts 
hanging on that left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he'd give us a good, solid 200 innings," Rodgers said. Now? Who can 
say when Magrane will be back in the rotation? Late April? May? June? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Rodgers said. "I really don't know. We have to find out how 
serious it is and when he can start throwing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be one thing. How long it takes him to get back on the mound 
is another. Really, everything is speculative right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Rodgers been able to track down Herzog to discuss this latest development? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he replied. "But (Magrane) was given the OK by the St. Louis doctor and 
our doctors. I don't think there's anything Whitey didn't do in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we followed the (proper) procedures and everything. We started him 
and he pitched 48 innings for us and we pronounced him able . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that it was my job to put him out on the mound and evaluate him 
as a healthy pitcher and an effective pitcher. We did that and we told (the 
front office) he could be one of our starting pitchers next year. And the 
negotiators took over from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed they did. Four-and-a-half months later, Rodgers was standing outside an 
elevator at Anaheim Stadium, playing spin doctor while the real doctors 
tinkered with Magrane's elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was that bad a contract," Rodgers professed. "I mean, if we 
go in and sign a healthy Joe Magrane, he's going to cost you somewhere between 
$4-5 million a year. So we took a gamble and built in some incentives. So I 
think both sides are protected." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruber. Magrane. You'd like to say the Angels do learn from these experiences, 
but last week they gave $1 million to a 31-year-old left fielder with an 
artificial hip. It was the first "major signing" of the post-Whitey Herzog era.

THESE DAYS, BARRETT IS JUST ANOTHER FAN IN THE STANDS; BASKETBALL: EX-MATER DEI 
ASSISTANT STILL CLOSE TO MONARCHS' PROGRAM. BUT HE SAYS HE DOESN'T RECRUIT FOR 
MCKNIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Twelve years ago, Pat Barrett used to sit beside Mater Dei boys' basketball 
Coach Gary McKnight as an assistant on the Monarchs' bench . . . now he says 
he's just another high school basketball fan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barrett knows there are whispers when he appears at the Bren Center to 
catch Mater Dei and freshman Schea Cotton, who plays on his traveling team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Mater Dei fan, heck, I coached there for three years," Barrett said. 
"But in no way am I aligned with or connected with Mater Dei or any other 
school. I don't work for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a kid asks me what high schools have good basketball programs and what 
colleges are good, I'll tell him. But I'm just one guy giving his opinion; I 
don't tell anyone what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, when Tom Lewis was the most sought after high school player in 
Southern California, many thought Barrett was telling Lewis what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis enrolled at Mater Dei the same year Barrett arrived on the coaching 
staff. They met while Barrett was the sophomore coach at Capistrano Valley, and 
Lewis, who came from a broken family, moved in with Barrett and his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis developed into one of the best players in county history and was 
recruited by high-profile schools, including UCLA, USC, Nevada Las Vegas and 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lewis chose USC, many pointed the finger at Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "People never got the whole story on Tom's recruitment and I was made out to 
be the bad guy," Barrett said. "That was fine with me. I was trying to protect 
a 17- (or) 18-year-old kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, Lewis is an assistant coach at Mater Dei and Cotton's arrival 
has brought Barrett's name to the forefront again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, all of a sudden, Schea Cotton shows up and it's like, well, (Barrett) 
had to be the reason," McKnight said. "If that was the case, Pat coached the 
O'Bannon brothers. Shoot I really got messed up there. I missed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed and Charles O'Bannon, now at UCLA, helped Artesia win three State 
championships. Barrett said he never coached the O'Bannons on a team, but 
helped tutor their individual skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett's current age-17 level all-stars include sophomores Olujimi Mann of 
Santa Ana Valley, Danny Walker of Westchester, juniors Jelani McCoy of San 
Diego Augustine, Paul Pierce of Inglewood, and Cotton, all rated among the best 
in the country in their class by basketball scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm recruiting for Gary, then I'm really doing a lousy job," Barrett said. 
"Look at all the great kids that play for my teams who don't go to Mater Dei." 
</P>
<P>
 During their three seasons in the grade six, seven and eight levels, Cotton 
and Mann helped Barrett's Performance Training Institute team (now known as 
Values for a Better America) go 220-3.  
</P>
<P>
 There are those who say traveling teams don't serve players' best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is these kids get involved with traveling teams at a very young 
age," El Modena Coach Steve Middleton said. "That can be very good, but it 
leads the Pat Barretts of the world to charge exorbitant amounts of money and 
promise them they will be stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett has heard worse and shrugs it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm such a bad guy, how come all the kids want to play here?" Barrett 
said. "We work hard to develop the kids' talents so they're ready for high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett said he charges $300 per player, and with the help of private 
corporate sponsorship, the year-round teams play in 20-plus weekend tournaments 
and 80 games annually. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of two assistants, Barrett coaches sixth-, seventh- and 
eighth-grade teams year-round, and age-15 and 17 level all-star teams. His 
practice regimen also includes monthly guest speakers, who address, among other 
issues, the ills of drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett says he is simply a basketball coach who drives a 1988 Ford van and 
runs Barrett Trophies and Awards, "a mom-and-pop organization" out of the 
garage in his home in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 But since he also is a close friend and coach to some of the top prep players 
in the area, Barrett wields considerable power in the basketball community. 
</P>
<P>
 "People take shots at us and that comes with the territory," Barrett said. 
"But I know I haven't done anything wrong . . . I sleep well every night."

CRUM USED PIERCE AS STEPPINGSTONE TO HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louisville basketball Coach Denny Crum always wanted success on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned down NBA offers and even a chance to coach UCLA, his alma mater, so 
he could mold Louisville into a national power. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has, Crum wants to be accompanied into the Basketball Hall of Fame 
at the side of his former mentor, legendary UCLA Coach John Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum, a 1955 graduate of San Fernando High, played at Pierce College from 
1955-57 before coming under Wooden's tutelage at UCLA during the 1957-58 and 
1958-59 seasons. He was the Bruins' graduate assistant from 1959-61 and an 
assistant coach from 1967-71. 
</P>
<P>
 In between his stints at UCLA, Crum served as an assistant at Pierce from 
1961-64 and was the Brahmas' head coach from 1964-67. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I had to be escorted by a Hall of Fame member," said Crum, who 
was elected Tuesday. "When you play for someone and then coach under him and 
take the things that you learned from him and have success from that, I just 
want him to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, the only person enshrined as a player and coach, said he will try to 
attend the induction ceremony May 9 if he is healthy enough to make the trip to 
Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd certainly love to," Wooden said from his Encino home. "I'm very proud of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Crum, 56, joins Indiana's Bobby Knight and North Carolina's Dean Smith as the 
only active coaches elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum, who began coaching Louisville in 1971, let it be known after he lost to 
UCLA in a 1975 Final Four semifinal game that he wouldn't be interested in 
taking over for Wooden, who retired after that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the opportunity to go to UCLA, but I chose not to do that," said Crum, 
who coached Louisville to NCAA titles in 1980 and 1986. "Not because of 
anything negative but because I grew to love it here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the challenge. I think it was the chance to do something I 
enjoyed and make a living at it. A lot of people dread to go to work every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Crum has never had that problem. Pete Nelson, the cross-country and co-track 
coach at Kennedy High and a fraternity brother of Crum's at UCLA, said Crum was 
consumed by basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played it, slept it and studied basketball all the time," Nelson said. "I 
don't think I've ever met someone who was so focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wooden: "I've been called a purist. I'd say he tends that way too. He's 
not a showman. Some coaches want to be seen. I wanted people come to watch my 
players. I think Denny's that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stanley, the men's volleyball coach at Pierce and a Brahma assistant under 
Crum, said there is more to Crum than winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always remembers a friend," Stanley said. "Once he met you and was around 
you, he didn't forget you, and that's a great quality. When you're around him, 
you always feel like you're special." 
</P>
<P>
 Crum has directed the Cardinals to 17 NCAA tournament appearances, including 
14 of the last 17 years. His teams have won 20 or more games in 18 of 22 
seasons.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: NEWBURY PARK TEAMS FORM AN ALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a banner year for two Newbury Park High teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers' football team went undefeated and won its first Southern Section 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' basketball team (20-4, 11-2 in league play) is enjoying its finest 
season in Coach Nori Parvin's 20 years. And the two squads have made sacrifices 
to show their support for the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Buena tournament in December, the girls' team advanced to the 
championship game against Buena, but the players unanimously voted to skip the 
game because it conflicted with the football team's Division III championship 
game against Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Newbury Park played in the third-place game earlier in the evening, 
and the players were able to attend the football game that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of flak for that, but I would do it again," Parvin said. "Some 
parent wrote a letter to a newspaper that (the decision sent a message that) 
the girls were second-best. That wasn't it. You'll never see a combination like 
Keith Smith and Leodes Van Buren again. It's once in a lifetime -- especially 
at Newbury Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Parvin said several football players thanked her for the gesture, and the 
favor was returned Jan. 11 when the football team postponed its banquet to 
attend a girls' game. MISSION LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Dream Matchup 
</P>
<P>
 The area's two best girls' basketball teams, perennial powers Alemany and 
Buena, are among the top squads in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena (18-2) is ranked fourth in the state and is powered by the talented trio 
of Arizona-bound Mikko Giordano (who returned Tuesday from a knee injury) and 
sophomores Eboni Conley and Kori Sebek.

<P>
 The Indians (21-0) are ranked sixth in the state and are led by the fab four 
of Samantha Rigley, Kelly McKay, Carly Funicello and Zevette Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 A matchup between the two teams will not happen because they play in different 
leagues and in different divisions, but that doesn't mean a question can't be 
posed. 
</P>
<P>
 Which team is better? 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park played both squads this season, losing to Alemany in a December 
tournament and to Buena in a scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Alemany would beat them," Parvin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're more experienced and more balanced. Kelly and Samantha have played 
together for three years, and Carly gets better each game. Plus, the Mission 
League is tougher than the Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say about Buena? They're a great team. If they had to play each 
other, it would be close, and maybe it would come down to free throws," Parvin 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I think Alemany would have the inside track -- I really do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura also has faced both squads, losing to Alemany in December and 
splitting its two games against Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ventura Coach Glenn Gray: "It would be a real good matchup. I don't know 
who would win. But they'll never play." 
</P>
<P>
 A pity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Notre Dame girls' basketball team is enjoying the most successful season 
in the program's 10-year history.  
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' 13 wins are the most ever in a season, and six players (Valery 
Brady, Casey Coghlan, Carla Arrue, Stacey Phillips, Maggie Dixon and Lucy 
Marandjian) have combined to set 10 school statistical records. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady recently became Notre Dame's all-time scoring leader with 666 points, 
breaking Andrea Banducci's record of 633, set in 1987. NORTHWEST VALLEY

 Aye, Aye, Eye 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, San Fernando practiced in its gym for the first time since the Jan. 
17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one light was working, however, so Coach Dick Crowell informed school 
maintenance workers that repairs were in order. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day electricians started fiddling overhead with the lights. It was a 
circuit-breaker problem, Crowell was told. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, several players complained of eye irritation. They figured 
it had something to do with the gymnasium and they refused to practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell, who said he had spent hours in the gym with no ill effects, went 
crazy. He called his team every name in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malingerers," he bellowed, throwing his hands up in exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the coach was told a pipe earlier had burst in the gym and that 
a chemical might have leaked into the air, causing the eye irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had egg on my face," Crowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach bought the team pizza Friday to make amends. But that wasn't all. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Crowell learned that two maintenance workers had called in sick with 
eye problems. Maybe the pipe wasn't the problem after all, the coach was told. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing opinion at school is that the workers and players suffered eye 
problems because of exposure to ultraviolet rays emanating from the overhead 
lights, which were exposed during the early repair work. GOLDEN LEAGUE

 Quartz Hill is making more with less. The Rebels had won or shared three 
consecutive league titles entering the season, but it didn't take long for 
everyone to realize there wouldn't be a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill lost its first 11 league games, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, however, the Rebels pulled off two upsets last week, knocking 
off Ridgecrest Burroughs and Antelope Valley, two teams in contention for 
playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 All this with only eight players, no less.  
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, three seniors quit the team, leaving Quartz Hill with a 
skeleton cast.  
</P>
<P>
 After losing two games, the team rallied to post the upsets last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys I have left are real fighters," Coach Steve Hurst said. "They just 
outhustled Burroughs and Antelope Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale, which entered the week on a 10-game winning streak, last week 
clinched the league title. A noteworthy accomplishment, to be sure, but since 
the Falcons shared the championship last season, nobody was doing cartwheels. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until somebody did research. It seems Palmdale last won the league 
title outright in 1960-61. "Nobody had any idea it had been that long," Coach 
Garry Phelps said. Around the Leagues . . .

YOUNGSTERS RIGHT IN MIDDLE OF THINGS FOR MASTER'S; BASEBALL PREVIEW: FRESHMEN 
START AT SHORTSTOP, SECOND BASE AND CENTER FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The green on The Master's College baseball field will not be restricted to the 
infield and outfield grass this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs -- Colts might be more appropriate -- will have freshmen at 
shortstop, second base and in center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Although experience at the corners surrounds the youngsters, remember what is 
commonly said about good baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 A clue: It is not, "They Are Young Up the Middle." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are showing signs of being a good club by the end of year," said Coach 
Chris Harrison, pointing out that freshmen Jeff Terrell (shortstop), David 
Scott (second baseman) and Garrick Moss (center fielder) need time to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the absence of catcher Dan O'Sullivan, a senior All-American who is 
out for the season because of a rotator cuff injury, and Harrison's doubts are 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's has lost its first two games to Cal State Los Angeles and UC 
Riverside, NCAA Division II schools. Improving on last season's 28-22 record 
seems remote, although Harrison is not discounting postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 Reason: Master's, an independent NAIA District 3 team, must beat only the 
other independent, Biola, in a season-ending best-of-seven series and have a 
better district record than the fourth-place team in the Golden State Athletic 
Conference to gain an invitation to the district tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining six District 3 teams are GSAC members. The top three GSAC 
finishers automatically qualify for the four-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Mustangs' chances rest on pitcher Chris Beck, a senior 
right-hander who is the school's all-time leader with 22 victories. Last 
season, he matched the school mark of nine victories he set as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gonna be a better pitcher this year, but whether his record will reflect 
that, we'll see," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the rotation is Ryan Dowhower, a junior right-hander who sat out last 
year. He posted 10 victories in more than 100 innings for Hancock College in 
1992. Freshman Mark Balch, a right-hander from North High in Bakersfield, is 
the third starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief pitchers include set-up men Matt Davis and Adam Davis and closer Jason 
Priske, who had three saves last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing experience in the field and production at the plate is first baseman 
Matt Hinsey, a junior who batted .343 last season. Other returning starters are 
senior left fielder Tony MacCaughtry (.291), sophomore third baseman Jayme 
Riggio (.279) and junior right fielder Kenya Hunt (.260). 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing O'Sullivan is Jeff Tomlinson, who hit .290 as a reserve last season. 
Sophomore Justin Miller is the designated hitter.

CAL LUTHERAN HOLDS ITS FATE IN ITS ARMS; BASEBALL PREVIEW: KINGSMEN'S CHANCES 
FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE SCIAC TITLE DEPENDENT ON WHAT AMOUNTS TO FIVE-MAN 
PITCHING STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Playing college baseball is nothing to take for granted, Scott Sebbo and Chris 
Fick of Cal Lutheran have learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Their coach appreciates their ability and will pencil them into the lineup 
every game this season, beginning with today's opener at Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes them lucky Lu Dawgs, as they call themselves. And they know it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys don't realize how precious it is to have a shot to play college 
baseball," Fick said as he watched his teammates take batting practice. "When I 
see somebody going through the motions, I shake my head." 
</P>
<P>
 In a season marked by change at Cal Lutheran, Sebbo and Fick are reminders of 
a colorful tradition of Kingsmen who have prospered through persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebbo finally is playing catcher, the position he has longed for since youth 
league. His El Toro High team had a better catcher, so Sebbo played first base. 
</P>
<P>
 At Orange Coast College, Sebbo played anywhere his coach asked. He was never 
asked to catch. Last season at Cal Lutheran, he batted .344 and earned 
All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference honors as a utility 
player. He caught for one inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what I always wanted to do," he said. "Calling pitches, handling the 
ball. It's a good spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of injuries, Fick went almost five years after graduating from Newbury 
Park High in 1988 before he wore a college uniform. He hit five home runs in 
four games for the Cal Lutheran junior varsity last year, was promoted, batted 
.341 and led the Kingsmen with nine home runs. He was named to the All-Far West 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a track record of overcoming adversity is not lost on Coach Marty Slimak, 
who is looking to Sebbo and Fick to help an inexperienced team mature quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are our leaders and our strongest link to the things this program 
accomplished the past few years," Slimak said. "This has always been a place 
for guys who might have been overlooked somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Slimak will begin his first year as head coach, but he is another link to the 
team's 142-39 record and two trips to the NCAA Division III World Series since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the year he became Coach Rich Hill's assistant. Hill, master 
recruiter and walking billboard for Cal Lutheran baseball, has moved to the 
University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little looser this year," Sebbo said. "Coach Hill was high-strung at 
times. He made all the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Slimak isn't afraid to ask his assistants about things. He'll even ask 
players what they'd like to do in a certain situation. I don't feel stupid if I 
ask the wrong question." 
</P>
<P>
 Slimak, for his part, believes he is following the same course Hill charted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why change a good thing?" he said. "I might be more open with the players, 
probably because I was an assistant for so long, but I'm not going to change a 
whole lot around here." 
</P>
<P>
 More of the same would include winning. The Kingsmen were 32-9 last season on 
the heels of a 43-6 1992 campaign that ended with a defeat in the World Series 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 But winning requires quality pitching, and there are conflicting opinions on 
how well this year's staff will fare. Slimak takes a guarded view. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have a weakness, it is pitching," he said, noting the graduation last 
year of three Division III All-Americans: Jeff Berman, Pat Norville and Mike 
Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
 Starters Sam Arroyo, Marc Weiss, David Jaglowski and brothers Tim and Andrew 
Barber figure to be effective. The talent falls off thereafter, which could 
leave the Kingsmen vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Fick, who as designated hitter has time to ponder such things, believes the 
pitching will hold up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is counting us out, but we've got five legit starters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is doubtful that Cal Lutheran, as two-time defending conference champion, 
is being regarded lightly. However, Redlands, Pomona-Pitzer and La Verne will 
field experienced teams, making a third title a severe challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring runs should not be difficult. Batting in front of Sebbo and Fick are 
outfielders Jason Wilson, David Chapman and Kirk Fellows. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the team's fastest player, batted .299 with 17 stolen bases last year. 
Chapman hit .320 in a part-time role and Fellows, a transfer from College of 
the Canyons, might be the team's best pure hitter. Fellows batted .375 with 34 
runs batted in over 35 games at Canyons last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The infielders are an eclectic bunch. Shortstop Eddie Castillo hit .324 in a 
utility role last year and second baseman Ed Campaniello, an Agoura High 
graduate, is a transfer from San Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
 Bounce-back players from Division I schools also will share time at first and 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Mike Shwartzer, a transfer from San Diego State who attended Reseda 
High, is competing with John Becker, a junior college transfer. At third, 
former Simi Valley High player Joe Gordon, in his second year at Cal Lutheran 
after transferring from UCLA, is competing with Bryce Malone, a junior whose 
athleticism is compensating for the fact that he did not play baseball last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Key reserves include Trent Martin, a power-hitting outfielder from Thousand 
Oaks High and Moorpark College who was the 1992 American Legion national leader 
in RBIs for World Series champion Newbury Oaks, and Chad Miyata, a speedy 
outfielder from Hart High and College of the Canyons.

CYPRESS' JOHNSON IS STEPPING DOWN; BASKETBALL: THE WINNINGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
MEN'S COACH IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY SAYS 27TH SEASON WILL BE HIS LAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Johnson, the winningest community college men's basketball coach in the 
history of California, said Tuesday he is retiring from Cypress College at the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a former All-American at UCLA, is stepping down after 27 years with 
the Chargers. He led Cypress to State titles in 1978 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 63, has a record of 585-257 at Cypress, which has four regular-season 
games remaining. The Chargers are 12-17, 3-7 and in sixth place in the Orange 
Empire Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "My greatest source of satisfaction has been dealing with the good kids who 
cared about our program," Johnson said. "I'm going to reflect on all those kids 
who cared enough to become better players and better people." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson graduated from El Monte High School in 1948 and played at Fullerton 
College. He was the Eastern League's most valuable player in the 1949-50 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 He then went to UCLA, where he was an All-American in 1952 for Coach John 
Wooden. He led the Bruins in rebounding both seasons. Johnson was head coach at 
Pico Rivera El Rancho High School from 1954-66 before coming to Cypress to 
start the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure he placed on himself got the best of him by 1971. He took off the 
1971-72 season because of a stomach ulcer, then returned the next season, and, 
with the help of assistant Jack Long, continued to build one of the best 
programs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, which won seven conference titles, also won 20 or more games in each 
of 17 seasons. Besides winning two State titles, Johnson's teams reached the 
State semifinals four times, most recently in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress has a reputation for getting the most out of his centers, including 
Mark Eaton and Swen Nater, both of whom played in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton, who didn't compete in high school, played at UCLA and is in his 12th 
season with the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he's retiring for several reasons, including his age, and because 
Long and team manager Dick Kirk also are stepping down at the end of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting through each season has been a little more difficult in the last few 
years," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is the second Orange County community college basketball coach to step 
down this season. Fullerton's Colleen Riley, the winningest community college 
women's basketball coach in the state's history, recently announced that this 
is her final season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only when you are near the end of something do you realize how important it 
is to you," Johnson said. "I just feel fortunate to have worked with so many 
great people, including our boosters and fans who have supported us through the 
years." Don Johnson at Cypress

NORTH VALLEY BOYS' GAME POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of confusion over the availability of game sites, a North Valley 
League boys' basketball game between El Camino Real and Reseda highs scheduled 
for today has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams initially were set to play in the first game of a three-day 
round-robin tournament. The site and times of the event were changed twice 
Tuesday, however, and logistic problems made it impossible for Reseda to 
participate, Coach Jeff Halpern said.

 Halpern said he hopes to play the game next Tuesday, perhaps at Taft High. The 
tournament was necessitated when earthquake damage left the gyms of several 
league members unavailable.

 Walsh, from Dana Hills High School, is often overlooked because of the scoring 
exploits of teammate Tes Whitlock and the rebounding of Antoine Jefferson.But 
Walsh has made key contributions all season for Saddleback, which has a 
one-game lead in the Orange Empire Conference race. He scored 18 points and got 
five rebounds as the Gauchos beat Riverside, 73-68, last Wednesday to take sole 
possession of first place. His three-pointer with about three minutes left gave 
the Gauchos a 67-64 lead.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; ANTEATERS HAVING BAD-DREAM SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great expectations have turned into little nightmares for Rod Baker. The UC 
Irvine coach has watched -- mostly in quiet desperation -- as the Anteaters 
have evolved into a team that's just good enough to lose the close ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Big West coaches thought it would be the other way around. Irvine had 
good athletes and experience, they said, and the Anteaters were sixth in the 
preseason coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Some coaches still haven't lost the faith. Pacific Coach Bob Thomason calls 
Irvine "the best five-win team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 As labels go, that one doesn't have an especially nice ring to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, 5-13, is 2-8 and ahead of only Cal State Fullerton (2-9) in the Big 
West. Irvine has lost twice in overtime and a couple more by a basket, but 
there isn't a column in the standing for valiant efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's teams won a total of 13 games in his first two seasons, but it was 
supposed to be different this time around. And when the Anteaters surprised 
Iowa, a team that had just lost to Duke by only three points, they were 3-4 and 
brimming with confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we beat Iowa, we thought we had taken it to another level," center 
DeForrest Boyer said. "We thought we could maintain that level the whole 
season, but almost the opposite has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been disappointing and it's been frustrating. But I will say this, so 
far, it's mainly made us mad to the point where we want to go out and play even 
harder the next time." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Baker has no simple answers or grand plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be amusing, have some kind of quip," he said, "but it comes down 
to making the plays when it counts. We're at that point where making a play or 
two makes the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the wheels haven't fallen off yet, but can Baker find a lug wrench 
before next month's Big West tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 With more than half the conference season over, let's consider some of the 
possible reasons for the Anteaters' fall from a chance at grace . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oh Fudge: The Anteaters are living, but too often eventually dying, with the 
play of senior point guard Lloyd Mumford. Mumford is sometimes spectacular, but 
too often on the outskirts of control. Nobody -- and unfortunately this 
includes his teammates -- knows what will happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's by far the best guard I've ever played against," Santa Barbara junior 
Clayton Madden said. "Before the game, he came up and told me it was going to 
be his night and I felt like I really had to step up or be embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford, who had scored 31 points two days before against Long Beach State, 
made five of 12 field goals and 12 of 15 free throws to score 22 points. But he 
missed a short shot at the end of regulation that would have won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "At certain points, it seems like everyone is waiting for someone else to step 
up and do the scoring and Lloyd is usually the guy," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford hasn't been the guy during the last two games, however. He managed a 
total of eight points, making only two of 12 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get another (bad game) from him, I might be more concerned," Baker 
said. "After Long Beach, teams have probably stepped up and said, 'We can't let 
him in the lane.' His foot hurts and his thumb hurts, but I'm not making any 
excuses. He sucked this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Help not wanted: A few tips on how Mumford could help his team win: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stop throwing no-look bullet passes to post players who are running full 
speed and might not catch the ball if they were standing still and knew it was 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use his quickness to create scoring opportunities for teammates. If you 
drive and then pass it to Chris Brown -- who made a school-record 10 
three-pointers against Pacific Saturday -- Brown would have a lot more open 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And don't try to do it alone. Those spinning, acrobatic drives are fun to 
watch, but, so far, they haven't translated into many wins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Throw furniture: Baker has cut loose with one postgame tirade this year, but 
he usually remains reserved and cool. Maybe too cool. 
</P>
<P>
 After back-to-back overtime losses, he said, "It's a lot easier to put a 
positive spin on things when you play well and things just don't work out," and 
"As long as they don't quit, I have no reason to be discouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked again Monday if he was discouraged by two more losses, he said, "No, but 
I'll be glad when that's not a viable question anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this too close to saying you're satisfied with well-played losses? 
</P>
<P>
 Is this sending the right message? 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's reaction to his team's sixth consecutive loss? 
</P>
<P>
 "I ate a whole pizza . . . in anger," he said. Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The women's volleyball team signed middle blockers Diana Juth, 6-2 from Chino 
Ayala High, and Amy Pimental, 6-1 from Bret Harte High, to letters of intent, 
Coach Mike Puritz announced Tuesday.

ANGELS TOLD MAGRANE'S PROGNOSIS IS FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels were cautiously optimistic after pitcher Joe Magrane's surgery 
Tuesday that he will be able to return to the starting rotation by May. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left elbow in which "loose 
bodies and scar tissue were removed," Dr. Lewis Yocum said.If the swelling is 
minimal the next seven to 10 days, Yocum said, Magrane will be able to start 
throwing softly in three weeks and begin a rehabilitative assignment in 
mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane probably will be sent to Class-A Lake Elsinore for several starts 
before rejoining the Angels in late April or early May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked what the prognosis was," said Bill Bavasi, Angel general manager, 
"and (Yocum) categorized it as fair. The surgery was pretty much as advertised, 
but we'll know more after seeing how he does this spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who missed all but five starts during the 1991 and 1992 seasons 
because of reconstructive elbow surgery, stands to suffer financially if he 
fails to make a quick recovery. Magrane is guaranteed $1.5 million in 1994, but 
by making 30 starts, he could earn $3 million. Also, if Magrane fails to make 
20 starts this season, his guaranteed salary in 1995 will be $1.5 million 
instead of $2.5 million. BOB NIGHTENGALE

CARL'S JR. TO UNVEIL MARKETING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Karcher Enterprises, struggling to reverse a sales slump, is set to 
unveil its long-awaited, value-oriented marketing plan during meetings this 
week with franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives are scheduled to explain the strategy, which is designed to 
help the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain bolster flagging profit and revenue, during 
meetings today in Southern California and Thursday in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises executives declined to comment. And franchisees declined 
to discuss proposed menu changes until after the company solidifies the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings are a culmination of a months-long process designed to make 
Carl's Jr. more competitive with Irvine-based Taco Bell and other national 
companies that correctly identified the growing demand for menu items that are 
perceived as better values. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises has been experimenting with a value menu at restaurants in 
Bakersfield, Sacramento and Las Vegas. Karcher Enterprises used those tests to 
experiment with new food items, to delete longstanding products and to tinker 
with pricing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant industry analysts generally agree that Karcher Enterprises must 
expand its selection of value-oriented menu items in order to cash in on the 
growing demand for better food values. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises profit for the third fiscal quarter ended Nov. 1 rose 
slightly to $1.5 million, but same-store sales -- business at outlets open for 
more than a year -- have continued to slide in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the company has a choice," said Laurie Lively Smith, a 
restaurant industry analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. 
"They have to get into the game with everyone else in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean Karcher Enterprises should abandon the image of high quality 
that many consumers associate with the Carl's Jr. menu, Smith said. "Each 
company has to find the right formula for value that works for them," Smith 
said. "Value means different things to different companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Some franchisees are cautioning Karcher Enterprises' management not to risk 
alienating longtime customers by straying too far from the company's heritage 
of being a slightly more expensive restaurant with higher quality food. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of speculation and anxiety about what we'll hear," said Robert 
Wisely, who owns six Carl's Jr. restaurants in Santa Rosa. "All the franchisees 
are in favor of fixing (menu) problems. But that doesn't mean we need to 
reposition Carl's as the low-priced leader." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're known for premium, quality sandwiches," said Nick Trani, a 
Modesto-based businessman who owns several restaurants in Northern California. 
"We all say, absolutely, that we need value on our menu boards . . . but we 
also need to focus on our strength . . . which is our premium products." 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises owns and operates about 380 restaurants, while its 
franchisees operate about 240 locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is recovering from a months-long, highly publicized boardroom 
fight that pitted founder Carl N. Karcher against the company's board of 
directors. Karcher, 76, was ousted as chairman in October after board members 
disagreed with the founder's plan to test-market another restaurant's 
Mexican-style foods at a handful of Carl's Jr. locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher, who also was struggling to solve severe personal financial problems, 
has since returned to the company he founded as chairman emeritus. Karcher also 
restructured his personal debts.

FHP'S OFFER FOR TAKECARE TURNED DOWN; HEALTH CARE: REJECTION OF THE DEAL IS 
EXPECTED TO SET OFF A BIDDING WAR. MERGER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE INDUSTRY'S 
LARGEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 TakeCare, a prized Northern California health maintenance organization, 
spurned an $829-million takeover offer Tuesday from Orange County-based FHP 
International Inc., triggering a likely bidding war in the increasingly 
merger-minded health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said FHP's Orange County competitor, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. of 
Cypress, will be among the bidders, though a PacifiCare spokesman declined to 
say whether the firm is interested. 
</P>
<P>
 With 742,000 members in California, Colorado and the Midwest, TakeCare is 
considered a premium merger candidate that could command bids as high as $75 a 
share, or more than $1 billion all told. 
</P>
<P>
 TakeCare said a deadline for FHP to complete negotiations on its $62-a-share 
cash and stock acquisition offer lapsed Tuesday, allowing the Concord-based HMO 
to consider other suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other organizations have come to the table and submitted competing bids," 
said TakeCare spokesman David Briere, who declined to identify the would-be 
merger partners. 
</P>
<P>
 One health care analyst who asked not to be identified noted that PacifiCare 
has more than $200 million in cash to join a fight for TakeCare. The firm 
recently secured a $130-million line of credit from Chase Manhattan for mergers 
and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement drove TakeCare's stock up $2.875 a share to close at 
$66.875 in heavy Nasdaq trading. FHP stock fell $1.125 on the Nasdaq to close 
at $26.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP vowed to continue its effort to purchase TakeCare. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the end," said Chief Executive Westcott (Bill) Price III, though 
he declined to say by how much FHP would sweeten its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP had reached a tentative agreement to purchase TakeCare on Jan. 10, hoping 
to use the firm's Northern California and Colorado membership as a way to 
expand its lucrative HMO plan for Medicare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which in dollar terms would have been the biggest managed care 
merger in U.S. history, would have created California's second-largest HMO 
behind Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
 But FHP's initial bid was doomed from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after it was announced, owners of 22% of TakeCare's stock filed a lawsuit 
in Delaware accusing Chairman Jack R. Anderson of touting FHP's offer for 
personal financial gain. They alleged that Anderson cajoled a majority of board 
members to vote for FHP's offer despite a higher bid from United Healthcare 
Corp. of Minnetonka, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Keaney, a health care analyst for brokerage Stifel Nicolaus in St. Louis, 
said that if FHP truly believes in the synergy of the two operations, it will 
pay the price and be more creative in how it designs its next offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we will see is a deal much different than the one that started all 
this," Keaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, TakeCare may sell for as much as $75 a share, according to Mary 
O'Connell, an analyst with the San Francisco brokerage Louis Nicoud Associates. 
"It is a good piece of property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stalled talks between FHP and TakeCare mark the third time in a year that 
a much anticipated health care merger has not come off as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, a pact between Blue Shield of California and Unihealth America 
failed over disagreements on how to reorganize the combined firm. 
</P>
<P>
 And a pending merger of Health Net Inc. of Woodland Hills and Qual-Med Inc. of 
Pueblo, Colo., has hit a snag, partly because of an $89.1-million medical 
malpractice award to a Health Net member.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BANKING AFTERSHOCK; THRIFTS: HOME SAVINGS COULD 
LOSE MILLIONS ON NEW LOANS AIMED AT KEEPING HOMEOWNERS FROM WALKING AWAY FROM 
DAMAGED PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Home Savings of America, the nation's largest thrift, introduced a new lending 
program Tuesday to help its earthquake victims deal with damage to their homes, 
but it noted that the plan may result in significant losses because many of the 
riskier loans may never be fully repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale-based Home Savings declined to estimate the size of the potential 
losses. But its chief executive, Charles R. Rinehart, said in an interview that 
he sees little chance of recovering money on as many as 200 of the new loans, 
whose balances will average about $100,000. That would expose the thrift to 
losses of as much as $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rinehart and some financial analysts say Home Savings' move is a savvy one 
designed to head off the higher losses that would result if homeowners 
abandoned their properties in droves. The riskier loans are expected to be made 
to homeowners with little equity left in dwellings that were badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings is the first large Southern California lender to admit that the 
earthquake will have a major impact on its profit. Until now, lenders have 
generally said the quake would not cause significant financial damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if it was considering new kinds of loans for quake victims, a Great 
Western Bank spokesman said Tuesday that the bank was "still reviewing all 
possibilities." Other major lenders were not available for comment or did not 
return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Rinehart said Home Savings will have a more precise figure 
for quake-related loan losses at the end of March, when its first quarter ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be something that will be visible, in the millions of dollars," he 
said. "But what number you put in front of the millions is not known . . . at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 With about 32,000 borrowers in quake-affected areas, Home Savings said about 
370 of those have homes that are reported to be "seriously damaged." About 
two-thirds of the homes have been inspected, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings is offering two new kinds of loans to the vast majority of its 
borrowers who have adjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate borrowers are not 
eligible because Home Savings usually sells those loans to institutional 
investors and cannot unilaterally alter their terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The first new loan is a 12-month "bridge loan" designed for borrowers with 
sufficient equity in their property to qualify for more debt or for those 
eligible for federal quake assistance programs. These loans, which require no 
monthly payments and carry a below-market interest rate, can be paid off at the 
end of a year or added to a first mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 The second loan type, which involves much more risk and is expected to result 
in the losses, is aimed at borrowers with little or no equity remaining in 
their houses because of falling property values. These loans will cover the 
amount of repairs and will carry no interest charges or payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Home Savings would receive a second mortgage on the property that would be 
repaid if property values increased. If the value rises above the 
first-mortgage amount when the home is sold, the difference will be split 50-50 
between the owner and lender until the entire amount of the second mortgage is 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 First Boston thrift analyst David B. Hilder said Home Savings is "making a 
rational economic calculation. It is better to provide funds for good borrowers 
with good credit histories to fix up their houses because those people are 
likely to keep making payments on their original loans." 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that (the anticipated loan losses) would be a lot less of a hit 
than if the guy walked from the property," said Joseph A. Jolson, an analyst 
with Montgomery Securities.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TAKING STOCK OF THE LOSSES; MANUFACTURING: 
THOUSANDS OF SMALL INDUSTRIAL FIRMS ARE STRUGGLING TO RECOVER.

<P>
 The Northridge earthquake hit Devon Industries, a maker of medical supplies in 
Chatsworth, like a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of seconds, the building's concrete roof parking lot collapsed 
into the 45,000-square-foot main manufacturing plant, burying the firm's 
machinery, inventory and injection molds in tons of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw it the first time, I went home and I cried," said Dan Sandel, the 
company's owner. "Then I came back and said we have to put it back together. 
What else can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: Devon, which owns its own building, had no earthquake insurance 
because it was too expensive. Now Sandel wonders where he will find the 
estimated $5 million to $10 million he needs to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the attention following the Jan. 17 quake has focused on the suffering 
of displaced residents and disruptions to the area's freeway system. But 
another story has been quietly unfolding: that of the industrial and commercial 
disruption caused by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of firms like Devon were hurt by the quake -- little-known 
industrial firms near the epicenter that are not glamorous but nevertheless 
provide good-paying jobs and are a key part of the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 As these firms clean up and make repairs, their supporters argue that too 
little attention is being paid to their plight. 
</P>
<P>
 About 177,000 firms lie within 20 miles of the earthquake's epicenter and 
employ more than 1.6 million people -- more than 200,000 of them in 
manufacturing, according to Dun & Bradstreet, the business information company. 
</P>
<P>
 With Southern California in its fourth year of recession, many of those firms 
were showing signs of financial strain even before the quake, according to Dun 
& Bradstreet economist David T. Kresge.  
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, many have little or no insurance. "This could mean a 
long and troubled recovery for these businesses, if they can recover at all," 
Kresge said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Building and Safety Department estimated that 4,068 commercial 
structures suffered earthquake damage at an estimated cost of $582 million. But 
the damage is probably more extensive: So far, about 42,000 businesses of all 
kinds have requested disaster assistance loan packages, said John Rooney, 
president of the Valley Economic Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney said many of the firms will fall through the cracks of disaster 
assistance programs. The limit for most Small Business Administration disaster 
loans is $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials say they are doing all they can to help quake victims. "I've 
heard this a lot -- that this program doesn't fit, that program doesn't fit," 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said. "You've got to put programs together 
in order to achieve your purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Without aid, many stricken firms may be forced to move out of the state or 
close, business executives said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know we're all focusing on housing and rebuilding the freeways, but the 
problem is that all these companies out there translate into good-paying jobs, 
which we can't afford to lose," said Benjamin Reznik, a Sherman Oaks lawyer and 
past chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. "And we're about to 
lose them . . . if we can't help them get back on their feet."  
</P>
<P>
 For some, like Devon, the quake may mean the permanent loss of jobs. Before 
the quake, Devon employed 350 people in Chatsworth who made plastic molded 
surgical supplies, bringing in more than $60 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the company has moved production to plants in Ohio and elsewhere in 
Southern California. But Sandel has been forced to lay off 106 of his workers 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 He is seeking help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the SBA and 
his bank for loans. But, like other afflicted executives, he worries about the 
effect such loans will have on his ability to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really required," he said, "is a special reconstruction fund, with low 
interest rates . . . outside of the normal requirements of an ongoing concern 
for day-to-day operations."  
</P>
<P>
 For others with less damage, the quake nevertheless means delays and setbacks. 
Gary Swanson arrived at the Banner Pharmacaps manufacturing plant in Chatsworth 
to a sticky, smelly mess the morning of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson, corporate vice president of the $45-million company that makes 
gelatin vitamin and medicinal capsules, found the floor covered in half a foot 
of greenish goo spilled from holding vats. In a warehouse, boxes of finished 
capsules had fallen off racks into the aisles and lay in piles four feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 It took eight days to clean the plant, and only now is it getting back to full 
production. Swanson figures the 250-employee company's output has been set back 
about a month. While executives are still tallying the costs, he says they will 
be at least $1 million, only part of it insured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were running at full capacity as it was, so there's very little we can do 
to catch up," Swanson said. "It's a bit of an uphill battle." 
</P>
<P>
 For some firms, the quake may be the factor that finally propels them out of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Hill Industries, the parent firm of Hill Aviation Logistics and Hill 
Aviation & Defense, which makes parts for military and civilian aircraft, 
including Bell helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's leased 70,000-square-foot building in Chatsworth sustained major 
structural damage when walls bowed out, causing ceiling beams to slip off their 
supports and opening gaps in the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent rains inundated offices and the back shop. Company officials 
complain that repairs have been delayed because city inspectors have arrived 
during off hours when no one was around. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives have been relocated to safer rooms, and production has resumed on a 
limited basis to fill orders. The firm employs about 20 people and has just 
under $6 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which had been weathering the region's defense industry cutbacks 
by restructuring, had been considering moving to Carlsbad to cut costs, 
spokeswoman Jennifer A. McKissick said, and the quake adds one more reason to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't been planning on moving," she said, "it would not have prompted 
us to do so."  
</P>
<P>
 For others, the quake forced quick improvising. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor virtually demolished an industrial warehouse-office building in 
Woodland Hills, which housed two toy companies and a computer firm, sending the 
roof crashing down through false ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, Arnie Rubin, president of Funrise Toy Corp., gingerly picked 
through the debris on the sodden carpet of the suite that once housed his 
company's headquarters, now open to the blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Foot-thick beams and six-inch water mains now rest ominously on desks or 
chairs where workers would have been sitting had the quake struck four hours 
later. The company's products still sit in soggy boxes on warehouse shelves: 
tiny fire engines, ambulances and medical evacuation helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin has wasted little time in moving his business and its 30 employees out 
of the wrecked building and into white tents in the parking lot, which will be 
the firm's home for the next three months. Fortunately, he said, most of 
Funrise's losses were insured.

CABLE GROUP SAYS PACBELL PLAN WILL HIKE PHONE RATES; TECHNOLOGY: ASSOCIATION 
CLAIMS IN COMPLAINT TO FCC THAT MODERNIZATION EFFORT WOULD LEAD TO 400% 
INCREASE TO CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 California's cable industry charges in a petition to be filed today that 
customers of Pacific Bell will face dramatically higher phone bills to pay for 
the phone company's proposed $16-billion modernization project. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell denied the claims and disputed statistics advanced by the 
California Cable Television Assn. But the legal challenge illustrated the 
turmoil faced by PacBell as it maneuvers to compete in the fast-shifting 
telecommunications marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, for example, PacBell bowed to the inevitability of increased 
competition in local service and asked the California Public Utilities 
Commission to establish rules for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable firms, long-distance companies and a host of new wireless communications 
services are all seeking to get a piece of PacBell's $3.3-billion local service 
revenues, and the California Public Utilities Commission is expected to act 
soon to open up the closed market. 
</P>
<P>
 "To believe that we can stay where we are now and not see an erosion in our 
business, I think, is a false hope," said Bruce Jamison, a PacBell vice 
president. "We need to get the rules in place so that we can compete on an even 
footing." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition by the cable lobby -- whose own turf is threatened by PacBell's 
proposed expansion -- asks the Federal Communications Commission to block the 
phone company's plans on grounds that it is against the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe if PacBell is successful in getting approval for this plan, local 
telephone costs will go up another 400% over what they are today," said Alan J. 
Gardner, a cable association vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable operators' legal challenge is likely to intensify the regulatory 
oversight of how companies go about modernizing the ballyhooed information 
highway as federal and state policy-makers debate the hows and whens of more 
competition in the burgeoning telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell maintains that the cost of its new network -- which averages 
about $2,900 for each of the 5.5 million Californians it will serve by the year 
2000 -- is so low that it needs no state regulatory approval. PacBell says it 
can substitute coaxial and fiber-optic cable for its existing copper wire 
network without raising telephone rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cable group argues that of the average $2,900 PacBell proposes to 
spend per home to modernize its network, the per-home expenditure for video 
dial tone amounted to just $136 or 5% of the total -- far lower than the 30% to 
40% other phone companies have allocated for video service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that 95% of this new network is for video, but only 5% of the 
costs are assigned to video," Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Bennett, PacBell's director of broad band infrastructure policy, disputed 
the cable operators' estimate of the project's cost allocations but wouldn't 
say what the correct breakdown is. He also said the phone company's rates are 
still restricted by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our prices are capped under incentive regulation, and we can't just raises 
prices to pay for this," Bennett said. "Now we make the investments as we see 
appropriate and we take the risks whether they are good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
 PacBell's fate before the FCC is being closely watched by other phone 
companies such as NYNEX and BellSouth Corp. The telephone stampede to offer 
video programming is driven by the belief that movies and cable fare will be 
far more profitable than telephone service.

JAMES FLANIGAN: NEW MEDIA AGE NEEDS GENIUS, NOT CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The future is always different from the present, but you'd never know it from 
the goings-on in "multimedia." A Digital Hollywood conference has been running 
for three days in Beverly Hills, with participants discussing topics such as 
"Cable, Studios and Networks -- Controlling the 500 Channel Environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investors across the nation ponder the sale of Paramount 
Communications for more than $10 billion -- the winning suitor to be crowned 
Monday. Movie studios are hot. Ted Turner recently acquired two small ones and 
would like to make bigger deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gigantic telephone companies join the bidding for Paramount, invest in studios 
or acquire cable television firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim is control. Buyers of studios want to control film libraries so they 
can supply movies on demand in the new age of expanded television. The cable 
and phone companies want control of the wires into your home, the highways on 
which information will travel. 
</P>
<P>
 But, incredibly, all those efforts are misguided. The big money and bright 
people are chasing illusions if they think they're truly buying a place in 
tomorrow's media industry. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, control is the wrong word in the Information Age. There will be 
many highways, frustrating big investors who think they're buying a monopoly 
line to homes. Personalized information will come to you through hand-held 
devices -- or conventional telephones or personal computers or interactive 
television sets or public outlets similar to bank automated teller machines, 
says Marc Porat, president of General Magic, a Mountain View, Calif., firm that 
is developing wireless communications systems for Apple Computer, AT&T, 
Matsushita, Motorola, Philips and Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 Control was the model of the telephone system's early days, notes Porat, and 
that is one reason the telephone evolved slowly. "In contrast," he says, "the 
personal computer tapped into the imagination of millions of people" and has 
developed rapidly.  
</P>
<P>
 Programming will be different, too. The idea that interactive media will 
simply show old movies is utterly lacking in imagination. "That's the old 
passive technology," says Stan Cornyn, executive vice president of Media Vision 
of Fremont, Calif. The firm adds sound and video qualities to personal 
computers and produces interactive videos -- called titles, not programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new medium will be a two-way one. "It will increase user involvement in 
stories or events," says Cornyn, who is working on an interactive version of 
Dante's "Inferno." 
</P>
<P>
 Style will be different, just as television was different from radio. In the 
early days of television, radio comedians Jack Benny and Fred Allen and their 
verbal humor were brought into the new medium. And they were good, but 
ex-vaudevillian Milton Berle and Lucille Ball, with her sight gags, were 
better. They were attuned to the new medium. 
</P>
<P>
 New technologies make new winners. The movie studios must have seemed logical 
candidates to dominate television. But it was radio companies, CBS, RCA and ABC 
who developed the new medium. So far, electronics and computer companies, not 
movie makers, are dominating interactive media, although it's likely that a 
growing need for story content will expand Hollywood's role. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will remain a business of new technology, not old movies. Right now, 
greater computer processing power must be developed to realize interactive's 
true possibilities; the titles that Media Vision and others make are 
technically crude. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is a fledgling industry to look at. There are roughly 6 million 
CD-ROM drives, costing $200 and up apiece, attached to personal computers in 
the United States. And each owner might buy three CD-ROM titles a year, at 
about $30 each. That adds up to a $1.7-billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful CD-ROM title so far is "The Seventh Guest," a mystery 
story and video game from Trilobyte Productions, a small Medford, Ore., firm. 
The game, which can take 40 hours to play, has sold 450,000 copies at roughly 
$45 each. That makes it a product worth $20 million in total revenue, yet it 
was produced for less than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the kind of margin that sets visions of sugar plums dancing in 
Hollywood -- where an average film costs $30 million to make and only a 
"Jurassic Park" approaches the 20-1 return of "Seventh Guest." 
</P>
<P>
 What's the next attraction? Not movies but theme park rides, electronically 
simulated and presented in smaller neighborhood theaters, says Andrew Kessler, 
a managing director of Unterberg Harris, a San Francisco investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, simulators of theme park attractions, such as Burbank's Iwerks 
Entertainment, sell simulation theaters to Las Vegas hotels, Walt Disney Co. 
and Universal Studios. Soon, says Kessler, a downsized theme park will be in 
neighborhood storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrills will come from the interactive video's ability to involve the 
user, to make your palms sweat as you steer the spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
 The more things change, as the saying goes. Talk of storefront attractions 
recalls New York's 2nd Avenue at the beginning of this century, where immigrant 
entrepreneurs began today's movie industry in nickelodeon theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 That industry hit it big with "Birth of a Nation" in 1915, an epic film that, 
as Stan Cornyn puts it, "made people look up and see that something new was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia doesn't have its "Birth of a Nation" yet, and the Information Age 
doesn't have its highway, either. 
</P>
<P>
 But they'll have breakthroughs. And when they do, it won't be from following 
present models, but thanks to "geniuses who will intuitively employ the new 
technology on its own terms," says Porat. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, buyers of studios and telecom-cable monopolies will find that it 
can be very expensive to invest in old technology.

 Chip Business Increases: The Semiconductor Industry Assn.'s closely watched 
book-to-bill ratio for January jumped to 1.07, up from 1.04 in December.Over 
the last several years, the January ratio has been up from December's. A 
book-to-bill ratio of 1.07 indicates that for every $100 in semiconductor 
shipments to the U.S. market, chip makers received $107 in new orders. A ratio 
above 1 indicates that the market is expanding. Bookings, based on a 
three-month moving average, were $2.456 billion, up 6% from $2.317 billion in 
December.

 USAir Cuts Fares: The airline slashed fares in the eastern United States by as 
much as 70% for leisure travelers in response to competition from Continental 
and Southwest airlines. The cuts also apply to unrestricted fares popular with 
business travelers, who can expect savings of up to 50% on routes between 96 
cities. American and Trans World Airlines said they would match the USAir fares 
on competing routes.

 State Home Sales Forecast Revised Upward: Reversing their earlier projections, 
economists at the California Assn. of Realtors said the figure should climb 
2.4% this year but that the price of a typical home should ease 2.5% to 
$184,150.In its initial forecast in September, the group said sales would 
probably drop 2.4% in 1994 and that prices would fall a steeper 3.1%. The 
upward revision was based on stronger-than-expected recent sales trends and an 
improving economy in both California and the rest of the United States, the 
association said. Sales in the state rose 2.2% in 1993 from 1992, it said, but 
the median price of a home fell 4.3% to $188,870.

 Princess Cruises to Build Two New Ships: The Los Angeles-based cruise line 
said it will spend nearly $700 million for the new Italian-made passenger 
vessels as part of a plan to boost capacity 70%.The company said the ships, 
which are to begin service in 1997, will help it remain competitive in the face 
of expansion by other major lines. Carnival Cruise Lines, the nation's largest, 
has six vessels under construction. One of the two new Princess ships -- a 
2,500 passenger, 90,000-ton vessel -- will cost $385 million and rank as one of 
the largest passenger ships ever built. The company also has an option to build 
a third ship.

 Sears Has Record Annual Profit; Mattel Reports Loss in Quarter: Sears, Roebuck 
& Co. announced that it vaulted from its worst year ever in 1992 to a record 
profit of $2.37 billion in 1993. The results, equal to $6.13 per share, 
contrast with a loss of $3.93 billion, or $10.72 per share, in 1992.In the 
fourth quarter, Sears had net income of $544.6 million, or $1.39 per share, 
contrasted with a net loss of $1.8 billion, or $4.84 per share, in the fourth 
quarter of 1992. Separately, Mattel Inc. reported a $42.7-million 
fourth-quarter loss, citing the costs of acquiring toy maker Fisher-Price Inc. 
The loss of 26 cents per share for the merged company contrasts with a profit 
of $49.6 million, or 28 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. 
Fourth-quarter sales rose to $753.9 million from $727 million. For the year, 
the merged company's earnings fell to $117.2 million, or 66 cents per share, 
from $184.8 million, or $1.04 per share, in 1992. Sales rose to $2.7 billion 
from $2.56 billion.

 Main points of the $140-billion economic stimulus package announced Tuesday by 
Japan: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tax cuts: Reductions will total $54 billion. Each Japanese will receive a 
20% tax refund this year, up to a maximum of $20,400.A typical family with two 
children and a $65,000 annual income will receive about $980. 
</P>
<P>
 * Public investment: Spending will be boosted by $66.7 billion, including 
$33.2 billion in public works; $5.6 billion for education, research and medical 
facilities, and $11.1 billion for government home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restructuring: About $4.6 billion will be used to buy land, including that 
affected by factory closings. The land will be held for future private 
development. Funds will also increase for aid to small businesses, agriculture 
and job restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial sector: A new organization will help banks temporarily transfer 
bad loans off their books, thereby improving their balance sheets and 
encouraging new lending while the banks undergo restructuring.

NEWS ANALYSIS; HOSOKAWA PLAN LIFTS GROWTH HOPES FROM ZERO; JAPAN: PROGRAM COULD 
BENEFIT BUSINESSES, FARMS AND BANKS. ANALYSTS SEE IT AS A BARE NECESSITY.

 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa won some political breathing space Tuesday, 
when his fractious ruling coalition agreed on a $140-billion economic stimulus 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 But doubts remain over how much the program will help the Japanese economy -- 
and that means it may also be of limited value to Hosokawa when he meets with 
President Clinton in Washington on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has pressed Japan to take strong measures to boost domestic 
demand, which should draw in imports and help reduce Japan's huge trade surplus 
with the United States, estimated at about $55 billion last year. Pressure to 
correct the imbalance was further intensified with the news Monday that Japan's 
current-account surplus had widened to a record $131.35 billion in 1993 from 
$117.55 billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Tuesday that Japan's economic 
stimulus plan may not be enough to spark any substantial increase in Japanese 
demand for U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a modest step," he said. "Every little bit helps . . . (but) it 
remains to be seen whether this package will be adequate to spur strong 
domestic demand and to reduce the (trade imbalance) significantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese government and private-sector predictions as to how much the 
stimulating measures will boost Japan's economy this year range from about 0.6% 
to 2.2%. Growth predictions hover near zero without such a package, so that 
means many observers expect the government effort to account for most of 
Japan's growth this year -- and that, even with the measures, growth could be 
very anemic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is already showing some symptoms of picking up by itself," said a 
Ministry of Finance official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. 
"Boosted by this package, I'm pretty sure the Japanese economy will recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Barker, an analyst with Baring Securities Ltd., agreed that the 
package should aid a modest recovery already starting to unfold. "January car 
sales were particularly encouraging," he said. "This package is adding fuel to 
the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Others reacted with less confidence. "The economy is flabby. (Government 
action) is not going to have the kind of impact that people are looking for," 
said Paul Summerville, an economist at Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is that the plan's income tax cuts -- worth $49 billion and 
retroactive to Jan. 1 -- are a sure thing only for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling parties agreed to try to decide by the end of the year on some kind 
of balancing tax increase. The presumption is that if agreement is reached on 
increasing some other tax, the lower income tax rates will be extended 
indefinitely. But the specter of a future tax increase may chill consumers' 
willingness to spend the extra money they get now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The government's stimulus measures are to be financed by deficit bonds, over 
what had been strong objections from the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The package has three broad parts addressing various aspects of Japan's 
economic ills. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest portion -- worth about $120 billion -- consists of tax cuts and 
spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $20 billion is allocated to various programs whose main purpose is to 
address structural problems. These include funds to ease land transactions 
between private parties, measures to help small businesses adjust to changing 
conditions, employer subsidies to fight growing unemployment, aid to farmers 
adjusting to liberalization of food imports and help for banks burdened with 
too many bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The third part of the package consists of policy measures, such as steps 
toward deregulating the economy and further opening Japanese markets to foreign 
goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Tokyo stock exchange, news of the government's stimulus plan helped 
push the Nikkei index up 237 points, or 1.2%, to 20,251 at the close of trading 
Tuesday.

 State Farm's Quake Damage Estimate is $600 Million: The company, by far 
California's largest seller of earthquake insurance, estimated that its losses 
in the Northridge quake will be at least that amount, making it the 
second-worst disaster in the company's history.Bloomington, Ill.-based State 
Farm Insurance Co. paid out $3.6 billion in claims from Hurricane Andrew in 
1989. More than 80,000 claims are expected to be field in connection with the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, the company said. After State Farm, the next-hardest-hit 
insurer is Allstate Insurance, which has estimated its quake-related losses at 
$350 million.

B OF A DEPOSIT RECORDS LOST IN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crash of a charter flight off the California coast near Del Mar on Monday 
night has thrown Bank of America's record-keeping in San Diego into a state of 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 On board the plane were records of a major portion of the commercial and 
consumer deposits made Monday by Bank of America customers throughout San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Cynthia Rice, 32, was still missing and presumed dead Tuesday afternoon 
when the U.S. Coast Guard called off its search for the twin-engine Cessna 
charter operated by Pacific Air Charter. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's San Diego-area customers who made deposits Monday were told Tuesday 
that they may have to present documentary evidence of their deposits to be 
credited with the transactions. Customers were asked to call the toll-free 
number on their statements to learn the status of their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working with the affected customers in going through a reconstruction 
process, asking for their help in re-creating the transaction," a Bank of 
America spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But one of BofA's commercial customers, who asked that his name not be used, 
complained that the bank was not being aggressive enough in contacting 
customers to warn them of possible snafus from the loss of the records. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bank of America's checks and deposit slips are handled locally, the 
bank's transactions are recorded electronically at one of the the bank's two 
processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The records lost Monday were en route to the BofA facility in Los Angeles.

2 HELD IN INVESTMENT FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The co-owner of a San Fernando Valley real estate investment concern believed 
by authorities to have defrauded 500 clients of $100 million was arrested 
Tuesday on charges of grand theft, money laundering and securities law 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said the suspect, 
businessman Stanley I. Glickman, 54, of Beverly Hills, was one of the 
masterminds behind a scheme that victimized many prominent Westside investors, 
including relatives of the company's operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the company Glickman once ran, Encino-based Property Mortgage 
Co., went into a downward spiral around 1983 that led to an involuntary 
bankruptcy filing in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested Tuesday was Glickman's brother-in-law, Jeffrey A. Fine, 46, of 
Hollywood Hills. Fine worked as a salesman for Property Mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with SLGH Investments, an affiliated company, Property Mortgage 
placed investors in real estate deals. When the business went sour, it 
degenerated into "basically a Ponzi scheme," Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent Collier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were paying off old investors with new investors' money," he said. "They 
eventually got to the point where they weren't taking in enough money to pay 
off the old investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were in custody pending the posting of bail. Lawyers for the 
defendants could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still being sought by authorities was 78-year-old Elliot R. Fine of Beverly 
Hills, Glickman's father-in-law and Jeffrey's father, as well as a partner in 
Property Mortgage. Officials said they plan to arrest him when he returns from 
a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also charged is Jeffrey Fine's younger brother, Steven B. Fine, another 
salesman for the firm. The defendants face terms of eight to 12 years in prison 
if convicted, Collier said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HOT, HEALTHIER LATIN MARKETS ATTRACTING CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rain of dollars falling on stocks worldwide has become a virtual torrent 
in Latin American markets this year. And many pros see further significant 
gains ahead for the region's shares, as global investors swarm there.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Mexican stock market's Bolsa index jumped to yet another new 
high, rising 56.77 points to 2,881.17. While most major world markets plunged 
on Monday in the wake of the U.S. market's Friday tumble, Mexican stocks all 
but ignored Wall Street's slump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa now is up 10.7% so far this year, versus a mere 1% rise in the U.S. 
market's Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-volatile Brazilian market also has been red hot this year, with 
prices rocketing 40% in dollar terms. In Argentina, the Buenos Aires market is 
up almost 14%, while Chilean shares have soared 25% on average, according to 
Morgan Stanley Capital International. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latin American bourses' gains are in sharp contrast to the plunge in many 
smaller Asian markets this year, which have been hit hard by profit-taking 
after surging in 1993. Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index, for example, is off 
4% this year; Thailand's SET index has plunged 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Latin America is benefiting directly from the trouble in Asian 
markets, many money managers say. "I think what happened is that a lot of Asian 
markets reached very expensive valuations at the end of 1993," says Josephine 
Jimenez, co-manager of the Montgomery Emerging Markets stock fund in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So when global investors looked around for better ideas as 1994 began, Mexico, 
Brazil, Argentina and other Latin markets stood out, Jimenez says. Brazilian 
stocks, for example, were trading at about 14 times estimated 1994 earnings per 
share when the year began, even after rising sharply in 1993. In contrast, some 
Asian markets were priced at 30 or more times '94 estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, with the Federal Reserve's decision last week to tighten credit, 
global stock managers appear to view Asian markets as net losers and Latin 
markets as net winners. The reason: Some Asian nations tie their currencies to 
the dollar, effectively tying their interest rates to U.S. rates, too. 
Meanwhile, Latin American interest rates are already high, so Wall Street sees 
room for them to drop even if U.S. rates inch up. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Fed's new stance boosted belief in the vitality of the 
U.S. economic boomlet, which will inevitably help pull up Latin American 
economies as well.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the real appeal of Latin markets lies in the promise of continuing 
economic rebirth after the "lost decade" of the '80s. The spread of democracy, 
business privatization and open capital and import-export markets has created 
vast new investment potential in Latin America, and that is what global money 
managers are responding to. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in November helped refocus 
investors not just on Mexico, but on all Latin economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors used to buy Latin stocks simply because, while risky, they were 
cheap, says Gilman Gunn, manager of the Boston-based Keystone Fund of the 
Americas, which invests in U.S. and Latin stocks. Now, he says, "We have a 
situation where the valuations are less compelling, but the risk is much less 
as well"--because the economic turnarounds in Mexico, Argentina and Chile are 
for real. Brazil, Wall Street hopes, is next. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, buyers of Latin American stocks shouldn't forget that these still 
are young--and very volatile--markets. Political problems are ever-present, as 
demonstrated by the rebel uprising in Mexico's Chiapas state in early January. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Perry, research chief at Baring Securities in Mexico City, says Mexican 
investors still are quite worried about the Chiapas affair, even as foreign 
investors continue to pour into Mexican stocks. After the uprising, Perry says, 
nine Mexican brokerages advised their domestic clients to sell stocks, while 
foreign brokerages saw the market's brief slide as a great time to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the foreigners have been right. But then, the sheer volume of money 
fighting to get into Mexico and other Latin markets may guarantee that foreign 
optimism is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: Paul Wargnier, manager of the Dean Witter/Trust Co. of the West 
Latin America fund in Los Angeles, saw $38 million in cash flow into his fund 
in December from individual investors. In January, the inflow was a stunning 
$70 million. The fund's assets currently total $333 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, Latin markets will probably face the same problem the Asian 
markets now face: overvaluation and heavy profit taking. But with the spotlight 
having shifted back to Latin markets only recently, their economies set for 
growth and U.S. investors ravenous for foreign shares, these markets have 
momentum in their favor. The Latin Funds

MAJOR FIRMS' PLANNED LAYOFFS SET RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major corporations announced 108,000 layoffs in January, the highest monthly 
level in the four years since the figures have been tracked, an outplacement 
consulting firm said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. said the level of announced 
layoffs topped even the worst of the 1990 recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies often announce their plans in the early part of the year because 
they set their budgets in the fall and begin implementing them in January. The 
announced layoffs often take months or years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The high level of announced layoffs underscores a basic trend in corporate 
America to downsize, increase efficiency and productivity and cut expenses at a 
time when profit growth has been slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although consumer confidence is reportedly at record levels, America's work 
force continues to be subjected to a steady stream of cutback announcements," 
said James Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even industries experiencing considerable growth have selectively cut back 
workers," he said. "Employers are increasing workloads of existing employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the economy is expanding, there has been concern among economists 
about the level of job creation. The jobless rate is still at 6.7%, which is 
considered high for this stage of the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the layoff announcements might be skewing the job picture. Big 
companies tend to announce layoffs but not hiring plans. Small and medium-sized 
companies may never announce their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the largest employers that are reducing payroll in one area of 
operation are adding staff in other departments," Challenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-one percent of the layoffs were concentrated in the East, among 
companies with headquarters in Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs announced in January were up sharply from the 31,389 in December. 
The previous highest number was in January, 1993, when 103,217 job cuts were 
announced, mostly because of 50,000 cutbacks at Sears, Roebuck & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest job cuts so far in 1994 were in the communications industry, with 
17,000 at GTE Corp. alone. Nynex Corp. also announced 16,800 cutbacks, and 
Pacific Telesis Group 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major layoffs during January were at Scott Paper Co., which 
announced plans to cut one-forth of its work force, or 8,300 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing Co., constrained by low orders from the weak airline industry, also 
announced 7,000 cuts.

PRODUCTIVITY INDEX RISES MODERATELY; OUTPUT: DESPITE SURGE IN LATTER HALF OF 
'93, THE 1.6% GAIN IS HALF THAT OF '92. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The productivity of American workers increased a moderate 1.6% last year, just 
half as fast as in 1992, when it grew at the steepest pace in two decades, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Labor Department report showed productivity rising at a brisk 4.2% 
seasonally adjusted annual rate in the final three months, even better than the 
4% jump from July through September. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said the annual increase in productivity -- defined as output 
per number of hours worked -- was the fourth straight, following a revised gain 
of 3.1% in 1992 and gains of 1.1% in 1991 and 0.4% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 advance originally was estimated at 2.7%. Productivity fell 0.9% in 
1989, the first drop in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Commerce Department reported that sales at the wholesale level 
weakened in December for the first time in three months, while stocks of unsold 
goods rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales fell 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted $161.03 billion after a revised 0.4% 
rise in November, which previously had been reported as a much stronger 1% 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Total inventories at wholesalers rose 0.4% in December to a seasonally 
adjusted $217 billion following a 0.5% increase in November. Inventories had 
fallen in October by 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to 
liquidate stocks at the current sales pace, rose in December to 1.35 months 
from 1.33 months in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists maintain that increased productivity is essential for improved 
living standards and to make American products more competitive in overseas 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Productivity helps boost living standards by restraining inflation. Continued 
gains tend to keep labor costs down. Labor represents about two-thirds of the 
cost of a product. 
</P>
<P>
 Unit labor costs rose 1.9% in 1993, down slightly from 2% a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But the improvement in productivity is coming at the expense of American jobs, 
as many companies restructure and shrink their work forces in efforts to 
increase long-term efficiency.

 Germany's central bank said it will not be forced to ease monetary policy for 
the sake of the economy, but some analysts see a good chance that German 
interest rates will come down this week. In its report for the month of 
January, the bank said it will continue to use carefully any scope for interest 
rate changes that emerges from economic and monetary developments. The bank's 
central council is due to meet Thursday in a regular session to review policy, 
including interest rate levels.

 The January figure marks a postwar record and approaches the dramatic levels 
last seen during the Weimar Republic that ushered in Nazi dictatorship. The 
Federal Labor Office said the unadjusted total was 4.03 million people 
unemployed, up from 3.69 million in December. German politicians and 
commentators in recent weeks have been drawing increasingly frequent parallels 
to the 5-million level of the 1930s that helped bring Adolf Hitler to power.

BRIEFING BOOK / WILLIAM R. LONG: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; CHILE FOUNDATION JOINS 
ALLIANCES TO EXPAND, DEVELOP EXPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG

<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: Among the many schemes for fostering economic development in Latin 
America, perhaps none has been more imaginative -- or practical -- than 
Fundacion Chile (Chile Foundation). It isn't the Peace Corps, it isn't a 
government subsidy program, it isn't foreign aid.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a nonprofit corporation known for its success in pioneering business 
ventures aimed at transferring technology and diversifying the country's 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was formed 17 years ago, the foundation has started 31 businesses and 
helped stimulate Chile's growing entrepreneurial prowess through the examples 
of those companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilean capitalists have become so aggressively competitive that the need for 
Fundacion Chile as a creator of companies is diminishing. As a result, the 
foundation is now helping with risk assessment, management training, consulting 
services, technical assistance and technological research and development. 
BACKGROUND: Chile's economy was a mess in 1973, when the military seized power 
in a violent coup against an elected government led by Socialists and 
Communists. The overthrown government had expropriated the Chilean Telephone 
Co. from ITT Corp., and the new government paid ITT more than $100 million in 
compensation for the nationalized company. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, the government and ITT joined forces to start Fundacion Chile, each 
contributing half of a $50-million endowment. ITT managed the foundation for 
its first 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31 businesses that Fundacion Chile has started since 1976 are mostly in 
agriculture, seafood production, forestry and wood products. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the ventures have been remarkably successful at transferring 
productive technology to Chile and developing new export lines. In salmon 
farming, for example, Fundacion Chile helped pioneer an industry that has made 
Chile the world's No. 2 exporter of the fish, after Norway. It has also 
contributed to expansion of Chilean berry exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important have been the foundation's services to the private sector in 
areas such as quality control and certification, technical research and 
marketing studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundacion Chile's success is widely recognized in Latin America. The group is 
often contracted for consultations, project planning and training. "We are 
providing help to almost all countries in Latin America," said Juan Eduardo 
Prado, the foundation's corporate affairs manager. In neighboring Bolivia, 
Fundacion Chile helped plan Fundacion Bolivia Exporta, a similar foundation 
that is supported by the World Bank and the Netherlands. OUTLOOK: Companies 
created by the foundation that have served their demonstration purposes are 
sold off to private investors. A dozen have already been sold. One of them, a 
salmon farm and processing operation, went to Nippon Suisan Kaisha of Tokyo for 
$22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 More foundation companies in seafood and agribusiness are being offered for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a salmon company that is ready to go," said Anthony Wylie, Fundacion 
Chile's director general.  
</P>
<P>
 At midyear, after the harvest season, the foundation hopes to sell a 200-acre 
farm with drip irrigation and sprinkler systems. The farm produces raspberries, 
blackberries, currants and asparagus. Also for sale will be a produce export 
company with freezing and cold-storage plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, although the foundation plans to put less emphasis on starting new 
companies, Wylie said it will still be looking for good joint ventures. 
STRATEGY: Fundacion Chile seeks to make alliances designed for technology 
transfer and marketing. The idea is to join forces with businesses abroad that 
already have experience in market niches that can be supplied by Chilean 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation can provide some investment capital and local technical 
knowledge, especially in forestry, marine resources and agribusiness. It also 
offers contacts and experience in the Chilean business environment. In return, 
it is looking for technology with an assured foreign market that can be 
assimilated and adapted to Chilean production conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking for wacky inventions. We're looking for things that have 
been proven . . . to be commercially viable," said Wylie, an Anglo Chilean with 
a doctorate in plant physiology from University of California, Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the foundation's strategy is to seek ways of adding value to Chilean 
products before they are exported, such as making furniture parts from wood or 
processing fish, fruits and vegetables. "It could be juices; it could be 
different ways of packaging fresh products," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the foundation is not the right partner for a project, it could help find a 
Chilean company that would be, Wylie said.  
</P>
<P>
 For some investment projects, touching base with Fundacion Chile could be a 
worthwhile step. The sectors in which the group specializes are among the most 
dynamic and promising in the Chilean economy -- but also among the most 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation offers a range of options for collaboration and service 
designed to reduce investment risk.

 The Anglo-French company announced that it will miss another opening deadline 
but admitted that this time there was nobody to blame but itself. The company 
said it will be unable to meet the March 7 start of freight service and might 
even have to delay the May 8 start of passenger service because its testing 
program is taking longer than planned.But co-Chairman Andre Benard told French 
radio that he still hopes freight services can start in March. The official 
state opening on May 6 of the $14.82-billion project will go on as planned, and 
Eurotunnel said it is working to start up services soon after that deadline. 
The English Channel tunnel project, more than 30 miles long, has been dogged by 
delays.

THE SURGE TO LAST YEAR'S MORTGAGE REFINANCING FRENZY AND AN IMPROVING ECONOMY.

 First American Financial Corp., powered by last summer's wave of mortgage 
refinancing in California and an improving economy elsewhere, reported record 
earnings and revenue for 1993 as well as for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 First American, which operates the nation's second-largest title insurance 
company, posted net income of $66.3 million last year, a 53% increase over 
earnings of $43.3 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings were so strong that net income per share rose to $5.84 a share from 
$4.55 even though the average number of shares increased 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's profit included an income tax benefit of $4.2 million, equal to 37 
cents a share, as a result of a new accounting standard. Revenue increased to 
$1.4 billion last year from $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, First American has made strategic acquisitions and 
other additions to the company's services as it prepared itself for a rebound 
in the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The year produced record numbers of refinance closings, which benefited both 
our title insurance and real estate information services segments," said Parker 
S. Kennedy, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, the company earned $20.5 million, or $1.80 a share, a 
67% increase over earnings of $12.3 million, or $1.10 a share, the previous 
year. Revenue grew 25% to $409.2 million last year from $326.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 First American offers title insurance through First American Title Insurance 
Co., a 104-year-old company that has a network of more than 300 offices and 
4,000 agents throughout the United States, and in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, 
Guam, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Related First American companies provide tax monitoring, home warranty, credit 
reporting and property information services for both buyers and lenders. The 
company also operates First American Trust Co., a trust and banking business in 
Southern California. A New High at First American

 In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, First American Financial Corp. reported

BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOBILES; DEALERSHIPS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH, COSTA MESA ARE

 The theater and the ballpark aren't the only places you need a program to keep 
the players straight. Recent changes among the car dealerships on Costa Mesa's 
Harbor Boulevard and Huntington Beach's Beach Boulevard ought to keep sign 
makers in champagne for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 University Olds-Pontiac-GMC Truck is gone; so is Norm Reeves Acura. Reeves 
went to Huntington Beach and turned into a Honda dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Miller Honda, on Beach Boulevard, disappeared, but Reeves didn't take 
over that store, which remains empty. Instead, Norm Reeves Honda Superstore 
Huntington Beach -- that's its name -- is housed in what used to be the 
Huntington Beach Acura dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 And Huntington Beach Acura is now on Harbor Boulevard in Costa Mesa, doing 
business as South Coast Acura in the old Reeves Acura facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just one too many Acura dealers around, and this was the best 
solution," said one insider. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a few blocks to the south on Harbor Boulevard, Orange Coast Jeep 
Eagle has acquired the recently closed University Olds operation, which has 
reopened under the Orange Coast banner. Dealership owner Gary Gray said he 
hasn't picked a new name for the combined operations yet, but is leaning toward 
Orange Coast Auto Center or a variation thereof.

NEC BLAMES SCHOOL CLOSURES IN YEARLY LOSS OF $9.6 MILLION; FINANCES: REVENUE 
FOR THE IRVINE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION FIRM DROPPED FROM $375 MILLION TO $355.9 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Citing the closure of 14 vocational schools because of tougher federal 
criteria for paying back student loans, National Education Corp. reported a 
1993 loss of $9.6 million dollars, or 32 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasted with a profit of $515,000, or 2 cents a share, for the 
previous year. The Irvine-based company, which operates 33 vocational schools 
across the nation, had revenue of $355.9 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 
compared to $375 million for the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, however, National Education showed income of $2 
million, or 7 cents a share, marking the first improvement in corresponding 
periods since the third quarter of 1992. For the same quarter a year earlier, 
the company showed a loss of $687,000, or 2 cents a share. The company reported 
three-month revenue of $96 million, down from $102 million for the final 
quarter of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual loss resulted in part from one-time charges including $23.6 million 
set aside to cover costs of the company's planned closing of 14 vocational 
schools. Also included was $9.2 million for a write-down of assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those losses were partially offset by a gain of $21.3 million from the initial 
public offering of stock in the company's Steck-Vaughn Publishing Corp. 
subsidiary, which makes and sells books for school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Cwiertnia, president and chief executive officer of NEC, said the 
company has stopped enrollment in about a third of its technical schools. NEC 
eventually will shut down those schools after current students have completed 
their classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students face increasing difficulty in obtaining federally guaranteed loans," 
Cwiertnia said. "We felt that, rather than attempting to do financing 
ourselves, we would cease enrollment in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, NEC stock closed at $7.13 
a share, up 25 cents.

 As part of its expansion, Orange Coast is abandoning its "never on Sunday" 
policy -- a plan that enabled Gray to slash operating costs at his Jeep-Eagle 
lot by closing down on Sundays, putting special sale prices in all the car 
windows, and letting customers browse without any interference from sales 
personnel. The Sunday prices were good on a no-dickering basis -- through 
Monday for customers who wanted to come back and make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the expanded facility -- the Oldsmobile-Pontiac-GMC Truck lot is much 
larger than the adjacent Jeep-Eagle property -- Gray plans to launch a major 
used car operation to augment his new car sales.

 Irvine-based Kia Motors America sold its first retail cars last week as the 
Kia Sephia four-door sedan officially went on sale Thursday at four stores in 
Portland, Ore. Company officials said that official numbers aren't available 
yet, but that about 20 cars were delivered to customers that day.One of the 
dealerships, Ron Tonkin Chevrolet-Geo-Kia, said it delivered four of the eight 
$9,000 to $13,000 Sephias that its customers had ordered in advance of the 
official sales launch.

 The Korean car maker, which set up its U.S. headquarters in Orange County more 
than a year ago, doesn't plan to have any dealers in California until the end 
of March, when a San Diego dealership opens. The first Los Angeles and Orange 
County stores open in April.

 The company said Tuesday that its chairman, Timothy M. Aitken, has replaced 
Victor Chaltiel as president and chief executive. Chaltiel remains on the board 
of directors, but the Costa Mesa company said that his role with Abbey is under 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaltiel became chief executive of Abbey in November when the company bought 
Torrance-based Total Pharmaceutical Care, where he serves as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rapp, Abbey's chief financial officer, would not disclose details of 
the change, saying only that "there will be clarification in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey makes home health-care equipment and drugs. Total Pharmaceutical, a 
wholly owned subsidiary, provides drugs and medical equipment for patients 
getting home infusion therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's Nasdaq trading, Abbey's stock closed at $28.88, up 38 cents.

SWEET NOTHINGS?; ONCE AGAIN, SCIENCE SAYS SUGAR DOESN'T AFFECT CHILDREN'S 
BEHAVIOR. TRY TELLING THAT TO PARENTS WHOSE KIDS BOUNCE OFF WALLS AFTER EATING 
CANDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was some bad news from the laboratory last week. Bad news, that is, if 
you are the parent, teacher or baby-sitter of a child who loves sugar. (Good 
news, if you happen to be the child.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar, science now advises us, has nothing to do with how children behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Empty calories? Yes. Rotten for growing teeth? Absolutely. But sugar does not, 
never has and never will cause temper tantrums, wild outbursts, the climbing of 
or the bouncing off walls.  
</P>
<P>
 That's what science says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, would you like to know what I say?" growls one harried mother of twins. 
"I say, they're nuts ! I say, 'Where were they last Christmas when my sons ate 
candy canes and green frosting for days and never slept?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, they were not at home with small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were say they're not sure they can swallow this latest report, 
published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. And that includes 
some parents whose children participated in what has been billed as the sugar 
study to end all sugar studies. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the outcome of the research on her son, Forrest, and 47 other 
kids, Linda Alexander of Iowa City, Iowa, is enthusiastic about the protocol: 
"It was so wonderful not to have to cook! They supplied all our meals for nine 
weeks. And we saved enough money on food to buy a play structure for the back 
yard."  
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander, who says her 9-year-old son is so "sugar-sensitive" that for a 
time she was forced to padlock the family's sweets, is more cautious in her 
assessment of the findings. "We believe that the results are accurate . . . as 
far as they go. We believe they need to continue looking at this question." 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely, say researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the 
University of Iowa. "A dead issue," says Dr. Judith Rapoport of the National 
Institute of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted in 1989, is the latest of many to conclude that consuming 
large amounts of sugar does not make children hyperactive. 
</P>
<P>
 The research involved 25 children ages 3 to 5 and 23 children ages 6 to 10. 
The older children had been identified by their parents as sensitive to sugar. 
All food was removed from the families' homes and replaced weekly with food 
prepared by the research team. The families spent three weeks on each of three 
diets -- one with sugar, one with NutraSweet and one with saccharin sweetening. 
Neither the families nor the researchers knew which diets they were on. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each week, the children's behavior was evaluated -- and no 
evidence was found that eating sugar made any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But mothers -- especially those whose children were not part of the study -- 
aren't buying its conclusions. After all, haven't they been hiding the Pop 
Tarts and rationing the Halloween candy for years?  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, just because they've said it again doesn't make it any truer, does it?" 
pouts Mary Ellen Gardner, a San Fernando Valley mother of five -- two of whom 
"don't do well on sugar."  
</P>
<P>
 If those behavioral aberrations aren't coming from the sugar bowl, worries 
Gardner and others, then where do they come from? And, more importantly, what's 
to be done to curb them? 
</P>
<P>
 "No such thing as a 'sugar high,' no 'sugar rush'? Oh, right," says Henriette 
Gratteau, mother of 2-year-old twins in suburban Chicago. "I know there is. 
When I want my boys to jump up and come to the store, I toss them a couple 
Oreos. They wake right up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that sugar can be a metabolic energizer. But that does 
not normally produce a behavioral change, experts say.  
</P>
<P>
 The question is why parents' anecdotal evaluations of their kids' behavior are 
so different from that of unbiased researchers.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mark Wolraich, director of the latest sugar study, says the answer lies 
somewhere in the void between what parents believe and what can be proven in 
the laboratory.  
</P>
<P>
 One respected body of research suggests that the extra attention given to 
children on sugar-restricted diets may do more to improve behavior than 
anything else. Other studies have ruled out such demons as red dye and food 
additives as contributors to less-than-optimal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1992, Health magazine was defending sugar against its bad rap. 
"In study after study," the magazine reported, "behavior researchers have 
failed to confirm that sugar is guilty of anything worse than making children 
happy."  
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion came on the heels of research that at the time was considered 
the mother of all sugar studies. In that study, scientists equipped a group of 
preschool boys with "actometers," little battery-powered belt packs to monitor 
their every jump, twitch and turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the boys were fed refined white sugar, glucose, saccharin or 
aspartame, the actometers (as well as a team of observers) revealed that the 
boys' physical activity was the same as always.  
</P>
<P>
 If there is a flaw in this latest study, parent-critics say, it may reside in 
the study's exclusion of chocolate from both the sugared and sugar-free diets 
of the subject children.  
</P>
<P>
 "No chocolate? Are they serious?" asks Joe Garcia of Highland Park, a single 
parent of two boys. "That's where my guys get most of their sweets from anyway. 
You can't study how they act up until you see how they start carrying on after 
a whole load of chocolate."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A REMINDER OF EVIL -- AND AN APPEAL TO THE GOOD IN US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROBIN ABCARIAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, after taking myself to the movie everyone's talking about, I drove 
home feeling outraged by the world's injustices and depressed because the human 
spirit seems eternally captive to its darker side. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of "Schindler's List," I tossed around the notion of personal 
responsibility in areas large and small: What, I wondered, can one person do 
about Bosnia? About the semiautomatic gunfire we hear at night in our 
neighborhoods? About a parent who slaps a child in the grocery store? 
</P>
<P>
 How we behave with each other every day adds up. There may be no cosmic score 
card, but we do have to face ourselves in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, flyers describing acts of violence against Jews were discovered in 
lockers at two La Canada Flintridge schools. In the weeks before that, we read 
about the anti-Semitic comments of a Louis Farrakhan aide and about high 
school-aged moviegoers in Oakland who snickered as Jews were blown away by 
Nazis in "Schindler's List."  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's silly, maybe it's maudlin, but I walked out of the movie determined 
to be as good a human being as I can. 
</P>
<P>
 And isn't that the most you can ask of a movie? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" is not the best film I've ever seen. (Steven Spielberg's 
sentimentality stuck in my craw here and there -- the girl in the red dress was 
a needless manipulation. Schindler's syrupy last words to his workers were 
jarringly out of character. And factory manager Itzhak Stern's story was 
slighted.) 
</P>
<P>
 But it is certainly one of the most powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 And because of its power -- and popularity -- it has conjured more than its 
share of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago in this paper, Rabbi Eli Hecht lit a fuse when he wrote that 
"Schindler's List" should never have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am wondering," he wrote, "why Jews in Hollywood are singing the praises of 
'Schindler's List' and its sanctifying of Oskar Schindler. He should be shown 
for what he was, a war profiteer, an opportunist, a carpetbagger of the worst 
kind, and not a 'righteous Gentile.' . . . There is no enlightenment to be 
gained from seeing Jews as victims over and over again. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not how the movie struck me. In fact, at this moment, when we have all 
internalized the psychotherapeutic vernacular, "Schindler's List" shines a 
high-intensity beam on the line separating "victim" and "survivor." 
</P>
<P>
 We love survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not love victims. 
</P>
<P>
 So when you have been victimized, you must shout about it, you must teach it, 
film it, sing it, dance it. You tell, you tell, you tell. You don't forget, 
because bearing witness to pain and loss -- when it's safe to do so -- is how 
you become a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holocaust was not just a Jewish disaster. It was a human disaster. 
"Schindler's List" is not about victims -- it is about how victims became 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it merely the story of more than 1,100 Jews saved from death by an 
amoral enigma of a man. It is about human nature, about the cruelty people 
inflict on each other in the most casual ways, about the "banality of evil," in 
historian Hannah Arendt's famous words, but also about the banality of good. 
</P>
<P>
 How else to understand Schindler's comment after his last-moment rescue of 
Stern from a train bound for the death camps: "What if I'd gotten here five 
minutes later? Then where would I be?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If we are willing, "Schindler's List" can remind us of -- can inspire us 
toward -- what is good in ourselves -- empathy, compassion and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland high school students ejected from a theater for laughing during 
the movie were not laughing at the Holocaust. They were laughing at what they 
perceived to be less-than-realistic scenes of death on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 These are kids who know. And to their credit, they came back days later with a 
courageous public apology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to learn more, plus develop more sensitivity and compassion," said 
one of the students, Mirabel Corral. "We hope we get a second chance to make a 
good impression by preparing to see the film again."  
</P>
<P>
 They learned, they understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminders of the Holocaust -- whether as movies or museums -- are not an 
insult or an anchor around the spirit of a people. They are ballast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If for a moment you think that there is a moral lesson to be learned from 
'Schindler's List,' " wrote Rabbi Hecht, "tell it to E.T." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi, can you spare two dimes?

A FAMILY UNITED; PATRICK HENIGAN KEPT A SECRET FROM HIS FAMILY THAT ALMOST 
KILLED HIM. AND BECAUSE OF THAT SOLITARY EXPERIENCE, HIS PARENTS RESOLVED TO 
HELP OTHER GAY STUDENTS AT FOUNTAIN VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL WHO MAY BE GOING THROUGH 
A 'LONELY JOURNEY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Henigans wince when called the perfect family, and who could blame them? 
It's a lot of pressure to both embody and shatter the stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 The four kids are attractive high achievers, the parents involved and doting. 
Dad Mike is the Fountain Valley High School athletic director. Mom Adrienne was 
a homemaker who became a college career specialist at the high school as her 
chicks left the nest. 
</P>
<P>
 On a suburban cul-de-sac, they raised their daughters and sons -- the boys 
football stars who played college ball, the oldest at Harvard. It is easy to 
see why people viewed them like a 1950s television clan. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Henigans are kind of like the Cleavers -- if Wally had been gay. 
</P>
<P>
 When students at Fountain Valley High School made national headlines recently 
by demanding the right to have a gay support group on campus, the Henigans 
stepped into the spotlight and became perhaps their most convincing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the storm clouds formed, the couple quietly offered their support 
at the first meeting in October. But a month and a few news accounts later, the 
campus was hit with anti-gay flyers and pickets by students calling themselves 
the Future Good Boys of America. And the Henigans decided it was time, in the 
words of their gay son, "to have their own coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 Through January, they had spoken to about 500 emotional people at school board 
meetings, urging tolerance and support for the Fountain Valley High School 
Student Alliance and reading a moving letter from their alumnus son, who 
typified machismo but secretly suffered as a gay teen-ager who could not be 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The story behind why the reserved family did this touches on universal 
emotions between parents and children. Usually we see the extremes -- Oprah and 
Geraldo versions of what happens when Mom and Dad learn their child is gay, the 
cases of estrangement and shame and lonely holidays for the banished one. 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly exist, but the Henigans have offered to tell a less hysterical 
story of how they've coped with learning that their son was gay, a story they 
hope is more ordinary than extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eldest son Patrick -- at 6 feet, 4 inches and then 260 pounds -- had been an 
all-league offensive lineman at football dynasty Fountain Valley High School; a 
student government leader with a 4.2 grade-point average whose classmates gave 
him the school's top honor, male student of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 What nobody knew was that he was so depressed about his sexuality that by his 
1986 graduation, he had repeatedly considered killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after he went to Harvard -- where he played football and graduated 
with a history degree into a successful law job -- Patrick broke the news of 
his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The Henigan family cried, hugged and vowed to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have admired Patrick his whole life, since he was in first or second grade 
and starred in his Christmas play," his father said, voice breaking. "I've 
lived a somewhat one-dimensional life, but Patrick is very well-rounded, a 
loving and sensitive person who always remembers you. How could I suddenly not 
love him for one part of his life being different than mine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick had returned home from his New Jersey paralegal job in the summer of 
1991 to attend his high school reunion, bringing a 12-page letter for his 
family and friends. He wanted them to read it, then they would talk. In it, he 
explained that he was gay and how he came to that realization. It had a bit of 
an angry, love-me-or-leave-me tone to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shocked? Oh, yeah," Mike Henigan said. "He asked, 'Did you have any 
inklings?' and we had visited him earlier that summer, and earlier something 
didn't sit right, but it was some passing thing, so I'd have to say no, we had 
no inkling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot of crying that first night. . . . With the HIV virus and I teach 
health -- not that it's a gay disease -- the first thing that comes to mind 
(is), he's going to die before me. Then you feel sorry for yourself: He'd make 
a wonderful father and we won't get to see all those things. . . . I told 
Patrick that night, 'You are just gonna have to give me a couple days to deal 
with this.' That's how I dealt with my father dying, big situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few days later," Mike said, "I gave him a hug, and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said mother Adrienne: "The thing that bothered Mike and I the most that night 
as we were crying and talking to one another was . . . OK, maybe I'm not sure 
with this gay thing, but we know he will face discrimination from the outside 
world, but at least with his family, we wanted him to feel that this was a 
secure haven." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick said he never feared that his family would abandon him. But he was 
afraid that they would be uncomfortable with him and that the family would 
never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew I was lucky in the sense that from day one, they supported me 
and asked questions," Patrick, 26, said in a phone interview. "But for them to 
be so public about it and support me is really neat. When I hear of (gay) 
friends literally kicked out of their families, and it's never even spoken 
about -- they live with lovers 10 or 15 years and their parents never meet them 
-- it's pretty much a lie, even if they told their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's literally a double life, and that's not a family if you can't 
share what you do on a daily basis and your relationships. I know people who 
are very, very out in the sense that they're very politically active, and yet 
their parents don't know. It just shocks me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I even had a relationship," Patrick added, "I told my parents. It was 
weird. I never had a relationship or joined a (gay) community activity or did 
the bar scene, I just went home. And it felt like night and day after that, 
after telling them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Henigans had an advantage in their ability to adjust. In 1978, Adrienne's 
brother had told their family that he was gay, and she was the one relative who 
accepted him. The Henigans spent much time with the brother, a successful real 
estate lawyer who has lived for 15 years in Santa Fe, N.M., with his mate and 
is "a wonderful man," Mike said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still not the same as your son or your daughter, of course, but there 
were a lot of issues we'd already worked out," Mike said. "We knew 
(homosexuality) wasn't something that you could change or think through. We 
believe that's the way you are, the way you were born." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did they know that more than a decade later, they would be facing off 
with hundreds of emotional parents who believe otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 News reached the Henigans swiftly last fall that gay students and their 
friends were forming a support group. A month into their meetings, the 30 or so 
gay and straight members called the group the Fountain Valley High School 
Student Alliance, the first of its kind in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, the Henigans said, they were still effectively in the closet 
about Patrick's homosexuality. They'd told friends and family whose acceptance 
they were sure of -- Patrick's two sisters and brother have fiercely supported 
him -- but they never felt the need to tell the world that their son was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 And the students never thought to ask either of the Henigans for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they would have ever picked Mike," Adrienne said with 
amusement, "just because of stereotypes. Just like we stereotype a gay person, 
we stereotype macho types, too. Like just a gay person can be sensitive, but 
supposedly macho types can't be sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 But on their own, Mike and Adrienne quietly lent their moral support to 
individual gay students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we weren't able to help Patrick," Adrienne said, "but if we could 
help one other kid who's going through some lonely journey, we should. Even if 
it was one kid, we wanted them to know that they weren't hated." 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, the placid veneer at this campus of 2,500 students began 
cracking. A few students calling themselves the Future Good Boys of America 
stuffed flyers into lockers urging students to ban the gay and lesbian support 
group and decry homosexuality as "deviant" and "queer." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Joe Khalil said he and some friends printed the flyers but insisted 
that they were not gay-bashers. "It's not prejudice," he said. "We just don't 
want them around us." He and his friends were worried that their high school 
would be viewed as "a gay school." 
</P>
<P>
 It was in this electric atmosphere that the Henigans went public, removing any 
lingering pretense faculty and community boosters may have held about their 
"straight" son. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before Christmas, about 200 parents, students and churchgoers 
crammed into the Huntington Beach Union High School District board chamber to 
debate whether the gay support group should be allowed to meet on campus. The 
Henigans read a gripping letter from Patrick, recalling his desperate feeling 
of aloneness and his wish to end it by hurling himself onto the San Diego 
Freeway. The Henigans urged that the support group be allowed to meet on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 When the board met again Jan. 11, 300 people packed the chamber and spilled 
into anterooms. Half favored the alliance, citing an equal access law that 
allows any student group to meet on school grounds. The other half argued that 
educators would be accepting homosexuality by allowing a gay student group 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance won. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us don't necessarily understand homosexuality, but I think it's 
valuable to know that gay people are normal people," said Mike, who was 
initially reluctant to share his family's story because he believed that the 
student group deserved the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's good for people to know that Patrick is from a 'good family,' a 
supportive family, so what difference does it make? . . . We're lucky, and it 
is not over yet. A lot of people are very, very upset that, as a teacher and a 
coach at Fountain Valley, that I've stood up for this group." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Robert Dodge -- a member of the track team, a former football player 
and now one of the Future Good Boys of America -- said he vehemently opposes 
the gay students meeting on school property. 
</P>
<P>
 After the school board ruled that the alliance could do just that, Dodge said 
his friend vowed to start the Beer Club, adding: "And I'm thinking of starting 
the Heterosexual Student Alliance. It is to make a point." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Dodge said there has been no interest in the Heterosexual 
Alliance, so he is starting the Bestiality Club, hoping to alarm parents into 
challenging the school board that defended its decision because the equal 
access law says all groups or none. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge thinks the Henigans should not have spoken out as district employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, he's a nice guy," Dodge said of Mike Henigan. "I can understand 
him wanting to support his son and all but . . . he should be speaking as a 
father and not as an employee of the school." 
</P>
<P>
 They were perhaps understandably well-chosen words about Henigan the morning 
after the Future Good Boys' stinging defeat at the volatile school board 
meeting. It was so tense and crowded that police had to control access to the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through, Dodge said, he left the auditorium for a television interview 
and an officer refused to let him back in. It was Henigan who explained the 
unfairness of keeping Dodge out when he had claimed his seat two hours before 
the meeting began. When the officer still barred Dodge, Henigan and others took 
it up with a supervisor, and Dodge was allowed back in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Patrick broke the news, he had not yet had a homosexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick is living with a friend now," Mike said. "I said, 'Now, do we call 
him your boyfriend? Or . . . what do we call him?' He's in a relationship with 
a young man. They came to visit us, spent two weeks with us, went to Las Vegas. 
So it's real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time with heterosexual young boys or girls being openly 
affectionate in public. . . . So for me, seeing men holding hands with men, 
that's a stage I'll still have to go through -- that still bothers me. But 
Adrienne's brother, and Patrick and his friend, they haven't been openly that 
way, so we haven't had to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Patrick said, his dad shows "in so many small ways" that he has 
accepted a gay son. Recently he mentioned that, perhaps next year, Patrick will 
have a boyfriend in the Henigan family portrait. His father also kidded him 
that he would tell people it was a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been easier to adjust, the Henigans admit candidly, because their son 
does not look or behave differently, that he does not suddenly seem like a 
stranger. That he is definitely "the same Patrick we've always known," his 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the crying, worrying, fretting," Mike said, "you see that your 
picture of what your son's going to grow up and be is gone. You have to adjust 
it. Then after awhile, you realize you don't have to adjust to it that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not the perfect family . . . but we let our children be who they are."

A BIG HONOR FOR A BIG BROTHER; WAYNE GRETZKY IS NAMED ATHLETE OF THE DECADE FOR 
HIS DEDICATION TO MENTORING FATHERLESS BOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If dessert is a chocolate hockey puck and stick (with raspberry sauce), the 
honoree must be . . . Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles bestowed upon the hockey great a 
fitting sweet and a big title -- Athlete of the Decade -- and in return, the 
Gretzky machinery went into high-gear Monday night at the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire.  
</P>
<P>
 The self-effacing honoree ("I'm a little bit embarrassed to be here") invited 
friends, family, neighbors and teammates to dine with him and leaned on fellow 
Canadians Alan Thicke and David Foster to provide entertainment. For the 
auction, Gretzky put his autograph on anything that didn't breathe -- his 
jersey, sticks, a commissioned portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky also enlisted Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall to co-chair the 
event with Prime Ticket Network's Bill Daniels, Great Western Bank's John Maher 
and the Walt Disney Company's Michael Eisner. Listed among the evening's many 
sponsors was the Riordan Foundation -- yes, the same Mayor Richard Riordan who 
sent along a proclamation honoring Gretzky for being an outstanding role model 
as well as important economic resource for the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "Normally you're calling all your friends to buy tables," McNall said. "This 
time we're telling people, 'Gee, I'm sorry, wait till next year. There's not 
enough room.' "  
</P>
<P>
 The sold-out event raised about $200,000, which will go toward recruiting men 
to befriend and mentor fatherless boys. Currently, the organization serves 500 
boys and 1,000 are on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could really use 2,000 big brothers," Soboroff said. "And if we put out the 
word that we had big brothers available to all the principals of all the 
grammar schools in L.A. and Inland Empire, I'd need 10,000 big brothers in a 
week."  
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky said he was 100% committed to kids: "Kids need guidance, whether it's 
a friend, a parent, a sports hero. I've made a lot of mistakes, but I had a 
great role model in my father and Gordie Howe was my hero growing up."  
</P>
<P>
 Walter Gretzky, meanwhile, confirmed that his son was an exemplary big brother 
to his four younger siblings. "Around the house they used to scrap a little 
bit, but Wayne was pretty good, just well-respected by his brothers and sister. 
He never forgets them."

ROUNDTABLE WRITING: A HEADACHE FOR GUILD; MOVIES: THE ISSUE OF MULTIPLE SCREEN 
CREDITS FOR WRITERS IS TAKING A NEW TURN. IF THE TREND OF USING A ROUNDTABLE 
EMERGES, WILL IT DIMINISH THE STATURE OF THE SCREENWRITER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roundtable writing -- creating or, more often, fine-tuning a script 
collectively -- is a time-honored tradition in television, the underpinning of 
comedies ranging from Sid Caesar's "Your Show of Shows" to "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent and controversial use of that process for the big screen, however, 
has, thus far, provoked more aggravation than laughs. By positioning writer as 
"jokester" instead of writer as "auteur" and raising the issue of multiple 
credits, say critics of the process, a roundtable not only diminishes the 
stature of the screenwriter but bogs down an industry already mired in 
mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the studios' intention is to imitate the quality of an average TV sitcom," 
says writer Gary Ross ("Dave," "Big"), "then roundtable writing is a very 
effective way of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Amy Ephron, who wrote the original script for Warner Bros.' "The Little 
Princess": "The really great movies have tended to be written by one person. 
They're less homogenized, have better characters and a much clearer vision. 
Writing is not a communist enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Pollock, motion picture group chairman of MCA/Universal -- thus far the 
primary employer of the roundtable technique -- prefers the term egoless. 
Although he would never have considered having "Schindler's List" written on 
that basis, he says, when it came to beefing up humor and polishing dialogue on 
comedies such as Amblin Entertainment's upcoming "The Little Rascals," "Casper" 
and "The Flintstones," the group dynamic worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Writers Guild agenda is to establish creative parity with 
directors, roundtable writing could be seen as potentially demeaning," Pollock 
says. "But is it any worse than 'serial monogamy' -- hauling in one writer 
after another to rewrite? In an industry in which the top writers work and get 
paid a lot and none of the others do, what's so bad about employing eight more 
people? This topic, I'm sure, will be part of collective bargaining during the 
(1995) contract talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Pierson, president of the WGA West, hopes it doesn't come to that. The 
union, which has been responsible for determining writing credits since the 
1940s, has a Contract Adjustment Committee that could negotiate amendments 
averting a clash before that date. The guild is also forming a task force to 
make recommendations to the committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Their task, says Pierson, is to review the current rules against granting 
credit to more than two writers (or two-person writing teams) unless a waiver 
is obtained in advance. In most cases, the maximum, even with a waiver, is 
three. Should that prohibition be lifted, the committee will attempt to protect 
roundtable writers from exploitation on the part of a studio out to cut corners 
on writing fees and health and pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unconscionable for the guild not to review the policy because, in the 
real world, people are working this way," Pierson says. "Our membership has to 
decide whether roundtable writing is acceptable -- and my personal opinion is 
that it is. It provides work. It can create good product. The problem is coming 
up with a credit 'card' (on-screen) that doesn't belittle the work of the 
writer in the eyes of those who see it." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came to a head in late December when Universal submitted what is 
probably a record-setting eight names -- seven roundtable writers plus 
writer/director Brian Levant -- for credit consideration on "The Flintstones," 
the studio's $40-million Memorial Day release. The first script was written by 
Steven de Souza ("Die Hard") in 1987 for Hanna-Barbera before Universal 
optioned the rights. Since that time, drafts were penned by six other writers 
or by teams of writers, and there were three additional versions by the 
roundtables brought in by Levant. 
</P>
<P>
 Several writers, including De Souza and the team of Tom S. Parker and Jim 
Jennewein, wrote letters to the guild protesting the submission of roundtable 
material without a waiver. Shortly thereafter, Pierson instructed the 
membership to pass on any roundtable assignments unless cleared in advance. 
Some guild members charge that the union dragged its feet on the matter. In the 
absence of a waiver, they ask, why did it inform the 32 "Flintstones" writers 
that the matter would go before arbitration? Why did the union meet with Levant 
twice rather than turn down the eight-person credit submission cold? 
</P>
<P>
 "Universal wasn't to blame," said Ross, one of the "Flintstones" writers. 
"It's not their job to exercise prior restraint but our's to enforce our own 
rules which, for a while, the guild clearly didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierson challenges that perspective. "Passions often run high on credit 
arbitrations, and you have to be flexible reading the rules," he says. "We 
weren't about to throw out the application of eight legitimate members of the 
guild without a fair hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 The WGA was spared a pre-arbitration hearing on the waiver issue recently when 
Universal abruptly withdrew its Levant-team submission and asked that Parker 
and Jennewein be given writing credit instead. Michael Wilson was to be 
credited with the "story." 
</P>
<P>
 Levant ("Beethoven") cautions that Universal's about-face should not be 
interpreted as an acknowledgment that roundtable writers are ineligible for 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our decision to withdraw our names," he explains. "It wasn't a 
pleasant situation, and we didn't feel like making it the issue of our lives. 
Letters, lawyers . . . we'd rather be comedy writers. I didn't know for a long 
time that Universal hadn't requested a waiver as I requested." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal's Pollock maintains that there was no need for a waiver. Since the 
composition of the groups changed weekly, he says, there was no ongoing "team." 
Despite the fact that WGA rules tend to favor the original writer, he had opted 
not to submit the writer's name for credit since his script was never optioned 
by the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 De Souza, nevertheless, is confident he will win out in the end, in an 
arbitration precipitated by a letter of protest filed by the writing team of 
Daniel and Joshua Goldin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final script is strikingly similar to what I wrote seven years ago," De 
Souza says. "The main story line and many scenes are identical. . . . I have no 
problem with roundtable writing -- as long as it's acknowledged the way it 
often is in TV -- in additional credits at the end of the show instead of in 
the writing credits upfront." 
</P>
<P>
 In the upcoming weeks, the final script will be sent out to a panel of three 
anonymous guild members who will make independent credit recommendations. 
Though roundtable writing is not an issue this time around, no one doubts it 
will surface before long. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Grazer, co-chairman of Imagine Films Entertainment, says it could 
probably be a viable way of turning out movies in an industry hungry for 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a script is good, what does it matter how many people wrote it?" asks 
Grazer. "And, who know where it could lead? Writers from 'Seinfeld' -- TV 
people who who otherwise might feel uncomfortable with the movie format -- 
could knock out a screenplay in a matter of weeks. It feeds a system that needs 
to be fed."

WRITERS' LIST: 'SCHINDLER'S' AND 'PIANO' AMONG NODS; MOVIES: 'AGE OF INNOCENCE' 
AND 'SHORT CUTS' ARE NOT AMONG 10 FILMS NOMINATED FOR ORIGINAL AND ADAPTED 
SCREENPLAYS.

 The screenplays for Oscar front-runners "Schindler's List," "The Piano," "The 
Fugitive," "The Remains of the Day" and "In the Name of the Father" were among 
the 10 films nominated on Tuesday for Writers Guild honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooked, however, were "The Age of Innocence," adapted by Jay Cocks and 
Martin Scorsese from the Edith Wharton period novel, and Robert Altman's "Short 
Cuts," based on Raymond Carver's short stories, which are considered to be 
among Academy Award screenwriting contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Writers Guild nominations are the last hint to which movies will likely do 
well in the Academy Awards nominations, which will be revealed this morning. 
"Schindler's List" and "Piano" have the most buzz, based on a succession of 
pre-Oscar awards. 
</P>
<P>
 In the original screenplay category, the nominees are:  
</P>
<P>
 The political satire "Dave," by Gary Ross; the Clint Eastwood thriller "In the 
Line of Fire," by Jeff Maguire; the first major studio movie concerning AIDS, 
"Philadelphia," by Ron Nyswaner; the period romantic drama "The Piano," by Jane 
Campion, and the romantic comedy "Sleepless in Seattle," by Nora Ephron and 
David S. Ward and Jeff Arch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the category of screenplays based on material previously produced or 
published, the nominees are: 
</P>
<P>
 The action drama "The Fugitive," by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, with story by 
Twohy, based on the characters created by Roy Huggins; the political father-son 
drama "In the Name of the Father," by Terry George and Jim Sheridan, based on 
the book "Proved Innocent" by Gerry Conlon; the generational drama of 
Chinese-born mothers and American-born daughters, "The Joy Luck Club," by Amy 
Tan and Ronald Bass, based on the novel by Tan; the melancholy romantic drama 
"The Remains of the Day," by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, based on the novel by Kazuo 
Ishiguro, and the drama of a German businessman who saves 1,100 Jews from a 
Nazi-run concentration camp in occupied Poland, "Schindler's List," by Steven 
Zaillian, based on the novel by Thomas Keneally. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the screenwriters have received nominations from the guild previously: 
Ephron for "Silkwood" and also for "When Harry Met Sally . . . ," Sheridan for 
"My Left Foot," Jhabvala for "Howards End" and "A Room With a View," and 
Zaillian for "Awakenings." Jhabvala won the award for "A Room With a View." 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination for "Philadelphia" comes at a time when there is legal action 
pending on the story's origins. Last week, the family of a lawyer who fought a 
discrimination case similar to the one depicted in the movie sued the 
filmmakers and independent producer Scott Rudin for breach of contract. The 
family contends the movie is based on the case of the late Geoffrey Bowers, but 
the film's distributor, TriStar Pictures, maintains that the lawyer portrayed 
in the movie by Tom Hanks is fictional. 
</P>
<P>
 The Writers Guild will hand out prizes for film, television and radio 
categories on March 13. The TV and radio nominations were previously announced.

SHARING CEREMONIAL TREASURES; AMERICAN INDIAN DANCE THEATRE BRINGS TRADITIONS 
TO CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 In 1921, the Canadian government took a look at the sacred ceremonies of the 
Kwakiutl people of the Northwest coast and promptly freaked. The authorities 
arrested participants, banned the events and blackmailed the remaining tribal 
members into surrendering their masks and artifacts by threatening further 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty-six of our people were sent down to prison in Vancouver, 200 miles 
away," Kwakiutl Nation Chief Bill Cranmer said in a phone interview from his 
home in Alert Bay, British Columbia. "The others gave up anything that was used 
in the ceremonies. It was all crated up and sent to Ottawa, and there it stayed 
until the early '80s, when some of our people started work to get it sent 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Now some of the outlawed ceremonial dances will be performed as part of the 
"Winter Dances" program by the American Indian Dance Theatre on Thursday and 
Friday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. The company, which is 
made up of dancers from more than a dozen Native American nations, performs 
sacred and social dances by many different tribes. Cranmer was responsible for 
bringing the Kwakiutl "Red Cedar Bark Ceremony" to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to teach people in the outside world about our history, our 
language and our culture," Cranmer said. "These are very special dances to us, 
and the American Indian Dance Theatre recognizes that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cranmer said the problems at the early part of the century began when "the 
Indian agents and the church were having difficulties reorganizing the lives of 
our people to conform with everyone else's system of living. A lot of these 
winter ceremonies would move from village to village, and a lot of the people 
would move with them. So the Indian agents and the churches couldn't keep our 
people in one area to be part of a labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our people wanted to carry on with the way they used to live." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the people did, keeping those ceremonies and dances alive in the 
remoter villages and even surreptitiously under the eyes of the Canadian 
authorities, although the law against them remained on the books until 1951, 
the 55-year-old chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the permission of the Kwakiutl Tribal Council, Cranmer and his 
16-year-old son Tyler taught the company the "Red Cedar Bark Ceremony," in 
which young men -- usually the eldest children of chiefs -- are initiated as 
Hamatsa, or wise and knowledgeable leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony tells how a young initiate goes into the forest to find his 
spirit. "He is overcome by this spirit and comes back to the village in a wild 
state," Cranmer said. "Other members of the society then put him through a 
taming ceremony. It could take anywhere from a day to two days to put him 
through this (entire) ceremony." In the staged performance it will take about 
20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hamatsa form "one of the more powerful societies in our ceremonies," added 
Cranmer, who is himself a Hamatsa. "They are usually the first to do anything, 
the first to be fed and the first to be presented with gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Gift-giving was always an integral part of potlatches, which were festivals 
held for important ceremonies such as naming of children, memorializing a chief 
or initiating young people into adulthood. "We didn't have a written language, 
so everything was done in front of guests you would invite to witness these 
things," Cranmer explained. "Then you would present these witnesses with gifts 
for coming to witness." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kwakiutl still feel some bitterness toward the Canadian authorities. "The 
government never did apologize to us for their action," Cranmer said. "They're 
actually helping us now, but not quite enough. We've had to really beat on 
their doors to help us get our stuff back. We've tried to do all the other 
things we need to do to keep our history alive. But we don't have the resources 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the chief sometimes feels that "we seem to be fighting a losing 
battle here. A lot of different things happened resulting in our young people 
not speaking our language. That's not peculiar to our specific language group. 
It happened all over the world to aboriginal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We numbered around 10,000 people when the first sailing ships came in the 
mid-1880s," Cranmer said. "It dropped right down to only 1,400 in the late '20s 
and early '30s because of different diseases that we had no immunity to. Now, 
we must be approaching 6,500." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "there has been a kind of resurgence or revival of the ceremonies," he 
said. "A lot of the younger people are learning the songs and learning the 
history of the dances. They understand the seriousness of the dances and their 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days, every member of your family would have a dance they would 
perform. There were so many different dances, these ceremonies used to go on 
for days. It was said that certain chiefs could dance forever because they had 
so many treasures that they could show. We had a saying: 'Their treasure box 
never empties.' "

IT'S WHITNEY'S NIGHT TO SAY THANKS AT MUSIC AWARD SHOW; POP MUSIC: HOUSTON 
RECEIVES EIGHT HONORS AT THE AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS, WHICH TIES TWO LONGSTANDING 
RECORDS BY KENNY ROGERS AND MICHAEL JACKSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a tight, nearly neck-and-neck race at Monday's 21st annual American 
Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for the awards themselves, of course, which were mostly foregone 
conclusions, but in the contest to see who would get thanked more in one 
evening: "the Lord Jesus Christ" or "Bobby." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney Houston -- celebrated wife of Bobby Brown and mother of Bobbi Kristina 
-- continued to enjoy the predictable spoils of her splashiest chart year 
throughout the Shrine Auditorium ceremony. She swept up seven awards for her "I 
Will Always Love You" single and "Bodyguard" soundtrack album, plus the 
career-honoring Award of Merit, following a video tribute narrated by Stevie 
Wonder that had her in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 This armful left Houston tying two longstanding AMA records: Kenny Rogers' for 
the greatest number of lifetime AMAs (19) and Michael Jackson's for the most 
ever won in a single year (eight). 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess I just should stay up here, huh?" quipped the diva, giving voice to the 
obvious midway through the three-hour telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominations for this show -- a populist precursor to the Grammys each winter 
-- are based on record sales and airplay, and winners are selected by a 
national consumer poll, pretty much precluding the possibility of suspense in a 
chart year so dominated by one personality. 
</P>
<P>
 With no more than two AMAs going to any other artist, none of the other 
winners attracted a fraction of the attention afforded Houston -- although one 
non-nominated performer, controversial rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, dogged his way 
into the media spotlight through a combination of infamy and default. 
</P>
<P>
 In the backstage press room, the parade of honorees and presenters were asked 
by reporters whether they saw any problem with Dick Clark Productions giving an 
artist currently facing a murder charge such a highly visible platform to 
promote his music. 
</P>
<P>
 None did, on the record at least, and many seemed puzzled that a question of 
ethics would even come up, with acts from En Vogue to Aerosmith echoing Snoop 
producer Dr. Dre's sentiment that "anybody who sells 4 million records should 
be able to perform anywhere he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 The media were warned by a publicist that Snoop would "walk" if his "court 
case" came up during his press conference. And when it finally did, he did. But 
before that, Snoop alluded to the wariness of some mainstream organizations 
about working with him, saying: "I want to give a special shot out to Dick 
Clark for standing up for me. . . . The people out there felt me. I got one of 
the biggest responses this evening. . . . Respect me as a musician. My private 
life and my other life, leave it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Snoop Doggy Dogg's playful rendition of "Gin and Juice" -- the edited radio 
version, that is, with hip-hop "scratching" noises turned up to obscure the 
more blatant sex and drugs lyrics -- was indeed a crowd favorite. Dr. Dre mixed 
from behind a turntable as Snoop and several tricycle-riding cohorts roamed the 
"Dogg Pound," an amusingly oversized back-yard set. 
</P>
<P>
 Snoop also won the unofficial award for best living metaphor. Asked why he'd 
let his hair grow out in such a '70s-redolent fashion, the rapper said, "My 
'fro symbolizes my career. It's blowin' up every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The honors for most obnoxious went to two members of Stone Temple Pilots, who 
skipped the press-conference room but did stop to pose in the photo tent, 
miming fellatio on one another with the help of their trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilots' awards were for favorite new artist in both the pop/rock and heavy 
metal/hard rock categories. Other double winners were Aerosmith (pop/rock band 
and heavy metal/hard rock favorite artist), Alan Jackson (country single and 
album), Toni Braxton (new artist in the soul/R&B and adult contemporary 
categories) and Dr. Dre (rap/hip-hop artist and new artist). 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama won its 17th AMA, for best country band. Other honorees included Garth 
Brooks, telecast co-host Reba McEntire and newcomer John Michael Montgomery in 
the country categories; Luther Vandross and En Vogue in the soul/R&B division; 
and absentee Eric Clapton as favorite pop/rock male artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny G managed the feat of besting the otherwise unbeatable Houston in this 
popularity contest, handing her her sole loss among eight nominations in the 
adult contemporary artist category. "Are you sure this is right?" the startled 
saxman kept asking. "Positive?" The recount is probably going on as we speak.

IT'S FINAL: O.C. TROUPE IS NO MORE; THEATER: THE FINANCIALLY TROUBLED 
GROVESHAKESPEARE IS 'CEASING OPERATIONS' WITH OUTSTANDING DEBTS OF 'CLOSE TO 
$300,000,' ATTORNEY SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The financially beleaguered GroveShakespeare, once the county's second-largest 
professional theater troupe, has taken its last breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry O'Brien, an attorney for the company, said Tuesday that 
"GroveShakespeare is ceasing operations" with outstanding debts of "close to 
$300,000." 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old company had folded in all but name in June, when it canceled 
its 1993 season due to a lack of funds. All but three members of its board of 
directors resigned shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then the company has struggled fitfully to stay alive, chiefly as the 
rental agent for its two city-owned venues, the 178-seat Gem Theatre and the 
550-seat Festival Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is likely to seek proposals from groups interested in managing both 
facilities. Several groups already have expressed interest. And the drama 
department of Chapman University, which wants to expand its graduate theater 
program, is considering making a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said the board voted unanimously Jan. 26 to dissolve 
GroveShakespeare's parent corporation, the Garden Grove Assn. for the Arts, 
confirming a press release issued by GroveShakespeare on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he disagreed with the assertion, made in the release, that $149,715 in 
debt "is currently in process (of being paid) and would most likely be erased 
over the next six months." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't foresee that getting paid," O'Brien said. "And I would not consider 
it to be anything other than outstanding debt. We have ceased operations, and 
there are essentially no assets." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a Brea-based attorney working without a fee, also discounted the 
press release's claim that GroveShakespeare was leaving only "$133,860 of 
unsettled debt." He said the two figures should be combined. A total of 
$283,575 in outstanding liabilities, "is more like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The press release also stated that GroveShakespeare's "accumulated past debt" 
had reached $427,700, the highest ever acknowledged by the company but that 
$144,125 had been forgiven or renegotiated by creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who specializes in bankruptcy, said he had agreed to represent the 
company until January, 1995, largely to answer any questions that creditors 
might have. "If anybody wants to file lawsuits and serve them, I'll be here to 
accept," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that he didn't think anybody would. And he did not foresee 
bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that the March opening of Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night 
Music" at the Gem, which is being produced by the independent Musical Theatre 
Co., is not likely to be affected by GroveShakespeare's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten that assurance," said George Quick, the troupe's executive 
director, who also will stage the musical.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we signed our contract in December," he said Tuesday, "it was with the 
understanding that GroveShakespeare might dissolve, but that the Gem would 
remain open."

GOING BACK TO THE SOURCE FOR 'LION, WITCH AND WARDROBE'; CHILDREN'S THEATER: 
WHAT THEATREWORKS / USA HAD AT FIRST CONCEIVED AS A ONE-HOUR VERSION OF 
'NARNIA' IS NOW 'A KIND OF KABUKI / STORY THEATER STYLE' STAGING OF THE C.S. 
LEWIS NOVEL OF GOOD AND EVIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When one of the country's leading youth theaters, New York-based 
Theatreworks/USA, decided it wanted to add a one-hour version of C.S. Lewis' 
"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" to its national touring repertory, it 
went to the creators of "Narnia," the full-length 1985 musical based on the 
Lewis tale that played London and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Narnia" writer Jules Tasca, composer Thomas Tierney and lyricist Ted Drachman 
were agreeable. Although they work primarily in stage and screen for adults, 
they had collaborated on two other musicals for the 33-year-old children's 
theater company, and besides, it was assumed by all that the adaptation would 
be a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, after struggling with initial drafts of the show last year, Tasca 
finally returned to the source -- Lewis' epic children's novel of good versus 
evil -- and Tierney and Drachman wrote new songs. Rather than a condensed 
"Narnia," the three came up with a brand-new show. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be seen Saturday at the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, Feb. 
19 at Santa Barbara's Lobero Theatre and on Feb. 27 at the Norris Theatre on 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed easy on the face of it," Tasca said in a phone interview from New 
York, "but how do you cut (a 2 1/2-hour musical to one hour) and not make it 
bleed? How are you going to do it so everything is there? We had horrible 
suggestions -- do it with only two kids (there are four in the story). That's 
like doing the 'Two Little Pigs.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So instead of shortening the musical, we went back to the original source 
material and it became a new concept." 
</P>
<P>
 The story now unfolds "in a kind of Kabuki/story theater style," Tasca said, 
"using silk banners and masks that move fast from scene to scene. We broke up 
the speeches, so it wouldn't be stereotypical story theater," and the actors 
use masks to change character. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried it out last year in four colleges in New York," Tasca said. "After 
each production, we rewrote it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tasca gives Theatreworks credit for being "tough cookies" when it comes to the 
quality of its shows that are seen by almost 3 million children a year. Theater 
for young people is "a genre unto itself that has to be mastered," Tasca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, any kid in college, you can say here's 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella' 
and he can get you a script, but Theatreworks would never do one like that. . . 
. We have arguments about what works, but that's how you get a good product, 
when people care." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're introducing a show with tryout performances, you can see very 
quickly when the kids are not involved," said Theatreworks' artistic director 
and co-founder Jay Harnick. "If there is a moment of restlessness in the 
audience, you have to address that moment because it's not the kids' fault, 
it's the show's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theater has so much capacity to entertain, to educate, even to inspire," he 
said, "and kids deserve the best. And since it is the first show many kids will 
see, we aspire to (high) standards. No play, no ballet, no opera is any more 
important than the first one you see." 
</P>
<P>
 The next Theatreworks show in the Southland will be "Charlotte's Web" in 
April. Of the mostly familiar material that tours, Harnick said: "Marketing is 
the reason. Children's theater income is limited. It's not by accident that 
what you see touring are essentially adaptations. What we hope is that we find 
an approach that is unique and provides a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Theatreworks/USA has a repertory of more than 70 shows -- 
biographies, issue-oriented plays and adaptations from literature -- performed 
by adult professionals and commissioned from newcomers as well as from veterans 
such as Ossie Davis, Mary Rodgers, Joe Raposo, Charles Strouse and Alice 
Childress. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Theatreworks/USA's acting alumni who have gone on to higher-profile 
achievements are Henry Winkler, F. Murray Abraham and Sherman Hemsley.

ACTRESS TAPS INTO PAINFUL 'INCIDENTS'; UCI DRAMA TEACHER TAMIKO WASHINGTON 
DRAWS ON HER OWN EXPERIENCES WITH BIGOTRY FOR THE ROLE AND FINDS THE CHARACTER 
INSPIRING.

<P>
 Ask Tamiko Washington about Harriet Ann Jacobs, the character she portrays in 
"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl," and the conversation turns to heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the lady; I really do," Washington said by phone after Saturday's 
performance. "I mean, I can't think of anyone in the present day who could do 
what she did, who would compare to this lady. She faced tremendous (hardships) 
but overcame them . . . she's inspiring." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs is the focus of Tamiko's one-woman show at Irvine Valley College 
through next weekend in recognition of Black History Month. Adapted by Deanna 
and Jon Sidoli from Jacobs' autobiography, the play describes Jacobs' life as a 
slave in North Carolina, her years as a fugitive and her eventual freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The production is useful as a history lesson, a reminder of a time that almost 
seems incomprehensible now, but it should also be viewed as a testament to 
personal courage, noted Washington, a Los Angeles actress who teaches drama at 
UC Irvine and has appeared locally in productions at South Coast Repertory in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't overlook what happened back then, but (the play) also has to do 
with our capability to overcome things," she said. "Look at this lady and 
understand your own power, (and that) can help you overcome the worst suffering 
imaginable." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Sidoli, an IVC drama instructor who also directed the show, said: "It's an 
eerily relevant story of a woman's struggle to be free of domination and 
degradation in the face of an oppressive culture."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said her own brushes with bigotry helped her prepare for the role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't identify with the ordeal she went through, but I have had to deal 
with racism, little ounces of it here and there," she said. "I had to rise 
above the situation and not get trapped (by the anger that can come from these 
encounters). That's the kind of willpower Harriet had, (and) realizing that 
figured in how I approached her." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the opening weekend, Washington said she was gratified by the 
good turnout and especially by how many young African Americans were present. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to see them out there because they get to have an idea about their 
culture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, it's great to see them coming to the theater because you wonder if 
they'd be interested in it. I think (most people) go to the movies these days 
(and) miss out on what drama has to offer." MARK CHALON SMITH

IRVINE MAY PHASE OUT BARCLAY SUBSIDY; THE PROPOSAL IS ONE OF SEVERAL BEING 
EXPLORED BY THE CITY, A ONE-THIRD PARTNER THAT PROVIDES ABOUT $400,000 A YEAR 
TOWARD OPERATING EXPENSES.

<P>
 The city, facing continuing budget problems, is considering phasing out its 
subsidy of the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 A phaseout is one of numerous options the city is investigating in a series of 
meetings with officials of the private operating company that runs the 756-seat 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said Monday that talks are exploratory, 
with no decisions expected for several months, and that the city intends to 
continue its financial support at least through next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is a one-third partner in the theater -- along with UC Irvine and the 
private Irvine Barclay Theatre Operating Co. -- and provides about $400,000 a 
year toward operating expenses not covered by ticket sales, rental fees and 
other income. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine also shouldered the lion's share of the theater's construction costs: 
$11.3 million of a total $17.6 million. Opened in 1990, the theater is an 
important venue for campus and community arts organizations as well as touring 
dance, music and theater productions. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been especially significant in presenting popular music and 
cutting-edge modern dance and theater groups and has developed a reputation for 
being more adventuresome than the larger, better-heeled Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady has had several meetings recently with Doug Rankin, general manager of 
the Irvine Barclay, and Gary Singer, chairman of the operating company's board 
of trustees. The meetings were initiated because the City Council "asked that 
we look at our commitment" to the theater, Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where this leads, I don't know at this point," he said. The city may decide 
to maintain its current arrangement, could alter it somehow or could pull out 
entirely by phasing out its subsidy or by selling its share to the university 
or a private operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Rankin said that talks have been constructive and that he doesn't expect any 
sudden or dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's $400,000 subsidy constitutes one-fourth of the theater's 
$1.6-million annual budget. Rankin said the theater is not yet in a position to 
take up the slack if the city were to drop out, but it has been working to 
create an endowment fund and to develop other means of private support. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, university officials have not taken part in the talks, but Rankin 
expects that they will join in the discussion. All partners would have to agree 
to any changes in the operating agreement.

 According to Vladimir Spivakov, conductor of the Moscow Virtuosi, one of the 
downsides of perestroika was that the Russian people sought scapegoats for 
everything wrong around them. As often has proved the case, the blame fell 
first on the Jews, then to other minorities of the former Soviet Union.

 Most of the Moscow Virtuosi -- who play tonight at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts -- are Jewish; the 28-member group also includes Armenians, 
Byelorussians and Ukrainians, and when they traveled, they all feared for their 
families' safety. In November, 1990, Spivakov arranged for a three-year 
contract for the musicians to work and live with their families in Spain, and 
when the contract expired recently, they did not return to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrangement continues for now," Spivakov said on the phone from Michigan 
City, Ind., a rest stop on the group's seventh North American tour. "We just 
see from day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Russia now it's quite a strange situation. We all hope for much better 
reforms, democratic reforms, but again the powers of communism (are growing). . 
. . It is not the time to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Spivakov is only too happy to share his views, be they social, artistic or 
political, no matter how unpopular those views may be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in 1992 on the occasion of the ensemble's 1,000th concert, he 
took the opportunity to chide his country's politicians. The Virtuosi were 
playing at the Moscow Conservatory, and (Russian President) Boris Yeltsin was 
in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave the introduction," Spivakov recalled. "I talked about egoism, about 
not (having) morals, politicians only thinking about themselves and not the 
people, even to kill people and to use conflicts for themselves, for their own 
power. I talked for 50 minutes before the concert. Afterward, Yeltsin came to 
congratulate me, and (former President Mikhail) Gorbachev sent me a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, of course, the politicians again do what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Shostakovich Chamber Symphony in F, based on the composer's 
string quartet Op. 73, tonight's program includes Mozart's Symphony in A, K. 
201 and a pair of Haydn Concertos in C, one with 20-year-old Wendy Warner as 
cello soloist, the other with Spivakov as violin soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivakov is hardly in sync with prevailing opinion on authentic performance 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historical instrument performance is often more business than music," he 
said. "And (those who adhere to the idea of historically informed performances) 
are very jealous when the normal instrument performs the 18th-Century music 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing, in life and music, is spirit. The halls today are 
not like before, and the historical instruments are not the best instruments 
(for these halls). The research of (historical) phrasing is good to know -- but 
not necessary for performance." 
</P>
<P>
 And did we mention that the Moscow Virtuosi all are male? 
</P>
<P>
 "We save our women from the hard life, to travel, take suitcases, not sleep 
enough and so on," Spivakov said. He continued with a chuckle: "Toscanini once 
said that if there would be a woman in his orchestra and she is beautiful, 'she 
disturbs the musicians. If she is ugly, she disturbs me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Apprised that in this country women sue all-male organizations to gain 
admission, Spivakov paused, then responded with almost Solomonic wisdom: 
</P>
<P>
 "If we play badly, then they can take us to court. If we play well, the woman 
brings for us the flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 * Vladimir Spivakov leads the Moscow Virtuosi in works by Mozart, Haydn and 
Shostakovich tonight at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 
Center Court Drive, Cerritos. Wendy Warner will be the featured cello soloist. 
Curtain: 8 p.m. $28-$39. (800) 300-4345.

WAYNE NEWTON, COUNTRY BILL SET FOR TROUBLED THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Celebrity Theatre, dark since New Year's Eve, will come back to life for 
at least two shows in the coming months despite a pending bankruptcy case and 
other legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas stalwart Wayne Newton will play the theater March 11 and a country 
bill -- Patty Loveless and Restless Heart -- will be offered April 16.Both 
shows are being produced by an independent promoter, Bill Silva of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by phone, Silva called the 2,800-seat theater-in-the-round a "great 
theater" and said he "would love to do some more things there in the future." 
But he said he would wait to see how the Celebrity's fiscal situation is 
straightened out before entering any long-term arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 California Celebrity Theatre Inc., which has leased the theater since 1987 
from the Leo Freedman Foundation, filed for Chapter 11 protection Dec. 16. 
Edward J. Haddad, California Celebrity's president and sole shareholder, is 
locked in a money dispute with Avalon Attractions of Encino, the promoter he 
hired to run the theater; he is also engaged in a lawsuit with the foundation 
over rent. If California Celebrity loses the lease, foundation representatives 
have said they would look for another operator. RICK VANDERKNYFF

SANTA CLARITA FILM FESTIVAL UNDAUNTED BY EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't easy launching a new film festival -- even under the best of 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be difficult to generate enough attention to draw a large audience. And 
competition for films, in an age when it seems most medium-sized cities boast 
of a local film festival, can be stiff. Good speakers are hard to find, and the 
amount of organizational work is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 And a large earthquake makes things even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent quake hasn't stopped the fledgling Santa Clarita Valley 
International Film Festival, scheduled for March 18-24 in an area hit 
particularly hard by earthquake damage. The show must go on, and it will, 
though with some changes in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we would go forward with the festival, and we originally thought 
we would have to make real programming changes," said festival director Chris 
Shoemaker. None of the scheduled speakers, including Jerry Mathers of "Leave It 
to Beaver" fame and writer Michael Medved, has canceled, and while the festival 
will now run seven days instead of 10, only two seminars of 17 have been 
dropped. It is difficult to predict what effect the earthquake will have on 
attendance, especially with damage to key freeways in the area, but the 
festival's director is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say how ready people will be to travel, but we hope people will 
want to go to something relatively close (to Los Angeles)," Shoemaker said. 
"And it could be an important part of the healing process." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the festival grew out of the film committee of Santa Clarita's 
chamber of commerce. "We're losing part of our film industry to out-of-state 
and out-of-country film concerns," Shoemaker said. "The festival will focus on 
Santa Clarita as a film-friendly community." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will screen family-oriented films, with a special concentration 
on animation and Westerns. A definite screening schedule has not yet been set. 
The festival will also include tours of Santa Clarita Valley and a special 
showing of "Tumbleweeds," the last film of William S. Hart, a longtime Newhall 
resident who acted in early Westerns. A lifetime achievement award will be 
presented to Warner Bros. animator Isadore (Friz) Freleng, creator of Porky 
Pig. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers are recommending Interstate 5 as the best route from Los 
Angeles to the Santa Clarita Valley. Though the festival will focus on 
family-oriented films, it will be "sensitive to the fact that our concept of a 
family is being broadened," Shoemaker said.

MALIBU'S LURE WASHES AWAY FOR SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Malibu, some were shoveling out. Others were shoving off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm staying. It's really beautiful here," Sharon Sandler said as she tugged 
at a garden rake to clean the mud from her beachfront living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm leaving. This place is a mess. This area's unsafe," Carol Stoinski said 
as she lugged a trash bag filled with her clothes through the thick ooze that 
poured through her front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Monday's mountain of mud clouded everything, the two neighbors on 
Pacific Coast Highway had shared an ocean view and a sunny outlook on life at 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 There were spectacular sunsets. Bracing sea breezes. Relaxing walks on the 
sand. The sight of red-tailed hawks circling over Piedro Gorda Canyon above 
their row of homes built on stilts at the surf line. 
</P>
<P>
 But last October's fire had burned away brush in the canyon. And rains 
pounding the blackened slopes sent a torrent of mud, water and debris roaring 
down Big Rock Drive, over the highway and through their front doors. 
</P>
<P>
 So Tuesday was a time of reassessment in the 19800 block of PCH. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll stay. I'd rather dodge boulders falling up here than bullets flying in 
the city," said Tommy Bartee, a 40-year-old movie extra who was dragging chunks 
of logs and tree branches from the mud in front of a friend's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is paradise. I'm not leaving," said retiree Sid Jacobson, 73. "I 
wouldn't have left during the flood, except that the firemen and sheriff made 
me. They carried me and the dog out in a skip-loader." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, Jacobson and his poodle named Boy 
needed rescuing again. Jacobson took a wrong step -- apparently into a hole 
hidden by the mud -- and soon was up to his waist in muck. It took three 
onlookers to drag him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that close call did not change Jacobson's outlook, but others seemed 
ready to wave goodby to paradise as quickly as they could dig their cars out of 
mud-sealed garages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to find a new place," said James Prescott, a 38-year-old 
water-filter business owner for whom the flood was a third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott said his home on Rambla Pacifica burned in the October fire. Then he 
moved into a house owned by friends, but had to move after the Jan. 17 
earthquake -- when its owners offered the place to other friends left homeless 
by the temblor. Prescott ended up on Pacific Coast Highway when another friend 
let him house-sit there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landowners beware: Don't rent to me!" joked Prescott as he wiped mud from his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Benner was ready for a change too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my TV, the VCR, my bed, my computer, most of my books," the 
24-year-old USC economics student said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at USC for the riots. I moved here a year ago -- that was a stupid 
move. I was here for the fire. After the earthquake closed the freeway, it 
started taking me an hour to drive to class, not 20 minutes like before. I 
should have stayed Downtown with the gunshots." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoinski, a 24-year-old legal assistant, said she planned to immediately hunt 
for a new place to live. She moved to Malibu a few months ago to live at the 
beach, a place where her dogs -- an Australian shepherd named Bo and a Samoyed 
named Pasha -- could run. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, she had to beg sheriff's deputies to rescue the dogs when the flood 
hit while she was at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved here after the fires, thinking what could happen after that," 
Stoinski said. "Then the earthquake hit and I thought we might fall right into 
the ocean. Now this. What's next? A tsunami?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stoinski said she salvaged few clothes or other belongings from the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a matter of washing them: I can't find them. I should probably 
sit on the beach and wait for stuff to wash up. It's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 A few doors down, Sandler was more optimistic -- even though the flood washed 
away her entire bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The room was built into the stilt supports beneath the main structure. Mud and 
water pouring down the living room stairs ripped the room loose and sent it 
tumbling into the surf, where it was pounded to bits by the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that was down there is gone, paintings, sculpture, the bed, 
everything," the 31-year-old lawyer said. But she managed a grin as she watched 
friend Paul Steinberg, 33, shovel muck down the stairway opening and onto the 
rocks below. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything on the top floor was muddy, including her French sofas and the 
shelf of books containing a numbered, turn-of-the-century collection of British 
volumes that Steinberg had given her about "the romance of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look very romantic now," shrugged the barefoot Steinberg, who is a 
special events designer. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, things were returning to normal in the 19800 block. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans crews were bulldozing up the last of the mud and depositing it down 
the street, next to the beach. Other workers were hosing down the pavement and 
picking debris from drains near Big Rock Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's top disaster official, Office of Emergency Services chief Richard 
Andrews, stopped by to check on the progress. He reminded victims that they can 
qualify for emergency assistance under the disaster declaration that followed 
the October fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Andrews admitted, it seems as if the only thing that has not 
happened to California is a volcanic eruption. Never in the history of the 
state have so many disasters occurred one after another, he said. And never in 
the history of the nation, he noted, has one state gained so much experience in 
dealing with calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeez," he added wearily, "we've had enough practice."

SENATE OKS TWO MAJOR SCHOOL REFORM EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate passed the two central elements of the Administration's education 
policy Tuesday, creating a new, hands-on role for the federal government in 
reforming the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the measures, known as Goals 2000, will for the first time set national 
academic standards and provide seed money to states that choose to overhaul 
their schools to help children reach these standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The second element, titled School-to-Work, provides funds to help schools 
establish apprenticeship networks that will provide job skills for students who 
will not go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 The two measures signal a radical new role in education for the federal 
government, which until now restricted its involvement to allocating money to 
help states in specific areas, such as educating poor and disabled students. 
</P>
<P>
 The House has already passed similar legislation. The bills now move to a 
conference committee to reconcile the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's action "will quickly help move our nation toward greater 
educational and economic progress and away from the low expectations which have 
too often held our children hostage and restrained our nation from achieving 
its full potential," Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiatives grew from ideas advanced in 1989 by the nation's governors and 
the Administration of then-President George Bush. The Clinton Administration, 
in keeping with its vision of making the federal government more active in 
addressing the nation's domestic problems, moved quickly to convert the 
education goals into legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither measure comes with much money. Education officials hope that parents 
and educators will push their school districts and states to provide additional 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals 2000, passed 71 to 25 by the Senate, will create a National Education 
Standards and Improvement Council to oversee the development of academic 
standards and provide money to states that choose to enact reforms to help 
their students achieve those standards. The Administration has asked for $700 
million in fiscal 1995 to help pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School 
Officers, which represents top school officials from around the country, said 
Goals 2000 "will have a tremendous impact because it links up the federal and 
state and local resources for total, systemic strategies to improve student 
performance. We've never had that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's 
second-largest teachers union, said the initiative is much broader than any 
undertaken previously by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will for the first time have a national system of high standards," Shanker 
said. "If a state does not participate, parents and teachers will be able to 
ask, 'Why isn't our state doing this?' or if it is, 'How well are our kids 
doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the measure culminates a five-year movement for national education 
reform, which started when the nation's governors, fearful that the country's 
children were falling behind their counterparts in other countries, agreed with 
Bush on six national education goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The governors, including then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, pledged that by the 
year 2000: 
</P>
<P>
 * All children in America will start school ready to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 * The high school graduation rate will increase from the current level of 71% 
to at least 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 * American students will be competent in core academic subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. students will be first in the world in science and mathematics 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Every adult American will be literate and possess the skills necessary to 
compete in a global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Every school in America will be safe, disciplined and drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation stresses that all students can reach high standards, including 
poor children, who the Administration feels have been cheated under the 
existing system. Several existing federal programs are being reshaped to work 
in conjunction with the new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals 2000 also establishes national occupational skills standards, intended 
to provide a foundation for the apprenticeship networks that the Administration 
hopes will become an integral part of every school under the school-to-work 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 That legislation, which passed the Senate 62 to 31, provides $300 million in 
fiscal 1995 to help states establish partnerships between local businesses and 
schools, offer students on-the-job training coordinated with classroom 
instruction and provide skill certificates upon completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is 'hire education' that offers hands-on learning to help students 
envision and plan for the jobs of tomorrow," said Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), 
chief sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanker said schools are in such bad shape that it will take many years before 
the impact of the two measures are felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major question mark will be if people will have the patience to wait," he 
said. "This is not a short-term proposal; this is a long-term overhaul that 
will eventually create an American model of what other countries have."

KATHLEEN BROWN FORMALLY ENTERS RACE FOR GOVERNOR; POLITICS: THE DEMOCRATIC 
CANDIDATE PLEDGES TO WORK FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE, JOBS AND CRIME REDUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown formally announced her candidacy for governor Tuesday 
with a pledge to restore educational excellence for California's children, job 
opportunities for its workers and safety for communities beset by violent 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough is enough," said Brown, 48, the first-term state treasurer, speaking 
of jobs lost, children being gunned down at school and fourth-grade test scores 
that rank at the bottom of the country. She said such problems have assaulted 
California during Republican administrations of the past 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sort of traditional California campaign kickoff made successfully by 
two Browns before her, Kathleen Brown declared her candidacy in speeches in 
Burbank, San Francisco and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., first won election as governor in 1958, 
and her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., was elected in 1974. Both served 
two terms and are the only Democrats to have occupied the chief executive's 
corner office in the Capitol in the past half-century. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring frequently to her roots as the fourth-generation offspring of Irish 
and German immigrants to Gold Rush California, Brown said the state always has 
reached into its pioneering spirit to recover from adversity such as it faces 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as those earlier Californians represented the very best of California's 
past, I intend to represent the best of California's future," Brown said as she 
toured the state on one of those sun-splashed, after-the-storm days for which 
California is famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving California forward again is going to require a governor with a plan to 
create jobs, fight crime and reform our schools. I am the only candidate with 
that plan, a plan to build a better and stronger California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June 7 Democratic primary, Brown will face state Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi, 49, another descendant of pioneer California stock -- Basques 
and Italians who came to the Mother Lode country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, the winner will go up against Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, 60, 
who is expected to be unopposed for renomination on the GOP ticket in his quest 
for a second term as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks Tuesday, Brown ignored Garamendi and reserved her political 
barbs for Wilson, accusing him of waiting until election year to attack 
California's problems. She said Wilson was more than 1,000 days into his term 
before he hired a consultant to reform education, traveled out of the country 
to develop export markets and called a summit meeting on ways to fight violent 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "And for those three years, we have had a governor who blamed our problems on 
Washington, on immigrants, on the Legislature, and even on our children," she 
said. "But 1,127 days into his term, he still doesn't get it -- that the buck 
stops with him." 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough is enough," she said, repeating her rhetorical theme while looking 
directly into the television cameras that were transmitting her announcement to 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said Wilson's recent trip to 
Asia was not just a beginning, but a continuation of an effort that began with 
working to make California's economy salable to foreign investors. The trip 
resulted in thousands of jobs and millions of dollars of investment in 
California, Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, he said, the crime summit was part of "more than 20 years of 
nonstop effort" by Wilson to make California streets and homes safer from 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur said that California has survived repeated disasters in recent years, 
but "one disaster that not even the state of California and the people could 
survive at such a critical point in our history is the prospect of Gov. 
Kathleen Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's stops were symbolic of the three key elements in her program: jobs, 
education and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, she spoke at a firm that makes bolts for military and commercial 
aircraft. In Sacramento, it was the school where she was an eighth- and 
ninth-grade student when her father was governor. The San Francisco setting was 
the police station where her maternal grandfather, Arthur Layne, began a 
41-year career as a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's mother, Bernice, introduced the candidate in San Francisco by 
remembering Layne as a tough but smart officer who "didn't just talk about 
crime but spent a career trying to do something about it." The notion of tough 
but smart is one of Kathleen Brown's slogans and she often talks about taking 
action on issues, not just talking about them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank and San Francisco, Brown was asked how she could be as tough on 
crime as Wilson and Garamendi, particularly when she is opposed to the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will enforce the laws of the state of California, including the death 
penalty," she said in front of the brick facade of the Richmond police station. 
"It is a settled issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that in choosing judges her only test would be that they are 
"qualified, and that they be willing and able and committed to enforcing the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown added that she would have reached the same decision that Wilson did in 
allowing the execution of Robert Alton Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown expanded on the crime issue by declaring that it is inextricably 
linked to the economy and education, and that she is the only candidate who has 
programs that deal with all those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 California cannot attract new business unless the streets are safe, she said. 
And the state's youngsters must get good educations and land jobs if the cycle 
of crime and violence is to be broken, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to deal with education, we're going to have to fix our economy 
so we have the revenues to put into education," she said. " . . . You have to 
have a measure of success in each of those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's father, in his late 80s and ailing, was not able to attend any of her 
appearances. There was some question whether brother Jerry, the former 
governor, would show up in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the police station, Kathleen Brown spotted him and said. "Well, 
you made it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Jerry Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was one of many Brown family members in the audience who were not 
introduced during the formal program. In a question-and-answer session 
afterward, a reporter asked Brown if she was trying to distance herself from 
her brother and his controversial political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my cue," Jerry Brown said, jumping up to the podium. He took off his 
brown jacket bearing the legend of the California Conservation Corps, one of 
the programs he started, and presented it to her with wishes of luck and an 
admonition to "fight for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Brown visited a computer lab at her old school and answered 
written questions from students. One asked her to recall her most memorable 
time at Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said it was when she ran for student body vice president, adding: "Girls 
couldn't be president of the student body at Sutter when I went here," she 
said. "But now we can grow up to be governors." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few months ago, Brown supporters were ready to virtually anoint her as 
governor. After three years of economic troubles, a tax increase and budget 
deadlocks with the Legislature, Wilson's popularity and job rating plummeted to 
modern lows. Garamendi was viewed as an ambitious maverick with little chance 
of winning the Democratic nomination over the well-financed Brown, whose 
campaign war chest is five times as fat as his. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her opponents acknowledge that Brown has a star quality enjoyed by few 
politicians, and she has received extensive, flattering national media 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the campaign approached, Brown was criticized openly by opponents, and 
quietly by many supporters, for failing to present a coherent vision and 
program. Beginning last summer, she launched a series of detailed public 
addresses in which she outlined plans on immigration control, education reform, 
crime and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics attacked the programs as superficial compilations of proposals already 
made by others. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Wilson's stock rebounded as the economy seemed to hit bottom 
and begin to recover and after he was able to work cooperatively with the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature in passing a 1993 budget on time, reforming 
workers' compensation and approving new tax breaks for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also received considerable attention in dealing with a string of 
disasters, including last fall's brush fires and the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, recognized as a tenacious campaigner, went on the attack on the 
crime issue. By the end of January, he had cut the Brown and Garamendi leads in 
Field Poll matchups to single digits. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Garamendi refused to back out of the campaign as Brown's 
strategists hoped he would. In fact, Garamendi launched a free-wheeling 
underdog campaign that began getting media attention as he called for quick 
action, including temporary tax increases, to repair earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts still give Brown the edge over Garamendi in the primary 
battle, in large part because of her huge advantage in campaign funds. But they 
also agree that it will be a tough campaign that could go down to the wire if 
Garamendi can raise enough money to finance a credible television campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is counting on scoring breakthroughs in debates with Brown, 
challenging her to at least 10 face-to-face meetings. She said Tuesday, "I'm 
prepared to debate John Garamendi," but declined to say when or how many times.

 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown formally declared her candidacy Tuesday for 
governor of California. She will compete with Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi for the Democratic nomination in the June 7 primary. The winner will 
run in the fall against Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, who is seeking a second 
term.

ACLU'S RIPSTON CHASTISED IN VISIT TO CRIME SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ramona Ripston might as well have stepped into the path of a runaway freight 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston, who heads the American Civil Liberties Union's Southern California 
office, appeared Tuesday on a panel at Gov. Pete Wilson's summit on crime, 
where she had hoped to slow the momentum of Wilson's effort to lengthen 
criminal sentences and build more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reception at the hands of Wilson's handpicked group of crime fighters was 
somewhere between chilly and nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have met the enemy, and Mrs. Ripston, I hate to tell you this, but you are 
it," said Steve Baker, whose son's killer, Robert Alton Harris, staved off the 
death penalty for more than a decade by filing repeated appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was kidnaped and killed last year, told 
Ripston she was "far out in left field." Another father showed Ripston a 
portrait of his murdered son and blamed her group for his death. Several 
panelists shortened the organization's name to the Civil Liberties Union, 
deliberately dropping the word American. And a legislator chastised Ripston for 
defending "lechers and scumbags." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not unexpected," Ripston said afterward. "I thought what I had to say 
was so important I was willing to risk what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston's message: Sentences should be tailored to fit the crime and the 
individual, not meted out with broad strokes adopted by panicky lawmakers 
fearful of their reelection chances. She said the ACLU opposes the "three 
strikes" initiative that polls show has the support of more than 80% of the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU believes that all people are entitled to justice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston's experience underscored the tone of the governor's two-day crime 
summit, which was billed as an effort to develop bipartisan consensus on the 
hottest issue of the day but turned out to be primarily a showcase for Wilson 
and his views on crime and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, when the pastor of the host Hollywood Presbyterian Church 
joined in the call for stricter sentencing, to the end, when the leader of a 
crime victims group threatened political retribution against lawmakers who 
don't toe her line, the event was a forum for the Republican governor's 
position that building more prisons and putting more inmates in them will make 
the state's streets safe again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, sitting at the head table on the stage of the church's auditorium, 
presided over the eight sessions on issues ranging from school violence and 
prevention to enforcement and punishment and crime's impact on business. 
Sometimes donning glasses to read from reports, Wilson introduced each session 
with a summary of his beliefs, then listened, moderated and asked an occasional 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also played traffic cop, admonishing the audience to "take your 
conversations outside" and repeatedly giving the speakers tips on how to handle 
the hall's sensitive microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade of panelists and speakers was peppered with prosecutors, police, 
judges and crime victims. Independent experts and academics were scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely present was the point of view that the state's dwindling resources 
would be better spent on educating and training young people than warehousing 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 One critic called the event a farce, contending that though Wilson is talking 
tough now, he has spent three years as governor cutting the ranks of the 
Highway Patrol, softening parole policy to save money and slicing money from 
local governments, which spend the bulk of their budgets on law enforcement and 
other public safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy has been asleep at the switch for three years," said Al Angele, 
executive director of the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs. 
"Finally he wakes up and says 'Geez, I'm on the rocks, maybe I should hold a 
crime summit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson aides and allies say the summit was a legitimate effort to gather 
information and ideas for bills that will be introduced in Sacramento in the 
weeks ahead. Many of the prosecutors in attendance cited specific sections of 
the penal code they said should be changed to make their jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any cynic who says it's being done for political reasons needs to have one of 
their kids snuffed to really understand," said Collene Campbell, who became a 
leader in crime victims circles after her son and brother were murdered in 
separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Sloat, a deputy chief of staff for the governor, said Wilson's staff 
took some heat from conservative groups and lawmakers that wanted the 
presentations weighted even more heavily toward their positions. He noted the 
presence of Ripston of the ACLU and former San Jose Police Chief Joseph 
McNamara, an outspoken advocate of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consciously tried to find a balance of all points of view," Sloat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloat acknowledged that Wilson hopes the summit will add to the pressure on 
legislators to pass the bills the governor already has endorsed. He said other 
measures will be introduced reflecting the ideas gleaned from the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we will take the momentum from this event and focus it on the state 
Legislature," Sloat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno described the summit as a "dog 
and pony show" and said he heard few new ideas expressed. But he said it was a 
worthwhile effort anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you focus this much attention on something, it becomes very difficult 
for the Legislature to do what it normally does, which is study and delay and 
put everything off for another year," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 That worries Ripston of the ACLU. She says lawmakers should take their time 
and thoughtfully consider the consequences before adopting simple-sounding 
solutions. But with the public clamoring for quick action, she said she is 
finding it harder to get her message across to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to hear it," she said.

QUAKE COST PUT AT UP TO $20 BILLION; DISASTER: BUT WILSON ADMINISTRATION SAYS 
DAMAGE FIGURE COULD ALSO BE AS LOW AS $13 BILLION. POLITICAL DEBATE CONTINUES 
OVER HOW THE STATE WILL FUND ITS SHARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration on Tuesday estimated the total cost of the 
Northridge earthquake at between $13 billion and $20 billion, which would make 
it the state's most devastating natural disaster and one of the nation's worst 
natural calamities. 
</P>
<P>
 State Finance Director Russell Gould pegged the total quake price tag for 
federal, state and local governments at about $11.6 billion, including 
everything from removing debris and fixing water lines to providing housing 
assistance and rebuilding highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould cautioned that the overall damage estimate -- initially set as high as 
$30 billion -- will continue to change, especially as the full extent of damage 
to underground utility, sewer and water lines becomes known. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that's our best estimate," he said. "But I'm not 
guaranteeing it wouldn't change as we know more." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials cited several factors for the wide range in their damage 
estimate, including the continuing aftershocks that trigger more damage, 
continuing scrutiny of damaged structures and the rising number of applications 
for relief by individuals and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big variable is private loss. The bottom line is we don't know yet what 
the private loss is," said Andy McLeod, a state official assisting the 
California Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal government is picking up most of the cost for damage to 
public facilities, California's tab is estimated at $1.9 billion, Gould said. 
Local governments face a bill of about $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
 How the state, with its ailing economy, will finance its share of the quake 
costs has become a subject of political dispute in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has refused to commit himself, pending release of firm 
government cost estimates. Even after the figures were disclosed Tuesday, 
Wilson would not spell out his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Goodman, Wilson's chief spokeswoman, said "now that we have a better 
sense of the estimates, the governor will take a look at what he has to do. He 
will review this and very quickly be telling people how he intends to pay for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's expressed a preference for bonds over taxes. He has not ruled anything 
out. He's said it's important to look at all the options," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But state Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said that legally 
only about half the state's $1.9-billion share can be made up by bonds. "They 
(the Wilson Administration) need another form of financing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, then-Gov. George 
Deukmejian moved much more quickly to craft a response. The Loma Prieta quake 
caused about $6 billion in damage, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said that "the situation cries out for executive leadership. We've 
postponed confronting difficult decisions while a damage inventory was 
conducted. . . . It's now imperative that we move forward expeditiously." 
</P>
<P>
 While politicians debate the best approach, state officials have retained the 
services of EQE, a San Francisco-based seismic consulting firm to calculate the 
quake's toll. Within days of the Jan. 17 quake, Wilson estimated the total 
damage at between $15 billion and $30 billion, an amount roughly equal to the 
nation's worst disaster, 1992's Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial estimate was based on a computer model, using observations from 
the first day or two after the quake, plus geographic, demographic and economic 
data. That was combined with information about the location of the quake in a 
heavily populated urban area, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Andrews, of the Office of Emergency Services, acknowledged that the 
$30-billion figure was suggested against a backdrop of "a great deal of 
uncertainty" about the extent of the damage, especially to large facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing three weeks, state authorities have compiled a more refined 
portrait of the damage, prompting them to lower the initial estimate. Now, they 
are basing the revised estimate on data from 300,000 people who have applied 
for disaster assistance and reports from hundreds of inspections of private 
residences, highways, schools and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with studies of ground motion during the quake and other geologic 
analysis, Andrews said he expects the toll to be between $13 billion and $20 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Gould said he was more confident using the $11.6-billion cost 
that government agencies must shoulder. State officials provided a partial 
breakdown that showed $3.4 billion for repairs to public facilities and initial 
relief; $1.45 billion to repair bridges and highways; $717 million for grants 
to families, and $575 million to repair damaged or destroyed houses or 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $11.6 billion in costs to government, the federal government is 
expected to pick up about $9.5 billion. At least $800 million has already been 
committed and another $8.6 billion was approved last week by the House of 
Representatives. The aid bill was sent to the Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, according to Wilson's office, is responsible for $1.9 billion, with 
$135 million in local government costs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wilson urged swift Senate passage of the emergency quake bill. In 
a letter to Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, Wilson said "any delay could threaten the flow of urgently needed 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 While pressuring Congress for help, the Wilson Administration last week 
opposed a bill by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) that would 
raise $1.5 billion from a temporary sales tax increase. Even so, it was 
approved by the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, legislation to temporarily increase the state gasoline tax by 2 
cents a gallon to raise an estimated $1 billion for earthquake-related highway 
repair and retrofit work was introduced Tuesday by Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San 
Francisco), chairman of the Transportation Committee. The proposed gas tax hike 
would be in effect for 3 1/2 years from July 1 to Jan. 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer, who just became Senate leader, said raising funds for the state's 
share will likely require a mix of financing measures, including either a sales 
tax increase or a boost in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the governor's involvement, I'm skeptical about the ability of each 
house to generate a two-thirds (vote) agreement (to approve a tax hike)," 
Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Daniel M. Weintraub in Los Angeles and Paul Jacobs and 
Jerry Gillam in Sacramento contributed to this story.

DEFENSE FIRMS FAIL TO CONVERT, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a finding that casts serious doubts on the ability of defense contractors 
to convert to a commercial footing, a survey of high-technology firms in Los 
Angeles County released Tuesday shows that they have grown even more dependent 
on the defense business in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies, ranging from aircraft manufacturers to electronics firms, are 
adapting to the collapsing defense market by shrinking their operations and 
increasing their reliance on the Pentagon, according to a study by the Economic 
Roundtable, a nonprofit research group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which was dominated by large companies that account for most of the 
industry's jobs, further confirms that Southern California is losing its grip 
on high technology. Sixty-two percent of the high-tech firms in a five-county 
region said they expect employment in their industry to drop over the next five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, Southern California, the heart of the nation's aerospace industry, 
has lost 39%, or 153,000, of its high-tech jobs. The report showed that even 
the region's high-tech firms that are not involved in defense work have shrunk 
by 20% over the last five years, based on data from the state Employment 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is believed to be the first regional or national effort to assess 
how well defense firms are adjusting to the biggest downturn since the end of 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense conversion has been a failure by any definition, said Daniel Flaming, 
co-author of the report and president of the Economic Roundtable. Generally, 
defense conversion has meant helping defense companies find commercial markets 
for their technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The response by local and federal governments to the economic crisis created 
by the aerospace bust has been ineffective, according to 88% of the business 
executives responding to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approach has been to throw money out there and see if anything gets done, 
and at that there hasn't been very much money," Flaming said. "It is a 
conceptual failure because there hasn't been a clear objective stated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems extraordinary to me that we have this level of loss and so little 
local action to deal with it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton last year announced a $19.5-billion defense conversion 
program, which would retrain workers, fund new technology and help communities 
adjust to military base closures. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official said Tuesday that Clinton's program is less than a year 
old and it is too soon to judge whether it will be effective in helping defense 
firms find new commercial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a tiny fraction of the $19.5 billion has been spent, and virtually none 
of the funds under the cornerstone Technology Redevelopment Program have 
reached industry. A new round of awards has been delayed for months by 
political battling between the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who thinks we can quickly beat our swords into plowshares has 
never tried it and probably never met a payroll," said Bob Black, president of 
Plastics Research, a Santa Fe Springs firm included in the survey. The firm has 
lost half of its 100 workers in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Black said he set a modest goal of getting 20% to 30% of his sales from 
commercial markets, but has found that "it is extremely difficult to reach 
potential customers. In defense, you can do business just by reading Business 
Commerce Daily, which has a list of all the contracts the government has up for 
bid." 
</P>
<P>
 The Economic Roundtable sent survey forms to 1,263 high-tech firms and 
received responses from 358, including every large aerospace employer. The 
responses came from firms accounting for 85% of the region's high-tech jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that the share of sales attributable to defense contracts at 
Los Angeles County firms rose to 65% from 59% in the last two years. The 
finding was based on comparing responses from 43 firms in a survey conducted 
two years ago to the same firms in the new survey. Those 43 firms account for 
74% of high-technology jobs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased dependency on military business can be explained in small part 
by the decline in commercial aircraft production in the last two years, but 
even if that had held steady it would not have changed the overall trend, 
Flaming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a rebound in commercial aircraft production is unlikely to solve the 
deep and pervasive problems affecting the region, given the continuing decline 
in the defense business. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion study to the Economic Roundtable survey, written by defense 
consultant Michael Beltramo, suggests that even after the defense budget stops 
dropping in the years ahead, Southern California will face a second blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltramo's analysis of recently declassified defense data shows that the 
Northrop B-2 bomber program and the McDonnell Douglas C-17 cargo programs 
accounted for 53% of defense contracting awards last year. Both programs may be 
ended before before 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last five years we haven't done much conversion and we have another 
five years to do something on the issue of these aircraft programs," Beltramo 
said. "It isn't clear that we are going to be any more effective in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Flaming and Beltramo said that no government agencies have seized on defense 
conversion as a "core issue" and as a result, assisting industry has fallen 
through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends that state or local agencies create programs to help 
small firms get access to private capital markets, improve communications with 
high technology industry and lay out future regulatory requirements more 
clearly.

 Into this besieged city last week arrived Connie Chung, swelling the CBS News 
assault force to more than 30. Her purpose: to make a new friend. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to get THE INTERVIEW -- ahead of Diane and Barbara and Jane and 
Katie. She came hoping to nudge out the free-spending tabloid shows, armed not 
with cash but with the blinding candlepower of a network anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 To be the one to get Tonya Harding to speak. To ask, leaning toward her 
confidentially, THE QUESTION: Did you do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "The way to do that in this day and age is, one, to pay money, which the 
networks won't do, or two, develop a close personal relationship, so the person 
you are pursuing trusts you," said "CBS Evening News" Executive Producer Erik 
Sorenson. "And the only way to do that is to be there in person." 
</P>
<P>
 So Chung, co-anchor at CBS and host of the broadcast magazine show "Eye to 
Eye," has been narrating her share of "CBS Evening News" since last week from 
the shopping mall rink in Portland where THE SUBJECT practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably go all the way with it," Sorenson said. "Connie will follow 
her all the way to Lillehammer." 
</P>
<P>
 There's rarely been anything like this -- and maybe, some say, there shouldn't 
be. The runaway Tonya Harding story -- did she conspire to injure rival ice 
skating star Nancy Kerrigan? -- has everyone galloping to get ahead, and it is 
raising questions about where the American press is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is the media's mission to put news into perspective, have they 
succeeded? If their mission is to separate fact from speculation, have they 
done so? If their mission is to honor constitutional traditions and play 
watchdog over the legal system, can they be satisfied? If their mission is to 
avoid being manipulated by newsmakers and to challenge stereotypes, have they 
managed? 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists are divided on the answers, even though most constitutional law 
experts believe that the hurricane-force coverage will not threaten fair trials 
for those involved -- even for Harding, if she is charged. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is wide agreement, even among those who love the story, that the 
sheer amount of coverage -- which has driven an assault case to heights once 
reserved for assassinations and wars -- illustrates three hard and sad facts 
about the news media: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tabloid television now colors decisions of even the most serious press 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * A big story is almost instantly inflated to apocalyptic proportions by the 
ever-intensifying frenzy of media competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Standards have all but vanished when it comes to passing along speculation 
and rumor as "news." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no distinctions drawn here between the Washington Post and the New 
York Post, or the local news story and the 'CBS Evening News' or the other 
networks," said Marvin Kalb, director of Harvard University's Shorenstein 
Barone Center for the study of press and public policy. "Without any doubt this 
is part of a broader problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24 days between Jan. 7 -- the morning after skater Nancy Kerrigan was 
whacked above the knee -- and Feb. 2, the day after Tonya Harding's ex-husband 
pleaded guilty in the injury plot, ABC, NBC and CBS aired 377 stories, an 
average of 16 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 And that does not include local TV news or the four nationally syndicated 
daily tabloid TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers were no less eager. In the same period, the New York Times ran 41 
stories, the Los Angeles Times 37, the Washington Post 46, in each case a story 
on Page One about every 2.5 days. 
</P>
<P>
 There is news even when there is no news. On Monday, CBS reported to the 
nation that Tonya Harding was parked illegally and rushed in bare feet to plead 
with a tow truck driver to spare her new pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five instant books are under way. The Oregonian, the Portland 
newspaper, has one such book in progress, titled "Fire on Ice," with a planned 
press run of 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Kerrigan books are also headed for publication this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding herself has hired a separate law firm -- her third -- merely to handle 
negotiations with book, TV movie, film and news people. "She could end up 
making more," speculated CBS' Sorenson, "than she would have from skating." 
</P>
<P>
 Why has this story taken off? 
</P>
<P>
 Because it has all the ingredients of drama -- romance and betrayal, tragedy 
and greed, triumph and suspense, all unfolding as the clock ticks down to the 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you get into the whole business of fair play, and the soap opera, and 
the sense of good versus evil, and with the ramifications of money, the 
Olympics and, heaven help us, the American Way, I don't think we are overdoing 
it," says Jeff Gralnick, the executive producer of the "NBC Nightly News" with 
Tom Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some press critics say they have no problem with what the press has done. 
"I think there is an exceptional amount of public interest," says Everette 
Dennis, executive director of the Freedom Forum, a journalism think tank in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kerrigan/Harding story does represent a change in the way the press 
covers crime, a change occurring without much reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, amid concern over the media's rush to judgment against Lee 
Harvey Oswald for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the American 
Bar Assn. set up a commission to develop guidelines for how the press should 
behave in covering crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reardon Guidelines, as they became known, were voluntarily accepted by 
press associations in many states. At the time of an arrest, it would be OK for 
the press to report basic background information about the accused, along with 
the substance of the charges, the circumstances surrounding the arrest and the 
names of the people handling the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the guidelines urged the press not to report statements about the 
character or reputation of the accused, the contents of any confession, the 
results of any lie-detector or evidentiary tests, the expected content of any 
testimony, or speculation about possible pleas of any accused. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare that to today. Practically everything you know about the Harding story 
would be outside those guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old 'free press, fair trial' standard has totally broken down," said the 
Freedom Forum's Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland was prepared for the assault wave of the news media the same way the 
California Territory was prepared for the Gold Rush. The district attorney has 
no press aide. A duty sergeant handles press calls at the sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were just the same: Hungry treasure seekers overran the place, and 
bawling anarchy broke out on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the crime, a Boston TV station reported erroneously that 
Harding was about to be arrested. This was spread nationally in a story marked 
"urgent" by the Associated Press. A day later, a Detroit radio station repeated 
the rumor, and it again became part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, from the balcony of the Portland Marriott, it was possible to see two 
parking lots sprinkled with satellite trucks and four separate live shots going 
on from different parts of the city. Free-lance video camera operators could 
make $700 to $1,200 a shift. 
</P>
<P>
 One network magazine show hired a former professional ice skater, wired him 
with a cordless microphone and had him skate near Harding and pick up anything 
he could. The tabloid shows sent friends of Harding's friends video cameras to 
take pictures of her if they could and send them to the shows, a practice now 
becoming widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "ABC World News Tonight" hired a handwriting analyst to examine notes 
retrieved from a garbage dumpster that might or might not have been 
incriminating and to speculate on whether they were Harding's. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 21 days following the attack on Kerrigan, the Oregonian published 265 
stories, nearly 13 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even slow days are manic. "Harding's Fate Left Hanging," was the huge headline 
Jan. 20, a day without news. Not much had really changed by Feb. 2: "All Eyes 
Turn to Harding." The next day: "Harding Keeps Quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregonian became both news gatherer and newsmaker. If knowledgeable 
insiders were not talking to the public, they were talking to hometown 
reporters of the Oregonian. So confident was the newspaper of its sources, the 
Oregonian largely dropped the traditional "sources said" in its reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to declare that Harding was "virtually certain to be 
arrested," it was the Oregonian saying it. And other news organizations, 
including the Los Angeles Times and New York Times, ended up quoting the 
Oregonian. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 29, a spate of reports suggested that investigators had been looking 
at telephone calls made on Harding's credit card to her so-called bodyguard. 
These calls supposedly occurred just before Kerrigan was attacked, an attack to 
which the bodyguard reportedly has confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 paragraphs of its daily roundup dispatch, the AP quoted the Oregonian, 
the Detroit Free Press and Detroit station WJBK-TV, each with a thread of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was, even if the calls were made, nobody could possibly know what 
was said, or even whether Harding herself made them. So what was the 
significance of the reports? Mainly to suggest that the noose was tightening 
around the skater's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Westling, professor of criminal law at the University of Oregon, marvels 
at some of the speculation by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had a call from a stringer for a Japanese television network. He 
wanted to know what the prison sentence would be for Tonya Harding -- and then 
he listed a potential series of charges. I'd say that's putting the cart way 
ahead of the horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the tabloid shows. Take one evening last week: "A Current 
Affair" had a "world exclusive interview" with Jeff Gillooly, Harding's 
ex-husband. "Inside Edition" had a sidewalk interview with Harding. (A 
spokeswoman declined comment on whether it had paid Harding for the time). 
"Hard Copy" had the second part of its "exclusive" interviews with the team of 
"hit men": Shane Stant and Derrick Smith. "American Journal" featured Harding's 
fitness trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Epps, professor of constitutional law at the University of Oregon in 
Eugene and a former Washington Post reporter, suggested that the press has an 
institutional desire to see Harding in the Olympics -- thereby keeping alive a 
big story. 
</P>
<P>
 By this line of reasoning, CBS in particular would have the strongest 
incentive, since it is broadcasting the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorenson denied the suggestion strongly. CBS is hardly alone in covering this 
story, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sorenson does see the influence of the tabloids. "The popularity of these 
syndicated news programs like 'Hard Copy' and the attention they pay to these 
ongoing soap operas have certainly bled all the way over into the rest of 
journalism, including the newspaper world." 
</P>
<P>
 Chung has been co-anchoring for nearly two weeks from Portland, for instance, 
because she needs to be there to woo Harding for her more tabloid-like magazine 
program, Sorenson explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the press not cover the Harding story? "No," said Kalb of the 
Shorenstein Barone Center at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does a news organization maintain restraint? Editors and news directors 
could simply draw a line, play the story modestly and then speak out about why 
they are doing so and engage the press in a debate, Kalb said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kind of editors and producers who might have done that belong to an 
earlier generation, Kalb contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the press scrambles for the interview and spends part of its time 
watching itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Oregonian columnist Pete Schulberg watched too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd of onlookers began building around 3 p.m. Tuesday at the far end of 
the Clackamas Town Center Ice Chalet. Lined two- and three-deep, they strained 
for a peek at the woman of the hour -- someone whose face is a regular fixture 
on the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 There she was -- awash in lights, peering right into the camera lens. Tonya? 
No. 
</P>
<P>
 "Connie!" 
</P>

BUDGET OFFICE SEES HEALTH PLAN WIDENING DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major setback for the Clinton Administration's health care initiative, 
the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that the reform plan would create 
a massive new government program that ultimately would prove more costly than 
Social Security and would widen the federal deficit by $74 billion during its 
first six years. 
</P>
<P>
 In its long-awaited report, the nonpartisan budget agency said the mandatory 
insurance premiums that employers would be required to pay under the Clinton 
plan should be considered government "receipts" and included in the federal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Characterizing the payments as receipts is a less politically charged 
definition than using the term "tax," but the budget office suggested that the 
mandatory premiums would have essentially the same effect as new payroll taxes 
on American workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton plan -- which the President has asked Congress to approve 
this year -- most employers would be required to pay at least 80% of the cost 
of providing insurance for their workers, with employees picking up the 
remainder. The government would subsidize premium costs for some small 
businesses and low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO, which provides official budgetary rulings for Congress, said that the 
Clinton health plan should be regarded as a huge new federal entitlement 
program. The premium payments and government subsidies would rise to an 
estimated $513 billion annually by the year 2004, nearly 20% more than 
projected Social Security outlays in that year, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing another blow to the Administration's reform campaign, which has sought 
to portray the President's initiative as a private-sector solution to the 
health crisis, the CBO said that the network of health alliances it would 
establish should be considered government entities. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned by the Administration, the alliances would act as insurance 
buying cooperatives for consumers and employers. The quasi-public entities 
would collect the mandatory premiums from employers and their workers, and then 
use the funds to buy insurance from a handful of large private insurers on 
their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO report is politically damaging because it directly challenges many of 
the basic assumptions on which the White House health care plan is founded. The 
Administration has argued that its "managed competition" plan represents a 
sophisticated public-private partnership designed to harness the power of the 
marketplace to extend coverage to all Americans, while reining in runaway 
health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have taken pains to design the plan so that it would 
not be characterized as a significant expansion of the federal government's 
role in an industry that accounts for 14% of the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 By defining the proposed system as a new entitlement in the tradition of 
Social Security and Medicare, the CBO has made it much easier for opponents to 
portray the Clinton plan as a form of socialized medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In rendering its bombshell ruling, the CBO resisted intense pressure from 
White House officials, including the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. The Clintons argued that the insurance premiums, and most of the 
plan's costs and expenditures, should be left out of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 By determining that the President's reform effort would create a new 
government program, the CBO report also will impose much tougher budgetary and 
cost discipline on the White House program. 
</P>
<P>
 CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer told the House Ways and Means Committee 
Tuesday that including the health plan in the federal budget would make it far 
more difficult for the government to use "accounting chicanery" to hide its 
true costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO's verdict that the plan would increase the federal deficit is another 
blow to the Administration. The White House has stressed repeatedly that its 
health reform campaign offers the only path to deficit reduction, because it 
will restrain the exploding costs of the government's existing health care 
programs -- Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor. The 
Administration has estimated that its plan would reduce the deficit by $58 
billion between the years 1995 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the CBO disagreed. Although the agency concurred that some form of health 
care reform is needed to curb the deficit, its report found that the Clinton 
plan would actually increase the shortfall by $74 billion for the remainder of 
this decade. The figure would increase to $126 billion by the year 2004. The 
budget office said that the Clinton plan would not result in significant 
deficit reduction until well after the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 In another troubling observation, the report agreed with private studies that 
say the Administration has underestimated by at least 15% the costs of 
providing health care to all Americans. While the White House has said that 
insurance premiums would cost about $4,200 a year for an average family of four 
under its proposal, the CBO projected a cost of $5,565 for an average 
two-parent family. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying at a packed committee hearing, Reischauer said that the costs are 
understated largely because the White House failed to anticipate many of the 
consequences of providing universal coverage and subsidizing firms and workers 
who can't afford to pay the premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The CBO estimated that the subsidies for employers would cost $58 billion 
annually by the year 2000, or $25 billion more than the Administration's 
forecasts. Reischauer said the CBO estimates reflect the agency's determination 
that the Clinton benefit package would be more generous than the average health 
care plan available to American workers today. 
</P>
<P>
 Reischauer stressed that his agency's report was not intended to be a 
condemnation of the Clinton plan. The CBO forecasts that by the year 2004, the 
Clinton reform measure would reduce overall national health care spending by 
7%, and "holds out the promise of reducing the deficit" sometime after the year 
2004, Reischauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly stung by the report, the White House and its Democratic allies in 
Congress immediately sought to downplay its significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, traveling in Shreveport, La., insisted it was a minor problem. 
Following the Administration line, Democrats on the House Ways and Means 
Committee stressed that the question of whether the Clinton health care system 
would be considered a government program is an "inside-the-Beltway issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), a member of the panel, insisted that the 
report is "good news for the Administration" because it shows that, under the 
Clinton plan, both overall health care costs and the deficit would finally 
begin to decline by the year 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) acknowledged the adverse 
political impact of the report. "I've always said that the Clinton plan would 
be modified," Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's critics agreed that the report could prove politically devastating. 
In effect, it strips away the distinctions the White House has sought to create 
between its managed competition concept and a more direct government 
intervention in the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, CBO confirmed what many of us recognized months ago -- the Clinton 
health care reform plan requires substantial new taxes," said Sen. Pete V. 
Domenici (R-N. M.).

 The restaurant seemed strangely familiar: A Los Angeles Times news rack was 
nestled next to the front door, the Raiders were playing on the large-screen 
televisions overhead and yuppies at the bar munched buffalo wings and "Dodger 
Dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 The menu offered Rodeo Drive nachos, Santa Monica clam chowder and a Wilshire 
vegetarian club sandwich. The ambience seemed straight out of Melrose Avenue; 
the blond furniture suggested a tony Encino bistro. 
</P>
<P>
 But barely visible, past the neon signs in the polished plate glass, loomed 
the Bank of China building -- an unmistakable Hong Kong landmark. Welcome to 
L.A. Cafe, a new restaurant chain, which is doing booming business by selling a 
slice of California to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wouldn't work in L.A., where it's old hat," said J.R. Robertson, an 
expatriate American insurance executive who founded the restaurant a year ago. 
"We're selling the L.A. lifestyle, which seems exotic here. Asians are throwing 
away the values of older generations and this kind of place is different from 
anything they are used to." 
</P>
<P>
 While American gourmets increasingly experiment with the foods of Thailand, 
Vietnam, Indonesia and even Myanmar, Asian diners, especially in the prosperous 
crescent from Taipei to Jakarta, have fallen head over heels in love with 
American food -- from Big Macs to Haagen-Dazs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when fast-food franchiser McDonald's opened its first restaurant in 
Singapore in 1982, it quickly became the biggest selling McDonald's in the 
world. Now, eight of the world's top 10 selling McDonald's are in Asia, seven 
of them in Hong Kong and one in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a stroll down Bangkok's Silom Road and you might think you have been 
transported to a suburban American shopping mall: McDonald's, Pizza Hut, 
Swensen's Ice Cream and a Sizzler Steak House anchor one side of the avenue, 
facing Arby's and Burger King on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Roma's, a Dallas-based franchise chain that specializes in ribs, opened 
its doors in Singapore a year ago and has a line around the block every night. 
With only 130 seats, it sells 800 meals a day. Franchised by Indonesian 
entrepreneurs, Tony Roma's has expanded to Hong Kong and Jakarta, where every 
month it manages to sell a 20-foot container-load of pork ribs in the world's 
largest Muslim country; 15 more branches are to open in the region in the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is just terrific; it's unreal," said Karl Faux, an Austrian hotelier 
who oversees Tony Roma's operations in Southeast Asia for franchise owner Mas 
Millenium. "Anything that is American is really hot right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Tony Roma's, some American companies have found success by selling food 
that is familiar to Asian tastes but is presented in an unusual setting. Pork 
ribs, after all, have been a mainstay of the ethnic Chinese diet for thousands 
of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company that is advancing in Asia is Kentucky Fried Chicken, now a 
subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc. and renamed simply KFC with "the colonel" demoted to 
a peripheral role. Tim Lane, KFC's president for Asia, said that in the last 
four years, the number of its chicken restaurants in Southeast Asia has shot 
from 250 to 600; the Japanese market has grown from 600 to 1,000. Thailand, 
where there were none as recently as 1989, has 50 KFC outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicken is a great concept for Asia because it's familiar and there are no 
health or religious issues," Lane said. "We're selling Americana and your slice 
of it. We're concentrated in areas with folks with rising incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 While rents are often higher in Asia's congested cities than in the United 
States, increased business more than compensates. Lane said that while the 
typical KFC restaurant in America does $200,000 a month in business, the 
average outlet in Asia rakes in $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 One man who successfully challenged the conventional wisdom that food has to 
be familiar to succeed in Asia is Bill Heinecke, an American who grew up in 
Thailand. When he proposed opening a Bangkok Pizza Hut in 1982, potential 
investors told him he had lost his marbles; even the franchiser was dubious. 
Asians, they said, are notorious for hating cheese -- and pizza uses lots of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heinecke is the one who is laughing these days. He just opened his 50th 
Pizza Hut in Thailand and is christening a new restaurant every 15 days. His 
company also just opened Thailand's first factory to make cheese, cranking out 
36 tons of mozzarella a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks the world is full of different people," Heinecke said in an 
interview. "But people are more similar than dissimilar. People haven't given 
up eating Thai food, but a secretary in an Esprit skirt is no longer willing to 
pull up a stool at a noodle stall. It's now considered part of the modern 
lifestyle to be seen in a fast-food restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 The ever-inventive Heinecke has capitalized on Bangkok's notorious traffic by 
hiring 500 motorcycle delivery boys and promising a pizza delivery in 30 
minutes, despite the gridlock. Most of his new restaurants don't even have 
tables and chairs but are simply kitchens and take-out windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Ng, a chemical engineer who became a millionaire as the Hong Kong 
franchise owner for McDonald's, recalled that in the early 1980s, many people 
warned him against entering the fast-food business. "Chinese won't eat 
hamburgers," he recalled being told by friends. "How can you do market research 
with food nobody had ever heard of in an ambience no one knew?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ng now owns 72 McDonald's in Hong Kong, three in China and has a one-third 
interest of the franchise in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Two factors seem to have helped speed American food into Asia during the last 
few years. First, the region is growing substantially richer, thanks to an 
economic boom that began in the early 1980s and has sustained growth rates of 
8% to 10% a year in many countries. That translates as rapidly rising salaries 
for many urban workers. "Basically, all the Asians are getting discretionary 
income making the widgets we are importing," said the L.A. Cafe's Robertson.

 Secondly, the region is not only getting richer but growing older. "A maturing 
Thai population will provide demographic support for a fast-food boom into the 
next century," said a study by Smith New Court, a stock brokerage company, 
which quoted census figures showing that 70% of the population is younger than 
30. "Combined with increasing upward mobility in this dynamic sector, consumer 
spending will continue its current up-trend." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that sets Asia apart from other regions is the relative strength of 
its families. Food outlets with the strongest appeal to families with children 
seem to have the most success. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's in Hong Kong staged 18,000 birthday parties last year for 500,000 
children. Singapore's franchise owner paid for a weekly television show hosted 
by a Chinese version of Ronald McDonald, the restaurant's trademark clown. 
"Much more than in the United States, we're very kid-oriented in Asia," KFC's 
Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most major restaurant operators try to keep their menus identical with the 
American market and import food from America when no local substitutes can be 
found. Tony Roma's coleslaw comes from Dallas; KFC's chicken comes from the 
United States and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have found, however, that Asian tastes differ: In Thailand, Pizza Hut 
puts pineapple on some of its pizzas and hot sauce on the tables; KFC offers a 
"hot and spicy" version of the old standby for Asians accustomed to piquant 
food. Burger King found that Thais, most of whom are Buddhists, weren't 
snapping up beef burgers and found a niche by promoting chicken sandwiches. 
McDonald's countered by offering fried chicken, which is not available at 
American outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while to get a handle on the market," conceded Stephen Hunt, an 
American executive who works for the Central Group, Burger King's franchise 
owner in Bangkok. "What we didn't realize at the time was that apparently a 
large segment of the market doesn't eat beef. We were advertising products with 
a limited appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 When McDonald's opens in India, now expected in about three years, beef Big 
Macs won't even be on the menu because of the Hindu reverence for the cow. "We 
haven't decided yet what will be there, but it will probably involve chicken," 
said Mike Gordon, director of communications for McDonald's Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 American marketers also had to rethink strategies to accommodate cultural 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hard Rock Cafe, for example, was a big success in Singapore and Jakarta, 
but stumbled in Thailand. For one thing, Thai customers were offended by the 
Hard Rock's legendary friendly waiters, who were encouraged to sit with the 
customers to take their orders, said James Choong, financial director of the 
restaurant. Thais were not used to sitting with servants. Another complication 
was the name -- many Thais considered a "cafe" a euphemism for a brothel. The 
company stuck with its name, but got its waiters to take orders in more formal 
fashion -- standing up; business is slowly improving. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a Hong Kong-based restaurant chain called Dan Ryan's Chicago Bar 
and Grill, which tries to evoke the image of an old Midwestern steak house, 
faced a negative image in Singapore because families would normally never go to 
a "bar" to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 One American chocolate chip cookie company encountered a hostile market 
because the gourmet treats were simply too expensive for local pocketbooks, 
even with the region's greater affluence. 
</P>
<P>
 The invasion by American food also has not been universally welcomed in Asian 
countries, many of which view with suspicion any hint that American values are 
being imported to their relatively conservative countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not be swayed by the trend towards eating non-rice food, including 
Western food," Indonesia's vice president Try Sutrisno warned in a speech last 
September. He said Indonesians should go back to eating traditional food that 
requires "more chewing." 
</P>
<P>
 But, so far, there have been few local efforts to repulse the American 
onslaught. One Thai restaurant chain, S&P, has started offering Thai food in a 
Western fast-food type setting. A number of local fast-food efforts in the 
region have failed, however, because American brands are so well-known and the 
chains achieve tremendous economies of scale by buying in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Satit Niyomyart, dean of sociology at Bangkok's Thammasat University, said he 
believes that Western food has become popular in Thailand because so many Thais 
have studied in the United States. There are 200,000 Thais in California alone, 
he noted. "It's a phenomenon of the past 15 years," Satit said. "Young Thais 
are trying to become Westernized. These lifestyle changes are worrying. People 
are gaining weight and getting fat. That never used to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 One big change wrought by the shift toward a Western diet is that young Asians 
are getting bigger than their parents, with average height and weight ratios 
much higher for the young. A study of young people published in Singapore last 
month showed that, on average, 18-year-old boys weighed 120 pounds in 1983 and 
137 pounds in 1993. Girls added 2.5 pounds, on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Because fast food is so new to the region and its clientele is so young, 
restaurant owners have yet to hear many concerns expressed about the 
healthfulness of their fare. In part, they suspect that Asian families are 
eating fast food only occasionally and don't have to start worrying about fat 
in their diet as do their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future of the industry, almost all of the restaurant executives 
interviewed believed that they have only scratched the surface of fast food in 
Asia. "If anything, the growth will be accelerated," said Gordon of McDonald's, 
who noted the chain is adding 1,000 restaurants a year outside the United 
States and doubling its presence in China next year. "There's a lot of 
opportunity and potential in the Asian market." 
</P>
<P>
 Cerebos Pacific, which holds the franchise for Pizza Hut in Singapore and 
Malaysia, is adding 15 restaurants in the next few months. It reported a 
$56-million profit last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the day last week that President Clinton lifted the American trade 
embargo against Vietnam, McDonald's received inquiries about the possibility of 
opening restaurants in Asia's newest market. But Gordon said there were "no 
plans to go into Vietnam . . . yet."

ON CALIFORNIA: IMMIGRATION VERSUS THE IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is America, and the only foreigners here are those who forget it is 
America.  
</P>
<P>
 -- William Saroyan, from "The Human Comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the nativists screech about immigration, I wonder about the Trejo brothers. 
There were three of them, Lionel, Manual and Salvador. I knew them as a high 
school kid, working summers in a feedlot outside Kerman, in the San Joaquin 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 They had come north long on dreams and, it was presumed, short on 
documentation. They were hard workers, particularly Salvador, a tall man with a 
stoic, almost mystical presence. Salvador and I were floaters in the feed mill: 
One day we might drive feed trucks or sweep out grain bins; the next we might 
be handed shovels and directed to the pens, where our task was to scoop cow 
pies from the troughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all pays the same," was our consoling joke, spoken in two tongues. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers Trejo lived together in lowly conditions. It was said in the 
lunchroom that they sent their money home. It was said that deep in the Mexican 
interior their minimal wages were building, slowly, quite a cattle ranch. It's 
been 20 years since my feedlot days, and I have no easy way of knowing what 
became of Salvador and his brothers and their dream of a cattle barony. But I 
can hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I offer this experience, not as something extraordinary but rather because it 
is common. Most Californians cannot help but view immigration as something more 
personal than a policy debate. Sweat beside somebody under the hot August sun 
-- or entrust your children or at least your lawn to them -- and, before you 
know it, you know them. And the whole question of immigration becomes one of 
immigrants, and the difference is huge. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many Californians who regard illegal immigration -- and what's 
illegal one decade might well be legal the next -- not as a crime, but as a 
deal, a transaction. It's not perfect. It's not clean. But almost everyone 
benefits. For the people from down south, it's an opportunity to pull 
themselves up, to dream. For us, it's a source of cheap labor, of workers who 
will take on jobs that from all appearances no one else wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard political terminology becomes inadequate. Advocates of undocumented 
workers should hardly be described as bleeding heart liberals, because the case 
can be made that the whole setup creates an underclass of powerless peons. 
Conversely, bedrock conservatives, it seems, should regard this labor pool as a 
commodity, a perfect exhibit of free market forces, of supply meeting demand. 
Certainly the farmers understand this. Let the border be truly sealed, and the 
screams of immigrant-bashers would be drowned out by the clamor from 
well-connected growers in need of seasonal pickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the demagogues prefer to ignore these realities. They prefer to 
depict illegal immigration as a social drain, and they come to the task 
equipped with shovelfuls of studies and statistics. For instance, they fling 
about tremendous estimates of money spent at public hospitals caring for the 
illegal sick. Where they obtain these numbers is a mystery, because citizenship 
status is one of the few questions not asked by admitting nurses. Perhaps the 
hospital workers simply assume anyone of brown skin is an "alien." In this 
assumption, they would not be alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And now with the earthquakes we have a few politicians all excited about 
ensuring no illegal immigrants receive long-term federal relief. Not that any 
legislator would explicitly advocate the opposite. The game is more subtle than 
that, a competition of posture and symbol. Post a Border Patrol, but withhold 
the money needed to fulfill its mission. Talk tough about cutting off 
earthquake aid, but make it clear emergency care will be provided, no questions 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect some of the bashers simply misread the polls. Yes, the short answer 
might be that a majority of Californians is concerned about illegal 
immigration, especially amid an economic slump. But probe deeper -- and at 
least one conservative pollster I know has done just that -- and this fast 
reaction clashes against a deeper, more stable value. And that is basic 
fairness. And it comes from knowing immigrants as people, and not just fodder 
for cheap politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after the earthquake, I watched tenants attempt to retrieve what 
they could from a wrecked apartment house in Northridge. This was nervous work, 
with more than a few residents afraid to step inside the building. A U-Haul 
pulled up. Out leaped three young men who looked like the day laborers who 
stand on certain street corners every morning. The truck renter pointed and the 
young men went to work, carrying out load after load. They worked hard and fast 
and they asked no questions. They kept up their end of the deal.

SPRAYING OKD OVER CORONA BUT WON'T BEGIN YET; AGRICULTURE: STATE OFFICIALS 
POSTPONE MALATHION TREATMENT OF MEDFLIES TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO PREPARE. DELAY 
GIVES CITY A CHANCE TO FILE ANOTHER APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An appellate court Tuesday cleared the way to begin aerial spraying of 
malathion over Corona and Norco, but state agricultural officials -- who had 
hoped to begin spraying Tuesday night to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly 
-- postponed their plans for at least a week so residents would have more time 
to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 The reprieve will also give Corona city officials more time to file another 
appeal in their effort to block the spraying. They contend that the aerial 
application of the insecticide jeopardizes public health and that Gov. Pete 
Wilson acted illegally in approving the action. The state says it is necessary 
to eradicate the crop-ravaging pest before it spreads to rich farmlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will file our appeal to the state Supreme Court this week, asking that a 
complete review of this issue be made," said Corona City Manager Bill Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has lost two efforts to legally block the malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the U.S. 4th District Court of Appeals in San Bernardino said the 
state's need to rid the pest in Corona was "obvious," and called the aerial 
spraying "an essential part (of Medfly eradication) and . . . poses no 
substantial risk of other than transient and trivial detriment to persons." 
</P>
<P>
 The court sided with a Riverside Superior Court judge who refused last week to 
overrule Wilson's declaration that the state's agricultural industry is at risk 
because of the pest. Such an executive level decision was appropriate, both 
courts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 With both courts upholding their plan, state officials had hoped to begin 
spraying Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But Corona city officials asked Wilson late Tuesday to keep the helicopters 
grounded because residents assumed there would be no spraying that night, 
Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one expected the appellate court to make its review so quickly," he said. 
"The governor was sensitive to that issue and recognized that in the best 
interest of everybody, (public) renotification of the spraying should occur. 
The helicopters were even being gassed up. It was real close, and there was a 
horrible amount of confusion -- were they going to spray or not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Dowell, the state's primary entomologist, confirmed that the spraying 
is being postponed "because of concerns and confusion about the notification to 
citizens," and said the date of the spraying had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Tuesday, the state Department of Food and Agriculture expanded the 
Medfly quarantine area in the Los Angeles Basin to 1,576 square miles -- about 
180 square miles larger than the quarantine zone announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation of fruit is regulated in the quarantine area to control the 
spread of the Medfly. The zone was expanded to reflect consolidation of more 
than 20 infestation zones, officials said. The quarantine area is larger than 
the one ordered at the peak of the 1989-90 Medfly infestation.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN EX-WORKER'S SUIT AGAINST SAN ONOFRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge declared a mistrial Tuesday after a jury deadlocked 7 to 2 in 
favor of a former nuclear inspector who claimed that the operators of the San 
Onofre nuclear plant were negligent and that she contracted cancer from leaking 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Magistrate Rudi Brewster set March 1 for a retrial in the case of Rung 
C. Tang, a former inspector for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is 
suffering from chronic myelogenous leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror John Bergamo said a majority of the panel were convinced that Tang was 
exposed to a dangerous level of radiation and that the plant's majority owner, 
Southern California Edison, showed callous disregard for workers' safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the trial, I was a supporter of nuclear power," said Bergamo, 44, a 
machinist. "Now I'm not so sure. The basic philosophy (of Edison) seems to be 
that if you work at San Onofre you're going to be contaminated. That's 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Tang's attorney, Don Howarth, said his client is open to a settlement to avoid 
a second trial, but Edison Vice President Dick Rosenblum said the company looks 
forward to the retrial. Before the trial, Tang had offered to settle for $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very complex, technical case with a lot of emotion," Rosenblum 
said. "The evidence by the experts showed that Ms. Tang's illness was not 
connected to her time at San Onofre. The jury simply didn't appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergamo said he thought the evidence showed that Edison put profits above 
safety, a major contention of Tang's attorneys. "They could have bought new 
(protective) suits for workers but it would have cost $4 million so they 
didn't," Bergamo said. 
</P>
<P>
 To find in favor of Tang, Brewster said, the jurors had to be unanimous on 
four questions: Was Tang subject to unsafe levels of radiation? Did it cause 
her cancer? Does she deserve damages? Did Edison show disregard for safety? 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors split 7 to 2 on the first question, despite five days of 
deliberation, and never proceeded to the second question. The two women on the 
jury sided with Edison, the seven men with Tang. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was closely watched by both anti-nuclear activists and nuclear 
industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-nuclear activists said they hoped the trial would convince the public 
that nuclear plants are unsafe and run by people who do not care about human 
safety. Industry officials maintained that a ruling in Tang's favor could bring 
an avalanche of similar suits against the operators of the nation's 108 other 
nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang, 44, worked at San Onofre during 1985 and 1986 when the plant was plagued 
with defective fuel rods and microscopic bits of radioactive material called 
fuel fleas. The fleas clung to workers' clothing and were spread throughout the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the competing testimony during the monthlong trial concerned the 
extent of the flea problem and whether Edison did everything possible to 
correct it. Edison presented evidence that Tang's exposure was far below 
acceptable levels established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Tang's 
lawyers offered experts who said that the monitoring devices used at San Onofre 
were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang, who underwent a bone marrow transplant and is confined to sterile 
surroundings in her home in Pasadena, did not testify or attend the trial. Her 
case was brought to trial faster than most civil cases after her doctor gave an 
affidavit to the court assessing her life expectancy at six months.

HANGING CONSTITUTIONAL, U.S. COURT RULES; EXECUTIONS: APPELLATE JUDGES, DIVIDED 
BY A 6-5 VOTE, REJECT CLAIM OF UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT BY MAN CONVICTED OF A 
WASHINGTON TRIPLE MURDER. DISSENTING OPINION CALLS IT A RELIC OF DARK AGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Execution by hanging is constitutional, a sharply divided federal appeals 
court ruled Tuesday in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 6-5 vote, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claim of 
Washington triple murderer Charles R. Campbell, whose lawyers argued that death 
by hanging constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging does not violate "contemporary standards of decency" or inflict 
unnecessary pain, according to the majority opinion. The state of Washington's 
procedures for hanging have safeguards against decapitation or a slow death by 
strangling, wrote Circuit Judge Robert R. Beezer of Seattle for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Campbell is not entitled to a painless execution, but only to one free of 
purposeful cruelty," Beezer added. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question, the judge wrote, is whether a method of execution causes 
"wanton and unnecessary pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenting Judge Stephen Reinhardt of Los Angeles lashed out at the majority 
for preserving a method of execution from "the Dark Ages." He also said the 
ruling "drastically curtails the scope and meaning" of the cruel and unusual 
punishment clause. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Anno Domini 1994, when almost every state and most other nations have 
rejected such a savage and barbaric method of killing its citizens, no court 
could in good conscience say that hanging comports with our 'evolving standards 
of decency,' " Reinhardt wrote, alluding to the U.S. Supreme Court's 
longstanding criterion for evaluating cruel and unusual punishment claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only Washington and Montana still permit hanging, the decision has 
broad ramifications in nine Western states, including California, because of 
the way it defines cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar challenge to California's use of the gas chamber filed by the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California is pending before U.S. 
District Judge Marilyn H. Patel in San Francisco. Last week, Patel said that 
the Campbell decision might give her some guidance in deciding that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy California Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette said Tuesday that he believes the 
9th Circuit's decision in the Campbell case strengthens the state's position 
that use of the gas chamber is constitutionally permissible. The passage on 
"unnecessary pain" in the case "sounds very much like the position we've 
taken," Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
 But ACLU attorney Michael Laurence said he thought the ruling was beneficial 
to those challenging the gas chamber, because the majority emphasized how 
quickly hanging works. "The reason the majority in Campbell can comfortably say 
hanging is not unconstitutional is because the standard they use is 
instantaneous unconsciousness," Laurence said. "Even California Department of 
Corrections records show that consciousness in lethal gas executions ranges at 
a minimum from two to three minutes. That's a far cry from the six to twelve 
seconds the majority in Campbell finds to be constitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's death penalty statute gives condemned inmates the choice of 
execution by hanging or lethal injection. If an inmate declines to choose a 
method, the statute provides that death will be by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 The Campbell case has a long and stormy history. Now 39, Campbell was 
convicted of slashing the throats of two women and a child in Clearview, Wash., 
in 1982 and has been on Death Row since then. The women had testified in a 1976 
trial in which Campbell was convicted of attacking and sodomizing one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's execution has been stayed because of appeals on numerous issues. 
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case twice and in 1992 took the 
highly unusual step of criticizing the 9th Circuit for failing to resolve the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's attorney, James E. Lobsenz, said he plans to file a writ with the 
Supreme Court, zeroing in on the punishment issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul D. Weisser, assistant Washington attorney general, said he doubted 
that the high court would grant Campbell a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobsenz said his writ would emphasize the fact that all but two states have 
abandoned hanging as a means of execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Beezer, writing for the appeals court majority, said that argument 
misses the point: "The number of states using hanging is evidence of public 
perception, but sheds no light on the actual pain that may or may not attend 
the practice. We cannot conclude that judicial hanging is incompatible with 
evolving standards of decency simply because few states continue the practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt said the majority was wrong on this point, saying, "Where nearly 
every state has abandoned a method of punishment, and they have done so 
precisely because they found it abhorrent and inhumane, we cannot but conclude 
that punishment is inconsistent with our standards of decency." 
</P>
<P>
 In an appendix to his dissent, Reinhardt lists the years when states abandoned 
hanging, starting with Wisconsin in 1853 and most recently Delaware, New 
Hampshire and the U.S. military in 1986. California abandoned the practice in 
1937. 
</P>
<P>
 "States have rejected hanging in favor of electrocution, lethal gas, lethal 
injection and even the firing squad. Although some of these methods may 
themselves be questioned as inhumane, the states have considered all of them to 
be more humane than hanging," Reinhardt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of this . . . court has no business substituting its judgment 
for the clearly expressed view of nearly every state legislature in the 
nation," Reinhardt wrote. "Under the Constitution, that consensus binds us." 
</P>
<P>
 Beezer said scientific testimony, presented to federal trial Judge John R. 
Coughenour in Seattle showed that a hanging that adheres to proper procedures 
causes "rapid unconsciousness and death . . . within a matter of a few 
seconds." Washington's standards for the elasticity of the rope, the position 
of the knot and the length of the drop minimized the risk of strangling or 
decapitation, Beezer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said these conclusions were consistent with medical reports of 
Washington's hanging of convicted killer Westley Allan Dodd in January, 1993. 
Dodd, one of only two people to be executed by hanging in the country in the 
past three decades, did not try to halt the execution. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reinhardt's dissent said considerable testimony was presented in the lower 
court showing that "each time an individual is to be hanged there is a 
significant risk of decapitation or of a slow, lingering and painful death." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that reports of what occurred at the Dodd execution were suspect 
because the state had refused the request of Campbell's attorneys that it be 
videotaped, and limited who could be in an attendance so that no independent 
expert was able to view the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Reinhardt wrote, Washington did not consult any medical experts for 
its procedures, but relied on a 1959 military manual. Beezer said evidence from 
other states was not comparable, but Reinhardt said that Washington's methods 
did not differ much from those in other states where prisoners had been 
strangled or beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA criminal law professor Peter Arenella said the decision showed a deep 
division within the 9th Circuit on cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Reinhardt's dissent was unusually critical of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a time when public fear of crime and violence is high, it may be 
understandable that some judges will on occasion close their eyes to the 
dictates of the Constitution, and employ whatever form of rationalization or 
self-deception will lead them to the result they deem expedient," Reinhardt 
wrote in a dissent that quoted writers Brendan Behan, Albert Camus, Charles 
Dickens and lyrics of a Billie Holliday song about lynching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, however, there is not even any such excuse for the majority's actions," 
he said, castigating the majority for failing to even consider whether another 
method of execution would be less painful. "The issue before us is not whether 
Campbell will be executed, but only the method by which he will be put to 
death."

KING-SIZED KINK; DESPITE ZIGZAG NECK, GIRAFFE ACTS LIKE ANY OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds like something from the far reaches of Dr. Seuss' mind -- a giraffe 
with a crooked neck. 
</P>
<P>
 But just such an animal grazes in the lush confines of the Santa Barbara Zoo: 
a 7-year-old female Baringo giraffe whose neck, for reasons yet unknown, 
zigzags at a startling 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians and other medical experts are baffled by the bizarre condition, 
which has been documented only once before -- 92 years ago, in a British 
zoological journal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never seen anything like that at any other zoo," said veterinarian Tim 
Overskei, who has been observing the creature since he joined the zoo staff 
four months ago. "I think it's a miracle she's alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-foot-tall animal does not appear to be in any discomfort and has 
remained on public view. But its freakish appearance posed a peculiar problem 
for the 30-year-old zoo: What does a zoo do with an animal that is flawed -- 
particularly a zoo in a city where beauty and perfection are expected? Was the 
giraffe an embarrassment -- or a marketing bonanza? 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, she has been neither. Zoo officials have been careful not to 
exploit the giraffe's unusual appearance to draw crowds. "We didn't want her to 
be a circus sideshow," said Nancy Hollenbeck, the zoo's assistant director. 
"That's not the image we're trying to convey." 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that the giraffe's appearance may puzzle or alarm visitors, the zoo 
posted a sign at the animal's grassy enclosure: "The young female giraffe has a 
neck deformity; we are aware of the problem and are monitoring it daily. She is 
in no discomfort. Thank you for your concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Just what put the zig in the zigzag neck is a mystery. The giraffe (which, 
like most of the zoo's other 700 residents, has never been named) appeared fine 
at birth at the San Diego Wild Animal Park in 1986. She was fine a year later 
when she arrived at the Santa Barbara Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The only clue is a freak happening in 1988. A worker saw her take a tumble -- 
a complete somersault, actually. But even then, she showed no sign of injury. 
It was not until the next year that workers noticed a slight bend in her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, visitors were constantly asking what was wrong. Was it a broken neck? 
Was she in pain? Did she need a chiropractor? 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened slowly, over a long period of time," said Julia Parker, the zoo's 
supervisor of animal care. "Her appetite has never been in question. She's 
always eaten well." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, zoo veterinarians scoured giraffe houses across the country for 
similar cases. They found nothing until Overskei dug up a 1902 publication of 
the Zoological Society of London. 
</P>
<P>
 The journal reported on an autopsy of a giraffe with a crooked neck that 
showed bones on one side of its neck had grown normally, while those on the 
other side had stopped growing. The result: excessive spinal pressure and a 
cockeyed neck. 
</P>
<P>
 That is only one possible explanation for the Santa Barbara case, Overskei 
said. The curve could also be caused by a tumor, a misalignment of the 
vertebrae or a muscle spasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Giraffes usually live to be about 15, and Overskei does not believe that the 
animal is in imminent danger. "If it was life-threatening it would already have 
resulted in death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bend is growing more pronounced, the giraffe does not seem 
bothered. She gave birth to a calf in 1991. It died of pneumonia, but its neck 
was straight. 
</P>
<P>
 She gets along fine with the three other giraffes that occupy the one-acre 
enclosure overlooking the ocean. There, storks, cranes and hornbills -- all 
natives of the Ugandan wilds where the rare Baringo giraffes originate -- 
skitter around a pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Overskei is eager to X-ray and biopsy the giant neck kink. That 
promises to be a difficult operation because giraffes cannot lie down -- it's 
too hard for them to get back up. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the zoo will construct a padded chute to confine the animal in a 
standing position for the procedures, and the giraffe will be tranquilized 
beforehand. However, it could take four months of tedious training in the chute 
before the animal is comfortable enough with it to undergo the examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to do anything to jeopardize her health," Overskei said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, when the deformity appeared, officials considered moving her from 
public view to a facility where she could breed and live out the rest of her 
life with more privacy, Hollenbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that idea was dropped as zoo personnel began to realize that the giraffe's 
presence might be an unstated lesson about disabilities for the public, 
especially children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a giraffe that functions like every other giraffe," Hollenbeck said. 
"It's really no different. It's healthy."

TALBOTT GIVES UNRESERVED SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AT CONFIRMATION HEARING; DIPLOMACY: 
NOMINEE FOR NO. 2 POST AT STATE DEPARTMENT BACKS AWAY FROM PROVOCATIVE 
ASSERTIONS HE MADE AS A JOURNALIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Backing away from some of the provocative assertions he made during his career 
as a journalist, Strobe Talbott expressed unreserved support for Israel on 
Tuesday and said that the United States should never use foreign aid to 
pressure friendly democracies into changing course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not here to defend all the opinions I have expressed over the years," 
Talbott, who is President Clinton's choice to be deputy secretary of state, 
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after several members read him 
excerpts from columns he wrote for Time magazine going back more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always believed that the U.S.-Israeli relationship is unshakable," 
Talbott said. "I have always believed that a strong Israel is in America's 
interest because it serves the cause of peace and stability in the region. I am 
proud to be part of an Administration that will promote a comprehensive peace 
in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 And, directly contradicting an opinion written 13 years ago, Talbott, who 
served as Time's Washington bureau chief and then as a columnist before joining 
the Clinton Administration last year as the State Department's chief policy 
czar on Russia, said he believes a strong Israel is a "strategic asset" of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's hearing on Talbott's nomination to be the State Department's 
second-ranking official turned into something of a seminar on his journalistic 
career after Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) displayed poster-sized snippets of 
Talbott's columns on an easel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Talbott, who was Clinton's roommate at Oxford University, is 
expected to be confirmed easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Talbott has specialized in the language, literature and politics of 
Russia and other former Soviet republics since his prep school days, the focus 
of the hearing was on his views about Israel, the support it receives from the 
American Jewish community and ethnic-based American politics in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton A. Klein, the leader of a conservative American Jewish organization, 
set the stage for the debate last week by circulating Talbott columns that he 
charged were anti-Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms said he has been barraged by letters and telephone calls complaining 
about a 1981 column asserting that American Jews "wield influence far beyond 
their numbers," and that some Americans were becoming irritated at "the power 
of the pro-Israel lobby." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott said the column was intended to "underscore the strength, the passion 
that the American Jewish community -- quite rightly -- brings to the question 
of what U.S. relations should be with the state of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same column, Talbott wrote that Israel was "a dubious asset on the way 
to becoming an outright liability" for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't feel the same way I did 13 years ago on this," Talbott 
said. "I simply changed my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) reminded Talbott that the assertion 
American Jews were influential beyond their numbers was attributed in the 
column to ex-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. And he quoted from the 
column: "Israel has been a credit to itself and its American backers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe that?" Biden asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, senator, I do," Talbott replied. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) suggested that Talbott had been critical of 
the ethnic aspects of American politics by which Greek-Americans are interested 
in policy toward Greece, American Jews in policy toward Israel and so on, the 
nominee quickly denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an aspect of American politics. . . . We're better off for it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Talbott said he will continue to have special responsibility for U.S. 
policy toward the former Soviet republics and the other formerly Communist 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, he said he will relinquish his post as 
senior adviser on the former Soviet Union to James Collins, a career diplomat 
who is his deputy and formerly was the No. 2 official at the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow.

CLINTON'S 'NEW DEMOCRAT' AGENDA REOPENS RACIAL DIVISIONS; PRESIDENT'S IDEAS ON 
CRIME AND WELFARE DON'T SIT WELL WITH BLACKS IN CONGRESS. LIBERALS' 
DISSATISFACTION MAY BE RISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The old racial divides within the Democratic coalition are resurfacing as 
President Clinton pursues his "new Democrat" agenda on crime, welfare and other 
domestic matters. 
</P>
<P>
 On an array of racially charged issues, tensions are sharpening between the 
Administration and black leaders. Crime tops the list of disputes, with the 
Congressional Black Caucus and the Rev. Jesse Jackson intensifying their 
efforts to derail tough anti-crime legislation that Clinton has urged Congress 
to complete quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But rifts are looming on other issues as well, including the pressure on 
domestic spending imposed by the budget deal the Administration pushed through 
Congress last summer and Clinton's expected proposal to require all welfare 
recipients to work after two years on the rolls. In floor speeches last week, 
several black representatives pointedly proposed that if the government is 
going to halt aid to poor women after two years, it should apply the same limit 
to other recipients of federal subsidies, like farmers and victims of 
hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the battle with organized labor last fall over the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, the divisions between the President and black leaders reflect 
the strains in Clinton's effort to synthesize an appeal that attracts moderates 
without alienating the party's base. Although the Democratic left still 
supports much of Clinton's agenda -- particularly his push for universal health 
coverage -- the black leadership's dissent on crime and welfare may represent a 
cutting edge of rising dissatisfaction among liberals about the 
Administration's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has shown a consistent flexibility when pressured," one source close 
to Jackson said. "So if people go back to the streets and escalate the 
pressure, he will bend to where the pressure comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), a leader in the black caucus and an early 
Clinton supporter during the 1992 campaign, said: "Everybody is anxious to get 
along with the President. But when I endorsed him, I knew it wouldn't be a 
love-fest. I want to handle (differences) as diplomatically as possible, but I 
have to be true to my philosophy and my constituency, and I think that speaks 
to where the black caucus is now." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, these rumblings on the left show no sign of changing Clinton's 
direction: In his State of the Union Address last month, he reaffirmed his 
support for the two-year welfare limit and endorsed the "three strikes" 
provision that would impose life imprisonment without parole on criminals 
convicted of three violent felonies -- a measure staunchly opposed by the black 
caucus and other liberals. But the pressure is certain to rise as the crime and 
welfare issues move forward in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a real test," one of Clinton's centrist advisers says. 
"This could very well be the crunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton's relations with Jackson and some other black leaders were 
uneven during his campaign, as President he has almost entirely avoided direct 
confrontations. The only exception occurred last summer, when black leaders 
fumed at Clinton's decision to withdraw the nomination of C. Lani Guinier for 
the Justice Department's top civil rights job. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton only filled that crucial job last week, with the appointment of Boston 
attorney Deval Patrick, after opposition from the black caucus doomed his 
second nominee, John Payton. Other key civil rights jobs in the Administration, 
including the chairmanship at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 
remain unfilled -- a delay that has angered many black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sharpest divisions between Clinton and the black political leadership 
are opening not on civil rights but crime. In some ways, the dialogue in the 
black community about crime is moving toward Clinton's stress on values and 
individual responsibility: Jackson in particular has escalated his denunciation 
of black-on-black crime. Black legislators also broadly support Clinton's call 
for more police and tighter gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 But black leaders simultaneously are amplifying their criticism of the 
anti-crime legislation the Senate passed last fall. Civil rights groups and 
black legislators maintain that the Senate bill's emphasis on prison 
construction and toughened sentences will be ineffective and is likely to 
"disproportionately" penalize African Americans, as Rep. Robert C. Scott 
(D-Va.) put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Craig Washington (D-Tex.) has put forward an alternative crime bill that 
runs entirely against the current in the Senate: His legislation would 
eliminate all mandatory minimum sentences (which civil rights groups maintain 
are applied disproportionately against blacks and Latinos), expand drug 
treatment for prisoners and fund social programs like Head Start and midnight 
sports leagues in troubled neighborhoods rather than spend $3 billion on new 
prisons, as the Senate bill proposes. Hearings on the legislation are scheduled 
for later this month, and although it has little chance of passage, it is 
likely to influence House deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingerly, some Clinton advisers and legislative allies have suggested that in 
resisting his blend of prevention and punishment, the black congressional 
leaders may be out of touch with their own constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, polls show that the view of blacks and whites on crime overlap 
substantially -- although they diverge in important respects as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Los Angeles Times survey showed that blacks are more optimistic than 
whites that prisoners can be rehabilitated, more worried that a crackdown on 
criminals might produce increased discrimination against minorities and 
somewhat more likely to tilt the balance in spending toward prevention rather 
than punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 But blacks do not differ significantly from whites in their support for 
stiffened penalties on criminals: In the recent Times Poll, 71% of blacks said 
juveniles who commit crimes should be treated as adults, and more than 
two-thirds supported the "three strikes" provision; three in five blacks 
support the death penalty, other surveys indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare reform, the politics are equally complicated. Most of the black 
caucus already appears leery of Clinton's evolving welfare reform initiative: 
Many of them signed a letter organized by House liberals last fall criticizing 
the time limit and other expected key elements of his plan. In a floor speech 
last week, Rep. Major R. Owens (D-N.Y.), said that, if poor women were to be 
cut off government aid after two years, "I want to spread that principle so 
that every American who gets any kind of assistance, any subsidy -- and I am 
not talking about Social Security -- should have a limitation of two years." 
</P>
<P>
 As on crime, some Clinton supporters suggest that the black legislators may be 
taking more doctrinaire positions on welfare reform than their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 In polling, whites are more likely than blacks to blame welfare dependency on 
lack of individual initiative; African Americans primarily point the finger at 
jobs. But across the racial divide, views on policy options largely converge. 
Recent surveys have found that blacks, like whites, overwhelmingly support a 
two-year time limit on welfare, as long as recipients are offered public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the politics of either/or on crime and welfare reform does a 
disservice to both blacks and whites," says Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster 
who has conducted recent surveys on both issues. "Whites don't only believe in 
getting tough and blacks don't only believe in giving a helping hand. It's 
possible for intelligent human beings to hold both ideas in their heads at the 
same time. And in fact most people -- black and white -- do." 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton is to avoid a racial split in the Democratic Party over welfare and 
crime, he may first have to convince black leaders that his agenda embodies 
compassion as well as toughness -- and then convince them they should accept 
that balance as well. How Do Views Differ by Race? 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks generally agree with Clinton welfare proposals and support "three 
strikes" crime legislation even though many think that tougher crime laws would 
discriminate against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare reform: That all able-bodied welfare recipients be required to get 
a job after two years of training or lose their benefits. 03,12,08,08 Whites 
Blacks Favor 90% 73% Oppose 7% 26% Don't know 3% 1% * 
</P>
<P>
 On "three strikes": Proposals would require that any criminal convicted of 
three violent felonies be imprisoned for life without the possibility of 
parole. 03,12,08,08 Whites Blacks Favor 81% 67% Oppose 15% 28% Don't know 4% 5% 
* 
</P>
<P>

stricter, would they cause increased discrimination against minority groups or 
will they be enforced equitably for all racial groups? 03,20,08,08 Whites

NEWS ANALYSIS; SHELLED MARKET NOT SOLE SPUR TO INTERVENTION; BOSNIA: FORCES 
HAVE ERODED THE WEST'S LARGELY PASSIVE POSITION AND PUSHED IT CLOSER TO A NEW, 
MORE ACTIVE ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, as snipers picked off pedestrians and artillerymen cut down 
children at play in Sarajevo, the United States and its European allies seemed 
paralyzed -- their vaunted power unused, their diplomacy wasted in empty 
threats and sterile bickering over whose fault it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, finally, the great powers of the West say they are getting serious about 
lifting the siege of Sarajevo. They are preparing a demand for the removal of 
artillery from the mountains around the city, and threatening air strikes to 
enforce the order. 
</P>
<P>
 What has brought Washington and its allies to the brink of action after 
blinking away so much violence, brutality and death? Was it really just the 
happenstance of a single mortar shell that fell into a crowded outdoor market 
last Saturday, killing 68 shoppers near the old stone bridge where World War I 
began? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't underestimate the impact of that," a White House official said. "We all 
saw it. It killed more people than had been killed in any one incident. And it 
came exactly three weeks after the President of the United States told NATO 
that it shouldn't threaten air strikes if it didn't mean it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet much as the grisly scene served as a catalyst, other forces were already 
at work eroding the West's largely passive position and pushing it closer to a 
new, more active role. The tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina has refused to yield 
to rhetoric or simple diplomacy. And it has relentlessly exposed the inability 
of the West's humanitarian efforts to achieve anything like humane results. 
</P>
<P>
 At a tactical level, there has been a growing recognition that Sarajevo could 
not hold out forever. Added to that is the slow deterioration of the U.N. 
forces' capacity to deliver relief aid, accompanied by escalating attacks on 
peacekeeping troops by all three Bosnian factions. And there was the sinking 
realization, as one U.S. diplomat put it, that "whatever we did, we couldn't do 
much worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will actually carry out its new 
threat to take military action after failing to back up earlier warnings, and 
whether air strikes can succeed in deterring further attacks on the civilians 
of Sarajevo, remain to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even less certain is whether relieving the city's punishing siege will do much 
to end the war that has killed more than 200,000 people in less than two years. 
Some diplomats even worry that saving Sarajevo could have an unintended side 
effect: encouraging the Muslim-led Bosnian government to harden its stand in 
peace negotiations and further slow the snail's-pace progress toward 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as NATO meets today in Brussels to consider a new strategy, the 
alliance's key members have already moved several steps closer to military 
intervention against the Bosnian Serbs -- an act that would be a watershed in 
the sad history of halfhearted Western attempts to stop the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have moved, the British have moved, the French have moved," a senior State 
Department official said. "We still hope air strikes won't be necessary. But if 
you took a poll, four out of five officials working on this think we will end 
up using force." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed NATO plan, a combination of U.S., British and French ideas, would 
order the Bosnian Serbs to move all artillery and other heavy weapons at least 
20 kilometers from Sarajevo -- about 13 miles, a distance intended to put the 
city out of range. They would be given seven to 10 days to comply, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, NATO would order the Bosnian government to turn over to U.N. 
peacekeepers all heavy weapons inside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO would threaten to destroy any armored vehicle, mortar or artillery piece 
found inside the 20-kilometer zone after the deadline, the officials said. "We 
have been ready for this kind of use of force for some time, but this time we 
think the Europeans are ready too," a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the ultimatum in Sarajevo, the Clinton Administration has agreed to 
European pleas to work more actively for a negotiated settlement in the war, 
officials said. Until now, the United States attended the negotiations as an 
observer, but refused to give any real support to the Europeans' peace plan, 
which would divide Bosnia into Serbian, Croatian and Muslim republics -- 
accepting, in the process, Serbian forces' conquest of large segments of what 
was formerly Muslim land. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Saturday's attack, the United States and its allies had been 
moving toward a more energetic effort to relieve the siege of Sarajevo and 
restart the peace talks, officials said. That work began in earnest Feb. 1, 
when British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher that Europe wanted more U.S. leadership on the issue, U.S. and 
British officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd also convinced Christopher that the European Union was willing to agree 
to a U.S. demand that the peace talks avoid putting pressure on the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 But the weekend massacre gave both sides a mighty push, officials said. It 
stepped up pressure from Congress, European parliaments and the public for 
action. A CNN/USA Today poll released Tuesday found that 48% of Americans 
favored allied air strikes in Bosnia, against 43% opposed -- a switch from 
before the massacre, when a Los Angeles Times poll found 33% in favor and 48% 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats were still seeking agreement from two countries reluctant to 
sign on: Russia, a U.N. Security Council member with historic and cultural ties 
to Serbs, and Canada, a NATO member that fears its 2,000 peacekeeping troops in 
Bosnia might become targets for retaliation if air strikes occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in Congress remained skeptical too. "If you embark on this policy, you 
had better be able to tell the American people what you do if it fails -- what 
is the other option if this doesn't work," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a 
conservative member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that 
air strikes could be counted as a success even if they merely reduced the 
shelling.

BOSNIAN CROAT LEADER QUITS IN BID TO BLUNT CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The leader of Bosnia's Croats stepped down Tuesday in a move aimed at 
improving their position in peace negotiations and minimizing criticism of 
Croatia's efforts to support ethnic kin in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by battlefield losses and the breakdown of an alliance between Bosnian 
Croats and Muslims, Mate Boban resigned as president of the self-proclaimed 
republic of Herzeg-Bosna. The front-runner to replace him, former Bosnian Prime 
Minister Mile Akmadzic, acted as the representative of the Bosnian Croats at 
recent peace talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 Boban, an ally of Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman, told members of the 
self-styled state's assembly meeting in the city of Livno that Bosnia's Croats 
never intended any ill will toward the Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Croats are not entirely free of imprudence in this conflict," Boban said. 
"But they never had bad intentions toward the Muslims, nor did anything to 
cause the destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
</P>
<P>
 Croats and Muslims once fought side by side in an alliance against the 
expansionist moves of Bosnia's Serbs. But the alliance broke down in the spring 
of last year, when Croatian and Muslim forces clashed in the southern city of 
Mostar. The city was divided along ethnic lines, and thousands of Muslims were 
detained by Croatian forces under Boban's command. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. observers and humanitarian aid workers say current living conditions in 
the Muslim section of Mostar are even more severe than in Sarajevo, which gets 
a regular stream of humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Mostar siege growing worse and fighting in central Bosnia escalating, 
international pressure has been building on Croatia. Criticism grew sharper 
when a top U.N. official confirmed the presence of 3,000 Croatian army troops 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Croatian military officials deny that charge, world leaders have warned 
Croatia to change its policies toward Bosnia or face international sanctions 
like those now in place against the rump Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudjman may have forced Boban out as part of an effort to address 
international censure, said Zarko Puhovski, a professor of political philosophy 
at the University of Zagreb. Boban, a gruff former businessman, came to be seen 
as a political liability, Puhovski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Tudjman is trying to do is improve the image of Croatian politics while 
changing it as little as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudjman's spokeswoman, Vesna Skare-Ozbolt, said Boban was never Zagreb's 
choice for the leadership of its proxies in Bosnia but had seized control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help for peace negotiations, because the Muslims always had something 
against Boban," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives in Zagreb of Bosnia's Muslim-led government said Boban's 
ouster alone may not be enough to create a breakthrough in peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that we have to wait to see if it is . . . a sign of a change in 
policy and approach," said Neven Kulenovic, a deputy consul at the Bosnian 
Embassy in Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, when we are talking with Mr. Boban or Mr. Akmadzic . . . 
(whether) the group behind them is going to change."

 Concerned about a political vacuum in Haiti, the State Department urged exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to lay the groundwork for a new government by 
naming a prime minister. Haiti has been without a prime minister since the 
previous Aristide appointee, Robert Malval, stepped down in mid-December. His 
government lasted but four months and was ineffective because of intimidation 
by armed groups loyal to the military.

ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS EXTEND TALKS IN BID TO END DEADLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian negotiators extended their peace talks Tuesday, 
closeting themselves in a Cairo villa in a painstaking attempt to break the 
deadlock that has delayed the start-up of Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still step by step. Not two steps by two steps," said Israeli 
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid following a full night and day of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat looked tired and 
drawn as he rushed wordlessly from one of several meetings with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres, as the two sides attempted to agree on enough issues to 
sign at least an initial accord before they leave here today. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as the two sides expressed cautious optimism, Israel made it clear 
that "prolonged negotiations" will be necessary before the accord on 
Palestinian autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we will reach an understanding about the issues that are being 
discussed in Cairo. But we have to bear in mind, even if we reach an 
understanding in Cairo, it will be only the nucleus of key issues for reaching 
an agreement to implement the Gaza-Jericho (agreement)," said Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, effectively torpedoing hopes for any quick and 
comprehensive accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres and Arafat held a brief meeting Monday night, then met over lunch 
Tuesday and again in the evening in an attempt to break through roadblocks 
encountered by their negotiating delegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The two negotiating teams, split over issues of who will control international 
border crossings and how to guarantee security for Jewish settlers in the new 
Palestinian autonomous zones, worked through the latest of several draft 
agreements, essentially based on understandings reached at the last round of 
talks between Arafat and Peres at a Swiss resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the talks say the danger is that both sides have approached 
their bottom lines. Arafat is unwilling to go beyond concessions he made at the 
Switzerland talks, while Israel sees issues of security as too fundamental to 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it appeared the two sides were discussing compromises on such issues as 
joint patrols of roads leading from Jewish settlements in Gaza, "safe passage" 
of Palestinians to points of Palestinian control outside the main Jericho area 
and the configuration of Israeli army buildings remaining inside Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides were hoping to reach at least a preliminary accord on which they 
could initial several points of agreement before concluding the talks today. 
Sources close to the talks said it would take at least two weeks beyond that to 
draft precise language before any summit to sign an accord could be held 
between Arafat and Rabin.

 Canada launched an offensive against rampant cigarette smuggling by lowering 
its federal tobacco taxes by at least one-third in a bid to eliminate 
smugglers' profits. The government also slapped a tax on tobacco exports to 
further discourage the billion-dollar trade in which duty-free export 
cigarettes are being smuggled back from the United States by Mohawk natives. 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien slashed the tax on cigarettes by an initial $5 
Canadian a carton and said Ottawa will cut more if Canada's cash-strapped 
provinces contribute with cuts of their own.

<P>
 The Senate approved the nominations of four Democratic loyalists to 
ambassadorial posts Tuesday after a four-month delay because of questions about 
their foreign policy expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 M. Larry Lawrence, a San Diego developer and hotel owner, was confirmed as 
ambassador to Switzerland by a 76-19 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three, Sidney Williams for the Bahamas, K. Terry Dornbush for the 
Netherlands and Thomas Siebert for Sweden, were approved by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a former professional football player and a car salesman, is married 
to U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence in particular was singled out last year by the private American 
Foreign Service Assn. for his lack of foreign affairs experience and 
allegations of irregularities in his campaign contributions to the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee submitted his name to the full Senate 
last November without a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornbush has contributed more than $250,000 to the Democratic Party over the 
past three elections, and Lawrence almost $200,000.

MILITARY JUDGE SAYS ADM. KELSO SAW MISCONDUCT, COVERED IT UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A military judge on Tuesday accused Adm. Frank B. Kelso of witnessing sexual 
misconduct at the 1991 Tailhook Assn. convention and then trying to cover it 
up. He dismissed charges against three aviators who contended their cases were 
tainted by the Navy chief's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, Navy Capt. William T. Vest Jr., also accused top Navy officials of 
not paying attention to instances of sexual misconduct at earlier Tailhook 
meetings. If they had, Vest said, "a high probability exists that both the 
assaults and much of the Navy's embarrassment could have been avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 The dismissals leave only one case pending in the investigation of the 
Tailhook scandal, which damaged the image of Navy and Marine Corps aviators. Of 
140 cases, no one was court-martialed and about 50 people received 
administrative discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fact that here it is over two years later and nothing has occurred, to 
me it's outrageous," said Karen Johnson, national secretary for the National 
Organization for Women and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon investigators concluded that 83 women were assaulted or molested at 
the convention, many of them on the third floor of the Las Vegas Hilton, where 
men lined the hallway on the night of Sept. 7, 1991, and grabbed women as they 
tried to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso, chief of naval operations, "manipulated the initial investigative 
process and the subsequent (discipline) process in a manner designed to shield 
his personal involvement in Tailhook '91," Vest wrote in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge concluded that Kelso was "in error" when he testified that he did 
not go to the third floor that night and did not see any misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "This court specifically finds Adm. Kelso visited the third deck patio at some 
time during the evening hours," Vest wrote. "This court further finds Adm. 
Kelso was exposed to incidents of inappropriate behavior while on the patio on 
Saturday evening, including public nudity and 'leg-shaving' activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso, who is scheduled to retire in July, declined comment. Navy officials 
were reviewing the decision and declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vest's ruling in the cases of Cmdrs. Thomas R. Miller and Gregory Tritt and 
Lt. David Samples makes it unlikely that any Navy fliers will face trials as a 
result of Tailhook. The case still pending involves a Marine Corps lieutenant 
colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, Kelso testified during a pretrial hearing for Miller and Tritt 
that he stayed on the hotel's ground floor on the night in question. However, 
numerous witnesses said they saw the admiral on the third-floor swimming pool 
patio near a group of suites that featured such entertainment as strippers and 
leg-shaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Vest also said inaction by Kelso after Tailhook allowed the Navy investigation 
to be limited to officers below the rank of rear admiral. That "was part of a 
calculated effort to minimize the exposure of the involvement and personal 
conduct" of senior officers who attended the convention, he said.

PROSECUTORS REST IN TRIAL OF TRADE CENTER BLAST SUSPECTS; TERRORISM: CASE 
AGAINST THE FOUR DEFENDANTS IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL. THE DEFENSE IS EXPECTED TO ARGUE 
THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF HAS NOT BEEN MET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After 18 weeks of testimony by more than 200 witnesses, government prosecutors 
in the World Trade Center bombing trial wrapped up their presentation Tuesday 
-- capping a case that has been remarkable for its detail as well as its 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors rested their case against the four defendants after two final days 
of testimony by David Williams, the FBI's primary investigator of the terrorist 
attack last Feb. 26. Williams gave an overview of the circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are expected to start presenting evidence later this week. 
It was considered unlikely that any of the defendants would choose to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense sources said they expect their presentation to take a few days at 
most. Asserting that prosecutors had failed to meet their burden of proof, 
several defense lawyers said they would be content to argue to jurors that 
reasonable doubts exist about the guilt of their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has built its case entirely on indirect evidence against the 
four alleged "foot soldiers" accused of constructing the bomb that devastated 
the World Trade Center, killing six people, injuring more than 1,000 and 
disabling for a month one of the world's best known landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to many celebrated trials, the government had no eyewitness to place 
the defendants at the scene, no former associate to testify about their 
movements. Prosecutors had offered concessions to at least two of the four 
defendants in unsuccessful attempts to persuade them to testify against the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, chief prosecutor Gilmore Childers presented one element of 
circumstantial evidence after another to try to show that the defendants rented 
an apartment and a storage shed in New Jersey to mix chemicals for the bomb and 
had access to joint bank accounts to finance their endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also asserted that the conspirators leased a Ryder van in Jersey 
City to take the 1,200-pound explosive device into the trade center's 
underground garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys hope to spotlight weaknesses in the government's case. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a parade of experts over several weeks testified about the 
destructive force of the bomb and about different types of chemical residues 
found in the defendants' rented apartment and a nearby storage locker. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent days, when an FBI analyst was called to the witness stand to tie 
the case together, he was unable to pinpoint the type of bomb used. He said 
chemical tests were inconclusive in showing whether components of the bomb 
matched residues found in quarters rented by the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most discouraging moments for prosecutors occurred when a Jersey 
City gas station attendant was called to the stand to identify two defendants 
-- Mohammed A. Salameh and Mahmud Abouhalima -- who he said had gassed up their 
yellow rental van before the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 After accurately describing the physical features of Salameh and Abouhalima, 
the witness, Willie Hernandez Moosh, was asked to identify them in the 
courtroom. He pointed to two members of the jury, leaving the courtroom rocking 
in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Abouhalima, who fled to Egypt after the bombing but was seized there and 
returned, has been linked to Salameh through records of eight telephone calls 
and by two people who said they saw a man of his description helping Salameh 
carry large drums from his apartment. But neither witness was able to identify 
Abouhalima in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI search of Abouhalima's New Jersey apartment found a pair of shoes 
stained with sulfuric acid of the type used in explosives. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said a third defendant, Nidal Ayyad -- who held joint bank accounts 
with Salameh -- ordered chemicals of the type investigators believe were used 
in the trade center bomb, purportedly for a second bomb. Again, the evidence 
was circumstantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially more damaging has been evidence that Ayyad sent a letter to a New 
York newspaper threatening further attacks unless the United States ended all 
military aid to Israel. He was linked to the letter through computer discs 
found in his office and a DNA test from saliva taken from the envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ayyad's attorney, Atiq Ahmed, showed on cross-examination of a government 
witness that the DNA traces could have applied to a small fraction of the Arab 
American population in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad Ahmad Ajaj, the final defendant, was in jail on a passport violation 
at the time of the bombing. The government's theory is that Ajaj provided 
bomb-making manuals to the conspirators as early as September, 1992, when he 
entered the country from Pakistan. The manuals were seized at New York's John 
F. Kennedy Airport, along with other materials in his possession, including a 
video showing how terrorists blow up buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted as charged in the 13-count indictment, the defendants face a 
maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

PANEL URGES FOCUS ON PROSTATE SYMPTOMS; HEALTH: RULES CALL FOR STUDYING 
SEVERITY OF PROBLEMS BEFORE DECIDING ON TREATMENT OF BENIGN CONDITION. PATIENTS 
SHOULD HAVE 'THE FINAL SAY.' 
</P>

<P>
 Physicians should not automatically recommend surgery or drug therapy for the 
treatment of an enlarged prostate gland, especially if the condition is causing 
only mild or moderate symptoms, federal health officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of urologists and other experts convened by the government urged 
physicians to focus on the severity of symptoms before deciding on the course 
of therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition in older 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice guidelines were issued by the Agency for Health Care Policy and 
Research, part of the Department of Health and Human Resources. Established in 
1989, the agency is charged with improving the quality of the nation's health 
care while reducing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The prostate is a male sex gland located below the bladder and in front of the 
rectum. Normally about the size of a walnut, it surrounds the upper part of the 
urethra, the tube that empties urine from the bladder. 
</P>
<P>
 BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland that generally progresses slowly. 
It can cause frequent and urgent urination, produce a sensation that the 
bladder never quite empties, cause difficulty in starting to urinate and 
disturb sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 It sometimes can lead to serious complications, such as urine retention, 
urinary tract infections, kidney problems or bleeding through the urethra. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition is not directly related to prostate cancer, the second most 
common cancer in men after skin cancer. But both are influenced by similar 
hormonal factors, and aging makes men vulnerable to both. 
</P>
<P>
 By the age of 60, more than half of all men in the United States develop some 
degree of BPH. And by age 80, an estimated one in four will require treatment 
for the condition, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel recommended that patients have "the final say" in determining the 
treatment, noting that the decisions should be "symptom-driven." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the present time, the unfortunate scenario too often occurs of the patient 
going into the doctor's office and leaving with either a prescription or a 
surgery date without much discussion," said Dr. John D. McConnell, chairman of 
the 13-member panel and head of urology at the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "All treatments other than watchful waiting are unnecessary in men who only 
have mild symptoms," O'Connell said. "Also, in a disease like BPH, which is 
slowly progressive -- and with most men does not interfere with their health -- 
it is important to lay out all the options and include the patient in the 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Transurethral resection of the prostate is the most frequently used treatment, 
and one of the most commonly performed surgeries among Medicare recipients, the 
agency said. In 1992, more than 221,000 such procedures were performed on men 
65 or older at a cost to Medicare of more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure involves cutting away prostate tissue with a tool inserted 
through the urethra. Most patients suffer no significant problems other than 
temporary discomfort, although there is a small risk of urinary leakage and 
sexual dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the guidelines could be used by insurance companies to deny 
reimbursement for surgery, McConnell said only that he believes surgery is not 
indicated for those men suffering only mild symptoms. "There is no benefit to 
(surgically) treating a patient with mild symptoms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 BPH also can be treated with other surgical procedures and with drugs. The 
drugs include alpha blockers, which relieve pressure on the urethra, and 
finasteride, a drug that reduces male hormone levels within the prostate and 
helps shrink the gland.

CBO DIRECTOR FIERCELY ADHERES TO NONPARTISAN COURSE; BUDGET: ROBERT D. 
REISCHAUER'S STAND ON CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN REFLECTS HIS INDEPENDENCE. BUT HE'S 
TROUBLED BY HIS IMPACT ON POLITICAL DEBATE.

 When Congressional Budget Office Director Robert D. Reischauer discovered at a 
recent hearing that his microphone at the witness table would not work, Senate 
Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) offered him one of the seats 
reserved for senators -- on the Democratic side of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Before accepting, Reischauer hesitated, looked over at the Republican side of 
the committee and said: "I could sit at an empty seat over there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the zealousness with which the CBO director, a 53-year-old bureaucrat 
who is scarcely known outside of Washington, maintains the reputation of his 
office for political independence and -- as a result -- for credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Congress that hired him is run by Democrats -- and he is one 
himself -- Reischauer has won wide praise for steering a nonpartisan course 
through the treacherous political jungle of budgetary forecasts, projections 
and estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet never was he or his 220-person staff put to so difficult a test as the one 
they completed Tuesday, when he presented the CBO analysis of President 
Clinton's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 With its declaration that the proposal is a massive new government program -- 
not a modification of the current private-sector system of providing health 
care, as Clinton and his allies portrayed it -- the CBO has delivered a serious 
blow to the biggest domestic initiative of this presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Democratic Senate aide described Reischauer's stand as "stunning 
bravery" in the face of an intense lobbying campaign from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is unprecedented to have a faceless bureaucrat shoot down the biggest 
piece of legislation a President has ever presented," the staffer declared. 
"The easiest thing in the world would have been to go along with the 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Added an admiring Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on 
the Senate Budget Committee: "He called it as he saw it, knowing full well that 
it would not bring him credit and adulation from many quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the blistering criticism began even before Reischauer completed his 
report. "This is nuts that a bunch of budget wonks would try to turn a serious 
national debate over health care into a scholastic argument over budgetary 
rules," one White House aide fumed as the thrust of the CBO conclusions became 
known around Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 However dramatic Tuesday's testimony was, it was not the first time that a CBO 
estimate has served to deflate the promises of Clinton and his recent 
predecessors. Last year, its contention that the Administration's hastily 
prepared deficit-reduction plan had fallen short sent lawmakers scrambling for 
an additional $67 billion in spending cuts over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the news from CBO is good, it carries just as much weight. Clinton 
has exulted in recent weeks over CBO's forecast that the deficit would fall an 
additional $124 billion by 1996, in part as a result of his economic program. 
</P>
<P>
 CBO itself is relatively new, born in the post-Watergate era of mistrust 
between Capitol Hill and the White House. Until its establishment in 1975, 
Congress had to rely on numbers generated by the White House's openly partisan 
Office of Management and Budget -- putting lawmakers at a distinct disadvantage 
in the knowledge-is-power equation. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, CBO's numbers proved an enormously potent weapon. It 
single-handedly killed former President Jimmy Carter's welfare reform proposal 
in 1977 with its estimate that the plan would cost $17 billion -- more than 
triple what the Carter White House had advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 And during the 1980s, CBO was constantly locked in battle with the Ronald 
Reagan Administration budget office over rosy Pentagon spending estimates and 
other projections aimed at selling the GOP agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CBO's forecasts were often wide of the mark, they proved consistently 
better than those of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Reischauer was a part of CBO at the beginning, having been recruited by its 
first director, Alice Rivlin, who is now a top budget official in the 
Administration. He left the office in 1981 to become senior vice president of 
the liberal Urban Institute, and then joined the Brookings Institution's 
economic studies program. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to CBO as director five years ago. A gangly man with a low-key 
manner, he shuns the city's power-lunch scene, generally eating his at his 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young man, Reischauer worked in Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential 
campaign, and two decades later advised the campaign of 1988 Democratic nominee 
Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
 One friend and former colleague -- a Republican -- says that Reischauer has 
shed his youthful illusions that "an activist government can do no wrong, and 
began over the years to know the limitations and the strengths and the 
weaknesses of government." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the friend also added that the CBO director feels very strongly that the 
health care system must undergo dramatic reform. "I know he's been torn on this 
from the beginning," he added. "This is a real tough one for him." 
</P>
<P>
 As Reischauer began his testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, 
it was clear that he was burdened by the knowledge that the figures generated 
by his office -- the cold, analytical message of his numbers -- would 
inevitably become distorted as they take their place in a political debate that 
he likened to "mud wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have appeared before Congress more than 100 times, and I've always started 
by saying how pleased I was to be here," he told the panel. "I did not say that 
today, because I have a great sense of foreboding about how this report and my 
words will be used." 
</P>
<P>
 When Reischauer finished, both Democrats and Republican applauded him, but it 
was already clear that his numbers and conclusions -- objective as they may be 
-- will inevitably be swept into the partisan struggle.UNITED ST

CLINTON TAKES SHOT AT CRITICS OF HIS HEALTH PLAN; REFORM: HE TELLS AUTO WORKERS 
THAT TALK OF A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF INSURANCE SYSTEM IS WRONG. HE SAYS 
MEDICAL COSTS WILL RISE WITHOUT HIS PACKAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Taking on his health care critics before an audience of friendly auto workers, 
President Clinton warned Tuesday that the slowed growth in medical costs will 
"go right back up again" if the country does not follow General Motors' lead in 
supporting his reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, speaking at a Chevrolet light truck assembly plant here, told auto 
workers not to believe business groups and insurance companies that contend his 
plan would bring about a government takeover of the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not true," he said. "What the President wants to do is to keep the 
system we've got now and give it to everybody: guaranteed private health 
insurance, private doctors, private providers -- a private system." 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming names, Clinton took a shot at the Health Insurance Assn. of 
America -- which represents the interests of smaller insurers -- for its latest 
round of advertisements attacking his health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he was "tickled" by the HIAA's commercials. "I read these ads of 
these folks that are so desperate to keep the system we have now. And they say: 
'Oh, the President wants to have the government take over the health care 
system.' It isn't true." 
</P>
<P>
 In a reference to insurers' financial resources and political savvy, Clinton 
added: "Look, I know there's a lot of money in this. And there are a lot of 
good people who work for those companies. But you just have to ask yourself 
whether we can afford to continue to spend 40% more than (other countries) and 
not cover everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also criticized a health reform plan by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) that 
has emerged as the leading alternative to the Administration's initiative. 
Cooper's proposal promises "universal access" to health insurance, but would 
not guarantee coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's universal access to this truck," Clinton said, pointing to a vehicle 
behind him. "But only people with money can pay (for) it." 
</P>
<P>
 In stressing the need for universal coverage, Clinton told of a woman who had 
written him about her husband, who developed lung cancer but was denied 
treatment because he had no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't even treat him, and he died in five weeks," Clinton said. "Our 
approach completely outlaws insurance discrimination. . . . Our plan reduces 
the control of the insurance companies and gives more input to workers and to 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 And he told of a Shreveport woman, an employee of an insurance company, who 
suffered a brain aneurysm. Even when her doctors told her she was "totally 
healed," she couldn't find new insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people like that all over the country," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that medical inflation "goes down every time there's a serious 
threat to reform the health care system." But if his bill is rejected, he said, 
"it will go right back up again, just like it has every time in the last 50 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks Tuesday came as the White House is struggling to overcome a 
series of setbacks in its health care reform crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the National Assn. of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable and 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce all declined to endorse the Clinton plan. On 
Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office ruled that insurance premiums paid by 
workers and their employers would have to be included in the federal budget 
under Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House contends that these setbacks are temporary, and that it will 
find a way around the CBO's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's comments before the crowd of about 2,000 were beamed live to other 
auto workers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The receptive audience was assembled by one of the few companies that still 
supports the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A key reason for GM's support is the plan's provision to pick up 80% of the 
health insurance costs of workers who retire between the ages of 55 and 64. The 
auto makers and other old-line manufacturers have large numbers of such 
workers, many of whom could be offered early retirement buyouts as companies 
continue to trim their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton mentioned the early retirement provision of his plan, arguing that it 
would make U.S. companies able to better compete with firms overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our approach protects the early retirees and finds a way to help companies 
pay for it to spread the cost of that, to make General Motors, our steel 
companies, a lot of our other companies far more competitive," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised GM's executives and union officials as "enlightened business 
leaders."

SNOW, FREEZING RAIN BRING PERIL FOR TRAVELERS, CLOSE BUSINESSES

<P>
 Snow and freezing rain fell over much of the nation Tuesday, creating havoc 
for travelers and forcing schools and businesses to close. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani postponed his first State of the City 
speech and declared a limited snow emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 With snow falling in the New York area at a rate of up to three inches an 
hour, the three major airports halted all inbound flights for most of the day. 
Only a handful of planes managed to take off in near-zero visibility, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange remained open, but 
several commodities exchanges closed early. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey state employees were sent home at midday, and Newark International 
Airport closed when almost nine inches of snow fell, a record for the date. 
</P>
<P>
 National Airport in Washington, D.C., was shut temporarily by a jet that 
skidded off a runway on the ice. Logan International Airport in Boston had 
extensive weather-related flight delays, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow also fell across other parts of the Northeast, with up to a foot possible 
in western Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered school closings were reported in New York, New Jersey, West 
Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 A chartered bus overturned during a snowstorm in New Jersey en route to the 
casinos of Atlantic City, and at least 20 people were injured, state police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads covered with snow and ice contributed to chain-reaction pileups Tuesday 
in Minnesota and Oklahoma. Six people died and about 50 others were injured in 
the Minnesota accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Three feet of snow fell overnight at Summitville, Colo., in the San Juan 
Mountains, with one to two feet elsewhere in south-central Colorado, the 
National Weather Service reported.

WHERE MOTHER NATURE SHOWS HER GLORY AND HER WRATH; WEATHER: IN MALIBU, BIG ROCK 
RESIDENTS HAVE ENJOYED OCEAN VIEWS AND FRESH AIR. BUT THEY HAVE ENDURED A 
NEVER-ENDING LESSON IN HUMILITY IN THEIR BATTLES AGAINST CALAMITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the struggle between man and nature had a single venue, it could easily be 
Big Rock, a spectacular oceanfront canyon in Malibu that was among the 
hardest-hit areas in this week's turbulent storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred families have made the canyon, its bluffs and beachfront their 
private paradise, with expensive homes and magnificent vistas the standard 
fare. But Big Rock, named for a nearby offshore boulder, has not taken well to 
its human admirers, a predicament that has made living there a never-ending 
lesson in humility -- from enduring landslides to fires to earthquakes to 
mudflows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Rock is where the hardiest of Malibuites live," said Michael Caggiano, a 
Malibu resident who lived in Big Rock for 12 years until his house burned down 
in November. "It is really hard to think of an area that Mother Nature has 
pummeled harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest calamity came Monday in the form of a cascade of muddy water racing 
down the hillside and thrashing into a dozen beachfront homes. Cars were 
tossed, residents trapped and garage doors torn open. Some residents had to be 
rescued from their homes in the shovel of a Caltrans skip-loader. 
</P>
<P>
 But as bad as it was Monday, most of Big Rock was breathing a collective sigh 
of relief Tuesday, having escaped the raging waters with minimum damage, most 
of it confined to thick oozing mud on driveways and roads. The 250 or so 
families that call Big Rock home have not always been so lucky -- in fact, some 
might argue that they are usually unlucky.  
</P>
<P>
 "You get to the point, between the fire, the earthquake and now this, that I 
am almost embarrassed to tell people where I live," said Margaret Richards, who 
for 18 years has lived in a four-bedroom home with a panoramic view of the 
Pacific Ocean. "I just ran up to the grocery store because if it starts to rain 
again, God knows what will happen this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four houses burned to the ground in last fall's fire, with four others 
sustaining substantial damage, robbing hillsides of vegetation and setting the 
stage for this week's mudflows. Three weeks ago, the Northridge earthquake 
rolled through the canyon like no longtime residents can recall, with walls 
cracking, shelves toppling and nerves rattling. 
</P>
<P>
 Storms in April, 1979, scattered enough rocks and boulders from Big Rock's 
geological nooks and crannies to close Pacific Coast Highway to traffic, 
transforming the high-speed roadway into a playground for bicyclists and 
joggers until Caltrans could clear the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 But by far the biggest catastrophe came in 1983, when one of the worst 
landslides in state history damaged more than 200 homes, cracking walls, 
foundations, floors, driveways, tennis courts and winding roads. About 30 homes 
were determined to be unlivable. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists concluded that the area rests atop an ancient slide plane that was 
triggered by rising ground water. Residents blamed Los Angeles County -- which 
had jurisdiction over the area before Malibu was incorporated in 1991 -- for 
contributing to the problem by allowing development on Big Rock without sewers. 
They also blamed the state of California for destabilizing the area by cutting 
into the hillside to make way for Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of legal haggling, the county, state and several insurance 
companies agreed to a $97-million settlement with 240 homeowners. The 
$35-million county portion was the largest payout in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the cash -- an average of $300,000 per household not including 
attorney fees -- many homeowners found it was not enough. Some say it is 
difficult to get insurance for their homes, while others have moved out and 
found renters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you chose to live (there), you are going to have some unique problems to 
deal with, but in return you get fresh air, ocean views and a place away from 
the city," said resident John Cadarette, who helped litigate the neighborhood 
lawsuit.

U.S. CENTER PLANS TO UPGRADE QUAKE TO 6.8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., 
confirmed Tuesday that the center has decided to formally upgrade the magnitude 
of the Northridge earthquake to 6.8. 
</P>
<P>
 The step will be taken Friday in the center's weekly publication, "Preliminary 
Determination of Epicenters," Waverly Person said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geophysicist John Minsch at the national center announced five days ago that 
6.8 "probably" would be the figure used. Monday, Caltech and the U.S. 
Geological Survey announced that they had upgraded the magnitude from 6.6 to 
6.7. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the generally recognized prerogative of the national center to set 
the official magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's magnitude figure could still change as the readings of more 
seismographic stations from around the world are figured into the average. And 
the evolving understanding of seismology often results in disputes years later 
on how strong an earthquake was. 
</P>
<P>
 The great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 has been variously estimated in 
recent years at anywhere from magnitude 7.8 to 8.4, with 8.3 the most commonly 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6.8 quake is considered about 1 1/2 times more powerful than a 6.6, 
according to Jim Mori, the scientist in charge of the Geological Survey's 
Pasadena field station. The expected upgrade would represent a substantial 
change in the official concept of how powerful the Jan. 17 earthquake was. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the upgrade, the quake was the most powerful in the Los Angeles 
Basin in the two centuries of available records, and it also stands as the most 
powerful quake in U.S. history to affect such a large population.

STUDY FINDS 'ALARMING' INCREASE IN CANCER RATES; HEALTH: IN WHITE MEN BORN 1948 
TO 1957, THE INCIDENCE UNRELATED TO SMOKING IS TRIPLE THAT OF THEIR 
GRANDFATHERS. BUT SOME EXPERTS SAY THE DATA MAY BE DISTORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The sharp decline in deaths from cardiovascular disease in the United States 
during the last two decades has been accompanied by an unexpected increase in 
the overall incidence of cancer, and in cancer deaths among people over 55, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 White men born during the baby boom of 1948 to 1957 have nonsmoking-related 
cancer rates three times as high as those of their grandfathers, but the rate 
of cardiovascular disease has fallen by 43%, a government research team reports 
today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 White women in the same age group have 30% more cancer not related to smoking 
than did their grandmothers, but 500% more cancer caused by smoking. "This 
increase is really alarming," said epidemiologist Devra Lee Davis of the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, the primary author of the new report. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study also has some good news. The incidence of smoking-related cancer 
among men is now only about 10% higher than it was among their grandfathers, 
down dramatically from its peak in the first quarter of this century. "That's a 
major public health victory," said Edward Sondik, deputy director of the 
National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also found that cancer mortality among people under the age of 55 
decreased by 17% between 1973 and 1987, but increased by 12% among older 
people. During the same period, the death rate from all causes dropped by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other researchers expressed the need for caution in interpreting the increased 
incidence of cancer, as well as the cancer deaths among older people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States, everyone eventually dies of something," said Dr. Cary 
Presant, a professor of medicine at USC and chairman of the California Division 
of the American Cancer Society. When people do not die of heart disease, they 
live longer and have a higher risk of cancer. As a result of continuing 
improvements in controlling heart disease, he said, "by the year 2000, the 
leading cause of death will no longer be cardiovascular disease, but cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and her colleagues do not know the cause of the increases in the cancer 
rate but suspect that they result from growing exposure to both known and 
undiscovered carcinogens in the environment. One strong clue, Davis said, is 
that farm families show an even higher death rate from the forms of cancer that 
have shown the greatest increase in the general population. 
</P>
<P>
 Such families have high exposures to a variety of agents, including 
pesticides, herbicides, engine exhausts, chemical solvents, animal viruses and 
sunlight, that could be the cause of the cancer rate increases, Davis said. The 
National Cancer Institute is initiating a study of more than 100,000 farm 
families to try to define the role of such exposures in producing cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other explanations might include increased exposure to hazardous materials in 
the workplace and changing patterns of alcohol use, Davis said. Prohibition and 
wartime restrictions limited the alcohol consumption of men born at the turn of 
the century, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study shows that we need a national commitment to public health research 
on the causes of these diseases that are increasing so that we can prevent 
them," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study is based on data collected in the first 15 years of the cancer 
institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program, an ongoing 
project in which cancer rates are determined in a representative 10% of the 
U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers focused solely on whites, Davis said, because "blacks and 
other minorities do not have equal access to health care." Cancer and other 
diseases currently are less likely to be diagnosed at an early stage in blacks 
than in whites, she noted, and were much less likely to be diagnosed in the 
past. "We didn't think it worthwhile to analyze the data (on blacks) because we 
might see an increase that wasn't real."

 Critics cautioned that the observed increases in cancer might overstate the 
case somewhat. Sondik noted, for example, that cancer was stigmatized in many 
areas at the turn of the century and that many cases were given a more 
palatable -- if inaccurate -- diagnosis. Techniques for identifying many types 
of tumors, particularly those of the brain and prostate, have improved 
significantly, he added, leading to sharp increases in their reported 
incidences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nonetheless, this tells us something very important about the public health 
impact of cancer," he said.

REMAINS FOUND IN DESERT MAY BE OF MISSING BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The skeletal remains of a child were discovered in a remote portion of the 
desert near here Tuesday, and investigators were trying to determine if they 
are the body of an 11-year-old boy missing since November. 
</P>
<P>
 The body, which was badly decomposed and above ground, was discovered about 
100 miles east of Los Angeles by a man searching for cans to use as target 
practice, said Sgt. Tony Allen of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are trying to determine if the remains are those of Robert 
Martinich, 11, who ran away from home with another youth, Arthur Leftwich, 14, 
in Yucca Valley on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains were found several miles from where Arthur's body was discovered 
Dec. 16. He had been shot to death, and sheriff's deputies called it a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys allegedly committed burglaries before disappearing, authorities 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Jay Hagen said investigators had mixed feelings about whether the 
body is Robert's. They did say that the victim apparently died as a result of a 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have found Martinich," he said. "But if it is him, that means we have 
a kid killer on the loose around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Dan Glozer, who spent the afternoon at the scene searching for 
clues, said Tuesday night that the body is "so badly skeletonized, we can't 
tell whether it's a male or female." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a forensic examination will be completed within days.

NEWSPAPER BOYCOTT URGED OVER CARTOON; MEDIA: SACRAMENTO BEE OFFICIALS APOLOGIZE 
FOR USE OF A RACIAL EPITHET. BUT NAACP LEADER IS CALLING FOR RESIGNATIONS AND 
955 READERS HAVE CANCELED THEIR SUBSCRIPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Sacramento Bee apologized Tuesday to readers who were offended by its use 
of a racial epithet in an editorial cartoon last week, but critics pressed for 
a boycott of the state capital's only daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate White, president of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People's Sacramento chapter, urged the resignations of editorial cartoonist 
Dennis Renault and editorial page editor Peter Schrag, while a city councilman 
pushed for passage of a resolution denouncing the Bee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was repugnant, right in the middle of Black History Month," 
White said Tuesday. "It almost made me spill coffee in my lap." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday afternoon, 955 subscribers had canceled their subscriptions, 
evidently heeding the call to boycott the paper for two months in what 
organizers of the action were calling a "fine." The Bee has a daily circulation 
of 275,000 and 340,000 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon, which appeared Friday, portrayed two Ku Klux Klan members reading 
a statement by Louis Farrakhan in which the Nation of Islam leader says, "You 
can't be a racist by talking -- only by acting." In the caption, one of the 
klansmen says: "That nigger makes a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon was intended as an attack on Farrakhan, who demoted his national 
spokesman, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, but who also defended the "truths" of 
Muhammad's statements against Jews and others. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where there were five racially motivated fire bombings last year, 
the reaction was swift. Readers telephoned the paper with protests on Friday, 
prompting Schrag to reply on Saturday that the cartoon was "designed to show 
bigotry's ugly face. The Bee regrets any offense or misunderstanding it 
caused." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction continued Monday when more than 300 protesters of the remark 
attended a meeting at St. Andrews African Methodist Episcopal Church in 
Sacramento, while another 100 Bee staff members packed an auditorium at the 
paper Monday to debate the cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's City Council meeting, Councilman Sam Panell said he would 
introduce a resolution condemning the cartoon. Panell called the use of "the 
N-word totally disrespectful and the Bee was insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Schrag said, "We did not use that word to offend. We 
used that word to make a point. I'm terribly sorry they were hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Schrag and the Bee had their defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Schrag has the insight to see that bigotry can wear a white robe or it 
can be in the form of anti-Semitic comment," Barry Loncke, a member of the 
NAACP and a Sacramento Municipal Court judge, said in an interview. "Calling 
for his resignation is a joke."

MARINE WHO SHOT SELF AFTER KILLING 2 DIES OF WOUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A young Marine, who kidnaped his estranged wife and killed two people who 
tried to intervene, died Tuesday of wounds from shooting himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Cpl.Timothy Clemons, 22, of Chicago died at 2:45 p.m., said Naval 
Hospital spokeswoman Pat Neal in San Diego. Clemons had been in the hospital 
since shooting himself at noon Monday, when he was confronted by a military 
police officer at his former barracks at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemons kidnaped his estranged wife Sunday night as she left work at a 
Carlsbad mall, police said. He shot to death two of her friends who tried to 
stop the kidnaping, authorities said. The young Marine fled to Mexico with his 
wife, Debra Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearn managed to persuade her husband to return to the United States on Monday 
morning and free her, officials said. She was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemons returned to his old barracks at Camp Pendleton. Someone at the 
barracks called police and when an MP approached with a gun and ordered Clemons 
to surrender, Clemons shot himself, said base Master Sgt. John Farrell.

ACLU'S RIPSTON CHASTISED AT CRIME SUMMIT; LEGISLATION: THE CHILLY RECEPTION FOR 
THE OFFICIAL PROTESTING GOV. WILSON'S 'THREE STRIKES' INITIATIVE WAS 'NOT 
UNEXPECTED,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ramona Ripston might as well have stepped into the path of a runaway freight 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston, who heads the American Civil Liberties Union's Southern California 
office, appeared Tuesday on a panel at Gov. Pete Wilson's summit on crime, 
where she had hoped to slow the momentum of Wilson's effort to lengthen 
criminal sentences and build more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Her reception at the hands of Wilson's handpicked group of crime fighters was 
somewhere between chilly and nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have met the enemy, and Mrs. Ripston, I hate to tell you this, but you are 
it," said Steve Baker, whose son's killer, Robert Alton Harris, staved off the 
death penalty for more than a decade by filing repeated appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was kidnaped and killed last year, told 
Ripston she was "far out in left field." Another father showed Ripston a 
portrait of his murdered son and blamed her group for his death. Several 
panelists shortened the organization's name to the Civil Liberties Union, 
deliberately dropping the word American. And a legislator chastised Ripston for 
defending "lechers and scumbags." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not unexpected," Ripston said afterward. "I thought what I had to say 
was so important I was willing to risk what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston's message: Sentences should be tailored to fit the crime and the 
individual, not meted out with broad strokes adopted by panicky lawmakers 
fearful of their reelection chances. She said the ACLU opposes the "three 
strikes" initiative that polls show has the support of more than 80% of the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU believes that all people are entitled to justice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston's experience underscored the tone of the governor's two-day crime 
summit, which was billed as an effort to develop bipartisan consensus on the 
hottest issue of the day but turned out to be primarily a showcase for Wilson 
and his views on crime and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, when the pastor of the host Hollywood Presbyterian Church 
joined in the call for stricter sentencing, to the end, when the leader of a 
crime victims group threatened political retribution against lawmakers who 
don't toe her line, the event was a forum for the Republican governor's 
position that building more prisons and putting more inmates in them will make 
the state's streets safe again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, sitting at the head table on the stage of the church's auditorium, 
presided over the eight sessions on issues ranging from school violence and 
prevention to enforcement and punishment and crime's impact on business. 
Sometimes donning glasses to read from reports, Wilson introduced each session 
with a summary of his beliefs, then listened, moderated and asked an occasional 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also played traffic cop, admonishing the audience to "take your 
conversations outside" and repeatedly giving the speakers tips on how to handle 
the hall's sensitive microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade of panelists and speakers was peppered with prosecutors, police, 
judges and crime victims. Independent experts and academics were scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely present was the point of view that the state's dwindling resources 
would be better spent on educating and training young people than warehousing 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 One critic called the event a farce, contending that though Wilson is talking 
tough now, he has spent three years as governor cutting the ranks of the 
Highway Patrol, softening parole policy to save money and slicing money from 
local governments, which spend the bulk of their budgets on law enforcement and 
other public safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy has been asleep at the switch for three years," said Al Angele, 
executive director of the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs. 
"Finally he wakes up and says 'Geez, I'm on the rocks, maybe I should hold a 
crime summit.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson aides and allies say the summit was a legitimate effort to gather 
information and ideas for bills that will be introduced in Sacramento in the 
weeks ahead. Many of the prosecutors in attendance cited specific sections of 
the penal code they said should be changed to make their jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any cynic who says it's being done for political reasons needs to have one of 
their kids snuffed to really understand," said Collene Campbell, who became a 
leader in crime victims circles after her son and brother were murdered in 
separate incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Sloat, a deputy chief of staff for the governor, said Wilson's staff 
took some heat from conservative groups and lawmakers that wanted the 
presentations weighted even more heavily toward their positions. He noted the 
presence of Ripston of the ACLU and former San Jose Police Chief Joseph 
McNamara, an outspoken advocate of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consciously tried to find a balance of all points of view," Sloat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloat acknowledged that Wilson hopes the summit will add to the pressure on 
legislators to pass the bills the governor already has endorsed. He said other 
measures will be introduced reflecting the ideas gleaned from the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully we will take the momentum from this event and focus it on the state 
Legislature," Sloat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno described the summit as a "dog 
and pony show" and said he heard few new ideas expressed. But he said it was a 
worthwhile effort anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you focus this much attention on something, it becomes very difficult 
for the Legislature to do what it normally does, which is study and delay and 
put everything off for another year," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 That worries Ripston of the ACLU. She says lawmakers should take their time 
and thoughtfully consider the consequences before adopting simple-sounding 
solutions. But with the public clamoring for quick action, she said she is 
finding it harder to get her message across to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to hear it," she said.

SQUABBLE UNLEASHED; SUIT SEEKS RETURN OF CHAMPION BULL TERRIER MISSING 4 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 It started as a simple business deal, according to a Northridge podiatrist who 
claims things turned sour a few months later when several people came down with 
a nasty case of seller's remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a lawsuit set to go to trial today in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
The suit alleges that the sellers realized they had given up a valuable and 
famous commodity for a paltry $600 and then took it back by force. 
</P>
<P>
 The property in question is Shavin-Kingsmere Notty Nada, a champion bull 
terrier not unlike the party-loving Spuds McKenzie made famous in those beer 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Spuds, Nada is a well-heeled animal. One expert in the case believes the 
dog, which at one time was the No. 1 bull terrier in the country, is worth up 
to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the dispute, according to court documents, is a clandestine 
raid involving an off-duty Orange County sheriff's deputy and an Anaheim man, 
who admits taking the animal from the doctor's Northridge back yard in March, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has seen the dog for nearly four years, and the alleged dognapers will 
only say that Nada, now 5 1/2 years old, was given to an elderly couple known 
only as "Helen and Jim," according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed April 5, 1990, by the doctor, Patricia Walters, calls the 
incident a dognaping, while those who admit taking the dog call it "a 
repossession." 
</P>
<P>
 During a trial expected to last five to 10 days, a jury will be asked to 
decide whether Walters owns the dog, or if Nada is the property of the alleged 
dognapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters is asking for Nada's return, as well as unspecified damages for 
assault and emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the lawsuit are the dog's breeders and trainers: William and Patricia 
Edwards of Glendale, and Terry Martin and Linda Lethin-Martin of Anaheim, 
owners of the firm, Shavin-Kingsmere, which breeds and shows dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters contends in the suit that she was assaulted by William Edwards when he 
entered her back yard to take Nada. But Edwards contends he was rescuing the 
dog from Walters, who he says was not fit to care for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards also contends Walters attacked him with a dog leash during the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Bollong also is a named in the suit, not 
for claiming an interest in the dog, but because he grabbed the animal as 
William Edwards passed it to him over a wall from Walters' yard. In court 
documents, Walters alleges the 12-year Sheriff's Department veteran was engaged 
in a "criminal conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the animal, the defendants "gave the dog to an elderly couple out 
of fear the plaintiff would put the dog to sleep should she ever regain 
possession," according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the acrimony that has developed in the case, the chances of a settlement 
appear to be slim. The file in the case is nearly a foot thick, and Robert 
Armstrong, the Edwards' attorney, says he has collected six large cartons of 
information related to the case. What is certain is that hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in legal fees have been paid to attorneys on both sides of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried brain damage cases that were substantially less complicated," 
said Armstrong, who compared the case to a bitter child-custody dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters' attorney, Major Alan Langer, did not return phone calls this week. 
Nor did attorneys representing the Martins and Bollong. 
</P>
<P>
 In the initial stages of the case, both sides posted $15,000 bonds to ensure 
Nada's safety. The defendants posted their counter bond -- a novel legal issue 
that was taken up by the state Supreme Court -- after the Edwards and the 
Martins were temporarily thrown into jail for failing to turn over Nada.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; INSPECTORS UNCOVER WEAK WELDS IN PIPELINE; OIL: 
AN INVESTIGATION OF AT LEAST EIGHT LEAKS CAUSED BY THE QUAKE IS CONTINUING. THE 
STATE WILL REQUIRE ARCO TO REPLACE AGED SECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The oil pipeline that ruptured during the Northridge earthquake is held 
together in many places with weak welds that pose a danger of breaking, and 
regulators are pushing the line's owner, Atlantic Richfield Co., to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an investigation of at least eight breaks that occurred along a 
35-mile span of the Four Corners Pipeline remains incomplete, an official from 
the State Fire Marshal's Office on Tuesday pinpointed the archaic acetylene 
welds and the overall age of the pipe as serious weak points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, all the spills that occurred, occurred at these welds," said Chuck 
Samo, supervising pipeline safety engineer for the State Fire Marshal's Office. 
The agency, which has sole authority for the safety of such pipelines 
statewide, will require Arco to replace the aged segments and welds, probably 
over several years, said Samo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to cooperate," Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein said. "We don't want 
to work in a hostile environment." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Jan. 17 ruptures killed hundreds of fish and other wildlife in the 
Santa Clara River near Valencia. Another spill resulted in a fireball that 
injured one man and burned three homes and 17 vehicles on Wolfskill Street, 
close to a segment of the pipe that runs under the playground of O'Melveny 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the fire, the San Fernando City Council on Monday night voted 
not to renew its franchise agreement with the Four Corners Pipeline Co., a 
subsidiary of Arco, until members are satisfied that all safety concerns have 
been addressed. The council also voted to explore ways to relocate the 
mile-long segment that runs through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But San Fernando has no jurisdiction over pipeline safety issues, said the 
State Fire Marshal's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 And the city has no control over the pipe segment beneath the playground of 
O'Melveny School, according to the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 
district gave Arco an easement for the pipeline at least 40 years ago and 
cannot rescind it unilaterally, said Bob Niccum, director of real estate for 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district 
surrounds San Fernando, told the San Fernando council on Monday night that he 
opposes relocating the pipe in his district, and he does not want to reopen the 
franchise agreement between Arco and the city of Los Angeles. Alarcon, chairman 
of the public works committee, has called a meeting with residents and public 
officials today. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the State Fire Marshal's Office is trying to find out where the 
archaic welds are located and how many exist, said Samo. About half of the 
1920s-era pipeline has been replaced over the years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the plans sometimes don't tell you what you have," Samo said. "In those 
days, there were no regulations." Until 1979, there were no federal regulations 
for oil pipelines, and no state rules until 1981, said Samo. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arco spokesman said the company would consider any changes, which would 
depend on cooperation among the city governments of San Fernando and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline, which runs from Kern County to refineries in the South Bay, 
remains shut down for repairs and inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will remain shut down until we've completely satisfied it's safe to 
operate," Samo said. His office will require extensive tests to look for cracks 
or separations resulting from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein said Arco hopes to reopen the line in about six weeks to two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state fire marshal doesn't want us to operate an unsafe line, and neither 
do we," said Greenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein said he is unsure what effect ending the San Fernando franchise 
would have on the flow of oil through the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Corners franchise with the city of San Fernando has been under 
negotiation since it expired in 1989. City Council members confronted by angry 
residents Monday night said they did not renew the franchise in part due to 
safety concerns. City Administrator Mary Strenn said Tuesday the council also 
wanted to assure that only crude oil would be shipped -- not more volatile 
compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil does not ignite easily, and council members have questioned the 
content of the line after the fire, which witnesses said erupted from a 
motorcycle's spark. Samo said as far as his office knows, the contents were 
light crude oil, and added that he is unsure if a spark could have ignited it.

 At 6:15 a.m., when the lights go on at the Mason Avenue Red Cross Shelter, 
Jannet Nguyen, 11, is among the first up and out of her cot. But then, she has 
a lot on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, I didn't do my homework because those kids, they're too noisy," 
Jannet said, her words coming out in a rush of frustration while her mother 
implored her two younger sisters to wake up and get ready for school. "I'm 
worried about that. I don't want to get a D or F. I don't go on the same bus -- 
I didn't have to wait for the bus before. My schedule is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go to school and live here." 
</P>

 Three weeks after the Northridge quake -- virtually a lifetime for Jannet and 
other children hardest hit by the temblor -- Los Angeles Unified School 
district buses are still picking up more than 100 students at 11 different 
shelters. The children are taken to 67 different schools citywide, according to 
Alan Tomiyama, the district's director of transportation.  
</P>
<P>
 The students on the shelter buses are a part of the most displaced of the 
Northridge victims. And for L.A. schools struggling to cope with a hobbled 
physical plant and an anxious staff and student body, they are at one extreme 
of a large group of students who were emotionally and physically isolated by 
Southern California's worst disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Their numbers are swelled by the ranks of students whom the quake left 
homeless but are coming to class on their own. Those students, officials said, 
are difficult to count. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to need a lot more resources and a lot more support," said Dr. 
Loeb Aronin, the district's director of psychological services. "We've never 
had enough psychologists, or enough nurses or support personnel in general. And 
now you've got a more critical crisis situation. . . . I don't know that we 
have enough staff to keep up." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter bus routes will continue as long as there are displaced children who 
need to get to school, Tomiyama said. There is no date set for them to end. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mason Recreation Center in Chatsworth, 23 children waited to be ferried 
to school by three buses that double back to make different trips along several 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica, 6, started on her long bus ride to school with three other children 
she did not know, who go to a different school than the one she attends. She 
did not speak to them, opting instead to stare out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 The other children disembarked at Germain Street Elementary School, not far 
from the shelter where the group boarded, spilling out of the bus and running 
to join their friends. Angelica, dwarfed by the school bus's long rows of empty 
green seats, still had a long ride to Lassen Elementary. She stared out the 
window at the Cal State Northridge tent city as the bus lumbered by. 
</P>
<P>
 "My home used to be close to the school," she said, not taking her eyes from 
the window. "My mom drove me. I don't have nobody to talk to now. I don't like 
to be alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelica is lonely in her traveling; other children are lonely in their 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
 Jannet, like many of the children at the Mason Avenue shelter, said she had 
not told her teacher the reasons for her difficulties with her reading 
assignment. "I don't want her to know it because I don't want to say it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles district buses also take Rachel Kinney, 12, from the shelter to 
her private Lutheran school in North Hollywood. Rachel and her mother, Wendy 
keep their troubles to themselves, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a church school," Wendy Kinney said. "On Sunday, everyone would say, 
'Awwww, are you OK?' It's kind of hard to take, so that's why we're keeping it 
quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, other students are not as sensitive as they might be if they knew 
of her troubles, Rachel said. Classmates do not know why she has worn the same 
clothes day after day. They say things that they might not say if they knew 
about her situation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just sort of carry on with everything," Rachel said over her shelter 
breakfast of Apple Jacks and a danish. "They talk about how mean their moms 
are, and they don't even know how bad it can get. They talk about how their 
lives are so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 She finished breakfast in time for her scheduled bus departure at 7:20. A 
blue-suited bus driver poked her head into the shelter to look for her morning 
wards. Wendy, Jannet and Jannet's sisters grabbed sack lunches and walked 
slowly out the large shelter doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jannet looked back at her mother before she boarded the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it to live here," Jannet said. "My sisters, they're going to school 
and I know it's hard for them because I've been their age. They need my help, 
but I just can't help -- I can't even help myself."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 2 MEN CHARGED IN QUAKE-RELATED CASES

<P>
 Even though crime appears to have decreased in the wake of the Northridge 
earthquake, two men have been charged in quake-related crimes that prosecutors 
say demonstrate how disasters can bring out the worst in people. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man was charged Tuesday with sexual battery for allegedly groping a 
woman while the two waited in line at a FEMA disaster assistance center in Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexis Duran Munoz, 32, is accused of assaulting an 18-year-old Arleta woman 
on the morning of Jan. 31 as she stood in line behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz was released on his own recognizance and ordered to appear in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court on Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a man who lived near the devastated Northridge Meadows apartment 
complex was formally charged with illegally entering the condemned structure 
where 16 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Loughton, 24, is charged with trespassing, entering a condemned 
building and carrying a knife.  
</P>
<P>
 Each charge carries a potential sentence of six months in County Jail.  
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Loughton is wanted by Washington state officials on drug 
charges, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers demolishing the collapsed building observed Loughton enter the 
structure last Friday morning, but no one saw him take anything, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors considered charging him with looting, but "he really didn't have 
anything, he was just looking," said Deputy City Atty. David Knokey. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Walters, a 22-year-old Van Nuys man, was also arrested at Northridge 
Meadows on Friday morning, but he has yet to be charged, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office filed about half a dozen felony looting charges 
in the first week after the earthquake. THOM MROZEK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; N.Y. FIREFIGHTERS PROVIDE QUAKE RELIEF IN 
VALLEY 
</P>

<P>
 Twenty-four New York City firefighters have been spared the cold weather of 
home this month -- but they hardly got what most would call a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is part of New York's Disaster Assistance Response Team, a volunteer 
program for firefighters willing to give up their vacation time in order to 
help the American Red Cross provide services to victims of calamities such as 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters -- many of whom are from engine companies in the Bronx and 
Brooklyn -- have been working 16-hour shifts in several San Fernando Valley 
disaster assistance centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their firefighter training, the distance they've traveled, and their 
unmistakable accents make them distinct from the scores of Red Cross volunteers 
who have descended on the Valley since the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the volunteers, it was their first trip to Southern California. 
But the long nights at the shelters, unloading trucks, making coffee, handing 
out blankets, and tending to jittery earthquake refugees have taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Several said that despite the freezing weather at home, they are looking 
forward to Friday's trip back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's starting to get monotonous," said Firefighter Kevin McCabe, of Ladder 
Company No. 122 in Brooklyn. "But it's an opportunity to help someone having a 
bad time." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are in the middle of it, you think 'argh, I want to get home.' But 
you get some distance from it and think of all the people you helped, and it's 
all right," said Firefighter John Hannon, a native of what he called "the 
beautiful Bronx." 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster response program is the brainchild of Bronx Firefighter Cesar 
Rivera, who was among a group of Spanish speakers called to help out in Puerto 
Rico during Hurricane Hugo in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Rivera was so enthused with the experience that he petitioned his superiors at 
the New York City Fire Department to allow 100 specially trained firefighters 
to use their vacation time, or work extra hours, in order to serve the American 
Red Cross during times of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1991, the program was formally launched, and 100 firefighters are 
now signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said the program provides the Red Cross with a ready group of 
volunteers who can take three weeks off from their jobs at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 For the firefighters, the program gives them an unusual chance to help victims 
after the initial moment of crisis has passed, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The firefighters form a real connection to these families," said Rivera, 
interviewed by phone from New York.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have to deal with them in a sincere way, they have to be compassionate . 
. . it's the ultimate sensitivity training." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Toussaint, spokeswoman for American Red Cross in Greater New York, said 
the firefighters have played key roles in the Red Cross response to the Midwest 
floods and Hurricane Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Firefighters are used to being in disaster situations, used to being 
compassionate, and have a good 'take-charge' attitude," she said. JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; COUNCIL TO STUDY PAY INCREASE FOR MANAGER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westlake Village City Council is scheduled to debate a salary increase for 
City Manager Ray Taylor at its regular council meeting tonight at 7:30 at 4373 
Park Terrace Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who has worked for the city for about a year, now earns $80,000 per 
year.Mayor Doug Yarrow said he supports the proposal to raise Taylor's salary 
to $84,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reflection of the absolutely superior job Ray is doing for our city," 
said Yarrow. "He very quickly tackled pressing issues of budget, established a 
two-year cycle for budget, identified pressing fiscal needs of city, and has 
quickly assimilated into the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 44, is former manager of the city of Malibu. Before that, he served as 
city manager in Rolling Hills Estates near Redondo Beach, and in several 
administrative positions in Simi Valley. He grew up near Sacramento and has a 
master's degree in public administration from Cal State Chico. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor moved to Westlake Village with his family after accepting the job as 
city manager. Yarrow said he believes that Taylor has settled in town for the 
duration, but added "we don't want him to leave." JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; AFTER-CLASS ACTIVITIES OFFERED TO STUDENTS

 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan joined school officials, local politicians, 
teachers and students Tuesday on the playground of Napa Street Elementary 
School to kick off an expansion of the after-school enrichment program LA's 
BEST to a neighborhood hit hard by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 LA's BEST provides after-school programs such as tutoring, art lessons, field 
trips, athletics and performing arts classes to nearly 4,000 elementary school 
children in low-income areas that are at risk from drug and gang activity. It 
was created in 1988 by Mayor Tom Bradley through a $2-million grant from the 
Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Program directors hope to launch LA's BEST at two new sites this year. They 
decided last week that Napa Street school would be a good place to start, since 
the quake left three apartment buildings in the neighborhood red-tagged and 
many families temporarily displaced. The Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce 
contributed more than $60,000 from private donations to start LA's BEST at the 
Northridge school, which will be the fifth San Fernando Valley campus and the 
20th in the Los Angeles Unified School District to play host to the program  
</P>
<P>
 "It's coming at a time when spirits here were low," said Principal Allen 
Sussman, whose Sherman Oaks home was severely damaged by the earthquake. "It's 
hard to be up and then go home and see all that damage. But this is a plus for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Sussman said that about 90% of the school's 730 students live very near the 
school in a neighborhood that he described as "a big gang area." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like they can go to a movie or go swimming after school. We don't 
have those facilities," Sussman said. "These children have nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. Sid Thompson, who joined school board member Mark Slavkin and 
City Councilman Hal Bernson in addressing more than 450 children and dozens of 
parents at the presentation, urged everyone to sign up for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an alternative education program out there -- it's called the 
streets," Thompson said. "If you don't take the time, the streets will take the 
time." SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: COUNCIL AUTHORIZES DEMOLITION PACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has authorized officials to proceed with 
emergency demolition contracts, and laid down rules on reconstruction of the 
city's quake-damaged neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all structures can be rebuilt as they were, provided they conform to 
modern seismic standards and building codes, according to the resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some older buildings damaged by the earthquake normally would not be permitted 
under new zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted Monday night to allow almost all of those buildings to be 
reconstructed -- even those with too many residential units or not enough 
parking.  
</P>
<P>
 But the policy bans commercial uses that may have prevailed in neighborhoods 
that since have been rezoned as residential. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will have to tear down about 14 structures that pose an immediate 
hazard to the public, according to Community Development Director Howard Miura. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Miura's agency has deemed 131 structures unsafe, and limited access to 132 
others.  
</P>
<P>
 Building officials hope to authorize demolition contracts quickly, after an 
abbreviated bidding procedure, City Administrator Mary Strenn said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually don't have to go through the normal bidding procedures in 
emergency cases, but we feel a little bit better about the prices this way," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also will charge its usual construction fees, but so far is not 
collecting them, according to Miura.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members Monday night said they will consider waivers, discounts or 
other incentives at a future meeting. GEOFFREY MOHAN

INFANT GIRL FOUND DEAD IN TRASH; MOTHER IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities found a dead infant girl in a dumpster Tuesday morning and 
arrested her 17-year-old mother on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant was discovered at 8 a.m. when a woman went to take out her trash 
and lifted the lid to the dumpster at 5915 Whitnall Highway in North Hollywood, 
police said.Inside, she found the infant, who was naked and apparently already 
dead, said Lt. Al Moen, officer in charge of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Child Protection Section. Paramedics were called, and the infant 
was pronounced dead at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the investigation is continuing, Moen said police determined that a 
teen-ager living next door to the dumpster had concealed her pregnancy from her 
mother, with whom she lived. The girl, who police won't identify because she is 
a juvenile, "admitted giving birth to the infant girl and putting the child in 
the dumpster" shortly afterward, Moen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we have too many of these kinds of cases," Moen said. "There 
are plenty of people who would want to adopt children. It's a shame people have 
to resort to this." 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent cause of the infant's death is being withheld pending autopsy 
results, which Moen said should be ready by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Police today plan to submit a petition to prosecutors in Sylmar Juvenile Court 
asking that the teen-age mother be charged with the equivalent of murder. If 
she is convicted, she could be sentenced to stay in jail until she turns 25, 
Moen said.

REPRIEVE FOR MCA RAIL PLAN URGED; RED LINE: THE ENTERTAINMENT FIRM WOULD HAVE 
UNTIL MARCH 10 TO GARNER FUNDS TO MOVE A STATION CLOSER TO CITYWALK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 County transportation planners recommended Tuesday that entertainment giant 
MCA be given one more month to come up with funding sources for relocating a 
planned Red Line station closer to its CityWalk attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the company -- whose executives traveled to Washington last week to 
brief federal lawmakers on the issue -- fails to secure the necessary funds by 
March 10, Los Angeles County transportation officials should go ahead with the 
current site on Lankershim Boulevard, planners said.

 "Because this is starting to accrue costs because of the delay, we have to 
fish or cut bait by March," said Judith Wilson, Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority staff analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA received a 30-day reprieve last month and was to present a funding 
proposal to the transit authority's planning and programming committee 
Thursday. The committee will now consider the issue of another reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation analysts recommended another month's grace period for the 
multimedia concern because "we have reason to believe they've been working very 
hard to find new revenue," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA executives briefed Wilson's office on their efforts Tuesday. "We haven't 
identified any specific (funding) sources at this point," MCA spokeswoman 
Christine Hanson said, noting that the purpose of last week's trip to 
Washington was to bring congressional and Clinton Administration officials up 
to speed on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But "we're going to move forward again with the MTA collaboratively in the 
next few weeks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit authority has estimated that moving the Universal City Metro Rail 
station to a site beneath the Hollywood Freeway, near Cahuenga Boulevard, would 
cost an extra $41 million and postpone the planned July, 2000, opening by 21 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even waiting until next month for a decision on a final station site could 
cost the transit authority $520,000 in other contract delays, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA representatives have disputed the authority's projections but acknowledge 
that their proposal would incur increased costs and a delay of some kind.  
</P>
<P>
 However, they contend that a relocation onto their Universal Studios lot would 
result in greater ridership, especially by tourists and residents bound for 
CityWalk.

VALLEY BRIEFING: WEDNESDAY SPECIAL; HISTORIC BOTTLENECK: CROSSING THE NEWHALL 
PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cranky commuters trying to get through the Newhall Pass are discovering what 
has been known to travelers for hundreds of years: Getting in and out of the 
valleys is no simple trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake crippled the interchange of the 
Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways, travelers ranging from Native 
Americans to early motorists struggled to find a convenient way to cross the 
mountains at the northwest end of the San Fernando Valley. They never did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways finally forged a better link 
between the Valley and parts north. Before the collapse, 318,00 vehicles passed 
through the interchange each day. Caltrans says it will take a year to repair 
the interchange -- the latest roadblock confronting travelers at an obstinate 
pass. ROUGH ROAD: A history of attempts to clear the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 1769: Explorer Don Gaspar de Portola leads a Spanish expedition across the 
Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 1800s: Early commuters use a Native American trail over the mountains, 
employing ropes and pulleys to hoist stagecoaches up and down. In one bizarre 
attempt, the U.S. Army tries leading camels over the hills. It was an 
unsuccessful experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 1862: Under the direction of U.S. Gen. Edward Fitzgerald Beale, workers using 
picks and shovels cut a 90-foot-deep gash through the mountains, creating a 
narrow passage for horses, stagecoaches and foot traffic. Beale's Cut, as it 
was called, can still be found just be found just east of Sierra Highway and 
Clampitt Road. 
</P>
<P>
 1875: Chinese engineers and stonemasons carve a 6,976-foot-long railroad 
tunnel, through the heart of the Santa Susana Mountains. The tunnel, still used 
today, passes below the crumbled freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 1910: The 434-foot-long Newhall Tunnel is bored through the mountains west of 
Beale's Cut. It's so narrow two trucks can barely pass simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 1938: The Sierra Highway, at four lanes across, seems to offer a respite. In 
its first year it is carrying 4,000 cars a day. 
</P>
<P>
 1955: First segment of Golden Sate Freeway opens. Final segment opened in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 1963: First segment of Antelope Valley Freeway opens. Final segment opened in 
1974. BEALE'S CUT 
</P>
<P>
 Today Beale's Cut is a mostly forgotten historic site east of Santa Clarita. 
But in its heydey the cut was a bustling place. 
</P>
<P>
 A tollbooth was erected and 25 cents was charged for a single horse and rider. 
Teams of 12 or more required a $2 toll and loose animals cost a dime each. 
GETTING THROUGH 
</P>
<P>
 A rundown on the routes around the Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golden State Freeway: With a portion of the freeway closed, The Old Road has 
been rebuilt as a four-lane detour between Weldon Canyon Road and Calgrove 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antelope Valley Freeway: Two southbound lanes open, one as a car-pool lane. 
Northbound lanes open. 
</P>
<P>
 * Angeles Crest Highway: The mountain road takes a roundabout route through 
Angeles National Forest, linking the Antelope Valley with east San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * California 126: From the Santa Clarita Valley, take State 126 west to 
California 23, driving south to either the Simi Valley or Ventura freeways. 
It's a circuitous route. METROLINK EXPANDS 
</P>
<P>
 New stations and extra commuter trains have been added to the Metrolink system 
in the Valley region. Metrolink tickets from Antelope or Santa Clarita valleys 
-- 10-trip packets cost $44 and a monthly pass is $145 -- may be purchased at 
the stations. For information and additional ticket counter locations, call

LANCASTER BANS PAY-TO-ENTER PARTIES AFTER FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of a fatal shooting at a pay-to-enter party, the Lancaster City 
Council agreed to outlaw such events in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A city ordinance unanimously approved by the council Monday calls for a fine 
of up to $500 or six months in jail or both for anyone charging admission to a 
party in a private home.The ordinance will take effect March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance follows the Dec. 18 shooting death of Rayshaun Love at a 
pay-to-enter house party in Lancaster. Five days after the shooting, Love's 
half-brother, Eric Gunn, pleaded not guilty to a murder charge as well as to 
two attempted murder charges stemming from the incident. A preliminary hearing 
is scheduled Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Love's killing is not the first to occur at a pay-to-enter party in the 
Antelope Valley. Since 1990, two other deaths and numerous injuries have 
occurred at the get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are already regulations in place that would seem to apply to these 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Collins, head of Lancaster's code enforcement division, said building 
and zoning codes already regulate the use of property and fire codes impose 
limits on crowd size. 
</P>
<P>
 He said any business use of a property in a residential area requires city 
approval. There are also city business license requirements and the state 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control mandates that a license be obtained 
for any gathering that includes the sale of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance the City Council adopted specifically addresses pay-to-enter 
situations, where the other ordinances regulate uses in general for health and 
safety concerns," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Denham said Lancaster's new ordinance "gives us another 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance does not apply to charitable, political or religious gatherings 
where participants make a donation.

FAMILY MEMBERS OF 2 KIDNAPED MISSIONARIES KEEP PRAYERFUL VIGIL; HOSTAGES: THE 
MEN, INCLUDING THE FATHER OF A SANTA CLARITA STUDENT, WERE ABDUCTED BY REBELS 
IN COLOMBIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Family members and co-workers of two U.S. missionary workers taken hostage by 
leftist rebels in Colombia are waiting, and praying, to hear from the 
kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Welch, the son of one of the kidnaped men, attends The Masters College 
in Santa Clarita. He was unwilling to discuss the situation, fearing it might 
endanger his father. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Steve Welch, 41, of North Platte, Neb., and Tim Van Dyke, 41, of 
Towanda, Penn., were kidnaped Jan. 16 when 15 to 20 members of the Colombian 
Revolutionary Armed Forces raided a missionary facility near Villavicencio to 
protest the presence of American troops in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 U.S. military personnel are in Colombia building a military base, 
radar stations, a school and a health clinic, according to U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrillas took the two men into custody after initially holding 70 people, 
mostly schoolchildren, at the site, according to New Tribes Mission, which runs 
the facility. There were no injuries in the incident and those detained said 
they were treated courteously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got word from the kidnapers that they (Welch and Van Dyke) are 
healthy," said Dave Zelenak, spokesman at the New Tribes Mission headquarters 
in Sanford, Fla. "They're going to be sending something along for proof of life 
and possession." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch is the maintenance manager in charge of construction at the missionary 
school. Van Dyke is a school official, Zelenak said. 
</P>
<P>
 All missionary personnel and children were evacuated from the school the day 
after the incident. They were relocated to temporary quarters in other missions 
in the country, and teaching resumed this week in the Villavicencio homes of 
some missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, about 50 miles west of the rural 
village, do not expect an immediate end to the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things, usually they do not break fast," said L.W. Koengeter, public 
affairs counselor for the embassy. "In the past, it has taken months to resolve 
the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy officials predict the New Tribes Mission headquarters will have a 
larger role in negotiating the release of the hostages than the embassy, 
because the victims are missionary workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recent contact with the guerrillas occurred Sunday via a radio 
conversation plagued with static and fading signals, at which time the 
kidnapers reportedly promised proof that Welch and Van Dyke were in their 
possession. A New Tribes Mission spokesman described the kidnapers as "friendly 
but businesslike" in discussions.

CITY TO BUY LAND FOR VETERANS HOME SITE; SERVICES: LANCASTER AGENCY AUTHORIZES 
PURCHASE OF 38 ACRES FOR $1.9 MILLION. STATE COMMISSION BACKS FACILITY FOR THE 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city of Lancaster will spend $1.9 million for 38 acres of land that is 
expected to eventually be the site of a state veterans home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting as the Redevelopment Agency, the Lancaster City Council without 
discussion unanimously agreed Monday to purchase the property at Avenue I and 
30th Street West from Chung-Yun Chang. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster was chosen last year by a state commission as the next California 
site for a veterans home. The California Department of Veterans Affairs, 
Governor's Commission on a Southern California Veterans Home, agreed that the 
home would be built after a similar, long-awaited facility is completed in 
Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, Lancaster must provide the property for the home. The 
Redevelopment Agency agreed to buy the land for about 10% more than its 
appraised value. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the construction of a $30-million, 400-bed veterans home in 
Lancaster has yet to be secured, said Thomas Langley, assistant director for 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs will pay 65% of the construction 
costs, Langley said, noting that he is preparing to submit the funding request. 
Federal funding for the Lancaster home may not be approved until the 1996 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't forecast a (time line)," Langley said. "It's up to the federal 
government to determine if money is available in this (upcoming) fiscal year or 
the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale), along with eight other 
legislators, recently introduced a bill that would authorize the sale of 
revenue bonds to provide the state's 35% share of construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Langley said Lancaster was selected as the site for the next veterans home in 
part because of its proximity to the veterans hospital in the San Fernando 
Valley. In addition, it will also be able to serve the 750,000 veterans who 
reside in Los Angeles County.

DISNEY MAY OFFER DUCKS TICKETS FOR GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Putting a Disney spin to the nation's gun exchange craze, the entertainment 
giant is expected to announce later this week that it will swap Mighty Ducks 
hockey tickets for guns turned into the Anaheim Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is one more way to get guns off the streets," Anaheim Police 
Capt. Stan Kantor said. "We think this will be a good program . . . anything we 
can do to get guns off the streets is good." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Ducks team, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co., 
confirmed that the team is close to agreement with the city on how to conduct 
the gun trade-in, adding that Friday's Ducks home game against the Los Angeles 
Kings might be the proper forum for the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say much right now. We are considering it. We expect to have an 
announcement later this week," said Mighty Ducks spokesman Bill Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not final yet," he said. "We're still working with the Anaheim 
police on a couple issues. It still needs to be ironed out. There's a chance it 
will be tabled until next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun trade-in programs have been turning up around the country in the past 
several months. Increasingly, private businesses have stepped in to donate cash 
or services to entice people to turn in their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, more than 1,000 people turned in pistols, assault rifles and 
other firearms in a toys-for-guns exchange that was run around the December 
holidays. A Los Angeles program, also in December, netted 110 rifles, 251 
handguns, two assault rifles and 49 shotguns from people who swapped them for 
tickets to concerts and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the police departments in Costa Mesa and Orange got together with 
a local carwash owner to offer free washes and wax jobs for guns. So far, no 
guns have been turned in at Orange; Costa Mesa has received six firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Kantor declined to discuss details of the Disney program, 
referring such inquiries to the Ducks organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said that one of the issues being discussed is how many tickets will 
be given per gun. One of Disney's concerns is that an overwhelming response to 
a gun exchange would outstrip the number of available tickets for the remaining 
13 home games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at the Ducks' home games has been impressive this year. The team 
has already registered 14 sellouts in 28 home games, averaging 16,829 fans in 
the new, 17,174-seat Anaheim Arena. The Ducks have announced that they expect 
to sell out all their home games and that for many games only single seats are 
still available. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson declined to say which games might be involved in the trade-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Colson, spokesman for the city of Anaheim, also declined to discuss 
details of the exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena officials said Disney has discussed the idea of having a gun-exchange 
program with them, but they did not know the particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the fledgling franchise entered the National Hockey League this 
season, the Walt Disney Co. has been busy cross-promoting the Ducks with 
Disneyland, trying to create and capitalize on links to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has a huge investment in Anaheim, and concern about crime's impact on 
tourism is widespread in Southern California. Although Anaheim's major-crime 
rate was down 5% in 1992 compared to 1991, it was still the third worst among 
the large cities in the county. Only Santa Ana and Garden Grove were worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Disney officials said they were looking into building an ice rink in 
Anaheim. As conceived, the rink would be a joint venture with the city and be 
used as a practice facility for the Ducks as well as a community center for 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they made any secrets that they want to extend their presence 
in the community," Colson said. "It makes sense for them to try and cultivate 
fans at an early age. Disney has always been a good corporate citizen and this 
would be a logical extension of that philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney wants to make an immediate impact with the organization in Orange 
County and Southern California area," he said. "We want to give something back 
to the community and thank our fans for the overwhelming support they've showed 
us."

$1.35 MILLION AWARDED TO FIRED CSUF COACH; COURTS: JURY FINDS JIM HUFFMAN WAS 
TERMINATED IN RETALIATION FOR A LAWSUIT THAT SAVED WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury awarded $1.35 million Tuesday to a former Cal State Fullerton coach who 
said he was unfairly fired after he fought and blocked the school's effort to 
kill the women's volleyball program in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The university contended it acted properly when it fired Jim Huffman. But he 
argued that it was retaliation for his sex-discrimination lawsuit in 1992 that 
saved women's volleyball, forced changes in the school's athletic policies and 
embarrassed the school. Huffman won 25 games and lost 80 during his three years 
as coach, but he is now 2-0 in legal battles against the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this case sends a clear message to coaches all across the U.S. that 
they can stand up for gender equity, for women's rights," said Kirk Boyd, one 
of Huffman's attorneys. "And if they suffer any retribution for doing so, then 
they'll be compensated." 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.35-million award -- $350,366 in projected financial losses and $1 
million in non-economic damages -- could grow today when the 10-woman, two-man 
jury reconvenes to determine punitive damages. Huffman is eligible for them 
because jurors determined that Fullerton Athletic Director Bill Shumard and 
Jack Bedell, vice president for academic affairs, had "acted with reckless 
disregard of, or callous indifference to," Huffman's First Amendment rights. 
Shumard is also found to have acted with "fraud, malice or oppression" in 
terminating Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 University President Milton A. Gordon issued a brief statement Tuesday 
afternoon. "The outcome is disappointing because I believe the university acted 
reasonably and lawfully in ending Mr. Huffman's employment," Gordon said. "The 
personnel decision was based on employee performance and how the university 
could best build a successful athletics program. These are reasonable criteria, 
and I regret that the jury did not agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard, a defendant along with Gordon, Bedell, Cal State University 
Chancellor Barry Munitz and the CSU Board of Trustees, bore the brunt of the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the only defendant found guilty of the most serious offenses in the 
case -- acting with malice and interfering, "through threats, intimidation or 
coercion," with Huffman's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury is saying that Shumard was primarily responsible for this 
retaliatory act, and that's what we believe," said Jared Huffman, Jim's brother 
and attorney. "I think this case shows, as the gender equity suit did two years 
ago, that Bill Shumard has done a disservice to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was part of a discriminatory decision that got reversed by a court (in 
1992), he fought it tooth and nail all the way, and then he lashed out against 
the person who led the charge on that lawsuit, a second blunder. He has cost 
the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars by his incompetent and bad-faith 
decisions," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the president of the university reflects on his athletic 
administrative team and does some soul-searching, because the students of Cal 
State Fullerton and the taxpayers deserve better." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard, who was present for most of the three-week trial but was not in the 
courthouse Tuesday, could not be reached Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman, who now works at an Anaheim sports apparel company and has not 
been able to land a coaching job since his March 23, 1992, firing, felt 
vindicated. The verdict was actually $150,000 more than the $1.2 million he was 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, school officials turned down a November settlement offer of 
$350,000, according to Huffman's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of the money, it's so nice to win with magnitude," Huffman said. 
"It was obvious the school was wrong. It was glaring , and the jury sent that 
message. I didn't want them to get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys had to prove retaliation was a part of the decision to 
terminate him; the defense needed to show the school had legitimate reasons to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Kevin Gerry argued that the decision to not renew Huffman's 
contract was made in November or December, 1991, well before the school's Jan. 
28, 1992, decision to drop volleyball and the subsequent filing of Huffman's 
gender-equity suit several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry claimed the school based the decision on the team's poor record, 
academic problems, Huffman's substandard fund-raising and NCAA violations that 
occurred in the volleyball program in 1990, a year before Shumard became 
athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry further contended that when the school made the decision to drop 
volleyball because of financial problems, administrators felt it would be more 
"humane" to discontinue Huffman along with the sport, so his reputation and 
resume would not be tarnished by a firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys argued that Fullerton administrators fired Huffman because 
of the gender-equity suit, and only when they realized they might have another 
lawsuit on their hands did they go back to Huffman's personnel file and look 
for reasons to justify their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors were not allowed to discuss the case Tuesday, but Boyd thought Steve 
DiTolla, former Titan associate athletic director, provided key evidence. 
DiTolla testified that Shumard said during a Dec. 10, 1991, meeting that "while 
we have concerns, we are going to renew (Huffman's) contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Boyd: "That cuts to the heart of the case. If you believe DiTolla, you 
can't believe their decision to terminate Jim was made in the fall of 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 DiTolla also testified that at a March 20, 1992, meeting, Bedell said of 
Huffman: "We have to get rid of that son of a bitch. He's caused this 
university enough aggravation." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman was fired on the next working day. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Carroll, former Titan athletic director, former senior women's 
administrator Leanne Grotke and several Big West Conference volleyball coaches 
testified that Fullerton volleyball, a perennial conference doormat, made 
drastic improvements under Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll and Grotke said the 1990 NCAA violations were minor and not grounds 
for termination. They also testified that Huffman probably would not get 
another college coaching offer because of his reputation as a troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "A young man who had worked 11 years to pursue his lifelong ambition of being 
a Division I head coach was treated in a very reprehensible way," Jared Huffman 
said. "And because of his firing and the blackballing, he suffered what sports 
psychologists say is a loss of identity. That's a very serious thing, 
tantamount to the loss of a family member." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa sports psychologist Richard Lister testified on Huffman's behalf, 
as did Dr. Joyce Pickersgill, an economic consultant who said Huffman would 
suffer economic damages of at least $800,000 if he could not return to Division 
I coaching. The jury did not agree with Pickersgill's estimate but was generous 
in awarding damages for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised with both the amount of the damages and the proportion of the 
economic to non-economic damages, especially in light of the fact that the 
majority of the plaintiff's evidence was directed toward economic damages," 
Gerry said. "While we respect the jury's opinion, we still disagree with the 
assessment of the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry said he will file two motions today, one for a new trial and one to have 
the award reduced. He said he didn't know whether the school, which has access 
to a CSU insurance fund to pay jury awards such as this, would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Huffman, meanwhile, was still wondering whether the verdict was worth the 
long legal struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying the money won't be nice, but two years of not sleeping, having 
those guys lie about you, not being able to do what you want to do . . . I'm 
not sure it's worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman also doubted the verdict would enhance his coaching prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure (athletic directors) will think I got hosed, but I doubt they'll 
hire me," he said. "But I do think this will scare the hell out of athletic 
directors who mistreat coaches."

RAIN PLAN, LUCK SAVE LAGUNA; STORM: OFFICIALS SAY A DOWNPOUR LIKE ONE THAT 
DROVE MUD INTO MALIBU COULD HAVE MEANT DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As workers dealt with downed trees and debris left in the path of tornado-like 
winds in Irvine, emergency officials and residents alike marveled that 
fire-ravaged Laguna Beach had escaped Monday's most damaging rains with its 
muddy hillsides mostly intact. 
</P>
<P>
 While winds whipped Laguna Beach, the lack of a prolonged and heavy downpour 
probably saved Laguna Canyon from ending up like mud-swamped Malibu, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were lucky," said City Engineer Terry Brandt. "Basically, you have 
to look at how much rain (Malibu) got compared to us. They got twice as much as 
we did, and they got it all in one fell swoop." 
</P>
<P>
 What most helped the city Tuesday was that only about 0.8 of an inch of rain 
fell throughout the day, compared to two inches that pounded Malibu in a short 
time. According to Laguna officials, 15 minutes of heavy rain would have 
saturated the ground and caused flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna had rain-induced mudslides shortly after a devastating fire last 
October burned nearly 17,000 acres and 366 homes. But that time, rain fell in a 
shorter period. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was fortunate this time, but some precautions also may have helped 
Laguna brave the worst storm of the season so far, according to Woodward-Clyde, 
a Denver-based consultant the city hired after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant crafted a plan to control future floods and mudslides. 
Woodward-Clyde also worked for the cities of Malibu and Oakland, both 
devastated by fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laguna moved forward very quickly, probably the fastest . . . the most 
aggressive and proactive . . . of all the cities we worked with," said Carol 
Forrest, a Woodward-Clyde vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 By early December, the consultant's plan was put into effect, Forrest said. 
The plan, which cost $1 million to implement, involved building a network of 
small dams, water-runoff barriers and hillside reseeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the other cities have been confused and worried about the funding 
issues," Forrest said. "But Oakland advised Laguna: 'Don't worry, the (Office 
of Emergency Services and Federal Emergency Management Services) will be 
there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At Malibu's Big Rock area, which was hit hard by heavy mudslides Monday, the 
consultant's plan to control flooding and mudslides was not yet in place, 
according to Woodward-Clyde officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the mudslides that struck Laguna Beach two weeks after the October 
fire gave Woodward-Clyde an opportunity to chart how key areas of the city 
reacted, particularly the fire-ravaged areas of Canyon Acres and lower Skyline 
Drive, Forrest said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, slopes on Skyline Drive and Canyon Acres were treated with 
different mixtures of wood, seed and strong adhesives sprayed from a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 By early December, Laguna city workers, aided by the Civilian Conservation 
Corps, had fashioned 1,400 silt dams made of bales of hay and millions of 
sandbags. At the base of vulnerable hillsides were placed heavy concrete rails, 
called "K rails," and 18-inch-high mesh fences that allow water through while 
trapping silt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire system diverts all the mud and water flow into manageable areas 
and, that way, if we stay ahead of the storm, we're OK," said Patrick Brennan, 
a Laguna Beach Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 While the California Department of Forestry was reseeding 3,000 acres of 
undeveloped land around Laguna Beach, the city was reseeding several hundred 
acres within the city limits, said Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward-Clyde officials singled out the Laguna Beach Fire Department for 
praise in helping prepare for floods and mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is classically trained in this stuff, but the way Laguna Beach Fire 
Department reacted you would have thought they had done this before," said 
Michael Harding of Woodward-Clyde and a past president of the International 
Erosion Control Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the city's preventive measures, it won't really be known how well they 
work until they're tested by a stronger storm. For now, the relatively light 
rainfall Monday is what saved the day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said it is hard to predict how vulnerable the still-fragile Laguna 
hillsides would be in a torrential rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no amount of preparation we can do if nature gives us three-quarters 
of an inch of rainfall in an hour," Brennan said. "It could be our turn next." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer David Haldane contributed to this report. Storm Trackers 
</P>
<P>
 Storm intensity is monitored from 76 sites across the county. Electronic 
sensors feed into a mainframe computer at the county's Emergency Management 
Agency. The computer supplies information to local emergency response agencies 
so they can head off potential flash floods and other rain-related problems. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1. Funnel collects water; drains into tipping bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 2. When .04 inches of rain fills one side of bucket, it tips, dumping out 
rain, activating switch that transmits radio signal to EMA computer. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Rain fills other side of bucket; process repeats. 
</P>
<P>
 4. When computer registers one-half inch in 30 minutes at a site, emergency 
alert system activates. In Laguna Beach, the rain gauge is in a canyon. Signals 
are broadcast to a nearby hilltop from where they are relayed to Santiago Peak 
and on to the EMA command center.

 The Laguna Beach Fire Department began monitoring storms itself last month to 
cope with fire-ravaged hillsides that become waterlogged by rain. Laguna 
Beach's emergency response system includes: 
</P>
<P>
 Equipment: Backhoes and graders to clear streets and storm drains of mud and 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Command center: Up to 15 fire officials are paged or called to establish a 
command center. County EMA, Caltrans and Laguna Beach Municipal Services 
participate in logistic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews: Up to 68 people in strategic locations throughout city mobilize to keep 
storm grates free of straw and other reseeding debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Evacuation: Senior citizens living alone in the flood plain are offered 
evacuation help. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescues: Swift Water Rescue Team, a combination of lifeguards and firefighters 
trained to rescue people caught in flash floods, goes on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Mudslides: System of silt dams and concrete barricades used to divert water 
flow and mud from main streets.

IRVINE CREWS QUICKLY CLEAR STORM DEBRIS; DAMAGE: CITY WORKERS AND CONTRACTORS 
STREAMED INTO BUSINESS AREA WHERE WINDOWS WERE SHATTERED, TREES UPROOTED AND 
VENTILATION COVERS WERE RIPPED FROM ROOFS.

 When Joyce Gaspard left work during the relentless rain on Monday evening, Von 
Karman Avenue looked like a war zone, with uprooted trees, fallen branches and 
debris covering much of the darkened street. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Webster University administrator returned to her Irvine office 
Tuesday morning, most of the debris she had seen the evening before was gone, a 
testimonial to the quick work of city crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the fallen trees you see," said Gaspard, indicating the splintered 
tree trunks that had been removed to sidewalks or farther still from the 
street, "you wouldn't believe something resembling a tornado zipped through 
here yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the tornado-like winds that whirled through the business complex 
Monday evening shattered windows, ripped roofing panels off of buildings, 
knocked out electricity and traffic lights, and uprooted more than 150 trees, 
blocking many streets in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 WeatherData Inc., which does forecasts for The Times, said the winds, reaching 
speeds of 65 m.p.h., were caused by an "unusually strong" storm system off the 
coast. No tornado was actually charted in the area, said meteorologist Curtis 
Brack, but "since a definite path of damage was left behind, I wouldn't doubt 
the possibility of . . . a very weak tornado." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the downpour, work crews canvassed Von Karman and nearby 
streets, and cleared all of the downed trees and other debris from the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Tuesday that city property was left relatively unscathed 
by the furious winds. Rather, it was mostly private businesses that suffered 
most of the damage, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business workers in the area said the damage was limited mostly to shattered 
windows and air-conditioner or heater covers ripped from roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that the winds were so powerful, I'd say we were very lucky," 
said Ann Wirth, building manager of The Atrium, a complex of mostly financial 
businesses, where two windows on the 11th floor were shattered. There were 
"lots of downed trees but, as you can see, buildings are still standing." 
</P>
<P>
 While city workers cleared the streets, nearby private properties were also 
bustling with contractors and landscapers hired for the next few days to remove 
fallen trees, brushes and branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just overwhelmed with all the work in the area," said Greg Haynes, a 
Mission Viejo landscaper who was clearing brush and trees from Diceon 
Electronics on Von Karman. Haynes had to subcontract some of his work in the 
area to other landscapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about every contractor in the county is here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road on Dove Street in Newport Beach, several windows of the Bank of 
California were shattered, causing bank officials to end business for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain, which tapered off Tuesday morning, is not forecast to return this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack predicts mostly sunny days and clear skies for the rest of the week with 
lows in the mid-40s and high temperatures ranging from the upper 60s to the low 
70s.

U.S. CENTER PLANS TO UPGRADE QUAKE TO 6.8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., 
confirmed Tuesday that the center has decided to formally upgrade the magnitude 
of the Northridge earthquake to 6.8. 
</P>
<P>
 The step will be taken Friday in the center's weekly publication, "Preliminary 
Determination of Epicenters," Waverly Person said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geophysicist John Minsch at the national center announced five days ago that 
6.8 "probably" would be the figure used. Monday, Caltech and the U.S. 
Geological Survey announced that they had upgraded the magnitude from 6.6 to 
6.7. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the generally recognized prerogative of the national center to set 
the official magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's magnitude figure could still change as the readings of more 
seismographic stations from around the world are figured into the average. And 
the evolving understanding of seismology often results in disputes years later 
on how strong an earthquake was. 
</P>
<P>
 The great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 has been variously estimated in 
recent years at anywhere from magnitude 7.8 to 8.4, with 8.3 the most commonly 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6.8 quake is considered about 1 1/2 times more powerful than a 6.6, 
according to Jim Mori, the scientist in charge of the Geological Survey's 
Pasadena field station. The expected upgrade would represent a substantial 
change in the official concept of how powerful the Jan. 17 earthquake was. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the upgrade, the quake was the most powerful in the Los Angeles 
Basin in the two centuries of available records, and it also stands as the most 
powerful quake in U.S. history to affect such a large population. 
</P>
<P>
 The three weeks since the earthquake have been marked by repeated changes in 
thinking and disagreements among scientists about what fault was primarily 
involved, what the fault angle was, where the epicenter was and, to a lesser 
extent, what the name of the earthquake should be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake name will probably stick, even though the latest 
calculations show that the epicenter was in the neighboring community of 
Reseda.

ELECTIONS / CONGRESS; SYBERT'S CAMPAIGN TREASURY DWARFS GOP RIVALS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican congressional candidate Richard Sybert has loaned his campaign 
treasury $409,290 of his own money to challenge Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) for the congressional seat representing Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, reported $404,859 in campaign 
cash but owed himself $405,816 as of Dec. 31, according to campaign finance 
reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson reported a cash total of $68,389 at the end of the year and a debt 
of $50,000. Beilenson remains unchallenged in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County's other congressman, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), has amassed nearly $121,000 in campaign contributions to bolster his 
reelection bid. None of his potential rivals have raised even the $1,336 filing 
fee to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising prowess of the incumbent Republican prompted a strikingly 
bleak assessment of a Democrat's chances at an upset in the 23rd Congressional 
District that covers all of Ventura County except for most of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If money talks, we don't have a chance," said Hank Starr, chairman of the 
Ventura County Democratic Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24th Congressional District that covers Thousand Oaks, Malibu and 
portions of the San Fernando Valley, Sybert's campaign treasury dwarfs that of 
his two challengers for the GOP nomination in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert K. Hammer, a Newbury Park banking consultant, reported a cash total of 
$35,182, but has loaned his campaign $51,945. Mark Boos Benhard, an Agoura 
public relations consultant, had nearly $10,000 cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard said Sybert, who only recently moved to the 24th District, is using 
his money to try and "scare other candidates out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't scare me," Benhard said. "We're not trying to buy ourselves a 
seat in Congress. We're trying to earn it through a grass-roots effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer said he also is not deterred by Sybert's wealth. "People vote, dollars 
don't," he said. "This is a citizen's campaign, not a political campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hammer loaned his campaign $51,945, he said it was made at a great 
sacrifice to his family. "I'm not wealthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who plans to formally announce his candidacy next week, defended his 
large campaign loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm putting together enough money to run a campaign to beat Beilenson," he 
said, noting that Beilenson spent about $800,000 in 1992 to defeat his 
Republican opponent, former Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident I'm going to be able to raise whatever it takes," Sybert said. 
"Based on past races and how much money Beilenson has spent before it could be 
a million-dollar race." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has already spent more than $28,000 on consulting, advertising, 
printing, legal and accounting fees associated with his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress, said he hoped not to 
spend more than $250,000 in his reelection bid. But he said he is prepared to 
raise as much as $1 million if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to spend a great deal less than that," he said. "But that will depend 
on what we're up against. If Sybert wins the Republican primary and he has a 
great deal of money, we will be forced to spend as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson raised a total of $55,239 from individuals during the last six 
months of 1993. As a matter of principle, he refuses to accept contributions 
from special interest PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who plans to seek a fifth term, raised a total of $93,546 in the 
last six months of 1993, according to reports filed with the Federal Elections 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's receipts included $14,000 from special interest political action 
committees. Lockheed Employees PAC, Sunkist PAC, Employees of Pacific 
Enterprises PAC and Professional Insurance Agents PAC each gave Gallegly $1,000 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who spent $862,061 to defeat a challenge from Democratic challenger 
Anita Perez Ferguson in 1992, has repeatedly said he will raise and spend as 
much money as needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Gallegly's two Republican challengers and one Democratic opponent have 
not raised the $5,000 that triggers a requirement to file campaign finance 
reports. Nor have they raised enough for the filing fees required to get their 
names on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Frank Stephenson, a 53-year-old college placement consultant of Ojai, 
said he has yet to raise any money for his campaign. "If ideas mean anything, 
then we have a chance," he said. "If it's just about money, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson said he hopes to collect 3,000 signatures to avoid paying the 
$1,336 filing fee. So far, he said he has collected several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate William Clifford Winter, a 38-year-old nurse's assistant, 
said he also has not raised any money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out of work for awhile," he said. "Right now I'm more focused on paying 
the rent. But I'm not giving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Somis resident Charles Russo, the other Republican candidate in the race, 
could not be reached for comment.

 A Ventura County prosecutor filed assault charges Tuesday against two Westlake 
High School students for a brawl last week that left three schoolmates with 
gunshot wounds, but he stopped short of charging the alleged shooter with 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Tuesday that they are still looking for a third youth they 
believe also shot into a crowd of football players and onlookers who had 
gathered at North Ranch Park on Thursday to watch a fistfight between two 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 And after Westlake High students returned to classes Tuesday without incident, 
Conejo Valley schools Assistant Supt. Richard Simpson told city leaders at a 
briefing on school violence that the Conejo Valley campuses are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said officials know that gang-related assaults and tagging throughout 
the community are on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend toward increasing violence does not come as a surprise and we have 
been gearing up to respond," Simpson told the Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said school officials have set up committees in the past month to 
study ways to improve safety at the Conejo Valley Unified School District's 
three high schools. In addition, he said, Conejo Valley schools are about to 
become a part of a national "We-Tip" program, which allows students to make 
anonymous reports on classmates carrying weapons or spoiling for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, we need to enlighten students that part of citizenship is knowing 
when to share information with adults," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have alleged that the two 16-year-old Thousand Oaks boys jumped out of 
a car Thursday with several friends who announced, "We're the Asian Mafia," and 
attacked the crowd with bats, lumber and gunshots. Both boys are Asian 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Cardoza said he wants the two boys tried as adults. 
They are being held without bail at Ventura County juvenile hall pending 
arraignment this morning in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza said he will ask Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren today to rule 
that the two should be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 If Perren grants that request after a hearing on the evidence, Cardoza said he 
will then file charges against the boys in Superior Court, where the two would 
be exposed to adult penalties if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very serious, very dangerous course of conduct that requires at 
least a very serious investigation as to whether or not it warrants the 
sanctions of adult court," Cardoza said. "We're very lucky that no one was 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 The older of the two 16-year-olds was charged with shooting at an occupied 
vehicle, assault with a deadly weapon and discharge of a firearm, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's accused of using a .25-caliber handgun that was involved in shooting at 
someone in a vehicle," Cardoza said. The boy also faces a charge of possessing 
a gun on a school campus. Witnesses reported seeing him with a gun at Westlake 
High School last week before the shooting, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardoza said there is not enough evidence to prove that the boy, not 
identified because of his age, was trying to kill anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy admitted firing shots that grazed one youth in a pickup truck, but he 
told police he was not trying to hit anyone, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger of the two boys, who was to have taken part in the fistfight with 
a Westlake High School football player, faces charges of assault with a deadly 
weapon and assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury. Police 
said he attacked another youth with a baseball bat or piece of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County sheriff's detectives are still hunting for two more 
youths -- a Los Angeles County resident who was in one of the cars and a 
Thousand Oaks teen-ager -- who may have fired more shots into the crowd, said 
Sgt. Dave Paige. 
</P>
<P>
 Two youths suffered minor injuries in the attack. Officials said that a third, 
junior David Behling, was released Tuesday from Westlake Medical Center after 
being treated for a gunshot to the neck that fractured his skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes at Westlake High School resumed Tuesday for the first time since the 
shooting, which erupted after students had finished end-of-the-quarter final 
exams in preparation for a four-day weekend break. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the day, students heard a lecture from Principal Curt L. Luft over 
the public-address system. Luft told students that as responsible young adults, 
they should have told administrators about rumors that a fight was brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one took steps to stop what could have turned into a far greater tragedy 
-- lifelong crippling injury to a fellow student, or even death," Luft told 
students in the address. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most students interviewed as they left the sprawling 1,750-student school 
Tuesday afternoon, 15-year-old Kirsten Erickson said she feels safe there. The 
gunfire occurred off campus between a few individuals, Kirsten said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like it affected the whole school," the ninth-grader said. "It was 
their choice to go and fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Spurka, 14, agreed that Westlake is a safe campus. School officials, he 
said, "always have people walking around everywhere with walkie-talkies."  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mini, a football player, said he is friends with the shooting victims. He 
was shocked at first to hear that weapons were brought into a minor dispute 
between two students who simply didn't like each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see nothing wrong with a regular fight, but it seems like now you have to 
watch your back," Mike, 16, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kara Pickman, however, said most students viewed the violence as senseless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stupid," the 15-year-old said. "Why kill kids at 16 years old? It's just 
dumb."

STORM BRINGS RAIN, SNOW BUT NO SLIDES; WEATHER: GUSTY WINDS, HIGH SURF AND RIP 
CURRENTS ALSO HIT THE AREA. ANOTHER SYSTEM IS EXPECTED AS SOON AS SUNDAY. 
</P>

 A two-day Alaskan storm blanketed Mt. Pinos with two feet of snow and dropped 
one to three inches of rain at lower elevations across Ventura County without 
triggering any mudslides in the denuded hills scorched by last fall's 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists forecast a return of clouds Thursday, with rain coming again as 
soon as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm left gusty winds and high surf with dangerous rip currents Tuesday, 
prompting the National Weather Service to issue a small-craft advisory and 
caution swimmers, surfers and fishermen to stay out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists and state lifeguards warned of sudden large and forceful waves 
that could cover an area that had been completely dry moments before, dragging 
unsuspecting adults and children into the swift-moving water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens all too frequently at Mugu Rock," said Steve White, a lifeguard 
with the state Parks and Recreation Department. "People get washed off the 
rocks by a big wave or they slip (while) trying to recover a lure." 
</P>
<P>
 The big waves were expected to diminish by today. And although the ocean was 
brown with muddy runoff from rivers, there was no contamination from sewage, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm also brought a two-foot cover of new snow to the Mt. Pinos area, 
where U. S. Forest Service rangers cautioned motorists to bring chains and be 
prepared for icy roads and unpredictable weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably have the best cross-country skiing in Southern California," said 
Mark Bethke, Mt. Pinos district ranger for Los Padres National Forest. Bethke 
said he expects an influx of visitors this weekend if the weather is as clear 
as it was Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely gorgeous here today," he said. "Of course, every day is 
beautiful on Mt. Pinos." 
</P>
<P>
 The mountains and foothills received the most rain in Ventura County, with the 
areas in the Ventura River watershed topping the list. The storm, which began 
Sunday and had dropped most of its rainfall by shortly after midnight Monday, 
left nearly four inches at the Matilija Dam on the Ventura River's westernmost 
tributary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good thing the rain quit when it did because we were approaching the 
saturation point," said John Weikel, county engineer. "If it had continued much 
longer, we could have had problems with flooding at the RV park and other 
low-lying areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Weikel referred to the Ventura RV Beach Resort, where dozens of recreational 
vehicles and campers were damaged when the Ventura River followed an historical 
path and flooded the RV park during a deluge in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no problems Monday night or Tuesday. "Our alarm system is 
always ready," said resort store Manager Ramona Martinek. "We were concerned 
and cautious, but there was no threat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara River, which collects water from the mountains behind Fillmore 
and Piru and another 50 miles of hills in Los Angeles County, was in no danger 
of flooding, Weikel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula received the most rain in that watershed, with a two-day storm 
total of 1.68 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas Creek, which drains the Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Camarillo 
areas, had no trouble handling the two-day storm. Simi Valley received the most 
rain in that area -- nearly an inch over the two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Calleguas watershed had much less rain and has much more capacity to 
absorb storm flows than the Ventura River watershed does," Weikel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the soil held up well throughout the county, said Peggy Rose, field 
office engineer for the U. S. Soil Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said a dry period will help keep soils stable, especially in the areas 
burned in last year's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a new storm were to hit tomorrow, we would be in danger (of mudslides)," 
Rose said. "But over a week, it's hard to say. It will depend on the intensity 
of the storm when it comes in." 
</P>
<P>
 Three catch basins being constructed by the county and the conservation 
service to stop debris and mud flows in the burned areas in Santa Paula and 
Newbury Park held up during the storm. The two nearly complete basins in Santa 
Paula caught some silt and other debris carried by runoff and kept it from 
coming down the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in Newbury Park, the construction on the basin lagged further behind, and 
it was not functional in the storm, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help prevent mudslides in burned areas, Thousand Oaks city engineers 
constructed about 100 small gravel barriers, each about two feet high, in the 
canyons above Newbury Park homes. Crews resumed work Tuesday to clear any 
trapped debris or silt and repair any damage to the barriers, said Gil Pableo, 
city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The gravel embankments are only an interim solution to erosion of the burned 
hillsides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The permanent solution is vegetation," Pableo said. Although seeds planted 
after the fire had not yet germinated because of low rainfall before this 
storm, Pableo said residents can soon expect to see "a nice greenish tinge" on 
the hillsides above their homes. County Rainfall

PANEL BACKS BUFFER ZONE FOR WETLANDS; THOUSAND OAKS: COMMISSION FAVORS BARRING 
BUILDING WITHIN 50 FEET. DEVELOPMENT INTERESTS CALL LIMITS TOO RESTRICTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an exhausting seven-hour debate, the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission 
narrowly approved an ordinance early Tuesday that would prohibit development 
within 50 feet of the city's wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and building interests vigorously opposed the ordinance at the 
marathon session, saying it conflicts with existing regulations and calling it 
too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 2:30 a.m., three of the five commissioners said the desperate state of 
the wetlands in the city outweighs the financial concerns of a small number of 
developers, and they agreed to send the revised document to the City Council 
for a vote later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we must do," Planning Commissioner Linda Parks said. "If we 
wait another few years, this issue may become moot for a lack of any wetlands 
for this city to protect." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, the ordinance would create a 50-foot buffer zone 
around any existing riparian or wetlands habitat, where development would be 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter likened the inclusion of riparian land -- the 
banks and plant life adjacent to wetlands -- to the canopy element of the 
city's oak tree ordinance, in which the city protects not just the tree trunk, 
but the area immediately around it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying what we have said before. If you build right up to the edge of 
an environmentally sensitive area, it's akin to destroying it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Mervyn Kopp and Forrest Frields said they agreed with the 
concept of protecting wetlands, but believed that the ordinance was being 
rushed and was too confusing to pass in its present form. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have spent an inordinate amount of time up here trying to figure out what 
we're talking about," Kopp said. "It seems to me that this has been rushed 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said he was particularly disturbed by the exemptions added to the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The new version includes exemptions for the city and other government 
agencies, and for homeowners who have existing structures near a buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 10 gazillion exemptions, and that makes this ordinance look like 
Swiss cheese," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers representing the few property owners that would be hurt by the 
ordinance also questioned the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're here to protect the critters, why are the homeowners protected? Why 
is the city exempt?" asked R. David DiJulio, attorney for Ned Cohan, who owns a 
47-acre parcel on a flood plain in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flowery statement, DiJulio told the commission that passage of the 
ordinance would keep him busy for years, challenging it in court. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that the restrictions so severely impact development on Cohan's 
property that they constituted taking of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks Assistant City Atty. Robert K. Rogers said he believed that 
the ordinance would stand up to legal scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very legitimate government interest in protecting this property," 
he said. "I don't think it acts as a taking." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief objection raised by opponents to the measure was that an outright 
ban on development near wetlands was needlessly restrictive, especially 
considering existing state and federal constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing regulation by both the state Department of Fish and Game and the Army 
Corps of Engineers allows for the possibility of development on wetlands if the 
builder agrees to enhance a wetlands site somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is between preservation of wetlands and management of them," 
said Ellen Michiel, vice president of Raznick & Sons, which owns 40 acres in 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wetlands management says that you look at the quality of the habitat 
involved, you look at the location, the diversity of wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Michiel said plans for her property, which were approved by state and federal 
regulators, would have allowed for the expansion of a rich and diverse wetlands 
at the expense of wetlands that are not worth preserving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were working on a very flexible and imaginative conservation-oriented 
approach to the management of this critical resource," Michiel said. "None of 
that is provided for in the city ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gregory Smith, the Thousand Oaks senior planner who drafted the ordinance, 
said the city's proposal takes wetlands protection a step further than the 
other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that as a preferred means of protecting these habitats, and I am told 
that it is the general opinion of the other regulating agencies that this type 
of no-loss policy is seen as supportive of their goals," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything," he said, "they see this as a means of streamlining the 
permitting process." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said that in the end the most effective appeal was that of Julie 
Clark of Newbury Park, who urged commissioners to consider the strength of the 
ordinance's environmental goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I sit here and listen to the developers and builders, I wonder why we are 
here," Clark said. "Are we here to protect the environment or are we here to 
worry about whether or not the developers make money?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of debate, Carpenter offered an answer to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a matter of focusing on the major issue here," Carpenter said. 
"The major issue is the massive loss of this precious resource. Adopting an 
ordinance of this sort is an imperative."

BIDDING FOND FAREWELLS; DEMOLITION UNDER WAY ON FILLMORE HOTEL AND MASONIC 
BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Nearly 100 people gathered Tuesday to watch a bulldozer pick and push at 
Fillmore's historic Masonic Building, witnessing the daylong demolition of the 
most prominent building in the city's downtown district. 
</P>
<P>
 The ground shook and dust billowed as the building's brick and mortar walls 
crumbled with each knock of the machine's claw. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day, but it has to come down," said Fillmore Councilman Mike 
McMahan, watching the demolition crew at work. "Just looking at how easy it is. 
I'm surprised it didn't fall earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 A block away, a much smaller crowd gathered to witness the demolition of the 
Fillmore Hotel. Hand crews began tearing down the walls on the second floor of 
the badly damaged building. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials didn't expect heavy equipment to be used on the hotel until 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hotel owner had fought to prevent the demolition of his structure, 
owners of the Masonic Building had to fight to tear down their building. The 
Masonic Assn., which owns the building, struggled first with the state Office 
of Historic Preservation and then local residents intent on saving the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 To them, Tuesday's demolition was more of a relief than a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the building right after the earthquake it was an emotional 
experience," said association member Jack Starnes while holding a camera to 
record the event. "Right now, though, all that emotion has left me. It's sad to 
see it go, but it had to. It was unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition crew from Reed Land Clearing of Ventura at one point stopped 
the demolition and plucked a piano from inside a second-floor auditorium. The 
bulldozer driver, Darrell Lahon, impressed the crowd with his deft handling of 
his rig, keeping bricks from cascading onto the piano until the team was able 
rescue it. 
</P>
<P>
 After saving the piano, Lahon picked up a large steel beam with the jaws of 
the bulldozer and used it to knock out the walls on the back half of the 
structure. As a large portion of one wall along the street toppled, the wood 
arched ceiling of the auditorium collapsed with the creak of snapping wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sure knows how to handle that thing," said Ken Glenn, president of the 
Masonic Assn., as the dust from the walls settled.  
</P>
<P>
 Glenn said he was glad that the demolition could finally proceed. He said 
association members worried that someone might be hurt if the building fell. 
</P>
<P>
 A last-ditch effort a week ago by a group of local residents to save the 
building had association members worried that they would have to wait weeks or 
months before demolishing the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to save the building ended last week when a Superior Court judge 
refused to block the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't looking at reality," said Glenn as he watched another piece of 
the second floor fall away from the building. "It's not even solid bricks. It 
would have cost $2 million to repair it." 
</P>
<P>
 The building, constructed in 1919 with bricks and hollow red tile, sustained 
severe damage during the Jan. 17 earthquake. While preservationist said it 
could be repaired, engineers hired by the association determined that the costs 
were too high. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition crew also was able to retrieve a safe that contained records 
dating back to World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew will finish tearing down the building today, when association members 
hope to rescue one last item from the rubble -- a time capsule still sealed in 
the cornerstone of the building.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's in there. I guess they put in all sorts of things," Glenn 
said.

JUDGES OK PAY HIKE FOR TOP COURTS EXECUTIVE; SALARIES: SEVEN JURISTS OPPOSE THE 
12.8% RAISE, WHICH MAKES SHEILA GONZALEZ THE THIRD-HIGHEST PAID COUNTY 
ADMINISTRATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With opposition from some brethren on the bench, Ventura County judges Tuesday 
awarded the top courts administrator a $12,400 raise just nine months after 
deferring on a $23,000 pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12.8% raise, which is retroactive to Jan. 1, brings Sheila Gonzalez's base 
salary to $109,000 and makes her the third-highest paid appointed county 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen of the county's 27 judges voted for the raise, seven opposed it and 
two abstained, Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one of Gonzalez's top two aides -- Vincent Ordonez Jr. -- said he 
was leaving his position in a move unrelated to the pay-raise issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the new salary better compensates Gonzalez, 50, for the job she 
does day in and day out. She said Gonzalez -- courts executive, clerk and jury 
commissioner -- had gone three years without a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also credited her with saving the county more than $3 million in the 
past four years by streamlining operation of the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's deserving of something," Johnson said. "This is a pretty cheap 
pay-back." 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the judges who opposed the pay hike disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, efficiency always ends up with some top people making huge 
salaries and some people at the bottom making little salaries," Superior Court 
Judge James McNally said. "I don't get the reason we're singling out top people 
to get big, bloated salary increases." McNally said a study conducted by 
another dissenting colleague, Judge Frederick A. Jones, showed that Gonzalez 
received raises totaling $24,722 in the 19-month period that began in March, 
1989. Jones could not be reached immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Those previous raises added up to 34%, said McNally, who added: "You would 
think that would hold you a little while." 
</P>
<P>
 McNally had previously said an appropriate raise for Gonzalez would be no more 
than 5% of her salary, or about $5,000. Other critics have said they would 
oppose any raise that exceeded 3%, citing countywide budget difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this salary thing has become a terrible boondoggle," McNally said. 
"It sends out a terrible message to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have opposed the raise in the past were less critical. They said 
$12,400 is a steep pay hike, but is still better than the $23,000 proposed in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, county Supervisor John K. Flynn threatened to cut the court's 
budget if the judges awarded the $23,000 raise. On Tuesday, however, he viewed 
the 12.8% pay boost as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judges have come down halfway and that's good enough for me," Flynn said. 
"I did all I could. I think they must have heard me." 
</P>
<P>
 Judges from the Superior and Municipal courts backed away from the larger 
raise eight months ago, but formed a four-member committee that studied the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee looked at the salaries of comparable court administrators in 
other counties and determined that Gonzalez deserved the 12.8% raise because of 
her extensive duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Municipal Court Presiding Judge John R. Smiley said Gonzalez is 
the only administrator in California who serves as clerk of Superior and 
Municipal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said in a written statement that Gonzalez took over collections of 
fines and fees on behalf of the county's probation office in May, supervising 
an additional 12 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the two judges said other counties have multiple executives doing 
the same job Gonzalez does. For instance, they said Fresno County courts have a 
similar number of employees and judges as Ventura County, but have three 
administrators with salaries totaling $246,000 doing the job that Gonzalez 
does. 
</P>
<P>
 And San Mateo County has one more judge and 60 fewer employees than Ventura 
County, but it employs two court administrators who earn a combined salary of 
$171,850, the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Gonzalez becomes the third-highest paid appointed administrator 
in the county behind Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg ($123,630) 
and Health Care Agency Director Phillipp K. Wessels ($111,976). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ordonez said he was resigning as assistant executive officer 
effective Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordonez, who received a 5% pay increase in October and was scheduled to 
receive another 5% raise this year, said he just figured that it was time for a 
job change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm leaving under very good terms," said Ordonez, who turned 46 on Tuesday. 
"I'm leaving because I want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wants to work in private industry, after 22 years of government 
service. All but seven of those years were with Ventura County, including a 
stint as budget analyst in the county's chief administrative office. He was 
born and raised in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of the fact that I am part of an organization that has saved 
taxpayers money," said Ordonez, pointing to the savings achieved, in part, by 
recycling paper and reducing office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordonez said he feels that "perhaps there is something different out there. I 
don't want to have to wait until I'm 65 to decide that it is time to make a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who refused to discuss her pay raise, said of Ordonez: "I'm going to 
miss him desperately."

COUNTY CITIES LOSE BIDS FOR L.A. MUSEUM; ATTRACTIONS: THE SOUTHWEST'S BOARD 
DECIDES AGAINST MOVING. IT PLANS TO BUY NEARBY BUILDINGS TO EASE THE SPACE 
CRUNCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Southwest Museum announced Tuesday it will stay in Los Angeles, ending 
months of courting by leaders in seven Ventura County cities who had hoped to 
woo the prestigious facility to their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of moving from their cramped Highland Park quarters, museum Executive 
Director Thomas Wilson said board members plan to acquire nearby buildings that 
will ease the space crunch that has plagued the institution for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the museum board was finally swayed by a promise from the city of 
Los Angeles to establish a blue-ribbon committee to help the museum expand and 
improve its present site. Key to the city's bid, Wilson said, was a promise to 
support bond issues that will fund museums and to help secure a museum stop on 
the Blue Line light-rail extension through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his city was among the most aggressive of the 80 offers that the 
museum board passed on, Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo said he was 
not surprised by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling they were just trying to drum up support for the home crowd," 
Schillo said. "The idea was to get something for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, he is not resentful. Schillo called the museum's actions 
"shrewd." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is an accepted way of doing the best for your board of directors 
and your patrons," he said. "The game is to say that a famous museum is 
interested in relocating and then see what you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said he "hates to think" that the museum 
solicited the bids in an effort to gain bargaining leverage with the city of 
Los Angeles. But the city must have made the concessions attractive enough to 
persuade museum directors to stay put, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they were offered," he said. "Did they get boxes at the 
Coliseum?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the museum's proposed move was "not a ploy to play one place off 
against another. We were honestly looking at the best alternative for the 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
 When museum officials announced they were seeking more space last summer and 
solicited bids from 140 cities in Southern California, seven cities in Ventura 
County expressed interest. Officials in Thousand Oaks, Ventura, Camarillo, 
Oxnard, Moorpark, Fillmore and Simi Valley began talking about what a wonderful 
attraction the museum would represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark sent a team to Highland Park to personally make a presentation to 
museum directors. Other cities sent letters touting their attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most unusual pitch, however, came from Fillmore rancher James Sandoval. 
Sandoval told museum officials that he envisioned a tourist mecca built around 
a Southwest Museum in Fillmore. The attraction would include a re-created Civil 
War battleground and live demonstrations of Chumash ceremonial rites. 
</P>
<P>
 But most cities dropped out of the bidding in November, when the museum 
requested at least $35 million to cover the costs of moving its collection of 
Native American artifacts and building new exhibition space. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Thousand Oaks and Ventura remained in the running. Ventura was the most 
aggressive, with the City Council voting in late November to tout two 
ocean-view properties as potential sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the process dragged on, some began to voice doubts on whether the 
museum was sincere in its intention to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some people who suggested that they weren't acting in good faith," 
Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said. "But we were happy to be considered. We think we 
would have been a great location." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said he believes the museum was serious about its 
intention to find a second facility, at least initially. But the lack of cities 
with the ability to spend $35 million in moving costs may have made them change 
their minds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it worked to their advantage," he said. "The local community (in Los 
Angeles) kind of sat up and took notice. And they did a little sales job with 
the city and got what they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Councilwoman Charlotte Craven also thinks the $35-million price tag 
turned off a lot of cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that nobody was willing to pay what they wanted us to pay for 
them to move here," she said. "It isn't that we didn't want them. We just 
couldn't afford them."

NO DECEIT BY DEVELOPER, ATTORNEY SAYS; COURTS: OXNARD DUNES PROPERTY OWNERS 
ACCUSE FIRM OF FAILING TO TELL THEM LAND WAS USED AS A DUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Denying that the Oxnard Shores Co. used deceit to sell property at the Oxnard 
Dunes, an attorney said Tuesday the development firm told Oxnard officials 
twice before anyone bought lots 20 years ago the site was an abandoned waste 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Christopher P. Bisgaard said the notification came in letters 
developers sent in 1962 and 1964 advising the city of an engineering firm's 
plans to drill mud sumps on the property in order to dry up the waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 During closing arguments, Bisgaard called the company's efforts "full and 
complete disclosure, without qualification." 
</P>
<P>
 Bisgaard's statements contrasted sharply with comments made a day earlier by 
an attorney for three families suing over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The families are seeking unspecified damages from Oxnard Shores, the city and 
numerous other defendants in the complex, four-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the defendants failed to tell them of the former use of the land they 
were purchasing. Since discovery of the toxic dump under the 100-home 
development nine years ago, their property has lost virtually all of its value, 
the plaintiffs claim. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, 175 residents joined in the lawsuit in Ventura County Superior 
Court. All but the three remaining families agreed to an undisclosed 
out-of-court settlement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first day of closing arguments, plaintiffs' attorney Lawrence M. 
Schulner told the jury Monday that Oxnard Shores and the city neglected to warn 
home buyers of the waste dump because of greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisgaard, however, tried to counter that on Tuesday, saying Oxnard Shores' 
only responsibility was to notify the city of the waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask the question, what more could Oxnard Shores have done to disclose this 
information?" Bisgaard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulner had suggested in his arguments that Oxnard Shores could have notified 
the California Department of Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bisgaard discounted that. He said the real estate department would not 
have notified the buyers of the property of the waste dump even if it had known 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisgaard said the real estate department only gives information on land to the 
original buyers -- which in this case would have been Oxnard Shores. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he said, the city of Oxnard could have readily provided the 
plaintiffs with information on the past use of the land, if the city had been 
so inclined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only conceivable place where these plaintiffs could have received 
historical information concerning the Dunes was the city of Oxnard," Bisgaard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said one of the plaintiffs, Steven Blanchard, has no claim to damages 
from the company because Blanchard's house is not in the sump area. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing at Blanchard, who sat at the plaintiffs' table with his attorney, 
Bisgaard told the jury: "Like a drowning man, Mr. Blanchard grabs at anything 
in a desperate attempt to remain afloat." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard, on the advice of Schulner, declined to respond to the portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisgaard also said the plaintiffs' charge that the waste dump was covered up 
with clean sand is a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Schulner likes to make that charge "because he likes to talk about the 
literal cover-up." But Bisgaard said it was common practice to pour a sand 
blanket on newly developed land. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is expect to conclude its arguments today. The case will go to the 
jury after Schulner gives a rebuttal.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EARLY VALENTINE TREAT FOR 'BETTER 'BREATHERS' 
</P>

 Betty Kallan of Oxnard wouldn't think of missing the annual party hosted by 
the American Lung Assn. in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Her convivial mood Tuesday was unmarred by her reliance on an oxygen tank, 
tucked discreetly next to the table, that emphysema has forced her to depend on 
23 hours every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky," Kallan remarked to her companions. "I go out all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kallan was one of several hundred members of the six Better Breather Clubs in 
Ventura County who attended Tuesday's program. The luncheon featured a catered 
meal and singing, dancing and inspirational talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was the fifth annual Valentine's Day Luncheon sponsored by the 
Ventura County chapter of the American Lung Assn. for the 1,000 county 
residents who belong to the Better Breather Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many Better Breathers, the Valentine Luncheon is their only social outing 
of the year," said Steven Nagelberg, president of the association's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the clubs suffer from chronic lung diseases such as emphysema, 
chronic bronchitis and asthma. Members receive medical advice and tips on 
coping with the illnesses at the club's monthly meetings and by reading the 
club's monthly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Edna Ray, the association's executive director, said lung ailments caused by 
tobacco use remain the country's No. 1 preventable killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "More people die from tobacco-related diseases than from AIDS, accidents and 
drugs," Ray said. "And anyone with a lung disease will be affected by 
secondhand smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, a guest speaker, told the audience that he will ask 
the city's staff March 1 to formulate a tougher anti-smoking ordinance for the 
city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 That was good news to William Reynolds, an 85-year-old Camarillo resident who 
developed chronic bronchitis 20 years ago after a lifetime of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had quit before, I wouldn't be here," said Reynolds. "But with the 
Better Breather Club, you can learn how to take care of yourself. I recommend 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the Better Breather Club, call the American Lung Assn. 
at 988-6023. PATRICK McCARTNEY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; POST-QUAKE OVERTIME PAY MAY HIT 
$108,000 
</P>

<P>
 Overtime for Simi Valley city employees who worked the week of the Jan. 17 
earthquake could top $108,000, according to early estimates from the city's 
budget office. 
</P>
<P>
 In a draft report prepared by budget officer Ken Schechter, overtime costs 
from Jan. 17 to 23 were estimated at $78,000 for police, $10,500 for 
sanitation, $9,000 for public works, $8,000 for waterworks and $3,000 for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "These figures are very preliminary," Schechter said. "This will just begin to 
give us an idea of what our overtime expenses will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Schechter had not compiled the total number of overtime hours worked or the 
cost of overtime beyond Jan. 23. Many city employees are still on quake-related 
overtime schedules, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employees will be reimbursed with extra time off rather than overtime 
pay, Schechter said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with other quake expenses, city officials said they plan to seek 
reimbursement for the overtime from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 
the state Office of Emergency Services. If approved, FEMA will pay 75%, the OES 
18.75% and the city 6.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday agreed to pay an additional $35,000 to a disaster 
grants management consultant to help the city complete its state and federal 
emergency grant applications. SARA CATANIA

 Thousand Oaks business owners, government officials and university professors 
will meet Thursday morning at Cal Lutheran University to dissect the state of 
the local economy and attempt to chart its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Entitled "Conejo Valley Jobs and Business -- A Quick Look Back . . . A Good 
Look Forward," the forum is being sponsored by the Thousand Oaks Rotary Club, 
the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce and Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got tired of seeing all these economic forecasts of our economy done 
by experts in Los Angeles, or Washington or even Ventura," said Merv Kopp, a 
Thousand Oaks Rotary Club member and planning commissioner who helped plan the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning forum will feature assessments of the economy from local business 
owners, city officials such as Thousand Oaks Finance Director Robert Biery and 
school administrators such as Jerry Gross, the superintendent of the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District, Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Maxey, the dean of Cal Lutheran's business school, will also give his 
forecast for the Thousand Oaks economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, which is free and open to the public, will run from 7:30 to 9 a.m. 
Thursday in Cal Lutheran's Preus-Brandt Forum. For more information, call the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce at 499-1993. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EXTENSIVE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLANS PUSHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a need to increase the number of minorities in top county jobs, the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday adopted a resolution requiring 
department heads to come up with extensive affirmative action plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county mirrors the diversity of the local communities that we serve," 
said Maria Diaz, the county's affirmative action officer."However, minority 
representation in the higher ranks is still lacking." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan approved by the board, department heads will be asked to set 
employment goals and timetables for the hiring and advancement of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a hiring report prepared by Diaz, the number of blacks, Asians 
and Pacific islanders on the county's payroll of 6,324 employees now largely 
reflects their presence in the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, minorities constitute 30.6% of the work force, up from 25% in 1986. 
But despite the gains, the county has made little progress in increasing 
minority representation in management, law enforcement and technical services, 
Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors said they hoped that by preparing the affirmative action 
plans, the department heads will help the county increase the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very supportive of this kind of approach," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. 
"I would like to see us recognize the department heads who have been able to 
achieve the goals." TINA DAUNT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL SEEKS FUNDS FOR METROLINK SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council has made it clear that it wants the Metrolink commuter 
rail service to stop at Oxnard to help reduce traffic congestion aggravated by 
earthquake-caused damage to area highways. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council approved an emergency ordinance seeking federal 
disaster funds to help subsidize the $4 million it would cost to extend 
Metrolink service from Moorpark through Camarillo to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials have already approved extension of Metrolink to Camarillo at a 
cost of $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is ineligible for disaster funds because the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency initially placed it outside the boundaries of the disaster 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission is scheduled to meet Thursday to 
discuss Oxnard's request. Next week, a state task force will take up the 
county's request. Oxnard's plea will be given greater weight if county 
transportation officials lend their support. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proposal, FEMA would pay 75% of the cost of extending the 
service to the two Ventura County cities through June 30, with the state and 
local communities picking up the remaining cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If federal disaster officials designate Oxnard as an eligible recipient, the 
city would have to furnish $50,000. Without the federal aid, Oxnard would be 
required to pay $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, City Manager Thomas Frutchey said Oxnard was harder hit 
by the Jan. 17 earthquake than Camarillo and therefore deserves federal 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our public buildings alone suffered $250,000 damage, whereas Camarillo did 
not experience any damage," Frutchey said. Nevertheless, federal officials 
initially included Camarillo in the disaster area while omitting Oxnard.

FIRM FACES SUIT OVER SENIORS' CARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley firm that pitched its "home companion care" plan as an 
alternative to costly nursing home care for senior citizens is facing a civil 
suit alleging unfair business practices and false advertising, a Ventura County 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Home Owners Assn. preyed on senior citizens' fears of being confined 
to nursing homes by offering a plan that includes no medical or nursing care, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. David Fairweather. 
</P>
<P>
 The company sold 5,000 of the contracts statewide after it incorporated in 
March, 1992, Fairweather said. Many were sold to seniors in Ventura County, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each contract cost between $6,000 and $9,000, and included fees of up 
to $600 a year, the group allegedly employed only unskilled laborers who 
provided little more than housekeeping and companionship, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office filed a complaint Jan. 28 
alleging that the association used pressure tactics to sell the contracts to 
unsuspecting senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The group told clients that their money would be held in escrow, but 
Fairweather said he is investigating whether that was ever done. After the 
complaint was filed, the company closed its doors and sent a letter to clients 
stating that it had filed for bankruptcy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Thursday will ask a judge to freeze the company's assets and 
prohibit them from selling any other home care contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President James Michael Cleary of Simi Valley could not be reached for 
comment Tuesday. Fairweather said he will attempt to retrieve the senior 
citizens' money, if there is any left, and give them refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are elderly victims that need health care," he said. "They only have 
limited money they can spend on it. And if they waste it on a product that 
can't even provide them minimal care, and that company has gone belly up, where 
do they turn?" KAY SAILLANT

HOME SALES ARE UP FOR 3RD CONSECUTIVE YEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of existing single-family homes in the Simi Valley-Moorpark area climbed 
in 1993 for the third consecutive year, up 13.8% from 1992, a study by a realty 
group showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 1,726 homes closed escrow in 1993, an increase of 209 from 1992, 
according to records kept by the Simi Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors.Homes 
were sold at an average price of $218,000, down 5.5% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 75% of the homes were sold in Simi Valley, and the rest were sold in 
Moorpark and the unincorporated Santa Rosa area. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a four-bedroom home sold in Simi Valley was about 
$224,300, while homes of a similar size in Moorpark and Santa Rosa averaged 
about $277,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Association President Shannon Wolf said that despite a brief lapse after the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, sales have continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't say just how long this will last," 
Wolf said. "But we are selling a lot of homes and it looks like that is going 
to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 While home purchases rose, condominium sales declined 4.1% to 237, the lowest 
annual total since 1987. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: EL RIO; SEWAGE PROBLEM MAY HALT CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction in El Rio may be halted until the unincorporated community of 
about 12,000 deals with its sewage problem. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are drawing up a proposal that will ask the County Board of 
Supervisors to impose a building moratorium on the area. 
</P>
<P>
 El Rio, which depends entirely on septic systems to handle its sewage, has 
repeatedly been plagued by contamination of its water supply by nitrates from 
sewage seeping out of the septic systems. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the side effects of nitrate contamination includes "blue baby 
syndrome," which can cause death in infants by inhibiting their ability to 
absorb oxygen, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nitrate contamination in El Rio at its worst in 1991 was measured at three 
times higher than what is considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "A sewer system is really the best solution for the community," said Jeff 
Walker, permit supervisor for the county's planning department. "It would allow 
them to go forward and develop their properties to the extent that zoning laws 
allow." 
</P>
<P>
 But the cost of a new sewer system, which could be as high as $10 million, 
might prove prohibitive for area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like the community to resolve the issue rather than the county saying 
'you have to put in a sewer system and you have to pay for it,' " said 
Supervisor John Flynn, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Environmental Health Department is expected to submit a letter to 
the Board of Supervisors in the next two weeks that will outline the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to study the prospects of having a moratorium," Bob Gallagher of the 
Environmental Health Department said Tuesday. "In the meantime, we're trying to 
look for state money to help fund a new sewage system for the area." SCOTT 
HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DISPUTE PLACES JOB PROGRAM IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A contract dispute between the Oxnard high school district and a federally 
funded jobs agency is threatening the existence of a program that trains 150 
welfare recipients each year to re-enter the work force, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District board Wednesday will consider a staff 
recommendation that trustees reject renewing a contract with the Oxnard-based 
Jobs Training Policy Council for a district training program. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs council is one of three agencies that pay the Oxnard district to 
teach adult welfare recipients such courses as English as a second language, 
preparation for a high school equivalency certificate and remedial math and 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, known as Greater Avenues in Independence, or GAIN, is designed to 
help people get off welfare and into the work force. The Oxnard district's 
adult school has offered the program for at least six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives about $273,000 each year to offer GAIN courses. The jobs 
council pays the district about $83,000 in federal funds. Another $156,000 
comes to the district from the Ventura County Public Social Services Agency, 
and the state Department of Education pays an additional $134,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials are objecting to the jobs council's proposal to change 
its contract so that the district would receive only half of its $83,000 
payment up front, with the other half withheld until the yearlong program is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAIN program runs each year from July through June. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Bohan, the council's contracts manager, said he believes the school 
district is not eligible to receive GAIN program payments from the county 
social services agency or the state education department unless it first signs 
a contract with the jobs council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohan said the new contract provision as proposed would allow the jobs council 
to first audit how the district has spent its initial GAIN funding during the 
contract year before delivering the final payment. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; LACK OF RIDERS PUTS END TO EXPRESS BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Express bus service between Ojai and Ventura is scheduled to be canceled on 
July 1 because not enough people are riding the bus line, officials said this 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Area Transit began operating the express service in 1991 as an 
experimental route.But the project has failed, with subsidies costing as much 
as five times what other area bus routes cost, a transit official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a demonstration route that was put into effect three years ago," said 
Maureen Hooper Lopez, SCAT director of planning. "For each of these three years 
it's been performing at a level very much less than the systemwide average." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said fewer than 40 people a day ride the bus line that makes three round 
trips daily. Given the low ridership, the average subsidy reached $8.60 per 
passenger last year. That compared with a systemwide average subsidy of $1.46 
per rider, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not actually sure why, but it never quite caught on," Lopez said. 
"People still don't want to give up their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley said the decision to cancel the express 
service may be premature because mass transit has surged in popularity since 
last month's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we're going to see a whole new aspect to public transportation on 
the part of the public," Shelley said. "It's possible that we need every bus 
from Ojai so that connections can be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said no one spoke against the proposed cancellation at a public hearing 
last week. Another hearing is scheduled for March 2 at the SCAT office in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 SCAT will continue to run six round trips daily between Ojai and Ventura, 
though the bus line makes a number of stops along the way. JEFF McDONALD

MAN LISTED AS SERIOUS AFTER JACKET FIGHT; OXNARD: FOUR PEOPLE ARE INJURED 
TRYING TO FEND OFF A GROUP OF FIVE OR SIX YOUNG MALES WHO WANTED THE CLOTHING. 
</P>

 A 43-year-old Oxnard resident who rushed to help a man being stabbed in a 
fight in the city's La Colonia neighborhood was reported in serious condition 
Tuesday at St. John's Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Jose Luna Hernandez and two other men were stabbed Monday 
night when they tried to help Luis Gallardo Melena, 23, fend off a group of 
five or six young men who wanted his jacket, Oxnard police investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez underwent surgery at St. John's Medical Center for abdominal wounds 
Monday night, a St. John's spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melena and a friend were walking home from a local market about 7:30 p.m. 
Monday when they were confronted by five or six males, ages 17 to 25, Oxnard 
Police Department spokesman David Keith said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects demanded Melena's jacket and when he refused, a fight started in 
the parking lot at Copper Road and McKinley Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melena's friend ran for help and returned moments later with Melena's brother, 
Juan, and a small group a nearby residents, Sgt. Charles Dunham said. 
Hernandez, Juan Melena, 27, and Baltazar Morales, 19, joined the fight in an 
attempt to help Luis Melena, Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By this time they had stabbed Luis," Dunham said. "When others showed up to 
assist, the suspects pulled knives and then they all got stabbed." 
</P>
<P>
 The four Oxnard residents were transported to three Ventura County hospitals 
for treatment Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Melena was listed in good condition Tuesday at Pleasant Valley Hospital, 
and Morales and Juan Melena were listed in fair condition at Ventura County 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into the incident is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we have some good leads," Keith said. "I think there's a good 
chance we'll get some arrests soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said the department has "good descriptions" of the suspects and is 
investigating the case as a gang-related incident. Keith said investigators had 
not determined why the attackers wanted the victim's jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been several incidents where that's been used to challenge an 
innocent passerby by some of these local gang members," Dunham said, adding 
that Melena might have been wearing a jacket with a popular sports insignia. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said there is no indication that the victims were involved in gangs.

ELECTIONS CONGRESS; GALLEGLY FAR OUTDISTANCES RIVALS IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) has amassed nearly $121,000 in campaign 
contributions to bolster his reelection bid, while none of his potential rivals 
have raised even the $1,336 filing fee to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who plans to seek a fifth term, raised $93,546 in the last six 
months of 1993, according to financial reports filed with the Federal Elections 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's receipts included $14,000 from special-interest political action 
committees. The Lockheed Employees PAC, Sunkist PAC, Employees of Pacific 
Enterprises PAC and Professional Insurance Agents PAC each gave Gallegly $1,000 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who spent $862,061 to defeat a challenge from Democrat Anita Perez 
Ferguson in 1992, has always said he will raise and spend as much money as 
needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising prowess of the incumbent Republican prompted a strikingly 
bleak assessment of a Democrat's chances at an upset in the 23rd Congressional 
District that covers all of Ventura County except for most of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If money talks, we don't have a chance," said Hank Starr, chairman of the 
Ventura County Democratic Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Gallegly's two Republican challengers and one Democratic opponent have 
not raised the $5,000 that triggers a requirement to file campaign finance 
reports. Nor have they raised enough for the filing fee to get their names on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's lone Democratic challenger, Frank Stephenson, a 53-year-old college 
placement consultant from Ojai, said he has yet to raise any money for his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If ideas mean anything, then we have a chance," he said. "If it's just about 
money, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson said he hopes to collect 3,000 signatures to avoid paying the 
$1,336 filing fee. He said he has collected several hundred so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate William Clifford Winter, a 38-year-old nurse's assistant, 
said he also has not raised any money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out of work for awhile," he said. "Right now I'm more focused on paying 
the rent. But I'm not giving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Somis resident Charles Russo, the other Republican candidate in the race, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional challengers have been much more active in the 24th Congressional 
District, which represents most of Thousand Oaks, part of the San Fernando 
Valley and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, has loaned 
his campaign treasury $409,290 of his own money to challenge Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert reported $404,859 in campaign cash on hand but owed himself $405,816 as 
of Dec. 31, according to campaign finance reports filed with the Federal 
Elections Commission. In all, Sybert's debts totaled $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson reported a cash total of $68,389 at the end of the year and a debt 
of $50,000. Beilenson remains unchallenged in the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert's campaign treasury dwarfs that of his two challengers for the GOP 
nomination in the June primary -- Robert K. Hammer and Mark Boos Benhard. 
Hammer, a Newbury Park banking consultant, reported a cash total of $35,182, 
but he has loaned his campaign $51,945. Benhard, an Agoura public relations 
consultant, had nearly $10,000 cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Benhard said Sybert, who only recently moved to the 24th District, is using 
his money to try and "scare other candidates out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't scare me," Benhard said. "We're not trying to buy ourselves a 
seat in Congress. We're trying to earn it through a grass-roots effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hammer loaned his campaign $51,945, he said it was made at a great 
sacrifice to his family. "I'm not wealthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who plans to formally announce his candidacy next week, defended his 
large campaign loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm putting together enough money to run a campaign to beat Beilenson," he 
said, noting that Beilenson spent about $800,000 in 1992 to defeat his 
Republican opponent, former Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress, said he hoped not to 
spend more than $250,000 in his reelection bid. But he said he is prepared to 
raise as much as $1 million if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to spend a great deal less than that," he said. "But that will depend 
on what we're up against. If Sybert wins the Republican primary and he has a 
great deal of money, we will be forced to spend as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson raised a total of $55,239 from individuals during the last six 
months of 1993. As a matter of principle, he refuses to accept contributions 
from special-interest political action committees.

CHEVRON DENIED PERMISSION FOR EMERGENCY TANKER SHIPPING; ENVIRONMENT: A 
SPOKESMAN FOR THE OIL COMPANY SAYS SANTA BARBARA COUNTY OFFICIALS WHO MADE THE 
DECISION 'NEED A REFRESHER CLASS IN ECONOMICS 101.'

 In a blow to Chevron Corp.'s Point Arguello operations, Santa Barbara County 
officials on Tuesday denied the oil company's emergency tanker shipping 
application, forcing the company to scramble to find storage space or cut 
production from its vast offshore oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists in Ventura County and elsewhere in Southern California 
hailed the decision, saying that, at least temporarily, the ecologically 
sensitive Santa Barbara Channel will be spared the risk of an oil spill from a 
tanker accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the decision that the county reached was correct and we are 
cautiously optimistic that, at least for the short term, the ecologically 
fragile Santa Barbara Channel will be protected from tankering," said Linda 
Krop, an attorney with the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center, a 
public interest law firm representing several environmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Krop was Lisa Weil, policy director for the Santa Monica-based 
American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that Chevron's request is bogus," Weil said. "This is nothing but a 
desperate move to play for time and continue tankering." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanker shipments began last August after Chevron obtained a three-year permit 
from the California Coastal Commission, allowing the company to ship oil only 
to Los Angeles. But the company failed to meet a key condition of the permit: 
that it have an agreement by Feb. 1 for an overland pipeline to carry the oil 
when the permit expired in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the Feb. 1 deadline, Chevron applied for emergency permission 
to continue shipping by tanker up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day to Los Angeles 
refineries. The company said an emergency permit was warranted because an oil 
pipeline it uses to get oil to Los Angeles suffered damage during the Jan. 17 
earthquake and was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 In the application, the company contended that because of damage to Four 
Corners Pipeline No. 1, a crude-oil supply emergency had arisen -- a claim 
rejected by Santa Barbara County officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've denied the emergency tankering request because Chevron has not 
demonstrated that a crude-oil supply emergency actually existed," John Patton, 
director of the county's resource management division, said in a statement. "We 
have analyzed the facts, and it's clear to us that for February, refineries in 
L.A. have adequate crude supplies." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to G. Michael Marcy, a Chevron spokesman, Tuesday's decision by 
county officials was ill-researched and ill-conceived. He also said Chevron has 
no other economically feasible way to move the oil. Other Four Corners 
pipelines to Los Angeles are overcrowded, and sending the crude oil in other 
pipelines to other locations was not economically viable, given the depressed 
oil market. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Santa Barbara County officials need a refresher class in Economics 101," 
Marcy said. "I think their decision was a product of a cultural bias against 
our company that we have had to deal with regardless of the concessions, 
mitigations and environmental protections we have proposed throughout the 
history of this project. This is nothing but an arbitrary decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Chevron and its Point Arguello Project corporate partners are 
producing about 80,000 barrels of crude oil a day from their offshore fields 
northwest of Santa Barbara -- fields that contain an estimated 300 million to 
600 million barrels of oil. If necessary, the companies can store about 800,000 
barrels of crude. If that capacity is reached, Marcy said, the company will 
reduce oil production at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate defeat for Chevron on Tuesday, State Lands Commission officials 
said that even if Santa Barbara County had approved the emergency permit, the 
oil company would not have been able to ship oil from the state-owned Gaviota 
Interim Marine Terminal because it failed to meet the Feb. 1 deadline in the 
Coastal Commission tankering permit issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy offered several explanations for the company's failure to keep the 
permit it had fought for a decade to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 During much of 1993, the company was working on such a deal with Huntington 
Beach-based Cajon Pipeline Co. but broke off negotiations in December after 
failing to agree on terms or a route for the line, which is slated to run from 
the Barstow area to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron instead has chosen to pursue development of the Pacific Pipeline, an 
oil conduit proposed to run directly south from Kern County to company 
refineries in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Marcy said Chevron is negotiating with Pacific Pipeline Co. officials on a 
deal. But the pipeline company has not yet secured regulatory and construction 
permits. If it does -- possibly by this summer -- Chevron will reapply for 
permits to resume tankering, Marcy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company's 17th and last load of crude oil, an estimated 250,000 
barrels, was shipped out of Gaviota Jan. 31 aboard the Chevron tanker Oregon, 
Marcy said.
