 Just another Hollywood remake: While lawyers for the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce are trying to stamp out rival walks of fame -- such as Huntington 
Beach's new Surf Walk of Fame -- historian Ken Schessler has made an 
interesting discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that the book "Famous First Facts" states that the original walk 
of fame was established in 1929 at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla. -- 30 
years before Hollywood got the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 We phoned Rollins, and spokeswoman Ann Mikell said the school's shrine is 
still going strong. "This year we honored Maya Angelou," Mikell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than consisting of glitzy stars, the Rollins walkway is made up of 
stones, rocks and bricks from the homes of more than 600 people, including such 
historical figures as William Shakespeare, Christopher Columbus, George 
Washington and Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really have any Hollywood-type personalities," Mikell said. "The 
closest might be Fred Rogers (TV's Mister Rogers). He graduated from here." 
</P>
<P>
 One other thing: Mikell said that Rollins College has no plans to demand that 
Hollywood shut down its Johnny-come-lately Walk of Fame.

 What's in a street name: West Los Angeles Drive and East Los Angeles Drive are 
two legs of the same street in a crime-ridden section of Vista, a northern San 
Diego County city. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident recently suggested that some new names for the two might reduce 
crime. So, the City Council has decided to survey residents of East Los Angeles 
Drive to see if they would favor their street being re-christened Vista 
Townsite Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 And West L.A. Drive? It will remain unchanged, reported Randy Dotinga in the 
Times Advocate of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a negative connotation when I hear 'West Los Angeles,' " 
explained Councilman Ted Cole.

 Money-making postal ideas: Sounds like a contradiction in terms, we know. 
After all, the U.S. Postal Service had to be practically dragged kicking and 
screaming into issuing an Elvis stamp -- its biggest seller ever (bringing in 
$36 million last year). 
</P>
<P>
 Postal services in several other countries had already immortalized the King. 
And, now, they are capitalizing on other American stars shunned by the Postal 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna is featured in stamps put out by the nations of Gambia, St. Vincent 
and Grenada. 
</P>
<P>
 A Marilyn Monroe stamp? Well, you can write Tanzania for one. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's a Bad Actors Series you wish to start, Sierra Leone has Sylvester 
Stallone in "Rocky III" while Grenada has Dolly Parton, Madonna and Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 Or if you want to begin a Celebrities- Who've-Died-in-L.A. Series, you could 
combine Marilyn Monroe with Grenada's tribute to glum-faced singer Janis 
Joplin. The latter is a 90-cent stamp, in Eastern Caribbean dollars, of course. 
But because her first name is misspelled "Janice," it's probably worth at least 
$1.80.

SCOTT HARRIS: LEGISLATING THE FINE LINE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon tells it, he is fighting for your right to 
bring a Bible to work, or wear a Star of David, or bow toward Mecca, or take a 
break to chant nam myoho renge kyo.  
</P>
<P>
 And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he suggests, doesn't seem to 
understand the difference between a guy inviting a colleague to Sunday services 
and a guy suggesting a rendezvous at the nearest No-tell Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I'm paraphrasing. The Republican from Santa Clarita is too much of a 
gentleman to put it in such bawdy terms. Instead, he states his case in House 
Resolution 446, urging the EEOC to remove religion from its new guidelines 
concerning harassment in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 To this devout Mormon, the resolution has become a mission. He's lined up 170 
co-sponsors, including 30 Democrats. He was thrilled when the Senate backed a 
like-minded resolution by the resounding margin of 94-0. The freshman 
congressman seemed to have a written a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And then a few days ago, an aide showed him a "Dear Colleague" letter signed 
by three House Democrats and one Republican. They urged members to oppose 
McKeon's resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In this ambivalent land of liberty that frowns on prayer in public schools, 
yet still prints "In God We Trust" on its legal tender, the line that separates 
church and state is easily blurred. Sometimes there's no telling where the 
politics of religion ends and the religion of politics begins. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon and his allies, and those who oppose his resolution, agree that people 
should be both free from religious harassment and free to express their own 
religious beliefs insofar as their actions don't infringe on the rights of 
others. They disagree on the means to that end. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, McKeon says, is that the EEOC has now essentially expanded upon 
court standards used for sexual harassment that hold employers accountable for 
creating a "hostile environment" in the workplace. Remember, it was the fear of 
a "hostile environment" that prompted county officials to ban Playboy magazine 
from fire stations -- a decision an Antelope Valley firefighter fought in court 
and won. 
</P>
<P>
 When McKeon saw the EEOC guidelines, he didn't think of Playboy -- he wondered 
about religious symbols. Would atheists have a case in protesting the painting 
on his office wall that depicts George Washington kneeling in prayer in the 
snows of Valley Forge? 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him if the thought that religious proselytizing might be considered 
harassment may be particularly offensive to a member of a church that 
emphasizes missionary work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking at this as a Mormon, but I don't know how you separate that, 
because that's who I am," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion has certainly shaped the battle lines. Early on, Rep. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City), who is Jewish, signed McKeon's initial letter to the EEOC, 
but later disavowed the letter, saying his own actions were careless. Noting a 
history of discrimination, some Jewish groups have opposed McKeon's resolution 
as a weakening of protections. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon points out that Mormons have their own history of persecution and 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't like the label "religious right," McKeon points out that 
some Christian conservatives opposed him in his first campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponent said I wasn't a Christian," he says. "I know what religious 
harassment means. . . . I think most Mormons do." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon insists that his resolution won't weaken protections. Existing laws, he 
says, do a good job of protecting against religious discrimination and 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like looking at a glass and saying it's half empty or it's half full," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon must be seeing it as half full these days. Recently, the House, by a 
366-37 margin, approved an amendment that for one year denies funding for the 
enforcement of the EEOC religious harassment guidelines. He seems optimistic 
that he'll persuade a committee to hold hearings on the EEOC guidelines. And it 
didn't hurt that the Washington Post, not known for its conservative 
editorials, recently agreed that the EEOC needed to rethink its views on 
religious expression. 
</P>
<P>
 If McKeon prevails, he'll have overcome the fact that the controversial Rev. 
Louis Sheldon, leader of the Traditional Values Coalition, first alerted him to 
the guidelines. Sheldon is a firebrand of the Christian right. To many 
liberals, he's the epitome of intolerance -- and anything he's for must be a 
bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buck McKeon doesn't want people to think House Resolution 446 is Sheldon's 
handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I just have a chance to talk to people . . . " this missionary says. "If I 
could just make them see where I'm coming from."

THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JOB; SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS NOT RELEVANT IN EMPLOYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are denied a job because of your race, religion or gender, legal 
remedies are available to you. The law is on your side. But if you are denied a 
job because of your sexual orientation, you are without legal remedy in 42 of 
the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal remedies would be unnecessary, of course, if discrimination did not 
occur. But it does occur. When Barbara Boxer was elected to the Senate in 1992, 
Peter Teague moved from San Francisco to Washington to take a position on her 
staff. His companion, a lawyer with a thriving practice, went with him 
expecting to find work easily. Interviews with law firms went well until the 
inevitable question about why the move had taken place. The answer cooled the 
initial warmth to "Don't call us, we'll call you." Teague's partner now has a 
job, thanks at least in part to a District of Columbia law that forbids job 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. California has such an 
anti-discrimination law too. 
</P>
<P>
 But can protection against job discrimination be extended to all homosexuals 
as a matter of federal statute? Last month the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an 
organization defending gay and lesbian equality at the federal level, announced 
that it had written confirmation from 71 of the 100 U.S. senators that they 
would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation when hiring for their 
Senate offices; 234 of 435 U.S. representatives have made the same promise. 
</P>
<P>
 These promises undoubtedly reflect the legislators' conscience on this matter. 
They should vote their consciences when the Employment Nondiscrimination Act 
comes before them later this summer. This legislation, which has 32 sponsors in 
the Senate and 107 in the House, exempts small businesses, religious 
organizations and the military. It requires no quotas or preferential treatment 
of any kind. It does not require that employers pay spousal benefits for 
same-sex partners. It merely requires that no one be denied employment because 
of sexual orientation.  
</P>
<P>
 People should be hired or fired on the basis of their work. The Times urges 
swift approval of this modest and reasonable measure.

TWO TIERS TOO MANY?; VOTERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE ON CALIFORNIA COURT 
CONSOLIDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the budget agreement behind them, state lawmakers are now turning to 
other lingering but no less momentous issues before their summer break. One of 
those is reform of California's trial court system. While not generally the 
stuff of headlines, the outcome of a protracted debate among lawmakers may 
nonetheless have an enormous impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly will decide, perhaps today, whether to place on the November 
ballot a proposed constitutional amendment that would streamline the state's 
trial courts. It should do so, allowing the voters to ultimately decide on the 
wisdom of this proposal, known as SCA 3.  
</P>
<P>
 California's Constitution created a three-tier trial court system. Civil 
litigants file in justice courts (which remain only in isolated rural areas), 
in municipal or superior courts. Criminal cases are filed in municipal or 
superior court depending on the severity of the charges; misdemeanors are heard 
in municipal court, felonies in superior. 
</P>
<P>
 But if this sounds straightforward it's not. This tiered trial court system 
has grown unwieldy and, in the view of many, has spawned duplication of 
services and unneeded litigation and public cost.  
</P>
<P>
 SCA 3 would unify the trial courts. Municipal and justice courts would cease 
to exist; judges in those courts would become superior court judges and 
superior courts would become the only state trial courts of general 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has much to recommend it. In response to past legislative mandates, 
trial courts have begun to coordinate administratively so as to use money and 
staffs more efficiently. Yet the tiered system of courts remains underfunded 
and overburdened. Full unification offers the prospect of long-term savings and 
greater efficiency.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposals to unify the courts have been around for years. The idea is not 
without problems -- many sitting superior court judges understandably resist 
the notion of hearing lesser matters currently handled by municipal court 
judges. Moreover, the measure could mean a significant boost in 
taxpayer-financed pay for existing municipal judges. Other states have 
undergone or are in the midst of court unification, including Utah, 
Connecticut, Minnesota, North Dakota and Iowa. California voters should have 
the chance to decide whether to follow their lead.

CAN'T WE STICK WITH THIS POLICY?; NO MORE WAFFLING ON HAITI, PLEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 12,500 Haitians fleeing their homeland have been picked up at sea by 
American vessels in the last 12 days, according to U.S. immigration officials. 
No one is sure how many more may have perished during the same period in trying 
to make the journey to Florida in small boats. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only conjecture how much of the refugee influx stems from deprivation 
caused by tougher U.S. economic sanctions against the military regime in 
Port-au-Prince or from government repression in the island nation or from 
liberalized U.S. asylum procedures for fleeing Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, President Clinton has only himself to blame for 
prolonging this crisis. He has gone back and forth on Haiti since he was a 
political candidate two years ago running against then-President George Bush. 
Clinton criticized U.S. policy on Haiti, then kept practically the same policy 
in place after becoming President. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently he changed course again, loosening asylum procedures when prominent 
African Americans criticized his Haiti policy. But now that the new asylum 
policy is being linked to an increase in refugees he appears tempted to back 
away from it. This month he announced that refugees encountered at sea will not 
be brought to U.S. shores but rather taken to refugee camps at the U.S. naval 
base in Cuba, in Panama or in other third countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The shifts would be almost humorous were it not for the severe suffering they 
cause the Haitian people. After finally enunciating a clear, firm policy of 
harder sanctions, Clinton must stick to it or it will have precious little 
effect where it most counts -- among the military thugs who control the 
government in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real solution to the long Haitian crisis is for that illegitimate 
regime to allow exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return and govern 
the nation that overwhelmingly elected him. Aristide would still face a 
daunting task in bringing democracy and development to a nation that has had 
precious little of either in its history; however, he at least would have the 
support of most of his people and of the United Nations, which has been in the 
forefront of diplomatic efforts to persuade the Haitian military to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 While not pretty, nor particularly encouraging in the short term, the upsurge 
in Haitian refugees is just the most visible effect of Clinton's 
get-tough-with-Haiti policy. If he and his advisers are patient and give this 
approach a full chance, it just might work. And for now it is surely preferable 
to the unpleasant alternatives: a U.S. invasion to restore Aristide or 
acceptance of the cynical status quo.

REBUILDING WATCH; ROAD WARRIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The interchange between the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways at the 
northernmost city limit of Los Angeles was a sweeping, 12-story feat of 
engineering. As such, it was hardly surprising that photographs of its 
collapsed sections are among the most enduring images of the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This was where Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle officer Clarence Wayne 
Dean plunged to his death. Later, the interchange was the cause of the worst 
commuting nightmares stemming from the quake, including one detour (eight hours 
for a round trip) that gained international attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening of the interchange's most important segments, set for the close 
of rush hour on Friday morning, is another reassuring sign of our recovery. 
Southbound Antelope Valley Freeway travelers (I-14) will again be able to 
switch to the southbound Golden State (I-5). Those headed north along the I-5 
will be able to connect to the northbound I-14. 
</P>
<P>
 This comes as a welcome bit of transportation news in the midst of what can 
only be considered a deluge of lousy developments. It was just last week, for 
example, that state transportation officials announced that 1,364 more highway 
overpasses will need to be retrofitted to withstand a major earthquake. More 
than 300 of those are in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, however, it's time to applaud the work done to reopen the 
area's third quake-damaged freeway artery -- it, too, ahead of schedule. At the 
very least, it's one less thing for Southern Californians to fret over.

GUN RIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your editorial, "Nuts over Guns," June 23: 
</P>
<P>
 You asked, "When will America get the message?" What message are you referring 
to? The message that no one can be held responsible for his or her actions, 
that there is always someone or something else (a gun) to blame? It is a fact 
that drunken drivers kill people. Usually, the alcohol is blamed.But we don't 
blame the instrument, the auto. When O.J. Simpson's ex-wife and her friend were 
savagely slaughtered, there was no outcry to ban long, serrated knives.  
</P>
<P>
 It is already a major crime to murder someone, whether by car, by gun or by 
knife. The law does not stop the crime. Gun bans do not work. Ask anyone in the 
nation's capital. You stated that you do not want more Spokane-style tragedies. 
Any responsible, law-abiding citizen does not want that either. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of future we as responsible citizens see, is the kind of future where 
we don't need guns for defense against the bad guys, because the bad guys are 
gone. Gun owners are not the problem.

JOB PROGRAMS FOR WELFARE FAMILIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "When Welfare Works," editorial, June 26: 
</P>
<P>
 We should pride ourselves for the success the GAIN (Greater Avenues to 
Independence) program achieved. It is time to remove the bandage and face the 
real issue. There will always be free riders who will not accept low wages or 
those who prefer to stay home with children rather than earning their living. 
</P>
<P>
 We should provide incentives for the poor, single mothers and school dropouts 
to learn a profession, earn their own living and be productive. Convenient 
training centers should be established in the community, with child-care 
facilities, using volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra financial rewards should be given to those who successfully complete 
each training phase. We should also provide placement assistance to those who 
graduate. In the long run everyone wins, especially the government, which can 
save those billions spent on welfare.

 * Welfare reform has become a hot topic for politicians and newspapers alike 
(editorial, June 19). What will it take for your editorial staff to realize 
that California already has enacted much of what President Clinton has only 
proposed? The main difference between California's reform and Clinton's 
proposed program is the extraordinary price tag of the Washington proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag of developing and maintaining a monolithic federal bureaucracy 
versus a state-run program is just too high and will be less likely to succeed 
due to special peculiarities of each state.

 * I am a 22-year-old single mother. I am a welfare recipient who is absolutely 
dependent on public transportation. It is often with a dark amusement that I 
read the articles on welfare reform and the continuing debates with the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority concerning "proposed" (meaning they've 
already decided to do it) fare hikes. It is with abject horror, however, that I 
read some of your reader comments and editorial pieces. I get up and go look 
for work every day just like all other unemployed people, but I can't pick up 
the paper without being informed that I am "lazy" either by implication or 
directly.  
</P>
<P>
 As far as Franklin White and the MTA board go, they don't seem to realize that 
by raising fares and getting rid of monthly passes, people like myself can only 
look for employment until their money runs out. Believe me, that doesn't take 
very long at all. I only get $490 per month with Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children. Out of that I pay my rent, a baby-sitter (so I can look for 
employment and pursue my education) and bills. If it weren't for bus passes I 
would have no means of transportation two weeks out of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not in love with welfare and am working feverishly to be free of this 
demeaning system. Nor do I appreciate the upcoming kick in the teeth by the 
MTA. All I want is to be treated fairly and as an individual, but I forget that 
is only for the rich in this county.

ITALIAN POPULATION BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Italians' Baby Boom Goes Bust," by William Montalbano (June 24), was quite 
interesting. Though we could quibble about whether Italy's total fertility rate 
of 1.3 is the lowest in the world, an honor that may currently go to Spain with 
its 1.2, the more important thing to note is that fertility in most of Europe, 
and in Japan as well, is substantially below the replacement level of 2.1. 
Furthermore, the United States is just right at that 2.1 figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is not complete agreement about why fertility has fallen so low 
in most of the world's economically advanced areas, some of the consequences 
are made quite clear by Montalbano -- aging populations, rising costs for 
health care and pensions, and a growing demand for labor, which, in Italy, as 
well as elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, is increasingly being 
supplied by immigration from less developed countries, which collectively have 
a total fertility rate of 3.6, and in some individual cases total fertility 
rates that exceed 7.0. In our species, economic success seems to be coupled 
with reproductive failure, a seemingly un-Darwinian phenomenon, but one that is 
going to reshape the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Just as Montalbano cites the rapid growth of places like Nigeria and Morocco, 
we can note also that the population of Latin America, now about 470 million, 
will, at current growth rates, double to 940 million over the next 35 years. 
Figuratively speaking, there is little difference between the Mediterranean and 
the Rio Grande -- globalizing economies, rapid improvements in communications 
and transportation, and a growing supply of labor in the less developed 
countries will work together to ensure that immigration will remain a major 
feature of life in the world's developed countries for the next few decades no 
matter how individuals may feel about it or what moves we make to slow it.

 * Montalbano explains how in 30 years the Moroccan population will grow from 
26 million to 47 million, Nigeria from 115 million to 285 and Iran from 61 to 
144 million. Then he explains that many will immigrate to Italy, legally or 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy should be praised and used as an example. Even fish in the oceans are 
becoming scarce, farmland is getting worn out, air and water are polluted and 
forests are being destroyed in much of the world. The earth's resources are not 
infinite, starvation is terrible and crowding brings on fighting. We must 
encourage smaller families.

'RULE OF THUMB' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phrase "rule of thumb," according to The Times' editorial of June 24, "is 
said to spring from the old English common law that allowed a man to beat his 
wife with a rod no thicker than his thumb." An intriguing notion, this, but 
totally spurious.No such principle is to be found in English law. This myth is 
being widely cited in print and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that the phrase has always carried the prosaic meaning attributed 
to it by the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary: "A method or procedure 
derived entirely from practice or experience; a roughly practical method." The 
campaign against spousal abuse is critically important, and is only diminished 
by attaching historical fantasies like this to it.

PLATFORM; A SPECIAL CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Los Angeles police received 45,000 domestic-violence calls on the 911 line 
last year. ROBERTA IKEMI, staff attorney of the California Women's Law Center, 
comments: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Other than continued beatings, nothing is more daunting to the victim of 
domestic violence than the horrifying realization that when she finally turns 
to the system for help, it is ill-equipped to assist and often does not 
understand her problem. Worse, her problem is dealt with as if it is less 
serious than other assault crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to its credit, the LAPD has embarked on establishing a "major assaults 
and crimes table" in each precinct. The so-called MAC table includes 
investigation of spousal violence as part of a possibly larger pattern of 
family violence. We need to support these efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 One project being discussed in legal circles is the establishment of 
domestic-violence courts to deal with the overwhelming caseload and the 
intricate pathology that leads to these crimes. Such a court would be in a 
position to get quick restraining orders, find violators in contempt and help 
victims connect with legal and social support services. And a court staffed by 
experts and dedicated solely to this crime would be less likely to let victims 
fall between the cracks.

PERSPECTIVE ON COLOMBIA; THE SCORE: DRUG LORDS 1, SPORTS 0; A NATION STRUGGLING 
TO OVERCOME ITS VIOLENT REPUTATION IS STUNNED BY THE SLAYING OF SOCCER STAR 
ANDRES ESCOBAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIRO A. MARIN, Jairo A. Marin is a television producer for KMEX, Channel 
34, in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brutal assassination of soccer star Andres Escobar is painful to me, as it 
is to the vast majority of Colombians, and not just at the loss of life of the 
brilliant young player. It is painful also because soccer had become a positive 
force in the midst of the nation's collective depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans probably don't understand why soccer is so important to Colombians, 
or why we would go to the extreme of executing one of our greatest athletes for 
a simple accident -- kicking the ball into his own goal -- on the playing 
field. Make no mistake about it, we are deeply saddened, because soccer 
represented for many our last hope to recover in international image 
deteriorated perhaps beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last weeks, for the first time in many years, people did not mention 
the word cocaine when they discovered I was from Colombia. Instead they talked 
about the Colombian team in the World Cup competition, they asked about the 
player with the "long curly blond hair" and about our chances of going to the 
finals. Not any more. The break is over. 
</P>
<P>
 The images of a violent, unsafe country, corrupted by drug cartels, represents 
losses of billions of dollars in potential investments and international aid, 
as well as discouraging tourism. Independent of the financial repercussions of 
this negative image, the country has witnessed so much violence at all levels 
of society, that the collective mood of the country has been one of permanent 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of this chaos and corruption, we Colombians saw recent 
constitutional reforms as the opportunity to transform the country and give 
back confidence in our social institutions. These reforms, among other things, 
were to have defined a legal framework under which drug lords could surrender 
to justice. Nevertheless, a recent U.S. State Department report summarized a 
widely held sentiment in Colombia: Our constitution may have changed on paper, 
but in practice, chaos and corruption still reign. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing of Andres Escobar is simply the latest chapter in a long drama of 
hopeful expectations dashed by tragic disappointment. For example, the 
surrender of drug lord Pablo Escobar (no relation to Andres) was widely seen as 
the light at the end of the tunnel. When Escobar escaped, Colombians lost any 
hope that this spelled the end of the Medellin cartel. The recapture and 
killing of Pablo Escobar was shown to the world as the success of law and 
order. It was not long before it was evident that the drug business was up and 
running without him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of this sad picture, Colombians put great faith in their soccer 
team. Players like Escobar, Carlos Valderrama and coach Francisco Maturana 
became national heroes and the World Cup a dream, potent medicine for a country 
that has lacked positive role models for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 But no exception was made for the Colombian soccer team simply because it was 
competing on the international scene: It received the same death threats and 
assassination attempts the country has seen for years. Despite the fact that 
Andres Escobar was one of the finest athletes the country had to offer, he was 
executed like the judges, presidential candidates and journalists before him, 
in a country that seems to know no limits to violence.

COLUMN LEFT/ JAMES LAFFERTY: PUBLIC DEFENSE FOR EVERYBODY EQUALS JUSTICE; A 
CRIMINAL CASE IS THE CONCERN OF ALL. FAIRNESS SHOULDN'T REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO 
PAY EXPERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES LAFFERTY, James Lafferty is executive vice president of the National 
Lawyers Guild and executive director of its Los Angeles chapter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simpson case, more than most, exposes the degree to which our 
criminal-justice system falls short in its commitment to the American principle 
of "equal justice for all." We pride ourselves on providing the fairest 
criminal-justice system in the world. But just how "equal" is it really? 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with two homicides, O.J. Simpson is pulling out all stops to defend 
himself. His defense team must be finding it hard to locate a conference room 
big enough to meet in. And I'm not just talking about the highly paid, 
high-profile lawyers. There also are the forensic experts, the law clerks, the 
private investigators, the public-relations people, the psychologists and who 
knows how many others. Simpson is said to be worth $10 million. Preliminary 
estimates of his legal fees start at $1 million. Certainly if I found myself in 
Simpson's shoes and had his money, I would spend no less. 
</P>
<P>
 But that leads right to the point. I don't have Simpson's money and neither do 
99% of others in this country charged with homicide. Your run-of-the-mill 
homicide defendant can't pay the rent while in jail awaiting trial, let alone 
hire a roomful of fancy lawyers and forensic experts to get him out of jail and 
keep him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I recognize that the district attorney's office, while perhaps unable to 
match Simpson dollar-for-dollar, still will spend a hefty amount of the 
taxpayer's purse trying to convict Simpson. Indeed, the district attorney's 
office has far more resources at its disposal than do 99% of the other murder 
suspects it prosecutes each year. In this regard, as in so many others, 
Simpson's situation is unique and unequal. 
</P>
<P>
 If we really believe in "equal justice for all," we ought to take steps to 
change the equation between the resources of the "have" defendants and the 
"have-not" defendants," as well as between all defendants and their 
prosecutors. We must level the playing field. Here's how we can:  
</P>
<P>
 We can create a system under which everyone charged with a crime, be they rich 
or poor, is defended by a state-provided attorney. Currently, we maintain a 
public-defender program only for those too poor to hire private counsel. If we 
were to require all defendants to be represented through such a program we 
would, of course, need more public defenders. We can solve this by adding staff 
to the current public-defender programs and by requiring private lawyers who 
regularly practice criminal law to defend at least one felony criminal case 
each year for which they receive no compensation. In this way, the wealthy 
defendant, like Simpson, would receive the same quality and quantity of 
representation that the poor defendant now receives -- representation which is, 
by the way, generally excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we must level the playing field between prosecutor and defendant by 
allowing defendants' public defenders to spend as much money defending their 
clients as the prosecutor spends prosecuting them. If the prosecution decides 
to hire experts who must be paid out of the public coffers, the defense should 
be entitled to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 But, you may argue, why should a rich man like Simpson be denied the right to 
spend his wealth any way he wishes, including on a stable full of high-priced 
criminal lawyers and experts? Isn't what Simpson spends on his defense a 
private matter? No, it isn't. A criminal case is not a private matter; it's a 
public matter in which the state has charged one of its residents with having 
committed a crime against the state. The criminal-justice system is not a new 
automobile. It's one thing to say that the rich have the right to buy a Rolls 
Royce rather than a Chevy. It's quite another to say that the rich have the 
right to buy their way out of a prison sentence that the rest of us cannot 
afford to buy out of -- to buy an unequal measure of justice.  
</P>
<P>
 So long as we are content to let the fairness and equality of our 
criminal-justice system be determined by the wealth of the accused, we have no 
right to say that ours is a nation committed to "equal justice for all."

COLUMN RIGHT/ DOUG BANDOW: ANOTHER CRISIS OF PRESIDENTIAL WAR-MAKING; AN 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL SLIDE TOWARD COMBAT WITH HAITI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG BANDOW, Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former 
special assistant to President Reagan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration seems to be slowly sliding toward war with Haiti. 
The goal, to restore democracy, sounds noble, but the means would be brutal: 
invading and occupying another sovereign state. Moreover, the constitutional 
power to decide to do so lies with Congress, not the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that modern chief executives admit to many limitations on their war-making 
power. In the fall of 1990, for instance, George Bush stated that he didn't 
think he needed congressional approval before attacking Iraq. He only 
reluctantly accepted Congress' plan to vote and the lawmakers' narrow 
endorsement of war avoided a serious constitutional crisis. But Bill Clinton is 
now similarly contemplating war without legislative assent. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, few issues where the language of the U.S. Constitution, 
intentions of the framers and historical record are clearer. The American 
colonists consciously avoided the European model of all-powerful executives 
when they created their new system. Article 1 of the Constitution states that 
"Congress shall have the power . . . to declare war." The President is to 
fulfill his responsibilities as commander in chief within the framework 
established by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 James Madison wrote in 1793 that it is necessary to adhere to the "fundamental 
doctrine of the Constitution that the power to declare war is fully and 
exclusively vested in the legislature." Delegates changed Congress' authority 
from "make' to "declare" war, explained Madison, only to allow the President 
the authority to respond to a sudden attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Delegates rejected a proposal to give the President the power to start war. 
Explained Virginia's George Mason: The President "is not safely to be entrusted 
with" the power to decide on war. Mason favored "clogging rather than 
facilitating war." James Wilson, though an advocate of a strong presidency, 
approvingly observed that the new constitutional system "will not hurry us into 
war." Similarly, Thomas Jefferson wrote that "we have already given . . . one 
effectual check to the dog of war by transferring the power of letting him 
loose." Even nationalist Alexander Hamilton agreed with his long-time adversary 
on this point. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of expansive executive war power -- oddly enough, including some who 
claim to believe in a jurisprudence of "original intent" -- nevertheless have 
come up with a number of reasons to give the President unrestrained authority 
to act. One is that he must be able to use the military for "defensive" 
purposes. True, but defensive means defensive: At the Constitutional 
Convention, Roger Sherman of Connecticut stated that "the executive should be 
able to repel and not to commence war." If President Clinton wants to 
"commence" war to overthrow Haiti's ruling regime, he must go to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Another argument is that it is impractical to involve the legislative branch 
in foreign affairs. But Congress' vote in January of 1991 proves the contrary. 
While 535 legislators cannot direct the course of an attack on Haiti or 
anywhere else, they can decide whether or not the nation should go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would a congressional debate tip off the Cedras junta as to the timing of 
any potential military action. Congress has four times approved conditional 
declarations of war, authorizing the President to use force if certain 
objectives were not achieved. In three instances, the executive branch 
peacefully resolved the disputes; in the fourth, war ensued after Spain refused 
Congress' demand that it withdraw from Cuba. Following these precedents, the 
President could ask Congress to authorize the use of force if Haiti's military 
rulers do not yield power after some reasonable period of time.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, proponents of executive war-making contend that ample precedent, 200 
or more troop deployments without congressional approval, exists for the 
President to unilaterally initiate hostilities. Most of these were minor 
skirmishes, however, offering no justification for conquering another nation. 
And the fact that past chief executives acted lawlessly does not empower the 
current one to do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no more important issue than war and peace. Should young Americans 
die to "restore" democracy in a nation with no democratic tradition? We need a 
broad national debate to answer this question. Indeed, the President can 
scarcely talk of respecting democracy in Haiti if he does not follow the U.S. 
Constitution by asking Congress to vote first. And if he refuses to ask, 
Congress should schedule a vote now, well before an invasion is under way. 
Given the recent record of presidential misbehavior, it is important for 
Congress to maintain what Jefferson called the Constitution's "check to the dog 
of war."

IT'S WELFARE POLITICS VS. GROWTH ECONOMICS; ECONOMY: THE WORLD'S LEADING 
DEMOCRACIES MUST MAKE SOME HARD CHOICES BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER GUARANTEE 
PROSPERITY AND SECURITY TO ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news for the "economic summit" -- convening in Italy this weekend -- 
is that the major industrial countries have embarked on a modest recovery. 
After a two-year slump, Europe's economy seems to be growing at a 2 1/2% to 3% 
annual rate. Japan shows faint signs of recovery, and the U.S. expansion 
continues. The bad news is that a normal recovery won't cure the deeper 
problems of these rich democracies. All face a collision between welfare 
politics and growth economics.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost no one wants unfettered free markets; but rigid markets suffocate 
economic growth. Politics specializes in distributing benefits and protecting 
people against hardship. By contrast, strong economic growth requires that 
people take risks and adapt to change. The democratic dilemma is that voters 
everywhere expect their governments to deliver both prosperity and security. 
This is a hard, often impossible, feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe, where joblessness is now approaching 12%, has coped least well. 
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * In France, the combination of a high minimum wage and steep payroll taxes 
makes it nearly twice as costly for companies to hire low-skilled workers as in 
the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 * In Italy, companies can hire only from state employment agencies and must 
hire 15% of workers from a list of "disabled" and another 12% from a list of 
"disadvantaged".  
</P>
<P>
 * Payroll taxes -- to finance unemployment, health, disability and pension 
programs -- are as high as 30% to 50% of wages. (The U.S. rate is 15.3%.) There 
are also big mandated labor costs. France requires seven weeks of paid time 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 * By U.S. standards, unemployment benefits are high and last much longer. In 
some countries (Spain, Denmark), workers receive about 70% of lost wages; In 
the United States, the rate is about 25%.  
</P>
<P>
 * In the Netherlands, disability laws are so generous and lax that one-seventh 
of the labor force receives disability payments, though the Dutch are no less 
healthy than anyone else.  
</P>
<P>
 Social justice is not advanced by foolish economics. If you make it too 
expensive to hire people, companies won't. If you pay people not to work, they 
won't. The damage is not done by any one policy; it is the collective impact of 
many costly policies. In Europe, there has been little net private job creation 
in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the problem is different. Export-led growth is no longer workable, 
because Japan's huge trade surpluses have pushed up the yen's value -- and made 
Japanese cars, machinery and electronics more expensive. In 1994, Japanese 
exports will grow only 1%. The imbalance in foreign-exchange markets (as 
exporters change dollars for yen) raises the yen's value. This will continue 
until Japan increases its imports by stronger domestic spending and more open 
markets.  
</P>
<P>
 There's the rub. Domestic spending is hobbled. A cumbersome distribution 
system raises consumer prices. Inefficient farmers produce expensive foods and 
oppose imports. Cartels collude on prices and restrict imports. Zoning laws 
raise land values and impede housing construction. These practices dampen 
domestic spending but enhance the well-being of strong vested interests. 
Japan's brand of welfare politics protects these privileges. The effect is to 
subvert economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 There are lessons for the United States -- and they are mostly ignored. The 
Clinton Administration acts as if it can enact a new tax here and a new program 
there without having any effect on the economy. It proposes a massive new 
payroll tax in the form of mandated employer-paid health insurance. The spirit 
in Congress is similar. There's little recognition that, as in Europe and 
Japan, the rising burdens of government may accumulate over time and slowly sap 
the economy's vitality.  
</P>
<P>
 What unites the leaders of the seven major nations at the summit (the United 
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada) is a reluctance to 
face these problems. But the danger of avoiding them is creating a vicious 
circle of slowing growth and rising political conflict. As growth falters, the 
cost of government welfare rises. This increases tax rates or budget deficits, 
which further impedes growth. Governments are then torn between breaking 
promises (by withdrawing benefits) and suffocating their economies (by 
maintaining existing policies).  
</P>
<P>
 Europe is already caught in this trap. Governments are striving to reduce 
budget deficits and spur economic growth by trimming some welfare benefits. But 
the cutbacks are small and unpopular, precisely because people are so used to 
being protected. Sweden recently lengthened the waiting period for "sick" 
benefits by a day. Absenteeism dropped sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 What leaders in Europe, Japan and the United States should do (but aren't) is 
to use the economic recovery to eliminate the least justifiable government 
spending and regulations. These changes are hard now, but they will be much 
harder later. The welfare state has become too much a part of the social fabric 
of too many nations. But someone has to save the welfare state from itself. If 
its excesses aren't curbed, it will become its own worst enemy.

 The company also makes a hot Mexicali version in which red chiles have been 
added to the brine. And, seasonally, usually July through December, pickled 
green tomatoes are available in both flavors. The pickles are not cheap, 
though. At $13 for a half-gallon, these pickles are only for very particularly

WINE: VIOGNIER: RARE AND RATTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hot summer wind blew the aroma of dried grass into the tent and warmed our 
glasses of Viognier, making it difficult to detect the nuances of peach, 
apricot, pear and spices in this unique wine. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second annual View From the Vineyards symposium staged by the 
Viognier Guild, a fledgling organization currently composed of producers of 
this ratty grape variety, which seems to have no respect for the grower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organization," in fact, may be an overstatement. The guild was solely the 
idea of Mat Garretson, a wine lover from Dunwoodie, Ga. Garretson had no ties 
to the industry (he worked in a family business dealing in contract liquid 
aerosol products), but he loved wine made from the Viognier grape so much that 
he announced formation of the guild early in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the guild had one member: himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first symposium was held May 8, 1993, in Georgia. Among the attendees was 
John Alban, owner of Alban Vineyards in Arroyo Grande, whose 32 1/2 acres of 
Viognier in Edna Valley is the largest planting of the variety in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In counting Viognier, every fraction of an acre is important. For all the 
enthusiasm it is generating among winemakers, astoundingly little land is 
planted with Viognier. 
</P>
<P>
 When she wrote her book "Vines, Grapes and Wine" in 1986, Jancis Robinson 
noted that there were no more than 80 acres of Viognier in the world -- most of 
it in the area of the Rhone Valley near the town of Condrieu. That has changed 
significantly, though Viognier acreage is still puny compared with even a grape 
as obscure as Muller-Thurgau. 
</P>
<P>
 The guild estimates that there are now 280 acres of Viognier planted in the 
United States. In southern France, the well-known Beaujolais producer George 
Duboeuf has 270 acres of Viognier in the Ardeche, a huge region west of the 
Rhone. And there are small plantings in Australia and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The grape has no one but itself to blame. Even its most ardent supporters 
consider Viognier a degenerate variety, producing only tiny crops of grapes 
that ripen irregularly and sometimes not at all, no matter how tenderly the 
grower treats them. Sometimes the grapes gain sugar but have no flavor. Its 
wines seem not to age very well, or very long. And it's difficult to make a 
great wine. 
</P>
<P>
 With that as a backdrop, it might seem surprising that more than 150 people 
from around the world, including the Condrieu producer Daniel Vernay, would 
show up on this hot day to sample the product of such an obscure and 
potentially expensive grape. Almost every attendee was affiliated with a 
winery; only a tiny handful were consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Alban tried to sum up the enthusiasm for Viognier when he said: "Truly great 
grapes are as rare as oceanfront property. And Viognier is a great grape." 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson, asked to describe the aroma and taste of a great Viognier, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Start with unrivaled hedonistic pleasure. When you try to describe it, it 
kind of has the aroma of a Riesling but with more spice. And in the mouth it 
has the weight and texture of a Chardonnay, but with even more grip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say it's sort of like Pinot Noir. Both of their aromas are 
so fascinating, both of them have this elusiveness, and both have these 
masochistic fanatics who are trying to make a great (wine from them)." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no worldwide standard for what a great Viognier is unless one uses a 
wine such as Chateau Grillet, one of the smallest appellations in France and a 
wine that I think is ridiculously overpriced at something like $80 a bottle. 
Occasionally the wine does display the peach/spice aroma I seek in Viognier, 
but it seems not to stand the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Grillet's cost, I rarely taste it, and when I have tasted older 
versions, I have been disappointed. Some experts claim to find charm in old 
Viognier, but my best advice is to drink it young. 
</P>
<P>
 That peach/spice element I like in young Viognier is difficult to capture 
unless the winemaker gets exceptional grapes and then treats them gently. Alban 
admits that "few winemakers have the quality of fruit that can let the grapes 
stand on their own." So what has happened in recent years is that many 
winemakers have taken to treating Viognier just like Chardonnay. The result is 
a wine heavier than Chardonnay, with a lot of oak and not enough fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Viognier I tasted at the symposium was the 1993 Alban "Estate 
Bottled" ($28); it had stunning, exotic peach fruit and perfect balance. This 
is the first Alban wine made entirely from his own grapes; clearly it's the 
best yet. 
</P>
<P>
 I also loved the marvelous 1993 Joseph Phelps ($25), with peach and pear notes 
and a trace of vanilla from oak aging. Also exciting was 1993 Kunde Estate 
Winery's version ($18), with a very soft taste but superb spiced aroma. I also 
detected a note of hay but wondered whether that may have come from the scent 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 1993 Calera Viognier ($30) is stylishly complex, with fruit and oak 
playing tag. The 1993 Arrowood Vineyards ($25), with apple and apricot nuances 
and a very rich mouth feel, though higher alcohol (nearly 15%), makes it taste 
a tad hot. 
</P>
<P>
 A real bargain was from Duboeuf's new planting in France, from the 1993 
vintage. Though it was light in the aftertaste, it was fragrant and appealing, 
and at $8 it is worth trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fascinating wines: 1993 Domaine des Aspes from France ($13); 1993 Cline 
Cellars ($17); 1993 Callaway Vineyards ($16); 1992 La Jota Vineyard ($24); 1993 
R. H. Phillips Vineyard ($15/500 milliliters), 1993 Qupe ($25), and 1993 
Preston Vineyards ($18). 
</P>
<P>
 "After the growers and producers, the next group to get excited about any new 
grape are retailers, restaurateurs and critics," said Alban, "and I have never 
seen more jubilant support for a new variety than what they feel for Viognier." 
</P>
<P>
 One Southern California restaurateur doesn't need persuading. Manfred Krankl 
of L.A.'s Campanile is a fanatic for Viognier and pleaded to have his 
restaurant do the lunch for the symposium. His request was granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all need this diversity, even if it is merely to enhance our enjoyment of 
what we already have," concluded Alban. "Maybe this is the first real 
alternative to Chardonnay."

LOW-FAT COOKING: OIL-FREE (ALMOST) PESTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA DEANE, TIMES FOOD STYLIST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To make a great pesto, you need plenty of good oil. Or do you? This version of 
pesto, in addition to the usual basil, garlic and Parmesan, is made with 
artichoke hearts, serrano chiles, olives, lemon juice and parsley. It's 
aromatic and flavorful but has almost no oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe calls for one tablespoon of olive oil, which isn't a lot. But that 
can be omitted if you are looking for a nonfat dip -- the liquid from the 
artichoke hearts is used to thin the sauce enough for dipping or tossing with 
pasta. When served with fresh vegetables, the pesto works as a dip and makes a 
terrific hot-weather appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
 ARTICHOKE PESTO 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 (8 1/2-ounce) can quartered hearts of artichokes 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup Italian parsley leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 4 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 serrano chile, cut in half and seeded 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup ripe olives 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh sliced vegetables, such as carrot sticks, celery sticks, jicama sticks, 
radish roses, sweet red or green pepper strips, broccoli florets or cauliflower 
florets, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Drain artichokes and reserve liquid. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place basil, parsley, cheese, lemon juice, garlic, chile and olive oil in food 
processor or blender and puree. Add reserved artichokes and olives and process 
until mixture is blended but slightly chunky. Stir in enough reserved liquid 
from artichokes to make pesto thin enough for dipping, about 2 to 3 
tablespoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve with fresh sliced vegetables. Makes 1 1/4 cups pesto.

SPONTANEOUS MEALS; CHEF 'S SURPRISE; MEAL STRATEGIES: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A 
PROFESSIONAL CHEF IS LET LOOSE IN A HOME KITCHEN -- WITH NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF 
WHAT'S IN THE PANTRY OR REFRIGERATOR? GOOD COOKING.

By SCHUYLER INGLE, Ingle, co-author of Northwest Bounty: The Extraordinary 
Foods and Wonderful Cooking of the Pacific Northwest (Simon & Schuster), lives 
in Seattle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer with all its edible implications swims into the Pacific Northwest on 
the backs of salmon. Wild mushrooms arrive, garden peas, various Asian greens, 
strawberries, fava beans, asparagus, sweet onions, fresh herbs -- the list goes 
on and on, the cornucopia spills over. It's a time for the spirited shopper to 
blast through the local supermarket, to hit the various weekend farmers 
markets, to grab a string bag and hoof it through the Pike Place Market. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a time, in other words, to shop for what looks terrific and carry that 
spontaneous enthusiasm for food back into the kitchen. The obverse of this is 
to shop for what's called for, as in the list of ingredients carefully 
transcribed from recipes, and to ignore all the other possibilities. What a 
bore. 
</P>
<P>
 So it came to pass, just the other day, that I found myself perusing the 
vegetables at Frank's Produce in the Pike Place Market. I bought basil and the 
first red-skin new potatoes of the season. My garden basil is weeks away, but 
Frank's apparently has some kind of greenhouse south of the city. The wild 
mushrooms at Sosio's caught my eye, both the morels and the big, meaty Oregon 
boletes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing left to do but make a quick visit to the mightiest of the 
Seattle fish mongers, Harry Yoshimura at Mutual Fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Copper River king salmon, magnificent sea beasts as big and fleshy as Chinese 
temple dogs, had been running for a short time in Alaska. Harry assured me they 
were still in their prime (the season is only a few weeks long). He asked 
Junior, his assistant, to cut fillets through the shoulder of a salmon as big 
as a hulking ham. The two resulting fillets delivered up by Junior and his 
knife were easily four inches wide, twice as long, and two inches thick. A 
weighty load. 
</P>
<P>
 I reached home by 9:30 that morning with the makings of a meal and enough time 
to clean my kitchen. It's sort of a guy kitchen and tends to lean into the 
messy more often than not. Chef Scott Carsberg arrived at 10. He likes a clean 
kitchen and has somehow mastered the art of cooking and cleaning at one and the 
same time. He leaves no indication, other than a meal, that he has even been in 
the kitchen. Lunch for six would be served at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole purpose of the exercise was to stand shoulder to shoulder with one 
of Seattle's premier chefs and watch cooking happen. Too often I stop taking 
inspiration from cookbooks and completely rely on them instead -- at best a 
dull and slavish mindset. Here was the potential to travel to the heart of 
cooking. And even though a recipe or two might come out of the process, only 
Carsberg's creative juices would carry him through. He had fresh ingredients of 
the finest quality to mess with in any way he might like, as well as complete 
access to my pantry, freezer and refrigerator. And garden, I should add. When I 
told Carsberg what was growing down in the P-Patch he sent me off for sweet 
snow peas. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of good cooks in Seattle restaurants. Carsberg stands out 
among them all as the one chef with the courage, the skill and the conviction 
to construct his plates with a simple palette, permitting the food to speak for 
itself and reveal its own inner elegance. He eschews hair-brained flavor and 
ingredient combinations that flop in and out of fashion with each passing menu. 
He doesn't handle his food a lot. Instead, he finds detail in a spare landscape 
and creates beautiful-looking dishes with a depth of flavor that completely 
envelops the lucky diner. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not the product of cooking schools but an instinctual cook who as a kid 
worked in frayed blue-collar Seattle restaurants, moved into high-end hotel 
kitchens by the time he was 16, then pushed on to work under Yannick Cam in 
Washington, D.C. before turning 20. Cam gave Carsberg's creative passion both 
discipline and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the opportunity to work for Andrea Helrigl at the Villa Mozart in 
Merano, Italy, that put Carsberg over the top. Not only did he have the 
challenge of a Michelin rating to maintain with his fellow chefs, he also had 
the finest ingredients imaginable to work with. The experience wasn't lost on 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Seattle's great good fortune that most Pacific Northwest boys eventually 
come home. By the time Carsberg hit 30 he had opened Lampreia in downtown 
Seattle with his wife and partner Hyun-Joo Paek. The restaurant is charming, 
the food sublime, and the national food press is catching up. But more to the 
point: While I had the chance, I had the chef in my own kitchen and lunch 
guests soon to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have baked the salmon. And I was more than happy to fire up the 
charcoal outside to grill those luscious fillets. But Carsberg felt like 
poaching the fish. At most it would be warm by the time it was served. It 
seemed like that kind of day to him. 
</P>
<P>
 So into a pot went the salmon fillet skins and the trimmings along with water, 
white wine, chopped basil, a shallot cut in half, skin on, a couple of crushed 
cloves of garlic (skins included), a dozen or so peppercorns, a little salt. He 
brought that to a boil, then reduced the fumet to a rapid simmer to intensify 
the flavor. He rubbed the salmon fillets with olive oil, sprinkled them on both 
sides with sea salt and freshly ground pepper, and placed them side by side in 
olive oil in a steep-sided pan just deep enough so that the fumet would cover 
the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The new potatoes had caught his eye. As had the jar of sun-dried tomatoes 
packed in olive oil. He got to thinking about potato salad, and by the time the 
ingredients came together he had whisked up an aioli to dress the potatoes. 
Carsberg halved each new potato, then carefully but quickly cut each one into 
small dice, about three cups worth, which he covered with water and brought to 
a boil. 
</P>
<P>
 For the aioli he separated two yolks into a stainless-steel bowl, added about 
a tablespoon or so of hot fumet and, with the bowl over the simmering pot of 
fumet, whisked the eggs yolks and hot liquid to slightly cook the yolks. Off 
heat the mixture went and he added a minced clove of garlic, a minced sun-dried 
tomato, about a tablespoon of the tomato-flavored oil, then olive oil, red wine 
vinegar, a squirt of tomato paste, salt and julienned fresh basil, whisking all 
into a splendid mayonnaise, or aioli if you prefer. This went into the 
refrigerator while the potatoes cooked. But once drained, the hot potatoes were 
stirred into the aioli, then returned to the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing I have to say that impresses me about Carsberg's cooking is that he 
is not afraid to use salt. I thought the aioli seemed salty. He added even 
more. But somewhere between the chilling and that time when the potato salad 
met up with the big flavor of the king salmon, balance and bliss had arrived, 
as had invigorating, muscular flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the fumet had cooked down to his satisfaction, he heated up the oil under 
the salmon. Satisfied with the heat, Carsberg poured the hot fumet over the 
fillets, brought it to a quick simmer, covered the pan and removed it from the 
heat. He let it sit this way for 15 or 20 minutes while he worked on another 
part of the dinner, then removed them to the platter to cool. The fillets were 
perfectly cooked, the centers just beginning to fade off their deep pink. 
</P>
<P>
 I will confess that all along through this exercise I had been wondering about 
those mushrooms. What a rich, brooding sauce they could make, thought I. 
Carsberg looked over the boletes, however, and saw salad. He cut each one in 
half lengthwise, then cut the mushrooms into thin slices. He took the onion, 
halved it, then separated each layer before cutting slices, ending up with 
individual slices of onion that each had their own shape and integrity -- a 
small point, granted, but, as it turned out, rather telling in the final 
assemblage. It's just the kind of attention Carsberg brings to each of the 
foods, no matter how humble, that make up a whole meal. It's as though the 
onion had its own inherent perfection, so why not liberate it? Why not honor it 
with a little extra bit of attention? 
</P>
<P>
 Carsberg cut the fresh peas on a lengthwise bias, then sauteed them in a 
little olive oil with salt and pepper over modest heat. He is one to stir, 
Carsberg is, almost as though he has to work off nervous energy. But as he 
stirred the peas over the heat he pointed out how they weren't so much sauteing 
as they were steaming in their own juices. And that they were turning a deep 
green as a result, a green that would not diminish and fade in the salad. 
</P>
<P>
 In a large glass bowl he whisked together a simple vinaigrette of olive oil, 
balsamic vinegar, fresh thyme, minced Italian parsley, minced shallots and salt 
and pepper. Then he added the sliced boletes, the onion, the peas and a little 
chopped basil. End of story. As for the morels, he poached those in a little 
fumet. 
</P>
<P>
 While the morels cooked, Carsberg arranged the salmon fillets to face each 
other, like slices of bread, with a layer of potato salad in between. He 
surrounded the salmon with the remaining potato salad, then sprinkled the whole 
creation with finely julienned fresh basil. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, he simply cut down through both fillets, adding a bit of potato 
salad to one side on the plate. This was complemented by the salad of fresh 
boletes and garden peas on the other side, and a healthy serving of hot morels 
right off the stove. Hot, warm, cool, the colors all earth-toned, the flavors 
speaking with distinct, magically enhanced voices. And all of it, off the cuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Carsberg had no idea what he was walking into when he appeared at my door, and 
truth be told, he was done cooking and fiddling around an hour later. He killed 
another hour throwing the ol' baseball with my son. The kitchen, after all, was 
clean. The guests arrived, sat right down, and upon their departure only the 
merest speck of salmon and potato salad was left over. Lunch was concluded 
within an hour. I kind of had to blink twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Something extraordinary had taken place, right under my nose, as it were. Yet 
it was all so uncomplicated, the simplest of poems to the beauty and integrity 
of fine ingredients, that had I not experienced the flavors suggesting a summer 
to come, I would have overlooked the art at hand. For it is an art. And a 
delicious one at that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following recipes might be considered the building blocks of Carsberg's 
spontaneous meal. The idea is not to duplicate his Pacific Northwest lunch in 
your Southern California home kitchen -- though you could approximate it by 
following the basic directions in Ingle's story -- but to re-create the spirit 
of the meal. Look for seasonal ingredients from local purveyors, keep your 
pantry stocked and your imagination open. Then come home and make a wonderful 
meal.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fish fumet is a good thing to have on hand when you're putting together a 
spontaneous meal. In Carsberg's menu, the fumet is used not only to poach the 
fish, but to flavor the aioli in the potato salad. This version uses salmon 
skin and trimmings -- not a traditional choice because a fatty fish such as 
salmon tends to cloud up the liquid. You could make a fumet instead with the 
heads, bones and trimmings of any lean fish. A fumet can be started at the 
beginning of preparations for a meal or made ahead and frozen so it's ready to 
use whenever you need it.

 A good aioli -- France's great garlicky version of mayonnaise -- is useful for 
several kinds of dishes. Traditionally, a dab is served alongside cold poached 
fish or cold meat . . . or best of all, is mounted in a big bowl as a dip for 
crudite s. Flavored with hot red pepper, it becomes rouille and goes into hot 
fish soup. Aioli is also served with hard-boiled eggs and salads. Keep it in 
mind as an idea to make even leftovers more interesting. Carsberg's version 
calls for sun-dried tomatoes, vinegar and herbs, but the most traditional 
version has just egg yolk, garlic, salt and pepper worked into a paste with a 
mortar and pestle; oil is then slowly drizzled into the paste to form an 
emulsion. Note, however, the egg warning at the end of the recipe.  
</P>
<P>
 SUN-DRIED TOMATO AIOLI 
</P>
<P>
 2 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon hot Salmon Fumet 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon minced fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
 1 sun-dried tomato, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil or olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 to 1 1/4 cups olive oil or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk yolks with hot Salmon Fumet over pot of simmering fumet (or water) until 
frothy. Turn off heat, add garlic, basil, sun-dried tomato, tomato oil, tomato 
paste and vinegar. Whisk ingredients together. Continue whisking while 
drizzling in olive oil to create emulsion. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Makes 1 1/3 cups.

 Note : Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes that 
have been pasteurized may be used in place of raw eggs in certain 
circumstances. Check egg substitute package for applications.

 Like aioli, a vinaigrette transforms simple steamed vegetables into more than 
just a side dish. Carsberg uses this vinaigrette to dress a salad of mushrooms, 
snow peas and onions. You could use it on steamed asparagus or fresh garden 
tomatoes, whatever looks good in the market or in your back yard. Just remember 
to dress your salads lightly -- the idea is to bring out the natural flavor of 
the vegetables, not to overwhelm them.  
</P>
<P>
 SALAD VINAIGRETTE 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon fresh thyme 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Place thyme, parsley, shallot, vinegar, olive oil and salt and pepper to taste 
in small bowl and whisk until smooth. Makes about 1/4 cup vinaigrette.

 The next three recipes demonstrate how Carsberg used the vinaigrette, aioli 
and salmon fumet.  
</P>
<P>
 POACHED SALMON 
</P>
<P>
 2 (1 1/2-pound) salmon fillets, skin-on 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon Fumet (heated if made ahead) 
</P>
<P>
 Rub each salmon fillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season to taste both sides 
of fillets with salt and pepper. Place 1 tablespoon olive oil in deep-sided pan 
(deep enough to hold fillets in one layer and fumet to cover). Place fillets in 
pan skin-side down.  
</P>
<P>
 Add enough fish fumet to completely cover fillets and bring to simmer. Cover 
and remove from heat, letting salmon cook through with reserved heat. Can stand 
15 to 20 minutes. Salmon should flake slightly. Place fillets on platter to 
cool and remove skin. Makes 6 servings.

 A pantry is a very personal thing. While daily marketing may provide the 
basics for most meals, it is the pantry that provides the style. The fishmonger 
sells you salmon, but your pantry is what makes the fish fit your taste. Dipped 
in Moroccan spices and broiled? Steamed with black beans and soy sauce? 
Surrounded by a spicy tomato sauce? 
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase Brillat-Savarin: Tell me what is in your pantry and I'll tell 
you who you are. 
</P>
<P>
 In my pantry, for example, you won't find a lot of exotic spice blends; if I 
want blends, I've got plenty of spices on hand to make my own. You won't find 
sun-dried tomatoes; to me they taste like rancid oil. And while I like fish 
sauce in other people's cooking, it's not yet part of my culinary lexicon. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that I don't have those things in my pantry does not in any way mean 
that they aren't worth having. It's just that they don't fit my cooking. My 
pantry is where I keep the ingredients to cook the things that please me.  
</P>
<P>
 It's also the place I turn to when I'm caught off guard. Friends drop by 
without warning? I've got this great little tuna spread I can put together in 
five minutes using nothing but the basics I keep on hand. Need a quick dinner? 
A mouth-filling plate of spaghetti with anchovies and bread crumbs can be ready 
in the time it takes to boil water. Snacks, appetizers, desserts . . . they're 
all in there, just waiting for me to call. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When I moved into an older house, one of the key selling points for me was 
that it had a real, honest-to-god pantry (which gives you some idea of my real 
estate acumen). But after years of trying to shoehorn things into an apartment 
kitchen, the prospect of what seemed like unlimited space was irresistible. Of 
course, within a year I was looking for more shelves to put things on.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's what's in my pantry. I'm leaving out the more neutral items -- flour, 
butter, vegetable oil, eggs, etc. -- in favor of those things that are specific 
to my style of cooking. Your pantry may be similar or totally different, but 
this list may give you ideas for new items to keep on hand.  
</P>
<P>
 When it's hot, when you're exhausted, or when you're just hungry for a meal 
and can't wait two hours to eat, a well-stocked pantry can make quick meals 
easy. Following the list are recipes that show what you can do with a pantry 
and a couple of minutes. Every ingredient in these recipes is a staple -- at 
least at my house.  
</P>
<P>
 REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER 
</P>
<P>
 * Mozzarella: Though I love the fresh mozzarella you can find now, it's a 
pretty perishable item. The cheese I always have on hand is the firmer, drier 
type that melts so well on top of pizzas, inside of quesadillas, over eggplant 
. . . I could go on. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parmigiano-Reggiano: I always have a good chunk -- or even two -- on hand. 
Though I'm normally a pretty stingy shopper, this is one time when I buy the 
best I can find, without thinking too much about the price. That cheese is too 
fundamental to too many things to quibble over a buck or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh goat cheese: In my family, goat cheese began not as an affectation but 
as a necessity. For many years, my daughter was allergic to cow's milk, so goat 
cheese was the only alternative. Now, we've developed a taste for it and we 
still use it more than any other cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bread crumbs: Do you have a problem with those expensive rustic breads going 
stale before they're finished? Cut off the crusts, cut the loaves in cubes, 
toast them in the oven and then run them through the food processor. You can 
use the crumbs over pasta, in soups, in a zillion ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * Black olives: Another basic, either as part of an instant appetizer plate or 
as a flavoring in a prepared dish. Check Greek and Middle Eastern markets for 
the best buys. I never use those canned California olives. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roasted sweet red peppers: When they're cheap, I buy fresh red peppers by 
the carload, roast them on my barbecue, peel them and stick them into small 
plastic food bags with a little slivered garlic and some olive oil. They'll 
last all year in the freezer and are much better than the pickled type, which 
is all you can buy in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stock: I'm not the kind of cook who makes fresh stock for every dish. But I 
am the kind of cook who makes a lot of stock once in a while and then freezes 
it in ice cube trays. Just be sure to dump them into a plastic food bag before 
guests go looking for ice cubes for their drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walnuts: One of my dessert standbys, I always have walnuts in the freezer to 
go into cookies or flour-less cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheese-filled tortellini or ravioli: These are strictly for those instant 
meals at the end of long work days. You can get them with all kinds of 
fillings, some of them wildly esoteric. The simpler the better in this case. 
Serve them with a little brown butter and sage and you've got an elegant 
weeknight dinner. DRY INGREDIENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Pastas: For short pastas, I like to use tubes (rigatoni, penne, etc.) 
because I find that other shapes (farfalle, etc.) cook unevenly. Also, orzo, 
rice-shaped pasta, is wonderful for soaking up meat juices. For long pastas, in 
addition to the obvious candidates (spaghetti, fettuccine), look for 
perciatelli , which looks like spaghetti with a hole through the middle. It's 
got a nice bite that makes even a simple tomato sauce shine. Don't buy angel 
hair pasta -- it always clumps when it cooks and cools almost instantly into a 
rubbery, starchy ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bittersweet chocolate: This is always on hand for making icings, mousses, 
cakes . . . well, you name it. In fact, break off little chunks and you can 
make the best chocolate chip cookies ever. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arborio rice: This stuff used to be ridiculously expensive, which was a 
shame, because risotto is a real boon when you need to have dinner on the table 
in a half-hour and all you've got in the fridge are some vegetables or a few 
scraps of leftover meat. I buy arborio in vacuum-packed bags when it's on sale 
and it lasts forever. If it's still too pricey, look for American short-grain 
rice. It's not as good, but for everyday meals it works just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cocoa: This is another one of those ingredients I tend to buy a lot of when 
it is on sale. Not only is it good on winter mornings, but there are a good 
half-dozen cakes and cookies that I can put together with it in almost no time. 
CANNED INGREDIENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Canned whole tomatoes: I've got a side yard full of shoulder-high tomato 
plants, but none of the fruit is ripe yet, so all my tomatoes right now are 
from a can. This is probably the most common canned food in good pantries. 
Here's a great quick tomato sauce: Put one tablespoon olive oil in the bottom 
of a pan. Mince a couple cloves of garlic and add them to the cold oil. Place 
over medium heat and cook until the garlic turns translucent. Run a can of 
tomatoes through the fine holes in a food mill into the pan. Cook 10 to 15 
minutes over medium-high heat until thickened. Then add either capers or basil, 
depending on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canned white beans, black beans and garbanzo beans: Certainly, dried beans 
that you cook yourself are better, but these are good weeknight substitutions 
-- especially for salads and to fill out soups. While I wouldn't serve these 
beans to guests (I have yet to find a brand of white beans in which two-thirds 
of the beans are not broken), I have (and will continue to) serve them purees 
of canned beans as appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tuna fish in oil: This is getting difficult to find these days, with every 
dieter in America seeming to rely on a small can of water-packed tuna for 
lunch. But if calories are not that much of a concern, try the oil-packed, 
preferably olive oil. Anything else tastes like fish-flavored sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salt-packed anchovies: If you think oil-packed tuna is hard to find, try 
scoring some salt-packed anchovies. For me, this began as an indulgence, but 
quickly crossed over to a necessity. Rinse them well and fillet them and the 
flavor is so much fresher and more delicate than the normal anchovy that it'll 
make a believer of you. After my first attempts at feeding my family 
anchovy-based dishes were soundly rejected, I began sneaking them in as 
flavorings in sauces and vegetable sautes. It got so whenever I asked whether 
my daughter liked a dish, she would fix me a stare and ask "Did you put 
anchovies in that?" She's coming around, though. You can get them mail order 
from Corti Brothers grocery in Sacramento, (916) 736-3800. Getting the rest of 
the family to eat them is up to you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Capers: I think of capers as my out-of-season basil. To me, they provide the 
same kind of bright accent to dishes, though they do it in a much different 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Olive oil: This is absolutely fundamental. One of my indulgences is having 
several olive oils to choose from. You don't need to go that far, though you 
should have a fruity one to cook with and an elegant one to use raw, with 
salads. You don't have to pay a fortune for good olive oil (though, as with 
Parmigiano-Reggiano, this is another case in which I would), and paying a 
fortune still won't guarantee you the best product. The only way to choose is 
to try several and decide which ones you like best. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vinegars: This is another major space occupier in my kitchen. I have more 
vinegars than I know what to do with. Actually, I think I could probably do 
with just three: balsamic (for cooking, where its sweetness is not so 
distracting); red or white wine (for general uses, though I like lemon juice 
best for salad dressings), and Asian rice wine (when I need just a hint of 
sweet acidity). 
</P>
<P>
 I know, I know: The combination of tuna and butter sounds pretty disgusting, 
but it is absolutely delicious. This is my adaptation of a recipe by Marcella 
Hazan and I use it a lot. Though it is pureed, oil-packed tuna still makes a 
difference, since it gives a smoother, creamier result.  
</P>
<P>
 TUNA SPREAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 (6 1/2-ounce) can oil-packed tuna 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons capers 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon finely minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Crackers or bread rounds, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Finely mince garlic by dropping in feed tube of running food processor. Turn 
food processor off and add tuna, butter and olive oil. Process until smooth, 
scraping down sides as necessary. Add capers and parsley and pulse once or 
twice to stir. Serve on crackers or bread rounds. Makes 3/4 cup.

 This is one of those things that can be done in 15 minutes and looks like a 
million bucks. The flavors are bright and complex, and it is just perfect for 
warm weather. Cut the balsamic vinegar in half, and you can even serve the 
tomato sauce as a cold soup.  
</P>
<P>
 TOMATO-GOAT CHEESE APPETIZER 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 (28-ounce) can whole, peeled tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons capers, with liquid 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound fresh goat cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Finely mince garlic by dropping in feed tube of running food processor. Add 
tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and puree just until slightly chunky. Add capers. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine goat cheese and basil in small bowl. Beat until smooth. Mound in 
middle of sheet of plastic wrap. Spread lightly to make rectangle, form in 
cylinder using plastic wrap, then twist ends to pack tightly. Unmold and 
carefully cut into slices. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide tomato puree among 6 soup plates. Place 1 goat cheese slice in center 
of each. Drizzle over with 1 teaspoon olive oil per serving. Makes 6 servings.

 This is one of those perennial summertime dishes that gets repeated over and 
over again in different Italian cookbooks. Each has a slightly different 
version. This one is mine. If the salad is a little looser than you like it, 
reduce the amount of oil.  
</P>
<P>
 TUNA-WHITE BEAN SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 medium red onion 
</P>
<P>
 2 (15-ounce) cans white (cannellini) beans, drained and rinsed 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 3 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon finely minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons finely minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
 2 (6 1/2-ounce) cans oil-packed tuna, drained 
</P>
<P>
 Remove ends from onion. Thinly slice onion widthwise to make thin rings. Place 
rings in strainer and submerge in cold water while salad is being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine beans, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and parsley in large mixing 
bowl. Stir well to combine. Add tuna and stir gently, being careful not to 
break chunks of fish up too much. Spoon into serving bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove onion with strainer from cold water. Rinse briefly under running cold 
water. Gently squeeze dry in corner of tea towel. Scatter onion across top of 
serving bowl. Makes 6 servings.

 This recipe, from "Paula Wolfert's World of Food," comes together in the time 
it takes to bring the pasta water to a boil; it is compulsively edible. The 
toasted bread crumbs are a distinctively Sicilian twist -- as cookbook writer 
Anna Tasca Lanza says: "We Sicilians are greedy and like to have big mouthfuls 
of food."  
</P>
<P>
 PASTA WITH ANCHOVIES AND TOASTED BREAD CRUMBS 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup fruity extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, halved 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 dashes hot red-pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 10 salted anchovies, filleted, soaked in milk 10 minutes, drained and cut 
small 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound thin spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup toasted coarse bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in heavy skillet. Add garlic. Gently cook over medium heat 2 
minutes, or until golden. Discard garlic and remove skillet from heat. Add 
red-pepper flakes and anchovies. Mash to puree with wooden spoon. Reheat 
gently, stirring 1 minute to blend flavors. Remove pan from heat before oil 
gets too hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook spaghetti in boiling salted water until al dente. While pasta is cooking, 
transfer 3 tablespoons pasta cooking water to anchovy-oil mixture and reheat 
gently. Drain pasta, transfer to skillet and toss with hot sauce. Divide evenly 
onto 4 heated dishes. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve at once. Pass bread crumbs 
for sprinkling on top of each serving. Makes 4 servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: GREAT BALLS O' SHRIMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before most of the businesses were turned into parking lots or government 
office buildings, before street people became feared as "the homeless," 
downtown's Main Street was a seedy -- though good-natured -- strip of "art" 
movies, fried food and beery dive bars that seemed straight out of John Rechy's 
"City of Night." 
</P>
<P>
 One theater near city hall played the kind of cheeseball samurai movies that 
never quite made it to the more respectable Japanese theaters on Crenshaw and 
La Brea; a theater down toward Seventh, decorated with a grand mural rendered 
all but invisible with grime, functioned mostly as a flophouse but showed the 
bottom-bill AIP and Herschell Gordon Lewis stuff that was too weird for even 
Hollywood's old World theater. Sometimes on a summer Friday evening, Main could 
seem like a giant, vice-ridden block party, straight past Hopper and down into 
Hogarth. 
</P>
<P>
 And right in the middle of it, for as long as anyone could remember, the 
fried-seafood stand Johnny's Shrimp Boat sold cheap coffee and ladled out chili 
and beans, fed the locals and drew a crowd of late-model cars. It was the one 
place on that stretch of Main Street that everybody seemed to go to on purpose. 
Sometimes at Johnny's, amid the discarded wine bottles and the passersby 
pestering for quarters, the line stretched as long as the one at Tommy's or 
Pink's, though the crowds dwindled as the neighborhood got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 For 40-odd years, until its closing, Johnny's made the fried shrimp that fed 
the Eastside: crisp golf balls of fried dough, deep golden speckled with sandy 
brown, that tasted of clean oil and happened to have a shrimp hidden somewhere 
inside each one. They were kind of weird, these shrimp, and sometimes the 
batter stayed too liquid at the center, but they satisfied some primordial 
fried-shrimp need, bought by fours, sixes or eights, swabbed with a dab or two 
of the Shrimp Boat's mild chile sauce. These were Chinese-style fried shrimp, I 
think, though the owners were Korean and the customers mostly Spanish-speaking: 
The thick batter defied ethnicity.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Johnny's reopened a while ago, a successful transplant to a converted 
roadside stand near where Temple City fades into El Monte -- a few picnic 
tables and a takeout window, a few taped-up pictures of the old place, a 
handsome new sign. The fried shrimp is pretty much the same as ever: fresh and 
hot, crisp and greasy, a little gooey. There are $2.99 lunch plates, which 
include a couple of the shrimp, a braised short rib or two, a mound of rice, a 
ladleful of plain pinto beans and a wash of thick brown gravy -- the kind of 
tasty, Spartan lunch you'd probably want if you had only $3 to your name. The 
chile fries aren't bad. You can even get a T-bone steak, though I've never 
actually seen anybody order one. But sometimes, all it takes is a basket of 
shrimp and a Pepsi with ice, and everything seems right with the world.

A BOWL OF BULBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around this time of year, early garlic comes to our markets. It's the kind of 
garlic with large, symmetrically arranged cloves in yellowish skin. However, it 
has a short harvest season and doesn't keep as well as the pink-skinned late 
garlic, so it will be around for only about two months. It is because of this 
seasonality, as well as the excellent flavor of early garlic, that July is when 
people put on garlic events -- this weekend, for instance, the L.A. Garlic 
Festival will be held at the Federal Building in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 All kinds of garlic are the same in the kitchen, but something about garlic 
festival season inspires people to loony inventions like garlic ice cream. 
Entertaining though this can be, garlic is a very classic ingredient. In the 
cooking of Spain, the most garlic-oriented country in Europe, garlic soup 
occupies the same place that onion soup does in French cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 When it occurs to American cooks to make a garlic soup, their instinct is 
usually to make it rich: a cream soup, one rounded out with onions and leeks, a 
thick vegetable puree scented with garlic. The Spanish, who love earthy food 
and, above all, the pure flavor of garlic, will have none of that. Spain's sopa 
de ajo isn't much more than broth and garlic, with a little bread fried in 
olive oil to thicken it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these limited means, the flavor is surprisingly rich. Since both the 
garlic and the bread have been browned, the aroma is sweet and toasty, and the 
combination of olive oil and bread makes it as satisfying as a meatier soup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are as many sopa de ajo recipes as there are cooks. Some make it thick, 
some make it thin. Most soak the bread to a mush, but some like to leave it a 
little crisp. Beef or chicken stock is common, but in Malaga fish stock is 
traditional. In the center of Spain, the liquid is often plain water. Basques 
tend to put tomatoes in and leave the paprika out. Many cooks enrich sopa de 
ajo with eggs, either by covering the soup with two beaten eggs and baking them 
into a crust or by stirring them into the soup in the manner of an Italian 
stracciatella or a Chinese egg-drop soup.  
</P>
<P>
 GARLIC SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 (Sopa de Ajo) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced garlic 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups coarsely crumbled whole-wheat bread 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon paprika 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Put olive oil in saucepan and warm over low heat. Add garlic and cook, 
stirring frequently, until garlic is tender but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir 
in crumbled bread, raise heat to moderate and fry just until garlic is brown 
and bread is golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in paprika, then add stock. Stir to 
break up lumps. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to very low and simmer, 
uncovered, 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Season to taste with salt and pepper. Garnish with cilantro. Makes 6 servings.

GOOD COOKING: SUMMER SOUPS: HOLD THE MEAT; RECIPES: REAL VEGETABLE SOUPS WITH 
NO MEAT STOCK, JUST GOOD SUMMER FLAVOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As summer diversions cut into your cooking time, consider soup. A soup can be 
served hot or cold, as a first course in a serious dinner or the focus of an 
informal meal, accompanied by sandwiches, cold cuts, salads or simply crusty 
bread and wedges of cheese.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, soups are not just versatile -- they're easy to make and practical. 
Soups keep at least three days in the refrigerator; many freeze successfully. 
You can easily double or triple a recipe. Typically they are inexpensive, 
especially considering the varied role they play. 
</P>
<P>
 The following brightly flavored soups are thickened with either vegetables or 
fruit, making them substantial without being rich or the least bit heavy. The 
carrot soup is thick and sustaining, with Asian overtones; the apple and celery 
soup is subtle and rather mild. The corn and potato chowder is chunky, rather 
than a puree, but thick nonetheless.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Canned vegetable broth is the liquid used here; it's much better-tasting than 
vegetable bouillon cubes. Even better, you can make your own vegetable stock by 
cooking an array of vegetables (leeks, carrots, celery, onions, tomatoes, 
turnips, etc. -- raid the vegetable bin) with parsley and peppercorns in water 
to cover for 1 1/2 hours. Strain the vegetables from the liquid (discard the 
vegetables) and hold back from adding any salt until the soup is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Subtle and mild, this is about as light and refreshing a chilled soup as you 
could serve on a hot night. It's also great hot. Use oil instead of butter to 
saute the garlic, celery and onion if you normally avoid dairy products in your 
daily diet.  
</P>
<P>
 ESSENCE OF CELERY SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter or oil 
</P>
<P>

apples, broth, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Bring to boil. Simmer, covered, until 
vegetables are very tender, about 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Strain solids from liquid, reserving broth. Puree solids with parsley in

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: WHAT IF THERE WAS A TOXIC SPILL AND NO POLITICIANS CAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SUPERFUND PARTY: Just a few months ago, frustrated neighbors of two toxic 
waste dumps near Torrance were fighting for any attention from politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 They wrote. They called. They did everything they could to get help for their 
neighborhood, where the back-yard soil is peppered with DDT and cancer-causing 
benzene taints the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing happened. Zero. Zilch. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ah, now it's election season, and look who's coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, officialdom is paying attention -- so much so that the 
much-publicized West 204th Street neighborhood appears to have evolved into a 
political whistle stop -- the chemical equivalent of the rubber-chicken 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, politicians are the ones writing letters and placing calls. They're 
sending staff members to mingle with the television cameras at media briefings 
at the DDT site. So many politicians dispatched emissaries to a recent U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency community meeting, in fact, that they 
outnumbered the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 On hand were representatives of U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey) and state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo). State 
Assemblywoman Juanita M. McDonald (D-Carson) even showed up in person, seizing 
a microphone and pledging her allegiance to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, in fact, has issued a news release announcing that she will soon visit 
the DDT site, bringing Elliott Laws, an assistant administrator with the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leader Cynthia Babich is taking all this newfound attention with 
several grains of salt, recalling those bleak days when no one seemed to care. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she observes wryly: "Everyone wants to come out and party with us." 
</P>
<P>

 BOOM COMING: To residents of Redondo Beach, summer means long, balmy nights, 
gentle breezes and relaxing afternoons at the beach. Oh yeah, and don't forget 
those really loud, annoying boomboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, thumping radios are turning the peaceful city into a 
round-the-clock headache for many meditative residents, who have begun 
complaining to police. 
</P>
<P>
 So last weekend, Redondo Beach police began a crackdown on the monster 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers say they'll the cite owners of blasting radios and might even 
confiscate the boomboxes. 
</P>

 EAT TWO PIZZAS AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING: Next time Palos Verdes Peninsula 
residents have hunger pangs, Cathy Hull wants them to call the doctor at 
Emergency Pizza, the restaurant she plans to open in September. There, patrons 
would be served pizzas such as the "Pediatrician's Special" -- a pepperoni and 
cheese pizza -- by employees dressed as doctors and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hull has her way, Emergency Pizza would be located inside Penguin's Frozen 
Yogurt store in the Peninsula Shopping Center. But the proposal has met 
opposition from the Rolling Hills Estates Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners have voiced concern over the restaurant's plans to serve beer 
and wine because it would be located across the street from Palos Verdes 
Peninsula High School. They also questioned whether Penguins' corporate 
headquarters approves of Hull's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing has been rescheduled for July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull, who manages Penguin's, said she will temporarily strike plans to serve 
beer and wine but said financial problems at Penguin's headquarters have 
essentially allowed franchisees the option of doing as they please. 
</P>
<P>
 Penguin's president and owner, Stephen Van Velkinburgh, acknowledges that the 
corporation has experienced financial shake-ups but said he would be willing to 
work with Hull on her pizza idea. 
</P>
<P>
 If the restaurant flies in Palos Verdes, Hull hopes to franchise Emergency 
Pizza nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "A gimmick is always a thing that hits people," she says.

 LOOK OUT HOLLYWOOD PARK: "Bingo!" will soon be echoing in the halls of various 
charity offices in the Santa Catalina Island city of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be the most original idea, but Mayor Ralph J. Morrow Jr. says the 
game will offer nonprofit community groups the chance to make money and may 
even help the city offset the $500,000 it pays annually to run the Avalon 
Municipal Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 21, the Avalon City Council unanimously passed an ordinance permitting

EX-CHIEF OF INVESTMENT FIRM GETS PRISON TERM; FRAUD: MORRIS ENGLISH IS 
SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS FOR SWINDLING 1,600 PEOPLE OUT OF MORE THAN $30 MILLION. 
ANGRY INVESTORS PACK THE COURTROOM. 
</P>

<P>
 While a capacity courtroom of angry investors looked on, the former head of a 
defunct South Bay real estate investment company, who swindled 1,600 people out 
of more than $30 million, was sentenced to 18 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic confrontation with some of his victims, Morris D. English Jr., 
52, who once headed the Rollings Hills Estates-based Wellington Group, faced 
the courtroom audience before he was sentenced and said: "I'm sorry for what 
you feel. . . . I'll never convince you that I never set out with the intent to 
defraud any of you."  
</P>
<P>
 As English spoke, some members of the audience, most of them elderly people 
who lost tens of thousands -- or even hundreds of thousands -- of dollars in 
English's scheme, grumbled: "No, no," and "Liar!" Others called out, "All of 
us!" when English said of the audience, "I don't know which are the ones with 
the blood in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ordered the crowd of about 100 people to be quiet, and federal court 
security personnel stationed themselves between English and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month trial and a month of jury deliberations, English was 
convicted in March of 30 counts of mail fraud, securities fraud, bankruptcy 
fraud, money laundering and criminal contempt. He was found not guilty of two 
mail fraud counts, and the jury was deadlocked on 15 other criminal counts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In pronouncing the sentence Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian 
noted the "devastating effect" that English's fraudulent scheme had on the 
victims, including a woman who committed suicide after losing her life savings 
and many others who lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Attorneys Peter G. Spivack and Jeffrey B. Isaacs had asked for 
a sentence of 30 years to life in prison. English's final sentence, however, 
was in the middle range of what was permitted by federal sentencing guidelines. 
Under federal rules he will have to serve a minimum of 85% of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should take care of Mr. English for the foreseeable future," Isaacs said 
after the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the spectators thought it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put in $84,000, all the money I had," said Caroline Laserna, 80, of Sun 
Valley. Now I have to live on Social Security. I think (English's sentence) 
should have been more." 
</P>
<P>
 Tevrizian also ordered English to pay about $850,000 restitution, but few 
expect him to make good on that. After the sentencing, defense attorney Richard 
M. Callahan Jr. said that English will be in his 60s when he gets out of 
prison, adding: "At that age it's going to be difficult for him to pay anybody 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The case, described by prosecutors as one of the biggest real estate 
investment scams in state history, began in 1984 when English purchased a 
dormant Manhattan Beach company called Wellington Escrow Corp. for $7,000. 
English changed the name to The Wellington Group, moved to Rolling Hills 
Estates and began making short-term, interest-only loans to borrowers who 
secured the loans with real estate. To fund the loans, English solicited money 
from investors, promising them a 15% return on their investment. English 
pitched the company on radio programs, and investors from across the country 
invested millions with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the enterprise eventually evolved into a classic Ponzi 
scheme, with new investors' money being used to pay off old investors. 
Meanwhile, prosecutors said, English diverted investors' funds to finance a 
lavish personal lifestyle, buying expensive homes, airplanes and cars for his 
son and girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 the California Department of Corporations obtained a preliminary 
injunction to prevent Wellington from selling "unqualified securities." The 
Wellington company later filed for bankruptcy and, prosecutors said, illegally 
omitted investors' names from the list of creditors so the investors wouldn't 
find out about it. English also concealed or destroyed numerous records 
concerning the company, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors later said they didn't know anything was wrong at the company 
until the interest payments on their investments abruptly stopped, and by then 
it was too late to get their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's collapse sparked civil lawsuits involving hundreds of investors. 
The company has been placed in the hands of a court-appointed trustee who has 
been selling its remaining assets to pay off investors. Some investors hope to 
get back 10 or 15 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 English's criminal court troubles began in 1991, when he was charged in 
Torrance with eight counts of grand theft and writing bad checks to investors. 
In a plea bargain, he agreed to make good on the checks, but was later arrested 
for failing to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal agents were investigating his business affairs. English was 
arrested in May, 1993, on the federal charges and has been held in federal 
custody ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in his own defense during the trial, English insisted that his 
company was a legitimate business that simply fell on hard times when the 
California real estate market plummeted.

FORMER CLIENTS CHEER TRAVEL AGENT'S ARREST; CRIME: SUSAN REINDL IS ACCUSED OF 
BILKING $500,000 FROM HUNDREDS OF SOUTH BAY RESIDENTS. SHE FACES A 10-YEAR 
PRISON SENTENCE IF CONVICTED.

 Larry and Deb Whipple of Lawndale will celebrate two unusual anniversaries 
this month: the day their travel agent allegedly fled with almost $1,000 of 
their trip deposit, and the honeymoon they took in spite of the setback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whipples are among more than 400 South Bay residents who Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies say were left holding their bags when their travel 
agent, Susan Reindl, suddenly closed the doors of Apollo Travel Service in 
Rancho Palos Verdes three years ago and disappeared with almost $500,000 in 
trip deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year investigation, deputies arrested Reindl on June 28 at a 
Harbor City travel agency where she was working. The arrest warrant charged 
Reindl with 74 felonies involving grand theft and travel-promotion violations. 
Reindl pleaded not guilty at her arraignment June 29 and was later released 
after posting $250,000 bail. A judge on Tuesday is scheduled to set the date 
for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Reindl could face up to 10 years in prison, said Laura Aalto, a 
Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The court could also ask Reindl to reimburse travelers left in the lurch, and 
a criminal conviction could mean that travelers who were defrauded would be 
among the first in line to collect from Reindl's assets filed under bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But local residents who were left ticketless, whether or not they receive 
their money back, were glad to hear of Reindl's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire the perseverance of the Sheriff's Department," said Larry Whipple, 
51, a retired Air Force projects manager. "I'd just about given up." 
</P>
<P>
 After Reindl closed shop, Whipple said, he and his wife paid Carnival Cruise 
Lines another $550 and took their scheduled 10-day honeymoon cruise. Whipple 
said Carnival already had received about $1,100 of the couple's original $2,000 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to have a good time, regardless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl eventually filed a Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy and a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy for Apollo Travel. In previous court proceedings, she said her 
business was hurt by the Gulf War and accused a former employee of embezzling 
$80,000 from Apollo, opening his own travel agency, and stealing 60% of her 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Reindl's attorney, Mona Soo Hoo, repeated those claims and 
added that the recession contributed to Apollo's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Department investigators allege that Reindl bilked clients by 
failing to make trip reservations or by making reservations and canceling them 
later. When asked about an employee who may have contributed to Apollo's 
downfall, investigators and the district attorney's office note that charges 
have been filed against Reindl only. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Aalto said she had no evidence that Reindl has been living lavishly 
over the past three years, but said she did not seek such information. 
</P>
<P>
 Whipple said he received a Nov. 4, 1993, letter stating that assets related to 
the Reindl case "may become available." He said he sent in his claim Nov. 21 
just as he began to feel the Apollo Travel case was "one more somebody bilking 
a bunch of people and trying to get away from it invoking bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Aalto said, it is a coincidence that the bankruptcy court sent out 
notices a few months before Reindl was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Whipples managed to salvage their honeymoon, other South Bay 
residents were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor City resident Helen Vaca said she and 13 relatives lost about $14,000 
in deposits for a seven-day cruise to Mexico. Vaca, who helped form a support 
group called Victims of Apollo Travel, says she was also disturbed at seeing 
Reindl work at a travel agency two blocks from her home. "It's like UFO 
sightings," Vaca said, adding that Reindl was spotted in supermarkets and other 
locales. 
</P>
<P>
 Soo Hoo, however, said Reindl's effort to "live openly" in the South Bay shows 
that her client has no intention of evading investigators. "She goes to the 
same hairdresser," Soo Hoo said. "She shops at the same market." 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl had been working part-time at the Bo Lam Travel Service, 1662 W. 
Sepulveda Blvd., for nine months when she was arrested, said owner Telry Lim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim said she knew of the bankruptcy but assumed Reindl's problems were behind 
her. She said she has no reason to believe Reindl did anything underhanded 
there.

HAWTHORNE; RECOUNT SOUGHT ON VOTE FOR SCHOOL BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawthorne school officials have asked for a recount of the June 7 vote on 
Proposition B. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue, which lost by 19 votes, would have authorized $15 million for 
improvements at the district's seven elementary and two junior high schools, 
said Pamela Fees, director of business services for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition required a two-thirds majority of those voting.It gained 
66.16% of the vote -- just .5% shy of passing, according to the county 
registrar's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The recount is expected to take several days and could cost members of 
Community for Hawthorne School District Proposition B, the citizens group 
sponsoring the recount, up to $2,000. Fees is a member of that group. 
</P>
<P>
 The county registrar charges by the day for recounting, and the total cost 
depends on the number of ballots cast and the number of counters requested, 
Fees said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the vote is overturned, however, I understand we don't have to pay," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the vote is overturned, the $15-million bond would be paid back over 25 
years by an average $24 property tax increase on Hawthorne residents, according 
to the Los Angeles County auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 The recount is being funded by money left over from the original campaign to 
pass Proposition B, Fees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would also make the district eligible to receive state matching 
funds for renovation and modernization of school buildings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our buildings are all more than 40 years old," she said. Many of the school 
buildings have problems with plumbing, locks and windows, Fees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds would also allow for construction of permanent buildings in place of 
portable classrooms now in use on some campuses. JON GARCIA

40 SHOW METTLE, VIE IN IRONMAN EVENT; TRADITION: THE ANNUAL FOURTH OF JULY 
CONTEST -- INVOLVING RUNNING, PADDLING AND DOWNING A SIX-PACK OF BEER -- AGAIN 
DRAWS CRITICISM IN HERMOSA BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 40 competitors in Hermosa Beach celebrated Independence Day by taking 
part in the annual Ironman competition -- a running, paddling and beer-chugging 
extravaganza near city shores. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacchanalian event, in which contestants run a mile, paddle a mile and 
then guzzle a six-pack of beer, sparked controversy last year when the drinking 
portion of the competition was held on the beach -- a violation of city 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, led by Councilman Robert (Bergie) Benz the annual Fourth of July 
event began on the beach with a rendition of the national anthem. And as is 
tradition, it culminated in a nearby back yard in a sweaty frenzy of men 
dancing, drinking and, inevitably, vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach "is just one big, happy family," Benz said after chugging a 
six-pack of generic beer and holding it down successfully for the required 20 
minutes. "This was great, I had a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 300 onlookers, some standing on nearby rooftops, braved the stale 
stench of competitors to cheer on the contestants.  
</P>
<P>
 The event has been a twisted fixture in Hermosa Beach for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Benz was chided by Hermosa Beach school trustees and numerous other critics 
last year for his involvement in the competition, which features a special 
award for "the most picturesque barf." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said Benz was supposed to be a role model, and criticized him for 
drinking beer on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Benz, an outspoken libertarian known as "The Senator" among some of 
the contestants, wrote a lengthy letter blasting the district's anti-drug 
curriculum as irrational. Benz has stated that he views the district's policy 
as a throwback to the days of prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stretched on the sand before the competition, Pat Gould, a 24-year-old 
Hermosa Beach contestant, defended the Ironman as a serious athletic endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to do, and at the end, you're lightheaded," said Gould.  
</P>
<P>
 While most of the competitors were men, one woman took part in the event this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Seawright, 28, made her second appearance in the competition Monday. 
Last year, she was unable to drink all six beers, but this year she chugged six 
cans of Coors Light and didn't throw up. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Fuess 35, of Los Angeles probably summed up the attitude of scores of 
spectators as she rode along the bike path: "I think it's pretty silly."

RANCHO PALOS VERDES; COUNCIL URGES UNOCAL TO KEEP GAS STATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Worried by the closure of three of Unocal Corp.'s five Rancho Palos Verdes 
gasoline stations within the past year, the City Council is urging the company 
to continue to operate its station at Hawthorne Boulevard and Palos Verdes 
Drive West. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to send a letter to Roger Beach, Unocal's chief 
executive officer, expressing concern that another closure would inconvenience 
residents and visitors.The city also would lose about $15,000 a year in sales 
tax, according to a report by City Manager Paul D. Bussey. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty Oil Co. owns the land on which the station operates, and Unocal's 
lease expires at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mattes, a Unocal area manager, told the City Council on Tuesday that the 
station is close to signing a new lease with Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been our desire not to leave this corner," Mattes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The station operator, Nasser Novinshoar, told city officials he hopes to stay 
at the eight-pump station. He said that hundreds of customers have offered to 
sign a petition opposing the station's closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to do business rather than a legal battle," Novinshoar said as he 
stood outside the station greeting customers one recent afternoon. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; L.A. TO SUE OVER DRILLING PROJECT AT CEMETERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to sue the City of Inglewood 
over a proposed oil drilling project at the Inglewood Park Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district borders the Inglewood 
site, proposed the lawsuit to force Inglewood to authorize a full environmental 
impact report on the drilling.Galanter's concern is centered on traffic that 
the project will create. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about heavy construction equipment (creating) traffic, dust, 
noise and who knows what else. There's going to be a big impact on the 
residents of L.A., who have no say in the project," Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Inglewood City Atty. Howard Rosten said most of the traffic associated 
with the drilling project on South Victoria Avenue will be forced to go through 
the cemetery, bypassing residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The only traffic allowed through residential areas would be limited to 
vehicles or equipment that would be impossible or impractical to move through 
the cemetery, Rosten said. The Inglewood City Council included that provision 
after Galanter and neighborhood residents voiced their opposition to the 
drilling on May 24, Rosten said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood City Council gave its approval June 7 to the drilling project, 
which will allow up to five exploratory wells to be drilled on 1.1 acres on the 
northeast corner of the cemetery. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; FDIC TO SELL ITS INTEREST IN PLANNED OUTLET MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials announced this week that they would put the government's 
interest in a proposed outlet shopping mall in Carson up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. inherited $28 million in loans on the 
157-acre Metro 2000 site when it took over Consolidated Savings and Loan of 
Irvine in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 FDIC spokesman Andrew Porterfield said the agency will sell the loans to the 
highest bidder. A date for the sale has not been set. Approval from FDIC 
officials in Washington is still pending, Porterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro 2000 spokesman Arthur Caracoza said Metro has already made a bid on the 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, which is at the intersection of two major freeways, is one of 
the largest undeveloped sites in Los Angeles County.

 As a curious little boy, Alex Ruelas liked to take apart all kinds of 
appliances. But the machines rarely recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Ruelas dissected a brand new personal computer, and when he put it 
back together, it worked the first time he flipped the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 His new skill with electronic equipment comes from a vocational training 
program called the Pioneer Academy of Electronics. The academy, near Watts, was 
established after the 1992 riots to give vocational training to young people in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy held a tassel-and-gown ceremony for its first 19 graduates last 
Thursday (6/30) at the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center. Eight of 
the graduates will come to Carson this summer to work at the Pioneer plant. The 
corporation donated $500,000 to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 30 youngsters started the program in 1992, the long hours and 
college-level work made many drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day after school, the students spend 3 1/2 hours at special electronics 
courses. Besides working with computers, they receive basic training in the 
repair of videocassette recorders, compact disc players, laser disc players and 
other home electronics. Guest speakers discuss interviewing techniques and 
professional etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
 The students applied for the program through their high school's guidance 
counselors. The selection committee looks for C-average students who score well 
on a math aptitude test. 
</P>
<P>
 The next class of students will start their senior year in the fall, and 
program organizers will soon select a new group of first-year students. At the 
graduation ceremony, Ruelas accepted valedictorian honors. He also earned a 
$2,000 scholarship from Pioneer to help him through Cal State University Long 
Beach, where he will study electronics starting in the fall.

 Until school starts, Ruelas will work full time at Pioneer's plant in Carson. 
Last summer he worked there on a paid internship. He doesn't know what his job 
will entail, but during his internship he checked the alignment of laser disc 
machines assembled at the plant.

 Other students will take entry-level electronics jobs rather than go on to 
college. A beginning technician earns about $21,000 a year, with experienced 
electronics workers making more than $30,000, according to the Electronic 
Industries Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the students who don't want to continue in electronics said they got 
something out of the program. Joy Harper, 17, will study journalism at Cal 
State Northridge next year. She said she got good internships and contacts.

CITY HALL NEWS; HAWTHORNE; COUNCIL REJECTS BUDGET CONTAINING TAX HIKE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed budget that included a 1.5% utility tax increase failed to gain 
enough votes to pass, leaving the financially troubled city without a budget 
for the new fiscal year which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2 to 2 vote, the council rejected the plan because the tax hadn't been 
approved by the council.Even with the tax increase, the plan projected a 
$1.4-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steven Andersen said he voted against the plan because the voters 
hadn't had a chance to speak on the proposed tax increase. Mayor Larry Guidi 
also voted against the budget. Councilwomen Ginny M. Lambert and Betty J. 
Ainsworth voted in favor of the proposal, with the understanding that it could 
be amended if the utility tax increase wasn't approved. Councilwoman Martha G. 
Bails was absent.  
</P>
<P>
 Interim City Manager James A. Algie said he will not change the plan before 
the council votes on it again July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much work has gone into it," Algie said.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed tax increase was introduced before the budget vote June 29 and is 
scheduled for a vote July 11. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: CEREMONY MARKS DISBANDING OF LONG BEACH NAVAL FLEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Navy disbanded its Long Beach fleet last week with a short ceremony 
of speeches, a prayer and a 15-cannon salute. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Harry E. Selfridge, group commander, ordered the fleet "disestablished" 
before an audience of about 200 officers and enlisted men and women.Selfridge 
also left the base a civilian. He retired after a 35-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony marked the end of the Long Beach fleet as a unit. Most of the 
ships are being decommissioned or reassigned to other fleets, mainly in San 
Diego and Everett, Wash., said Lt. Carl Johnson, Navy spokesman. Nine ships 
will remain stationed in Long Beach until Sept. 30, while four others will stay 
in Long Beach until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach fleet consisted of 38 ships and 16,000 sailors in 1991, when a 
federal base-closure commission recommended shutting down the naval station and 
the Long Beach Naval Hospital. The hospital closed in March. Currently, 7,700 
personnel are assigned to the base, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last week's ceremony, Navy officials decommissioned the Joseph Hewes, a 
25-year-old frigate that served in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1972 during the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Isaiah J. Jones will preside as chief commanding officer of the base 
until it closes in September. After that, the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, which 
has survived several closure efforts, will oversee the base property until the 
federal government decides its future use. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL NEWS; CARSON; ADULT SHOPS GET REPRIEVE FROM ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raven A. Knight's adult business came close to being shut down, but after a 
series of meetings at City Hall, Knight Dreams can continue to sell massage 
oils, videos, lingerie and other novelties from a Carson mini-mall for at least 
five more years. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved an ordinance at Tuesday's meeting that prohibits 
adult businesses from opening near schools, churches and residential 
areas.Knight Dreams was too close to homes, according to the ordinance. But 
officials, fearing a lawsuit, allowed Knight's business to continue operating 
for at least the five years remaining on his lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson city clerk received more than 100 letters in support of Knight 
Dreams and the other adult business in Carson, Lingerie Dreams. Lingerie Dreams 
uses live models for lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 At earlier council meetings, several people vehemently opposed allowing adult 
businesses. But City Atty. Glenn R. Watson said that an ordinance banning adult 
businesses would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents suggested including a grandfather clause that would permit 
existing businesses to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the new ordinance allows those two adult businesses to continue in 
their current locations for five years as existing legal nonconforming uses. 
Then those businesses will either have to ask for extensions or move to an area 
acceptable under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said the council's decision is "a good compromise." MARY GUTHRIE

SOUTH BAY COVER STORY; ON THE WAR PATH; CYCLISTS BATTLE SKATERS AND PEDESTRIANS 
FOR SPACE ON SEASIDE 'BIKES ONLY' LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER and JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Avid cyclist Andy Hale races along the beach bicycle path like a human 
pinball. 
</P>
<P>
 He slips by two carefree pedestrians sipping beer. He eases around a 
bare-chested jogger weaving in the lane. He ducks a chain of 12 children on 
in-line skates. He steers clear of being hooked by sticks carried by two 
roller-hockey players. Ahead, he maneuvers around a skater towed by a dog on a 
leash. 
</P>
<P>
 Time for a breather. 
</P>
<P>
 "This path is just not set up for people trying to bike," Hale said. "There 
are so many who don't understand the rules of the road. You really need a bell 
or whistle to be out here." 
</P>
<P>
 A first-aid kit could come in handy, too. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years after the first segments of the 21.6-mile seaside path from 
Torrance to Pacific Palisades were laid, many believe it has become a victim of 
its success. Frustration -- and injuries -- have mounted as cyclists jockey for 
space on the 14-foot-wide ribbon of concrete with a host of in-line 
roller-skaters, skateboarders and pedestrians, who in recent years have taken 
to the trail in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works recently estimated that 1.5 
million cyclists pedal along the path annually. But county officials are 
increasingly worried about the hundreds of thousands of additional users who 
ignore the "Bikes Only" signs along the pavement (all but a one-mile segment in 
Pacific Palisades and a nearly two-mile segment in Hermosa Beach is designated 
for bikes only). 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, plenty of people spend a mishap-free afternoon zipping along the path, a 
favorite among tourists and residents alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But it can get dicey, as cyclist Dave Jeffords, who is recovering from a 
broken collarbone and concussion he suffered last year in a head-on collision 
with another cyclist, can attest: "It's like running a human slalom course. 
It's actually safer to just ride up the Pacific Coast Highway." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who took a tumble a number of years ago 
while bike riding in Venice, said: "It's really quite a mess out there; you 
really just have to take it slow, take your time." 
</P>
<P>
 County and city officials concede that solutions are hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aware there are problems, but what to do about them I don't know," said 
Dennis Morefield, a spokesman for County Supervisor Deane Dana, whose district 
includes the path south from Marina del Rey. "In this economy, you can't think 
about building a separate path for skaters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence of the problem mounts from people who use the 
path and from the authorities who patrol it. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County lifeguards estimate that almost half of last year's 2,300 
first-aid calls from Marina del Rey to Torrance were for injuries on the bike 
path. Ankle and wrist sprains and strains, along with bad scrapes, accounted 
for most of the calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 years, there has been only one death on the path: a pedestrian who was 
struck by a cyclist in 1986 just north of the Santa Monica Pier and died after 
four years in a coma, said Dean Smith of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials do not keep precise numbers on accidents, they believe the 
situation is deteriorating.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, it's just getting more and more out of control -- the bike path 
is being used by everybody," said Craig Mattox, a Santa Monica Beach lifeguard. 
"We're seeing more collisions, head traumas and cervical injuries. It's a 
nightmare out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Most lifeguards are used to treating what they call "cheese pizzas" -- severe 
abrasions. But other injuries can be grislier. Dan Cabrera, a part-time county 
lifeguard, remembers a head-on collision between cyclists that left one bike 
rider with the sprocket gears stuck in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went in behind his right ear and pulled his scalp back a bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards say stretches of the path near popular South Bay beaches are 
particularly dangerous. Beach-goers frequently dart across the path, oblivious 
to the crush of oncoming bike and skate traffic. Inevitably, collisions occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach have installed 
flashing lights that, when activated on crowded days, warn cyclists to walk 
their bikes along busy sections of the path. The lights have significantly 
curbed the number of accidents in those areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many path enthusiasts believe trail rules are haphazardly enforced. Bikers 
say they receive tickets if they ride on pedestrian walkways, but they believe 
tickets are rarely issued to pedestrians or skaters who use the bike path. 
</P>
<P>
 They may have a point. Police have been wary of cracking down on a 
recreational activity that is a petty violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, where roller-skating on the path is almost as popular as 
cycling, police issued about 25 citations to skaters last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We normally wait until a complaint is made," Capt. Robert Cashion said. 
"Technically, they are in violation of the law and, if there was an accident, a 
skater could be held liable." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent problems, the beach bike trail remains one of the county's most 
spectacular successes, according to those who were behind its construction. 
</P>
<P>
 It was conceived in the early 1970s by Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude, a 
cycling enthusiast who saw the need for a continuous path along the coast for 
the region's bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude coordinated a joint project with Los Angeles County through Kenneth J. 
Hahn and the late Burton Chace, both supervisors at the time. The city and 
county approved the project over the objections of environmentalists worried 
about paving on the area's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the construction was completed between 1973 and 1976, with the final 
1.2-mile strip in front of Santa Monica's famed Gold Coast colony of movie 
stars finished in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The path cost about $2.5 million in state, county and city funds. The county 
spends about $200,000 annually on cleaning and maintaining 14.6 miles of the 
path, with local cities tending to the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, millions have swarmed over the trail -- even on cold winter 
days, when the route, viewed from Vista del Mar Boulevard north of El Segundo, 
looks like a human fly strip against the background of deserted beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude says it remains one of his proudest achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "My blood is in that walk and I feel the bike path is one of my greatest 
accomplishments," Braude said. He regularly bikes on the path and sports a scar 
on his knee from a scrape he suffered a few years ago when he bumped into 
another cyclist. "It's one of the cheapest public investments in terms of cost 
and how many use it per day." 
</P>
<P>
 But he, too, sees trouble from the path's mix of users and is investigating 
ways to make it safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have too many people in a playground, injuries go up," he said. 
"You may pay a price for that, for having too good a parade." 
</P>
<P>
 For many people, drawn by the ocean vistas, sea breezes and a track that is 
smoother than surface streets, the path is almost magical. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like this in Kansas," said Sara Lundberg, 18, a vacationing 
in-line skater who made her way down the path in Hermosa Beach on a recent 
afternoon. "This is probably the best surface I've ever been on." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Juliet Sanchez-Hassan, a resident of Manhattan Beach and a 
Santa Monica city staffer, use the path to commute to work. Sanchez-Hassan says 
she has been riding the 31-mile round trip daily for four years, a trek that 
takes about 45 minutes each way. Winter nights can be particularly spooky 
around Playa del Rey, where Sanchez-Hassan relies on her 16-watt halogen bike 
lamps because there are no lights on the path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Biking to work is often faster than getting stuck on the freeway," 
Sanchez-Hassan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikers and in-line skaters debate which group causes the most safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bikers blame the increased risk on the influx of in-line skaters, whose 
numbers have swollen in recent years and whose etiquette can differ markedly 
from that of cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists say skaters take up more space on the path by kicking their legs side 
to side and swaying their arms to propel themselves along the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some skaters are also always wearing headphones, and when you scream 'On your 
left!' as you're trying to pass them, they never hear you," said Ilana Israel, 
a regular path cyclist and employee at Helen's Cycles in Santa Monica. She has 
so far avoided injury on the path. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Lorne, 17, of Pacific Palisades, was riding near the Santa Monica Pier 
recently when a skater cut him off, sending him to the pavement with numerous 
"road rashes" on his knees, elbows and thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got up and he started yelling at me that it was my fault -- he wasn't even 
supposed to be on the bike path," Lorne said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Skaters counter that they outnumber cyclists and that the bikes-only rule is 
outdated. Many say their speeds are consistent with that of cyclists. The 
in-line skaters, in turn, blame pedestrians for trouble on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you'll see them, a typical family of four abreast, just strolling 
along the bike path," said Bob Lagunoff, a dedicated skater and owner of 
Skatey's, an in-line skating shop in Venice. "Why don't they walk on the 
pedestrian path?" 
</P>
<P>
 But in Hermosa Beach, skaters and pedestrians are permitted on the path. On 
crowded days, the mix makes for some serious swerving, as cyclists pass skaters 
who are trying to avoid pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most bike-path users agree about the worst problem: "weekend warrior" 
skaters and cyclists -- office workers who explode in a blaze of speed on the 
path come Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 County lifeguards say the greatest dangers are when such skaters -- some 
wearing brightly colored, tight-fitting uniforms and often sporting five-wheel 
speed blades with no brakes and no helmets -- try to pass clumps of people. 
Cyclists going full throttle on 16-speed racing bikes contribute to the menace. 
Add a few hairpin turns and some sand on the roadway and you have the makings 
of a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 "On days like this, I don't even think about going fast," said Bill Carr, 45, 
who slowly cruised the crowded path in Hermosa Beach recently on his 21-speed 
mountain bike. When Carr wants to race at high speeds, he heads for quiet roads 
near his home in Rancho Palos Verdes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the path safer, users, police and lifeguards offer such suggestions as 
mandatory helmets for everyone (only cyclists under age 18 must wear them; 
there is no such rule for skaters) and warning signs for dangerous areas and 
crosswalks at designated areas so path users would know where to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Redondo Beach, where the path weaves along Harbor Drive and through a busy 
parking lot near the pier, the city plans to begin construction of several 
ramps that will allow cyclists to ride over the lot and avoid the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, some even call for a separate path for skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Dianna Pollard, an architect at Studio Architecture, a firm hired by the Los 
Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks to design the Venice Beach Ocean 
Front Walk refurbishment, said the group's latest plan includes a separate lane 
for in-line skaters. In addition, a 22-inch-high concrete wall would line the 
west side of the path to provide seating and block out sand. 
</P>
<P>
 French expatriate and dedicated bicyclist Michele Forest offers a distinctive 
European solution: "They should just build huge roller rinks on the beach 
somewhere for the skaters to go round and round." 
</P>
<P>
 To deter one of the county's most popular attractions from slipping into 
anarchy, Nadirak Rama, a clerk at a Santa Monica Beach in-line skate rental 
trailer, offered a recognizable refrain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't we all just get along?" he said with a wink.

PORT OF LOS ANGELES; MASSIVE DREDGING TO ADD THOUSANDS OF JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners says thousands of jobs will be 
generated in Southern California over the next three years under a 
$148.6-million contract awarded last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract for a major three-year dredging project in the Port of Los 
Angeles is the largest dredging and landfill contract in the history of the 
United States, said Dwayne Lee, deputy executive director of development for 
the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois-based Great Lakes Dredging and Dock Co. and Connolly-Pacific Co. of 
Long Beach will begin dredging a new channel from the breakwater to Pier 300 on 
Terminal Island next month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Water depths will be increased to 63 feet to accommodate deep-draft container 
ships and larger vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 The tons of material dredged from the harbor will be used to construct a rock 
dike that will become the new Pier 400. Eventually covering 582 acres in the 
port's outer harbor, the structure will help accommodate an expected doubling 
of cargo by the year 2020, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long range, Pier 400 will house the port's liquid bulk petroleum 
facilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The harbor board expects 2,100 jobs will be created during the peak year of 
construction in 1995. No estimates were available on how many permanent jobs 
might be created by the project. SUSAN WOODWARD

HERMOSA BEACH; ANTI-DRILLING MEASURE QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a plan to drill for oil here have gathered enough signatures to 
place an anti-drilling initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Hermosa Beach Environmental Protection Initiative gathered 
1,628 signatures in the hope of quashing a plan by MacPherson Oil Co. of Santa 
Monica to dig 30 wells at a slant under the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will probably vote next week whether to put the initiative on 
the November ballot in conjunction with the statewide election, said Mayor Sam 
Y. Edgerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue that's too big for the City Council to take on," Edgerton said. 
"It must be left up to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Donald MacPherson Jr., president of the oil company, said a vote either 
way will have no impact on the project. His firm has spent more than $2 million 
on the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really irrelevant if (the initiative) gets on any ballot," MacPherson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company's project was endorsed by the State Lands Commission in March, 
but still requires the approval of the California Coastal Commission. 
MacPherson hopes to begin drilling by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company engineers expect the wells to produce 27 million barrels of oil 
over the next 25 years, generating as much as $104 million for the city. JAMES 
BENNING

QUARTERBACK KLEIN CONTINUES TO BE MAN IN MOTION; FOOTBALL: OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR 
SCHOOL-HOPPING, 'MR. TRANSFER' TURNED STAMP OF APPROVAL AT C.W. POST INTO 
OPPORTUNITY FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports agent Gary Wichard says that Perry Klein's story, the rags-to-riches 
tale of a controversial quarterback, will make a best-seller someday. 
</P>
<P>
 An appropriate title might be "The Post Man Always Rings Twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, after all, had been knocking on doors for some time until he found a 
football program that allowed him to showcase his talent. It all came together 
last season at tiny C.W. Post in Brookville, N.Y., where Klein set a bushel of 
NCAA Division II passing records, caught the attention of NFL scouts and wound 
up being drafted in the fourth round by the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the third quarterback taken overall, after Tennessee's Heath Shuler and 
Fresno State's Trent Dilfer were among the top six picks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an improbable turn of events for Klein, who had become better known for 
changing schools than throwing touchdown passes until finding his niche in the 
run-and-shoot offense at C.W. Post. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to work hard and be successful," Klein said by phone from 
Atlanta. "I'm not trying to gloat. I've had a bumpy road. I think it makes me 
appreciate everything a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 The path appears to be getting smoother all the time for the 23-year-old 
Malibu native. He has been encouraged by his early meetings with Falcons Coach 
June Jones and quarterback coach Mouse Davis. He is now looking for a place to 
live in Atlanta. And on Sunday, Klein will marry his girlfriend of three years, 
Cari Delson, a former volleyball player at Pepperdine and at Irvine High. After 
a brief honeymoon in Laguna Beach, Klein will report to camp with the Falcons 
on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all fitting together for Perry," said Klein's mother, Diana. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two years ago, though, Klein's football career was in disarray. He 
left UC Berkeley in the middle of the 1992 season after three frustrating years 
as a backup. He wasn't sure what his next move would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Wichard. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful agent whose NFL clients include linebacker Ken Norton Jr. of the 
San Francisco 49ers and tight end Keith Jackson of the Miami Dolphins, Wichard 
was a friend of Klein's father, Danny, a Malibu neighbor, when he met Perry for 
the first time in the summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Jets receiver Rob Moore, one of Wichard's clients, was in town and 
wanted to work out with a quarterback. Although Wichard was a College Division 
All-America quarterback at C.W. Post in 1971, he knew Moore needed a younger, 
stronger arm to throw to him. Wichard called Klein, whose passing and 
athleticism made an immediate impression on the agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see right away he was one of the most talented quarterbacks I had 
ever seen," Wichard said. "He just jumps out at you. I figured he would be 
playing for Cal that season, and I said, 'Good luck.' I was going to keep my 
eye on him as a potential client." 
</P>
<P>
 When Klein left Cal six games into the 1992 season, he called Wichard, who has 
since become the player's agent and is negotiating his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was frustrated," Wichard said. "Maybe (leaving Cal) was a mistake. I said, 
'Let's turn a negative into a positive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid having Klein sit out a season, which he would have been obligated to 
do had he transferred to a Division I school, Wichard suggested that the 
quarterback transfer to a lower-division school. 
</P>
<P>
 He called C.W. Post Coach Tom Marshall, who was the offensive coordinator when 
Wichard played there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard of it," Klein said of C.W. Post. "At that point, I just 
wanted to have an opportunity to play. It wasn't like I was looking down on the 
school. I liked the idea that it was in New York. That was an exciting thing 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wichard said leaving the West Coast was the best thing for Klein, who had 
earned the nickname "Mr. Transfer" for his highly publicized school-hopping in 
high school. After enjoying a record-breaking junior season at Palisades High, 
Klein transferred to Carson for his senior season and helped the Colts win the 
1988 City Section 4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 After the football season, the Kleins gave up an apartment in Carson and Perry 
transferred to Santa Monica, where he finished his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, the events portrayed Klein as an opportunist, a spoiled rich kid, 
who, with the help of his family, was making a mockery of poorly enforced 
transfer rules in his pursuit of a bigger, better deal. The press had a field 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Klein says his only regret is that he did not finish his senior 
year at Carson. "I always said that I never meant to hurt anyone, or take 
anything away from a school," he said. "A lot was written at the time, and I 
took a lot of heat. To go through that when I was young was tough. But I've 
used it to fuel my fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things didn't go right for me at Cal, a lot of people were probably 
saying, 'Here he goes again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The way Wichard saw it, Klein was caught in the middle of two movements at 
Cal. As a freshman and sophomore, he played behind an older, more experienced 
and more popular quarterback in Mike Pawlawski. When Pawlawski left, and the 
starting job appeared to be Klein's by seniority, new Coach Keith Gilbertson 
went with a younger quarterback, sophomore Dave Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein may have undermined his junior season when he walked out of spring 
practice. He returned two days later and apologized to the team, but the damage 
was already done. Klein got off to a bad start with a new coach and lost his 
teammates' respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to unseat Barr, Klein left Cal after a particularly humiliating 
experience. Playing against USC before family and friends at the Coliseum, 
Klein got in for one play, was blindsided and lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3 Klein committed himself to weightlifting after leaving Cal and 
bulked up to his present weight of 210 pounds. Faster and stronger, he went out 
and rewrote virtually all of C.W. Post's passing records. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1993 season, Klein had passed for 3,757 yards and accounted 
for 4,052 yards in total offense, both Division II records. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could dispute the numbers Klein put up, but some questioned the 
competition he was facing. This was, after all, Division II football. 
</P>
<P>
 Wichard, though, never had any doubts that Klein was NFL material. He rattled 
off a long list of quarterbacks who excelled in the NFL after playing at small 
colleges: Terry Bradshaw, Ken Anderson, Dan Pastorini. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Falcons use a run-and-shoot offense, their interest in Klein was 
understandable. He was the 111th player selected in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real excited because I worked so hard for it," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, does Klein have anything to say to those who doubted and criticized him in 
the past? A last laugh, so to speak? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, that's not what this is all about," he said. "It's about Perry Klein and 
me being happy. It doesn't make me happy to make other people look bad. I don't 
feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's nice to overcome odds."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: UNCLE BILL'S BEACH BREAKFAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To paraphrase an old Motown hit, "Summer's here and the time is right for 
breakfast at the beach." Actually, when Martha and the Vandellas' "Dancing in 
the Street" was making its way to No. 2 on the charts in 1964, Jack Gabriel was 
buying a flower shop in Manhattan Beach and turning it into a restaurant. 
Thirty years later, Uncle Bill's is still among the most popular in that most 
popular category of beach restaurants, the breakfast place. 
</P>
<P>
 Located a block from the ocean, Uncle Bill's has the alternately laid-back and 
hectic feeling of a true beach restaurant. Hordes of regulars don't mind 
waiting for a table, don't bother to look at the menu and often don't even have 
to tell the waitress what they want -- she already knows.  
</P>
<P>
 The food at Uncle Bill's will not finesse anyone with its subtleties and 
nuances, but the large portions of well-prepared breakfast and lunch fare, 
combined with the neighborhood feel and the location, explain why the faithful 
fill the seats.  
</P>
<P>
 The popular potatoes stroganoff ($4.25) are hash browns sauteed with bacon, 
and Jack or Cheddar cheese, topped with sour cream. If that's not enough for 
you, try the potatoes Del Riego ($5.25), named for a customer who wanted more 
on his 'browns. This version takes the stroganoff and adds avocado, bell 
peppers and onions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancakes are also favorites; one contains chocolate chips, blueberries and 
cinnamon apples ($3.75). Among the omelets, the Expo '73 ($5.75) combines ham, 
bacon, sausage, cheese, mushrooms and onions with a meat sauce and sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch highlights include the various grilled sourdough sandwiches ($4.75), 
such as roast beef and Cheddar or ham, Cheddar and Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Bill's Pancake House is at 1305 Highland Ave., Manhattan Beach. (310) 
545-5177. Open Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Saturday and 
Sunday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

LIFEGUARDS: LIGHT READING FOR THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have occasionally been stirred by well-written articles in The Times.Now 
that I've retired, I feel no hindrance of work to keep me from telling you I 
really enjoyed the article on lifeguard training (June 16). 
</P>
<P>
 The article was very entertaining and informative, with just the right amount 
of sensitivity and done with good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 I look forward to seeing more of the section's articles.

CABLE TV: READER URGES UNIFORMITY OF SERVICE, FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have recently moved to Lomita from Carson. In Carson, I enjoyed using 
Continental Cable Vision. The fees were reasonable, their system was modern, 
without a cable box, and I received many channels. Since my move to Lomita, I 
have been forced to switch to Copley Connelly Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 After having a cable box installed on my 35-inch TV, I realized this cable 
system didn't handle picture-in-picture capabilities. Nor was I able to use 
some of the features my VCR provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable was not installed correctly, I was given an obviously used remote, 
the clock wasn't illuminating correctly and I now have to use a separate remote 
for changing channels and manipulating the volume. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, when I change channels my TV gives off a horrible, wrenching 
sound. I hook my TV through my stereo speakers and this sound is obviously 
doing damage to my speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 I also receive fewer channels with Copley. 
</P>
<P>
 I called and spoke to a supervisor who informed me I would require two cable 
boxes to use the features my TV and VCR had. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not run into any of these problems with Continental. I was told by 
Copley that I would have to be charged $4 extra per month, on top of the close 
to $50 per month bill, to use the second box, even though I would only need it 
once in a while. My TV is 5 years old. The features I mentioned are not new.  
</P>
<P>
 If Continental Cable is able to accommodate my TV and at a cheaper price, why 
can't Copley? If each cable company is not going to provide the same services, 
then I should have a choice of which cable company I want to use. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the $4, I was told by a supervisor at Copley that I could afford it and 
that he looks forward to getting it from me. He's right. I can afford it. The 
point is, I shouldn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
 I am being discriminated against because I have a nice TV. If their equipment 
is not modernized so that it can accommodate modern TVs, they should be held 
responsible -- not the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge that everyone write a letter to their City Hall, their senator and the 
Federal Communications Commission and demand that the monopoly of cable 
companies be abolished or that each company provide equal services.

 Jay Leno, on the question of whether witnesses in the O.J. Simpson hearing and 
trial can be believed if they sold their stories to the National Enquirer: "The 
question should be, can anyone be trusted if you see them reading the National 
Enquirer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on the rock group Pearl Jam testifying before Congress about the high 
cost of concert tickets: "That was kind of nice. It was kind of refreshing to

 The FBI has opened its first field office in Moscow. To honor the historic 
event, comedy writer Bob Mills says, Russian leaders dressed the body of Lenin 
in one of the late J. Edgar Hoover's black lace gowns.

 Mills also reports that under new rules instituted by the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare, college students now have 30 years -- rather 
than the previous 10 years -- to default on government loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Perot has told Republican leaders that he would run the U.S. government 
just like a business. Comic Argus Hamilton agrees: "He'd take one look at the 
books and then burn us down for the insurance money."

 Comedy writer Tony Peyser's crime and court watch:

Police arrived quickly but said the crooks already had a head start of seven 
furlongs. They placed the odds of catching them at 9-5.

 Hundreds of new laws went into effect all over the country on July 1. In

Oak Ridge Boys cassettes.

VIDEO VOGUE; SINGERS FINDING SOME DESIGNER CLOTHES SUITABLE

 Current music videos offer a few good hair and clothing ideas for hot summer 
days, as well as continuing evidence that musicians are moving toward tailored 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dread No More: Yes, that really is Seal with newly bald head and striking 
tailored suit in "A Prayer for the Dying." He takes the ultra-cool designer 
minimalism favored by jazz and R&B artists one step further by going to the 
top. The singer first asked for a custom suit from Richard Tyler, but tight 
production deadlines made that impossible. The final choice was a sleek black 
Giorgio Armani suit off the rack, which fit him perfectly and ends up getting 
as much attention from the camera as the singer. Seal's not-for-everyone 
fashion tip: Skip the shirt and tie and accessorize with a smooth bare chest. 
Not for the Squeamish: One of the most arresting videos out is Nine Inch Nails' 
"Closer." It's a sexy, stylized, sepia-toned mix of vintage-meets-industrial 
rock. Old photos come to life amid science experiments, shots of singer Trent 
Reznor floating mid-air and Francis Bacon-inspired sides of beef. Its fashion 
statement mixes a tough metal-and-leather look with current fashion, such as an 
Anna Sui crocheted shirt -- which here is cut up -- and tattoo-look bodysuits 
by Jean Paul Gaultier. Stylist April Napier picked up dishraggy shirts from 
Souled Out in London, the Sui shirt at Maxfield and Jean Colonna PVC pants from 
Gallay on Melrose. Old leather pieces were rented from Warner Bros.Napier had 
the incredible Jules Verne sunglasses made at Old Focals in Pasadena, where 
they doctored up welder's glasses with oversized screws and leather sides.

 Next Up: Janet Jackson's sexy video "You Want This," being edited and readied

designer Mossimo as one of the young men pursued across the desert by Jackson 
and her dancers. Mossimo is a friend who has done shirts, bodywear, belts and 
accessories for Jackson's past videos and tours, but not this time. What 
Jackson wears in the new video is still under wraps. Meanwhile, Jackson's 
softer "Any Time, Any Place" video still tops the airplay charts. Fans of that 
video's long, sheer, faded floral dresses and skirts can find similar filmy 
styles at Neo Romantic in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thing to Do: Layer crop tops. In her "Back and Forth,"15-year-old singer 
Aaliyah layers tiny white and black tops, while Salt-N-Pepa's Pepa wears a 
cropped vest over a crop top in "Heaven 'N Hell." In Aerosmith's "Crazy," 
parochial-school escapees Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler (lead singer Steven 
Tyler's daughter) wear a variety of cropped tops. Stylist Lauren Ehrenfeld 
picked up the blue vintage Angora sweater at American Rag and put it over a 
classic underwear tank, then scissored both off below the bust line and added 
Plein Sud plastic-coated pants from one of her favorite stops, Bullock's 
contemporary department on the Beverly Center's seventh floor. Ehrenfeld found 
plaid schoolgirl skirts in Sue Mills, a Santa Monica uniform shop, and small 
men's saddle shoes for the girls at American Rag.  
</P>
<P>
 Another Good Look: Never mind what Dorothy Parker would say. Lisa Loeb makes 
it OK to wear your nerd glasses with a sexy dress and high heels in her video 
"Stay." The black lace-front mini-dress with an empire waist and scoop neck is 
by Betsey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxi Driver: Yes, that's supermodel Shana driving the cab in John Mellencamp's 
and Me'shell Ndege'Ocello's "Wild Night." You know her as the one in the white 
bathing suit in Calvin Klein's Escape TV ads. Moonlighting as a cabby was a 
smart move -- it scored her a chance to read for the part of the love interest 
in the upcoming "Batman Forever."

 The Movie: "Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Life of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks, pictured), a Southern man with a 
"below normal" IQ, and his childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright, pictured). The 
story spans the early 1950s to the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: London-based Joanna Johnston, whose credits include 
"Back to the Future," "Death Becomes Her," "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" 
and "Far and Away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Doubtful to launch any fashion movements, Gump Style can only be 
called half-boy, half-nerd. Throughout 83 clothing changes, the beauty in the 
costuming, however, is in its consistency through the decades. When the 
inevitable "Saturday Night Live" skit comes around, you can be sure Gump will 
wear a blue plaid shirt buttoned to the top, pressed cotton chinos, "Leave It 
to Beaver" striped socks and -- for the year's fashion product endorsement 
extraordinaire -- Nike athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Short Hair Day: Gump's ungainly, stubby razor cut evolved from the theory that 
his mama would have sent him to the barbershop every week and as an adult he'd 
think of no reason to do differently, agreed Johnston and director Robert 
Zemeckis. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing the Masses: Tens of thousands of costumes were employed for the epic 
story involving 143 speaking parts and thousands of extras shot in 11 states. 
For the most part, the non-principals' clothes were culled from vintage 
clothing vendors all over the country. "We accumulated warehouses full of 
clothes," Johnston says. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "It was a big logistical challenge," Johnston says. "Funnily enough, 
the script didn't read as big. We all thought it would be a nice little love 
story. But it just grew in preparations. Bob Zemeckis has the most brilliant, 
crazy mind. You had to be able to say, 'Winter, New York, 1972,' and 
immediately know the look." 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: While many contemporary films tend to make '60s clothes look ghastly, 
Jenny's hippie days are wistfully beautiful. Standouts include two Afghanistan 
embroidered coats (one custom-made locally in wine velvet, one vintage 
Mongolian lamb), antique petticoats and her antique silk georgette wedding 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: The exceedingly average-looking blue plaid shirt that Gump wears at 
the bus stop bench was custom-made by Venice Custom Shirts in Los Angeles. "I 
laid it out very, very carefully. I wanted all the plaid mismatching and one 
side of the collar slightly longer than the other so it looks cheap," Johnston 
says. For that matter, Gump's ordinary trousers and suits were custom-made as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Masses of research included photos of mental patients and 
Southerners in the 1940s and period Sears Roebuck and Montgomery Ward 
catalogues. For Jenny's '60s phase, photos of French singer Francoise Hardy as 
well as personal photo albums of friends were used. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Aside from vintage clothes, most of the costumes were made in 
production wardrobe departments in three states. BETTY GOODWIN

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: IT'S AN AD OF A DIFFERENT COLOR, PERSPECTIVE

 L.A. Raiders wide receiver Willie Gault is about to show the world his bum. 
The arty, black and white photo of Gault's undressed, silhouetted physique is 
one of several in B.U.M. Equipment's first national ad campaign. How soon the 
world sees Gault-as-Adonis, though, depends on the acceptance of the 
provocative image by major retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, initially at least, wanted to make a splash with the ads. No one 
expected it to take so long. Fred Davis, corporate creative director of parent 
company Chavin International Inc., said the ad featuring Gault was shot more 
than a year ago. Although retailers say they like the photo -- and have 
besieged Davis with requests for color Xeroxes -- some think it's unsuitable 
for a line of clothing that appeals to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as making a statement," Gault said. "For so long, black men have not 
been shown in a sensual way in the marketplace. When you look across the 
country you see black men in ads and billboards playing non-threatening 
character roles. This gave me a chance to show that sensual side." 
</P>
<P>
 From the rear. Color copies, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 He's in the Building: Very cool Olympic skater Elvis Stojko had all the female 
ice skaters' hearts throbbing when he took to the ice late last week at the 
Culver City Ice Arena for a practice session. We, of course, were only 
interested in what he was wearing. When he finally stopped spinning like a 
dervish, we unscrambled what was on his black T: a big old picture of our 
earliest hero, Popeye the sailor man, and, on the back, words to live by: "I 
yam what I yam." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheers: Everybody wants to talk about models using heroin to keep their weight 
down, and, yeah, OK, it works. But can't we talk about something more positive? 
More '90s? Like Power Punch Energy Drink (the Fashion Potion)? 
</P>
<P>
 The slender, model crowd in L.A. is mad for this 75-cent-a-shot herbal elixir. 
So are Aaron Spelling, Joan Collins, Linda Evans and Yanni. In fact, the sound 
you hear at about 3 p.m. on the Westside is the slurp, slurp, slurp of 
sub-energetic beauties sucking up Power Punch's 11 grams of Chinese herbs and 
vitamins. Stamina. Vitality. The energy needed to smile cheerily after being 
rejected for a part. Yes!  
</P>
<P>
 Models Lizanne Falsetto and Garrett Jennings concocted the elixir with the 
help of Chinese herbalists while living in Hong Kong. They married, bought a 
house in Ventura and began selling the punch 2 1/2 years ago through health 
food stores and mail order: (800) 643-2057. 
</P>
<P>
 Power Punch, Falsetto said, satisfies our search for "inner beauty" and the 
chic brunet is her own best testimony. In a four-day period, we spotted her on 
the runway at three different fashion shows. She works out three hours a day. 
And her husband has just signed on for another year as the Gillette man. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sincerest Form of Flattery: Speaking of models, a throng of them had a 
TV-watching party the other night to get a load of the show that purports to 
tell their life stories, "Models Inc." The verdict? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so unreal," one party-goer said. "Models getting their own beach 
house? That happened about 10 years ago." But the truth is, if anybody did a 
show about how models really live, no one would watch. Most practice good clean 
living and turn in before "Models Inc." is over.  
</P>
<P>
 The real-life models poked a bit of fun at the TV show's pretenders -- one of 
whom is so short that everyone around her must remove their shoes to make her 
look, well, tallish. (Charlene Tilton resurrected?) "The best one," observed 
the pro, "was the girl who got killed in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Here Come the Brides: Actress Elizabeth Shue may wear a pricey Vera Wang 
wedding gown for her upcoming nuptials, but when it came to the shoes, Shue 
went the moderate route, selecting Kenneth Cole's simple, classic wedding shoe 
called Sculpture for herself and step-in mules for her bridesmaids . . . 
Meanwhile, Natasha Richardson was wed this past weekend in a private ceremony 
to hunky Liam Neeson. But the really important aspect of the event is that she 
was wearing Donna Karan. Let's get our priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
 You're Not Getting Older, You're Getting, Uh, Riper: We know her breasts are 
the size of honeydew melons, and that she's seen it all, done it all. Now, 
thanks to her high school yearbook, we also know good-time girl Anka 
Radakovich's real age is 37, not 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, what sounded like great naughty fun in her raunchy Details column now 
seems, we don't know, a bit depraved. "I want to start my own band," Radakovich 
writes in the current issue, "Anka & the Implants. We will wear baby-doll 
nighties and play alternative striptease rock with post-punk Emersonian utopian 
lyrics." Perhaps we're being too harsh on the old girl. But that's what comes 
with being 39. Really.

HIS VOICE IS SLOW, HE LISTENS CLOSELY, HIS TALES ENTHRALL; MINOR HERESIES MAJOR 
DEPARTURES, A CHINA MISSION BOYHOOD BY JOHN ESPEY . UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 
PRESS; $25, 349 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCHUYLER INGLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have suffered mightily for being a man of slowly spoken words. Few indeed 
are the patient listeners. So it was with great satisfaction some years back 
that I met John Espey, author of the recently published "Minor Heresies, Major 
Departures: A China Mission Boyhood." 
</P>
<P>
 I had been attending a writing class, the instructor's wife had grown woefully 
ill, and Espey stepped in to take over for the rest of the quarter. His voice 
caught my immediate attention -- not just for its rumbling bass tone but for 
its slow, mellifluous cadence as well. Here was a man who spoke more slowly 
than I, and he had my complete attention. It was about that time that I learned 
how much a help it is to the listener when the slow speaker actually has 
something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 And Espey did. He would listen patiently to readings of his students' dreadful 
prose, comment here or there, then somehow gently drift into a tale of his own. 
And the tale would go on and on and on, weaving in and out of a childhood spent 
in China, the ways of a Presbyterian missionary father and mother, life under 
C.S. Lewis at Oxford, a certain taste for gin while grading papers. 
</P>
<P>
 And always, just about the end of class, the story would congeal, come rapidly 
to a point, turn on a surprising series of events and awarenesses that would 
literally pull out the listener's breath in a way that fired up the heart like 
a forge. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Espey never really told his writing students what to do in the 
way of storytelling. He simply demonstrated. He also consumed the majority of 
class time, a neat trick for the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 I searched used bookstores and came up with a first edition of his collection 
of childhood reminiscences, "Minor Heresies." Alfred A. Knopf had published it 
in 1944. I remember marveling at one story after another. There I was, after 
all, something of a student of writing, beginning to realize that I was at the 
knee of a master.  
</P>
<P>
 Espey's voice carried with the resonant surety of a temple bell through each 
and every story, a voice that balanced delicately between the self-deprecating 
humor of the adult and the wide-eyed wonder of the child. Few indeed are the 
mature writers who can give their child memoirs a child's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Espey is one. 
</P>
<P>
 Two volumes followed the publishing of "Minor Heresies": "Tales Out of School" 
and "The Other City." It is from these three volumes that Espey has drawn what 
he calls "all the chapters I wish to preserve" for inclusion in "Minor 
Heresies, Major Departures." 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Shanghai in 1913 and was more or less raised in that city until 
he left to attend college. The lucky reader is taken back not just to an 
earlier time, but to a place and time that no longer exist, all of it seen 
through the eyes of a growing boy and a reflective, bemused adult.  
</P>
<P>
 Espey's world was divided between the mission, school and the city. He never 
once loses track of the fact that he didn't simply come to Shanghai like so 
many other Westerners, but was born there. It's as though he is part Chinese 
without the ability to actually be so, and this quirk of fate colors his 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is something else in these stories, also from another time and 
place, and that is the sense that they may well have all been spoken out loud, 
told as stories by a man with a magnificent grip on his language, his sense of 
humor and timing, and his sense of audience. What with the rise of television 
and all, we have so few opportunities today to simply sit around on an evening 
and tell each other our stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Espey comes from a time of slow speaking and close listening. It is a joy that 
the experience is here for the rest of us, preserved on the printed page.

RSVP; IT'S THE SEASON TO BE BOWLED OVER 
</P>

 It's not really summer till the Hollywood Bowl opens. 
</P>
<P>
 The 73rd season opened Tuesday night, with picnickers jostling wicker baskets, 
stacks of plastic dishes, bottles of wine and plaid tablecloths. It was 
sunshiny and warm when they came, chilly and time to wrap up in afghans as the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra finished Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2 in E 
minor, op. 27 near 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hollywood Bowl is like having a picnic in a closet," said Nancy Wayte at 
Box 831, exchanging grapes, crackers and cheese for a plate of chicken with 
raspberry dressing. She and her husband, Alan, a Philharmonic board member for 
eons, were celebrating their 19th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma and David McIntyre piled everything for their picnic on the cement 
foundation of their center box; the Fibber McGee trick seemed to work 
beautifully, messy or no. 
</P>
<P>
 Haute couture was missing, although Annette O'Malley looked fashionable in her 
green and pink knit outfit, which matched Dodgers owner-husband Peter's green 
and white striped shirt. Sitting with husband Al, Bobbie Rush moved the afghan 
on her knees to her shoulders as the temperatures sunk. Artist Marion 
Siciliano, whose husband Rocco Siciliano is past president of the Philharmonic, 
scurried about in black Reeboks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boxes sported piles of shrimp. Others had popcorn. Said Olin Barrett, 
next to his wife, Ann: "Popcorn -- it's healthful." Ann and George Riordan 
feasted on pork won-tons and shish kebabs over pasta on a huge platter with 
strawberries that Martha and Jon Keates brought from Claremont. Barry and 
Martha Berkett -- overladen with towers of fresh peach pie, fried chicken, 
grilled vegetables and pasta salads -- barely made it down the ramps to their 
box. 
</P>
<P>
 John Welborne introduced his fiancee, Martha Lampkin, the Boston/Chicago 
architect who became an Angeleno three days ago. She's joined Skidmore Owings & 
Merrill, which has a contract to help refurbish the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere, the atmosphere was folksy and upbeat. In the crowd: Friends of the 
Hollywood Bowl President Joan Stubbs and husband John, Penne and Bill Durst, 
Laney and Tom Techentin with son Warren, Dean and Joan Schneider, Wally and 
Vida Fassler, Pat and Bill Bedford, Jane and Howard Lipstone, Harold Williams 
and Nancy Englander, Richard and Susie Grodiner, Jim and Jonnie Neville, Betsy 
and Carl Anderson (who next week move to Westport, Conn., to be at their home 
base while she studies Episcopal theology at Yale), and Sam and Cynthia Coleman 
and their daughter Katie, who were entertaining John and Kathy Russell III and 
their son, John IV.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: SPORTS STARS SCORE BIG BUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Tuesday's ninth annual Cedars-Sinai Sports Spectacular fund-raising 
dinner at the Century Plaza Hotel. This is said to be the most prestigious 
sports dinner in the country. Talking about society's fascination with 
athletes, attorney F. Lee Bailey said: "Sports are the last frontier of the 
all-American spirit. They're totally benign, certainly healthy and a clean form 
of combat. If lawyers pull something dirty, you might not catch it. But in 
sports, it's all out in the open." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The dinner was chaired by Marv Chanin and emceed by Tommy 
Lasorda. Presented with Man of the Year awards in their respective sports were 
Dodger catcher Mike Piazza, the Clippers' Dominique Wilkins (who was unable to 
attend) and Rams running back Jerome Bettis. Lifetime Achievement awards went 
to Joe DiMaggio and Joe Montana, both repeatedly referred to as legends. In 
DiMaggio's case it's certain. Montana, who is still playing, said, "Hopefully 
not yet" regarding legend status. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crowd: Predominantly male. It was as though they'd taken the entire 
membership of a West L.A. gym, put them in suits and handed each a Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Details That Evoke Paralyzed Grins in Publicists: The evening's honorary 
chairman (and 1986 Lifetime Achievement honoree) was O.J. Simpson. And, until 
the company went out of business, the event was co-sponsored by Drexel Burnham 
Lambert, Michael Milken's junk bond dealing investment house. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Close to $600,000 was netted. This brought the total to more 
than $5 million the nine dinners have raised for Cedars' Medical Genetics-Birth 
Defects Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports Figure With Best Assets for a Second Career: Lasorda's booming voice 
makes him a perfect emcee. He basically just yells louder than the crowd talks. 
He's also full of choice expressions perfect for sports dinners. A sample would 
be his line on Bettis: "If you don't like that guy, you don't like Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: DiMaggio was asked how sports dinners have changed through the years: 
"How has baseball changed? How has the world changed? I was paid $10,000 a 
year, now players get $7 million. If the club owners are making a dollar and so 
are the players, I'm not knocking it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: Getting autographs. It was mostly kids doing it, but attorney Bob 
Shapiro was at the reception carrying a Broadway shopping bag filled with the 
three-dozen baseballs he and his son asked players to sign. He then left early 
to work on the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Observed: There was an extensive pre-dinner silent auction that included 
restaurant dinners and ski trips, but was geared mainly toward sports items. In 
the midst of fitness equipment, team jackets and every kind of autographed ball 
imaginable, stood a porcelain Barbie doll in a lace dress. Hey, it's the '90s. 
Barbie hangs out in the locker room.

 For the many journalists covering the World Cup, it was a chance to see a Los 
Angeles far removed from the stadiums, pressrooms and hotels where their time 
is normally concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents of the Eastside and other Los Angeles neighborhoods, it was an 
opportunity to show a different side of communities often viewed from the 
outside as caldrons of gang violence and ethnic tension. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday afternoon, a group of visiting journalists, tourism industry 
representatives and others took a bus tour of eastern Los Angeles as part of a 
community-based effort to give the visitors a touch of Los Angeles distinct 
from the glitzy image prevalent on glossy tourist brochures and promotional 
videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood chic, beach cool and mall-scene acquisitiveness this was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants on Wednesday viewed murals, learned about the Chicano arts and 
rights movements and spoke to new Mexican immigrants and ex-gang members now 
gainfully employed. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming days, visiting journalists -- taking advantage of a lull in the 
World Cup schedule -- will take similar tours of Pico-Union, Koreatown, 
Hollywood and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, residents of these neighborhoods have been devising itineraries 
designed to highlight their diverse communities, which are usually excluded 
from official promotion by the region's $8-billion tourist industry.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; BEACH PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of this week's Fourth of July disturbances, Huntington Beach 
police were putting the best spin they could on the city's continuing efforts 
to curb unruly holiday behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The police had worked with neighborhood and downtown groups over the past year 
in an effort to address the conditions that led to a near-riot on July 4, 
1993.With nearly double the expenditure for officer overtime this year, they 
reported an increase in arrests even though they said this year's unruliness 
was less serious than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while gradual progress toward orderly Fourths is a fond hope and 
maybe even a realistic expectation, the larger community in Huntington Beach 
still must decide what kind of holiday the city ultimately wants to have.  
</P>
<P>
 How much disruption is enough?  
</P>
<P>
 Given the large numbers attracted by the waterfront and a parade -- and hours 
of celebration before nightfall -- it's easy for the few to ruin things for the 
many after the official celebrations are over. Some of that happened Monday 
night despite the community efforts of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began recently to enforce more strictly a 10 p.m. curfew for youths. 
Should it expand the curfew? Are there ways to further improve communication so 
that potentially troublesome situations are headed off before they develop?  
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach has made gains, but it isn't quite there yet and has more 
work to do. In the year ahead, it must continue exploring these questions.

HOMER IN NINTH BEATS DODGERS; BASEBALL: TWO-RUN SHOT BY EXPOS' FLETCHER OFF 
WORRELL NEGATES BUTLER'S BLAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the unexpected, and sometimes quirky, things that happen during a season 
that gives a team a good feeling about its chances, such as Brett Butler 
turning into a power hitter the season he turned 37 years old. Or Butler 
scoring from second base the other night on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night at Dodger Stadium, Butler hit his sixth home run of the 
season, sending Pedro Martinez' 1-0 pitch into the seats just inside the 
right-field foul pole for a two-run homer. And for six innings, it appeared to 
be enough for a Dodger victory. But in the ninth inning, with the Dodgers 
leading 2-1, Todd Worrell gave up a two-run homer to Darrin Fletcher, giving 
the Montreal Expos a 4-2 victory before 37,741 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Worrell (3-4) has faltered in six appearances, having 
converted his last five save opportunities. He went on to give up another run 
in the inning, after Wil Cordero doubled and then eventually scored on a 
groundout, and walked to the dugout to a chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first series the Dodgers have lost in their last four, and the first 
of this home stand. Before the series with the Expos, they beat the San 
Francisco Giants, two games to one, and the Philadelphia Phillies, 3-1. Before 
the home stand, they took two of three games from the Houston Astros -- in the 
Astrodome -- where they hardly ever win. The Dodgers are 6-4 during the home 
stand and have won eight of their last 13 games, and they are not even hitting 
all that well. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say we have been flat or we're not doing this or we are that, well we 
are in first place," Butler said. "I think we are going to win this thing. The 
whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Third base coach) Joey Amalfitano came up to me after I scored from second 
the other night and said, 'I don't know if this is an omen or not, but the last 
time someone scored from second base on a wild pitch was when Kirk Gibson did 
it against Montreal in 1988 and that was the year we won the World Series.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, making his debut on the Dodger Stadium mound as an Expo, retired the 
first eight Dodgers until Kevin Gross connected for the first hit, sending a 
ground-ball single up the middle with two outs. Butler then hit his homer, 
following Gross around the bases but beating him to the dugout, high-fiving as 
many hands as he could find. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross allowed only one hit through the first four innings, but he had some 
exceptional defense working behind him during that time. Lou Frazier sent a 
hard-hit line drive into the gap in right center in the first inning that Raul 
Mondesi backhanded on the run, afterward crashing into the wall. And Rafael 
Bournigal made several good plays during the game, including a backhanded snag 
of a line drive by Martinez in the third that was heading through the hole.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the fifth, the Expos scored on back-to-back singles by Cordero and Mike 
Lansing, with the help of a wild pitch by Gross, which put Cordero in scoring 
position. After that, the Expos next opportunity came in the seventh, when they 
put runners on first and second with two outs. Lenny Webster pinch-hit for 
Martinez, and Gross struck him out.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez pitched well in his six innings, holding the Dodgers to two runs on 
four hits and walking only one. But he left the game trailing 2-1, giving way 
to reliever Tim Scott (4-2), who pitched two innings for the victory.

MORNING BRIEFING: FOR BALTIMORE, THERE'S NOTHING IN ITS NICKNAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't matter to the players on Baltimore's first-year Canadian Football 
League franchise that the team doesn't have a nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be the team with no name, that sounds pretty good," nose tackle Jerald 
Baylis said. "Maybe we'll go through the whole season with no name and get more 
recognition for the city of Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
 The former NFL Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis in 1984. A lawsuit 
charging trademark infringement was filed against the new CFL team by the NFL, 
NFL Properties, Inc., and the Indianapolis Colts, when the new CFL team 
announced it, too, would be the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge in Indianapolis last month stripped the Baltimore team of 
the moniker "CFL Colts." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore opens its season tonight at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the only running back in NCAA history to average more than 
10 yards every carry for an entire season with more than 75 carries? 
</P>
<P>
 Tough Torrey: Most professional golfers will tell you that one of the most 
difficult holes in the country is the sixth on the North Course of the Torrey 
Pines complex in San Diego. Statistically, it was the most difficult for the 
1993 PGA Tour season. The 190-yard, par-three hole played to a scoring average 
of 3.576. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the South Course at Torrey Pines was the toughest 18 on the tour last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical team: There was a musical touch to the men's and women's basketball 
teams at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Before each home game for the women's team, forward Kelly Mazza led the 
audience in "The Star Spangled Banner." Before each men's game, guard David 
Masciola played the national anthem on his trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Message received: Professional motorcycle racer Carlos Giro crashed 32 times 
during the 1993 world championship season and the early part of this one. Last 
week the Spanish rider decided to call it quits, citing "mental problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Refreshing outlook: Some players say they would rather have three days off 
than play in the All-Star game, but not Carlos Garcia of Pittsburgh, one of two 
backup second basemen on the National League squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost started crying when Jim (Leyland, the Pirates' manager) told me I'm 
an all-star," Garcia said. "I can't tell you how special it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Confident kid: Point guard Jason Kidd, who left California after his sophomore 
year and was drafted No. 2 by Dallas, has high expectations for his NBA debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be in the top five in the league in steals and assists and for the 
team to double its number of victories," he said. "I think we can be a playoff 
team. That's a bold prediction, but I'm going to stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Glenn Davis, Army, 1945, with 944 yards in 82 carries for an 
11.5 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Mookie Wilson, on the troubled careers of former New York Met 
teammates Darryl Strawberry and Doc Gooden: "I see both of them coming back, 
but coming back to what? None of us come back to what we were. And in the case 
of these two guys, they weren't where they were when they left." SHAV GLICK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

 I can use the three-day vacation from the World Cup. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Every four years at this time, I get soccered out. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The rest until Saturday will do me good. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Some highlights: Marcelo Balboa's bicycle kick. Roberto Baggio's rebirth. 
Gheorghe Hagi's midfield magic. South Korea's grit. Brazil's dribblers. 
Germany's technique. No commercial interruptions during the action. No timeouts 
except for injuries. Singing in the stadiums. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Some low lights: Our power play against Brazil. Deciding the Bulgaria-Mexico 
overtime by penalty kicks instead of sudden death. Argentina without Maradona. 
Hugo Sanchez sitting on the Mexican bench. Teams sitting on leads. Too many 
theatrics. Not enough shots. . . .

 That might have been the first and last Fifth of July matinee at Dodger 
Stadium. Nearly 32,500 tickets were sold for the Dodger-Montreal game, but 
there didn't appear to be as many as 20,000 fans in the stands. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi is one of the best bad-ball hitters since Yogi Berra. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Home plate umpire Jim Quick was just that with his right hand Tuesday. Eight 
of the 20 strikeouts by the Dodgers and Expos were called. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As good as they are, the Expos have only two players as old as 30. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. is maturing on and off the field. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's laughing at the San Diego Padres anymore. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How come the Angels have a Hall of Fame and the Dodgers don't? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Defense isn't getting the San Francisco Giants far. They are first in the 
league in fielding and third in pitching. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Tony La Russa is a genius, after all. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Watch out for the Chicago White Sox now that Jack McDowell has regained his 
form. . . .

 Versatile Bob Ley of ESPN, as good a sports investigative reporter as there is 
on TV, is doing a good job on World Cup play-by-play. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The camera work during the tournament hasn't been imaginative but at least 
they're not confusing us with a lot of shots from crazy angles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The best rivalry in horse racing might be between 3-year-old fillies Sardula 
and Lakeway. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, who won the Mother Goose in track record time, could have stayed back 
in New York to run in the richer Coaching Club American Oaks, but trainer Gary 
Jones chose to send her against Sardula in the Hollywood Oaks Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It will be a rematch of the Kentucky Oaks when Sardula, benefiting from a cool 
ride by Eddie Delahoussaye, upset Lakeway by a head. . . .

 There will be more than a 100-degree difference in temperature for CFL teams 
playing an exhibition game at Las Vegas and a late-season game at, say,

 Backup quarterback being such an important position, Phil Simms still might be

 Florida Marlin closer Bryan Harvey, bothered by a pulled right groin, was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to June 30. . . . The Red Sox 
activated second baseman Tim Naehring from the disabled list and sent pitcher 
Nate Minchey to Pawtucket of the International League. Naehring was batting 
.287 in 174 at-bats when he went on the disabled list June 10 with a sprained 
right ankle. . . . Bob Watson, general manager of the Houston Astros, underwent 
successful surgery for removal of his cancerous prostate gland at a St. Louis 
hospital.Watson, 48, was expected to remain hospitalized for five days before 
returning to Houston. . . .

 Baseball players declined to make contract proposals to owners and said their 
executive board might not set a strike deadline when it meets Monday. Because 
players are fearful owners will unilaterally impose a salary cap after the

Chicago Cub broadcaster Harry Caray was expected to be released today from a 
Chicago hospital, where he underwent heart tests and observation after 
collapsing June 23 at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BAGWELL GETS WELL, ASTROS FEELING EVEN BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell returned from a three-game absence because of flu and drove in 
two runs Wednesday night as the Houston Astros defeated St. Louis, 7-6, for 
their fifth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell took over the major-league lead in runs batted in 79, and the Astros 
moved 12 games over .500 (48-36) for the first time since 1989. Craig Biggio 
had three hits and Houston starter Doug Drabek drove in two runs with a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis, which has lost a season-high five in a row, fell below the .500 
mark (40-41) for only the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 4, Cincinnati 3 -- Pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn hit a two-out, 
bases-loaded single in the 10th inning at Miami as the Marlins snapped their 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds, who blew a 3-0 lead in the eighth, lost for the first time in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Carr reached with one out in the 10th when Barry Larkin mishandled his 
soft liner. Carr took second on a passed ball, and Hector Carrasco (4-5) walked 
Jerry Browne and Gary Sheffield to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jeff Conine popped out, Chuck McElroy replaced Carrasco and gave up 
Colbrunn's sharp single up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3-2, Atlanta 1-4 -- Steve Avery got his first victory in almost 
seven weeks and Ryan Klesko drove in two runs as the Braves won the second game 
of a double-header to split with the Pirates, who won the opener with two runs 
in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane Smith earned his ninth victory, his most since 1991, and Dave Clark had a 
tie-breaking sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates' loss in the second game ended their five-game winning streak 
against Atlanta this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery (6-2) had seven no-decisions and one loss since May 20. He held the 
Pirates to six hits and struck out eight in eight-plus innings. Greg McMichael 
got the last three outs for his 17th save. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Bill Krueger, backed by Phil Clark's two-run 
home run at San Diego, provided the Padres with a rare win by a left-handed 
starter. Krueger entered the game with a 22.50 ERA, courtesy of his nightmarish 
first start with San Diego on Friday, when he gave up six hits and five runs in 
two innings of a 10-7 loss to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Krueger (1-1) became the first Padres left-handed starter to win since Jim 
Deshaies on Sept. 10, 1992, at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 7, Chicago 1 -- Andres Galarraga hit a three-run homer in a five-run 
ninth off All-Star reliever Randy Myers at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs missed several scoring opportunities and stranded 12 runners. They 
collected 10 hits, but scored just once on Glenallen Hill's leadoff homer in 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, San Francisco 1 -- Bobby Jones threw 7 1/3 innings without giving 
up a run as the Mets swept a three-game series with the Giants at Candlestick 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (9-7) allowed four hits and did not walk a batter. The Mets limited the 
Giants to 13 hits and four runs in the three-game series. Todd Benzinger had 
two of the Giants' five hits.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SUDDENLY, THOMAS (31) ONLY ONE BEHIND GRIFFEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Thomas hit a two-run home run -- his 31st -- and Tim Raines hit a 
two-run double in a five-run ninth inning Wednesday night at Detroit, rallying 
the Chicago White Sox to a 6-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who hit his 30th homer Tuesday night, reached the plateau in his 81st 
game to set a new team record. Carlton Fisk hit his 30th homer in Chicago's 
108th game in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is one home run behind major league leader Ken Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Henneman (1-3) struck out Darren Jackson to open the ninth but walked 
pinch-hitter Warren Newson. Mike LaValliere singled to move Newson to third, 
and Ozzie Guillen tied it 2-2 with a sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
 After an infield single by Lance Johnson, Raines hit a ball just over right 
fielder Junior Felix's glove, scoring pinch runner Norberto Martin and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who went two for four, followed by lining a 2-and-2 pitch into the 
lower deck in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 13, Texas 4 -- Paul Sorrento's three-run homer highlighted a six-run 
first inning at Arlington and Jack Morris registered his 252nd career victory. 
The Indians have won six of their last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris (8-5) moved past Bob Gibson into 36th place on the career wins list, 
giving up three runs and five hits in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris was backed by an offense that set a season-high for runs and pounded 
out 15 hits. The Indians, who led, 10-1, after two innings, got at least one 
hit from every starter and put 14 of their first 20 hitters on base. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 4, New York 2 -- Scott Brosius hit a two-run homer and Troy Neel added 
a solo shot at Yankee Stadium, leading the Athletics to a victory and a 
three-game sweep of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland was 13 games back in the AL West on June 13, but the A's have won 12 
of 13 and trail first-place Texas by three games. New York has lost six of its 
last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Darling (7-9) gave up two runs and nine hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked 
two and struck out six. Dennis Eckersley pitched the ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Toronto 4 -- Scott Erickson gave up seven hits in 7 2/3 innings 
at Minneapolis and Kirby Puckett hit a two-run homer to help the Twins snap a 
five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Winfield's second-inning triple was hit No. 3,081, tying him with Cap 
Anson for 14th on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 4, Kansas City 3 -- Dave Nilsson's tiebreaking homer in the eighth 
inning at Kansas City helped Bob Scanlan get his first win as a starter since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan (1-5) gave up four hits in eight innings, the longest outing of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked two and struck out two for his first victory since Sept. 10, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 5, Seattle 4 -- Brady Anderson hit a three-run homer and substitute 
starter Mike Oquist pitched six strong innings at Baltimore as the Orioles 
completed a three-game sweep of the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey went one for three with a sacrifice fly. He has gone 11 games and 44 
official at-bats since hitting his 32nd homer on June 24.

 Brazil escaped from one of the biggest disgraces in the history of the World 
Cup (by beating the United States, 1-0). It was an embarrassing victory over a 
mediocre team that lacked imagination. Brazil -- a team without personality and 
scared -- surprisingly against one of the weakest rivals in the eight finals, 
helped lower the average of goals in this phase of the tournament.

 What was supposed to be a joke ended in the deportation of Dutch journalist 
Lex Muller and his loss of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller jokingly claimed Wednesday that there was a bomb on the chartered plane 
that was taking the Dutch national team from Orlando to Dallas, site of 
Saturday's Netherlands-Brazil quarterfinal game. The flight was delayed for 
about five hours as a bomb squad secured the area.  
</P>

 Airport officials held Muller in handcuffs before U.S. officials ordered his 
deportation, and his newspaper, Algeen Dagblad, fired him. ELLIOTT ALMOND

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; BRAZIL'S LEONARDO SUSPENDED FROM TOURNAMENT; 
PENALTY: HE IS ALSO FINED ABOUT $8,000 FOR VIOLENT ELBOW AGAINST RAMOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazilian defender Leonardo was suspended Wednesday for four games for 
throwing an elbow that sent American Tab Ramos to the hospital with a fractured 
skull. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the longest suspension in recent memory imposed at a World Cup and 
means Brazil will be without one of its starting players for the rest of the 
tournament, even if it reaches the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The disciplinary committee of FIFA, soccer's governing body, said Leonardo was 
suspended "for violence against another player" and fined 10,000 Swiss francs, 
about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of recent World Cups, it is the longest suspension," FIFA spokesman 
Andreas Herren said. "The committee felt the violent behavior of the player 
deserved this kind of punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the length of the suspension, it can be appealed. Brazil plays in 
the quarterfinals against the Netherlands on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA is getting tough on violence this tournament, routinely imposing two-game 
suspensions for a red card, twice what usually is handed out. It topped that 
early in the tournament with a three-game suspension against Ion Vladoiu of 
Romania for a blatant hit on a Swiss player, and FIFA said at that time it was 
the longest suspension at any recent World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Leonardo, who threw his right elbow into the left side of Ramos' 
head as the two tangled for a ball near the sidelines in the first half of 
Monday's 1-0 Brazilian victory in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo later apologized and said he did not intentionally hurt Ramos, who 
was knocked unconscious and hospitalized briefly and is expected to be 
sidelined for up to six months. Leonardo visited Ramos in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brazil fails to advance past the Netherlands, Leonardo's suspension would 
be completed in a corresponding number of matches in the next South American 
tournament, FIFA said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of Leonardo was only one of a series of penalties imposed by 
the disciplinary committee. 
</P>
<P>
 It suspended two players expelled from second-round matches Tuesday -- Italy's 
Gianfranco Zola for two matches and Bulgaria's Emil Kremenliev for one match. 
Kremenliev's penalty was less severe because his red card was a combination of 
two yellows in the same match, not a blatant foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Also suspended for one match in the next CONCACAF tournament were Fernando 
Clavijo of the United States and Luis Garcia of Mexico, for accumulated yellow 
cards. Both Mexico and the United States have been eliminated from the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Zola was fined 5,000 Swiss francs (about $4,000), while Kremenliev, Garcia and 
Clavijo were fined about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the committee fined the Argentine delegation 10,000 Swiss francs 
for "unsporting conduct" on the bench during a 3-2 loss to Romania in the 
second round, and fined the team's coach another 5,000 Swiss francs for 
violating advertising restrictions.

FAUX PAS REPORT: BY DESIGN; HAT'S NOT ALL, FOLKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

 What guy doesn't have a favorite cap? It may be a major league-quality Angels 
cap, a white Nike or an overpriced black concert cap bought after too many 
brews during a performance of Megadeath. 
</P>
<P>
 Caps and hats go with just about anything, even when you're headed for a nice 
casual event held outdoors. But all caps are not equal. Lots of guys have been 
seen looking great except for the worn, wool cap that looks like they've had it 
since Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go with a dressier alternative if you want to cover your head," says 
Chris Lockwood of the Pendleton Sport Shop in Laguna Hills. "There's the 
stylish, classic sport cap that's available in cotton for summer. It's 
available in colors to complement your clothing, or even plaid." 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't go through life without a bill, there are some hot new 
baseball-style caps out there. Just make sure that it doesn't have the tacky 
plastic adjusting straps in back and that the bill is straight, not bent over. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning: The waif look is dead. How can you reach that conclusion? Just go to 
any local evening event and look at all the cleavage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the natural look is out," says Susan Shaw of Dancegear in 
Fashion Island Newport Beach. "Cleavage has always been popular, but it seems 
more so now." 
</P>
<P>
 Enhancing those curves without the help of silicone is the push-up bra, which 
has been reintroduced as the hot-selling "Wonder Bra." Take care when shopping 
for one of those cleavage inhancers. Too little a lift won't make much of a 
difference, while too much could give you a cartoonish, Jessica Rabbit-like 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys and towels: Everybody loves new towels in the bathroom, but new towels 
don't always love men. The problem is simple: the man dries his face after 
shaving with a new towel and shows up at work with little terry nubs sticking 
to his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter how close you shave, those nubs catch," says fashion buyer 
Bill Rigioni of Huntington Beach. "Take a good look in the mirror before you 
leave the house." 
</P>
<P>
 The trait seems to be not just among cheap towels but expensive ones as well. 
Be sure to give new towels a good washing and, more importantly, a good shake 
when dry.

HE SAID / SHE SAID: BY DESIGN; GRAY HAIR CAN MEAN A SILVER LINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT and ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I t's mostly inevitable, the arrival of silver threads among the gold, but 
there are a lot of us who would rather suffer a plague of boils than the 
sprouting of a single gray hair.  
</P>
<P>
 For years we've watched the battle rage, women and men snatching up bottles of 
Clairol and Just for Men, the symbolic artillery in the war against visible 
aging.  
</P>
<P>
 Is the graying of America really the eyesore so many of us seem to think it 
is?  
</P>
<P>
 HE: Glad you asked, and boy, have you come to the right place. Speaking as a 
41-year-old who has not a single hair on his entire head (apart from a couple 
of rogue red ones in the mustache) that isn't gray, I can say with truth that, 
if I could have my old brown hair back, I don't think I'd take it. (I'd take a 
little more hair if I could, but that's another story.) 
</P>
<P>
 I look at photographs of myself a few years ago when I had brown hair, and 
there's nothing about my appearance that's particularly striking. Now, though, 
people don't have much trouble spotting me in a crowd, and all that gray -- 
silver, if I'm going to flatter myself -- tends to make me look a lot wiser 
than I really am. 
</P>
<P>
 I get a lot of mileage out of knowing that Steve Martin is only eight years 
older, and he's just as snowy on top as I am -- and has been for years. Think 
it hurt his career? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I don't laugh as hard at Martin as I used to. But maybe that's more about 
my grayness than his. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been hiding my silver threads since they first popped up when I was in my 
20s. They bugged me then, and they bug me now. Let's face it: Gray hair can 
make you appear wise, but it can also make you look older than your years. I'm 
for looking as young as I possibly can, because that makes me feel young. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: That old saw about being as young as you feel? It's true. When I look in 
the mirror, I don't see an old guy. In fact, with that magical illogic 
particular to guys, I still think I'm about 22. 
</P>
<P>
 That can apply to women, too, I think. I'll never point the finger at any 
woman who wants to hide her gray artfully, but my hat's always off to the one 
who allows it to show. Some of the most striking women I've ever seen have had 
a big, full head of gleaming silver hair. It bespeaks confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I think I have confidence for remaining a brunette all these years.  
</P>
<P>
 Be honest. In a room full of women, who would you approach first: the blonde, 
redhead, brunette or gray head? I'm guessing you'd make a beeline for the 
blonde, then the redhead, the brunette, the gray. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Hair color doesn't mean a thing to me. I'll admit I'm partial to red hair, 
but there had better be a brain underneath it or she might as well be bald. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't misunderstand: The sort of gray on a woman I'm talking about needs to be 
just as stylish and well-cared-for as any other color. A well-crafted hairstyle 
is a must, as is attention to bringing out the highlights in the hair. It ought 
to shine. It should appear silvery. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be working with the stereotype of the moody poet in Birkenstocks with 
her unkempt gray -- and in this case it's gray -- hair carelessly yanked back 
into a frizzy pony tail. If that's New Age, I'll remain fossilized. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: But you said you were partial to red hair. Why, if hair color doesn't 
mean a thing to you? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Yes, I'm partial to red hair, all other things being equal. But all other 
things -- smarts, wit, a pretty smile -- aren't. They can't possibly be. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I remember the big statement Barbara Bush's gray hair made when George 
Bush took office. People were generally turned off by her grandmotherly looks. 
They seemed to respect it on the one hand, hate it on the other. She was 
alternately patronized and shunned. Her silver hair looked particularly odd 
next to her husband's brownish-red locks (did he dye it?). 
</P>
<P>
 And now with Bill and Hillary, you've got the opposite thing going. His hair 
seems to be getting grayer every day. And Hillary's tresses keep changing from 
blond to brown and back again. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only gray hair I've ever admired covered the heads of Barbara 
Stanwyck and my beautiful mother, Dorothy. They had a sparkle in their silver 
that enhanced them. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: And that's my point. Silver hair, properly maintained, can look terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, if people think they look prematurely geriatric or just plain ghastly 
with gray hair, they can color it. I just think they ought to give it a chance. 
I got my first wisps of gray at the temples when I was about 19, and I got 
ragged about it, but I knew I'd look purely ridiculous trying to color them 
away. And when the gray started getting fairly overwhelming in my early 30s, I 
figured Nature was trying to tell me something. 
</P>
<P>
 Why complicate your life and run the risk of looking like hell by gooping up 
your hair? 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: It's true that men can't get away with dyeing their hair the way women 
can. Short hair showcases gray roots. And the brassy tones that come from a 
total dye-job look ghastly on men. They don't get to use makeup to balance it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 But gray-haired men might consider doing what many gray-haired women do: Have 
a professional hair designer streak their hair with platinum or ash tones. It 
can only make them look younger. And what's wrong with that?

 Though the League of Women Voters of the United States won't officially 
celebrate its birthday until February 1995, celebrations of its diamond jubilee 
are already underway. That includes a slew of merchandise commemorating the 
75th anniversary. A $10 lapel pin from the Missouri contingent says it best by 
saluting the suffragists. "We wanted something that would remind people of the 
history of these women and their fight for health care, the environment and 
political and social reform -- the kinds of issues we're still concerned with 
today," says Janet Hardy of the St. Louis office. "We thought it fitting we'd 
honor the suffragists because we were the first city to establish a league 
chapter." She developed the pin with a local artist as a fund-raiser for the 
league's lobbying efforts. Not forgotten is that the fight included all women 
-- choose a pin with either a white or black woman pictured. Copper Plaits 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than a pretty penny to decorate Buena Park High junior Lori 
Osaw's braids -- like $1.76 worth of Lincolns. The 16-year-old had a beautician 
Super Glue pennies to her braid tips. Why? "Because I've never seen anyone do 
it before," she says. Well, at least no one has done it with pennies. She got 
the idea from a pal in Palm Springs who stuck quarters to her ends. Osaw has 
already experimented with dimes and nickels, but figured the copper coin was a 
better color for summer. They should stay on six months, she adds, and if any 
fall off, she's got a tube of the sticky stuff at home. And yes, she says, it's 
a heavy 'do. Riding the Wave 
</P>
<P>
 What started as purely promotional for their surf team riders turned into a 
gold mine for the guys at CounterCulture. Within weeks after the Huntington 
Beach street-wear line cut a limited number of rash guards emblazoned with 
their name and tribal logo, demand from friends, store owners and customers 
drove them to mass-produce them. The tops protect surfers from skin irritations 
caused by wet suits, board wax or the sun. Made of 100% Lycra, they dry 
quickly, says co-owner Mike Schillmoeler. Land-locked hipsters are finding 
another use for them, too. The modern look of the silhouette and fabric make 
them ideal for nightclubbing. One Melrose account can't keep them in stock, 
says Schillmoeler -- who frowns in disbelief at the alternative use. "They're 
intended just for surfing," he says. Available in white or black, long-sleeve 
guards are $34 and short-sleeved versions are $32. ROSE APODACA JONES

ANN CONWAY: A SHOW OF GRATITUDE FOR TACO BELL AND THE MASTERFUL FIREFIGHTERS

 Oops. Laguna Beach Festival of Arts board president Bud Schroeder said "Del 
Taco" when he should have said "Taco Bell" on Tuesday night during a cocktail 
party at Tivoli Terrace on the festival grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Toasting Taco Bell for helping present a special performance of the Pageant of 
the Masters for firefighters who battled last October's firestorms, Schroeder 
goofed and got the crowd giggling. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charlie Rogers -- Taco Bell's senior vice president of human resources -- 
got even: "It's great to be here at the Museum of Modern Art ," he said, 
shooting a megawatt smile at Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Schroeder said to Rogers: "I'm really sorry about that. But maybe you 
got more out of it this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, well. Taco Bell and the Pageant of the Masters both made history Tuesday. 
The special preseason performance for more than 2,000 guests was the first of 
its kind in the production's 60-year history. The pageant opens to the public 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the firestorms, we (at Taco Bell) were really impressed with the 
efforts of the firefighters," Rogers said during the reception. "And we are 
really passionate about this pageant. When I moved here 2 1/2 years ago from 
New York a lot of people told me I had to see the pageant, that it was out of 
this world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I went and found out it was true." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests -- who included Orange County Supervisors Harriett Wieder and Tom Riley 
and Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph -- mingled on the terrace under a huge 
sycamore tree strung with twinkle lights, sipping cool ones and nibbling at 
passed appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz: fire prevention. "It's the summer season," sighed Christoph, "and 
we're encouraging people to remove excess fuel . . . plants, debris, deadwood . 
. . from their properties." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who want to prevent fires should invite the fire department to 
inspect their homes, said Laguna Beach Fire Chief Richard Dewberry, who 
attended the event with his wife, Suzanne. "The fire department can give them 
ideas on what to do to make their homes fire safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder tribute: Harriett Wieder will step down from her post as Orange County 
supervisor in January, but not before her pals give her a huge send-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are underway for a black-tie tribute to Wieder on Sept. 8. Bob Fluor and 
Chris Deemer are co-chairmen. "(The tribute) was supposed to have taken place 
on June 30," Wieder said on Tuesday night. But it was postponed, she said, 
"because we are establishing a Harriett Wieder Charitable and Educational 
Foundation, and the tribute will benefit that. 
</P>
<P>
 "So first, we have to get an IRS clearance." The foundation will help support 
Wieder's pet charities, "like the Wellness Community and Interval House," she 
said.

A GALA OPENING THAT WASN'T QUITE; MUSIC REVIEW; THE BOWL SEASON OFFICIALLY 
BEGINS WITH PHILHARMONIC BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hopeful hypesters in residence billed the concert Tuesday night at 
Hollywood Bowl as a "Gala Opening." 
</P>
<P>
 Well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Trusty Webster defines gala as "a festive occasion." This one wasn't, unless 
one gauges festivity in terms of a couple of flower pots adorning the stage 
apron. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone defines opening as a beginning. This was the seventh concert of the 
summer at our gigantic amphitheater in Cahuenga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The only striking difference between the latest program by the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic under guest-conductor Andrew Litton and the earlier programs under 
guest-conductor Gerard Schwarz involved the top ticket price: $65 now, $40 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 No, for most practical purposes, this was business as usual under the stars 
and airplanes. Rather predictable business. Rather boring business. Another 
opening, another show. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton, the 35-year-old maestro-to-be of the Dallas Symphony, is a solid 
technician. He is good at keeping the orchestra together. He isn't so good, 
unfortunately, at making the music interesting, or at keeping it moving. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, he chose a ponderous agenda of works by Berlioz, Beethoven 
and -- argh -- Rachmaninoff, and he conducted it ponderously. When he and the 
ever-responsive orchestra reached the ultimate cadence -- at 11 p.m. and not a 
moment too soon -- the communal picnickers mustered dutiful applause. It seemed 
to reflect relief as much as enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening began with an unusually pompous performance of the "Star-Spangled 
Banner." This ritual of de rigueur patriotism may not stir all hearts at 
concert time, but it often serves as a useful preview of coming interpretive 
attractions. In this case Litton's overstretched tempo and overstressed 
sentiment told all. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlioz's "Carnaval Romain" overture followed, its excitement muted, its 
bravura measured. 
</P>
<P>
 The central soloist was Yefim Bronfman, who approached Beethoven's Third Piano 
Concerto in a leisurely spirit of wispy introspection. The precious 
sigh-and-whisper approach may make poetic sense in the intimacy of a bona-fide 
concert hall. In the not-so-great outdoors, however, it makes the noble 
rhetoric teeter on the brink of evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
 One had to admire the pianist's indomitable sensitivity. At the same time, one 
had to worry about a Largo that threatened to unwind, about pianissimo passages 
that had to be taken on faith, and about indulgent exaggerations that brought 
pathos perilously close to bathos. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton's tendency to slow down whenever a transition loomed did little to 
bolster tension. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came Rachmaninoff's treacly Second Symphony. All of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton ignored the kind cuts favored by other conductors and actually 
sanctioned by the composer. He luxuriated for an endlessly meandering hour in 
well-played mush and gush while many in the audience squirmed. The exodus 
before the last movement was startling (and it made one wonder how the escapees 
intended to extricate their cars from the stack-locked parking lots). 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * The nefarious amplification system at the Bowl continues to undergo 
modifications. "This year," the official announcement proclaimed, "we will 
incorporate a miking and mixing approach derived from a fusion of recording and 
reinforcement techniques." The new speaker systems introduce " 'wave guide' 
high-frequency components in place of traditional horn designs." 
</P>
<P>
 The precise meaning of the technical data eludes at least one innocent 
listener. Nevertheless, it can be reported that the sound encountered at the 
rear of the lower-box section seemed more mellow and less distorted than on 
some past occasions. It also seemed a bit dull and distant. 
</P>
<P>
 The piano lacked presence. The symphonic choirs were unnaturally separated. 
One was conscious of music emanating from speakers at the side of the stage, 
not from the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Distraction statistics: five aeronautical intrusions, one medical emergency, 
one noisy baby. 
</P>
<P>
 * Official attendance figure: 9,213 at the start.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BYRNE EMERGING WITH A NEW FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What happens when rock's sartorial Renaissance man gets buck naked? 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there's a tremendous feeling of newfound freedom, as David Byrne 
demonstrated Tuesday at the Coach House. Long rock's disinterested observer in 
the button-down collar, Byrne achieved that feeling several times in his new 
guise as an artist working in the emotionally exposed first person. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there also were a number of times when he came across like nothing so 
much as a man in search of a bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the freed-up man won out in Byrne's nearly two-hour set, part of a 
Southland swing that brings him back to the Coach House for a sold-out show on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Having jettisoned the Latin big bands that laid the foundation for his 
previous two solo albums, Byrne is now fronting a quartet that's as forceful as 
you'd expect a rock foursome to be. Yet the band was every bit as agile and 
versatile as you'd expect of one backing the former Talking Heads frontman, 
whose career has wended its way from nerdy new wave to muscular funk to 
pulsating Afro-pop to sensual salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 He played all but two of the dozen songs off his new "David Byrne" album, 
songs in which he strives to achieve closer contact with his listener. (One he 
skipped, ironically, was the album-closing "Buck Naked.") But simply being 
closer isn't always better. 
</P>
<P>
 Naked can mean exposed, and in many instances Byrne reveals himself with 
almost painful honesty, as when he sang, "I need someone to cover me with 
kisses when I'm alone and scared" in "Lilies of the Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Naked can also mean just plain bare, and that's how some of the album's 
truisms sound. The lyrical straight line may be the shortest distance between 
two points, but it's not always the most enlightening route. 
</P>
<P>
 What helped in concert were the moments where he expanded on the album's 
arrangements and transcended the carefully thought-out quality that still 
pervades his music. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Crash," he engaged in some Neil Young-like blasts from his electric 
guitar that gave voice to the feelings of pain and powerlessness in the face of 
death referred to in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 That new plateau of musical and spiritual abandon carried over when he dipped 
into the Talking Heads songbook. It was with renewed vigor that he sang such 
cornerstone numbers as "Psycho Killer," "Once in a Lifetime" and an especially 
cathartic show-closing rendition of "Life During Wartime." 
</P>
<P>
 Juxtaposed with Byrne's new in-the-altogether side, the Heads material proved 
that even a nouveau nudist can enjoy throwing on a favorite old suit once in a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Byrne plays Friday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Sold out. (714) 496-8930. RANDY LEWIS

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; HARRIS PREDICTABLY UNPREDICTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmylou Harris is nowhere to be found on the charts, but the audience at the 
late show Tuesday at the Crazy Horse Steak House still treated her and her 
band, the Nash Ramblers, as if they were the very heart of country music. As 
usual, Harris' voice conveyed every nuance of ache or joy the songs potentially 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris rarely plays what one might expect. Tuesday's show was predictable only 
in its unpredictability as she explored some of the byways of her career, 
opening with a propulsive version of "Mystery Train" and including Steve 
Earle's "Guitar Town" and Delbert McClinton's "Two More Bottles of Wine." 
</P>
<P>
 By going acoustic four years ago, Harris might have risked limiting the range 
of her material. But on numbers such as Rodney Crowell's "I Ain't Living Long 
Like This," the band showed it could rock furiously, while on softer selections 
such as "Pancho and Lefty," "Beneath Still Waters" and "Green Pastures" the 
group left an uncluttered landscape for Harris' vocals to soar over. 
</P>
<P>
 As much evident pleasure as Harris puts into her singing, she seemed happiest 
Tuesday when she sat partially obscured on the drum riser watching her band 
stretch out on the instrumental "Lee Highway" where they passed off solos that 
flew fast, inventive and funny. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harris appears Monday at the Crazy Horse, 1580 Brookhollow, Santa Ana, 7 and 
10 p.m. $33.50. (714) 549-1512. JIM WASHBURN

ART REVIEWS; 'RUINS': AN OBSESSION-FILLED LOOK AT PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Artist and critic Kavin Buck has curated a group show at Ruth Bachofner 
Gallery around one of those impressive-sounding, but ultimately amorphous 
themes. "Second Nature: Ruins" purports to concern itself with minor elements, 
overlooked details and secondary forms. This part sounds promising. 
</P>
<P>
 The tag line, "Ruins," is supposed to clue us in to the fact that the nine 
artists in the show pick through images, objects and information "that have a 
predetermined past, be it social, political or historical.' " This part sounds 
less promising, since there's no way around the fact that every image, object 
and piece of information has a past. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you start moving through the show, the fuzziness of the premise fades in 
significance, for most of the work is quite interesting. Personal obsessions 
weigh in heavily here. Julie Becker is fascinated with "Eloise," the pint-sized 
heroine of a series of children's books. Becker displays two letters ostensibly 
penned by her junior alter ego, as if they were holy relics or psychoanalytic 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Balk is driven by the need to dissect the order of the cosmos -- thus, 
the 19 linen napkins pinned to the wall, each covered with elaborate flow 
charts and abstruse notations linking developments in empirical psychology to 
Newtonian analytic methods to ancient mythology to explorations of alternate 
sources of fuel. Mara Lonner is enslaved by an urge to embellish. She takes 
ordinary shopping bags and cuts intricate patterns and designs in them; here, 
the untrammeled desire for beauty results in complete dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 Dysfunction is certainly an issue for several artists in the show. Christopher 
Dolan's remarkable video stalks a three-legged cat as the cat himself stalks 
his imperceptible prey. Peter Santino is more interested in downright failure. 
Famed for his intricate, tinted sand drawings, he shows here a series of small 
balls -- one covered in gold leaf, another encrusted with pasta and a third 
made of solid lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Affixed to the wall at eye level, the balls suggest stifled ambitions, 
impacted ideas, smothered hopes and imporous flesh. They are compelling in 
their poignancy and serve as a wry corrective to unnecessarily overblown 
curatorial agendas, such as the one in which they are currently entangled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruth Bachofner Gallery, 2046 Broadway, Santa Monica, (310) 829-3300, through 
July 30. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays.  
</P>
<P>
 For Sale: To interrogate the popular perception of the artist as martyr-saint 
-- endlessly misunderstood and destined to suffer -- is one thing. It's been 
done by the best of them: Marcel Duchamp, Roy Lichtenstein, Yves Klein, Jeff 
Koons. To buy into this perception is quite another, and rather painful to 
watch. Self-pity generates pity if you're lucky and annoyance if you're not. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Contract of Sale," her new show at Ace Contemporary Exhibitions, China 
Adams brings up this issue, while failing to provoke any serious reflection 
upon it. Circling the walls of a dimly lit room is a series of 13 medical light 
boxes, each displaying an X-ray of a specific bone in Adams' body. Next to the 
X-rays are purchase agreements in which Adams sells ownership rights to her 
left scaphoid, her first rib, her right humerus and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 These rights, which can be exercised only upon the artist's death, include the 
right to "have, hold, display, exhibit and exploit." The obvious reference is 
the medieval practice of selling bones from the bodies of the saints. The 
notion that through possession of such relics the owner could come closer to 
heaven is here equated with the idea that through ownership of the work of art, 
the collector can vicariously experience the artist's genius. 
</P>
<P>
 The message, too, is that the artist is a victim, but it's a hard one to 
swallow -- especially these days, when Van Gogh's ear is such a debased 
signifier. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally hard to swallow is Adams' immunity to the insights of art historical 
revisionism. She appropriates the forms of 1970s conceptualism, where objects 
on display are considered merely documents of an intangible idea; yet she stops 
short of acknowledging the impossible utopianism of such a scheme -- or even, 
for that matter, of accepting conceptualism's anti- aesthetic mandate. Instead, 
Adams stresses the "artiness" of her X-rays -- the images of the left femur, 
for example, look like gorgeous, if severely minimal, abstractions. In the 
process, she is a bit too vigorous in pleading her own case as underappreciated 
aesthete, making it unfortunately clear that she is playing it straight, when 
critique, if not outright parody, is called for.

 Light Construction: David Hines' immaculate paintings at Koplin Gallery depict 
single houses seen by night. Located along deserted highways, in the farthest 
reaches of outer suburbia, these anonymous, ubiquitous structures are 
illuminated by unadorned light bulbs hanging over their garage doors, or by a 
glow emanating from within, which is neither warm nor particularly inviting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that Hines wants to convey a sense of foreboding. These are 
not the deserted highways made famous by B-grade horror films, nor the 
assembly-line dwellings that house burgeoning serial killers. Hines purges his 
images of all such affect by stripping them of detail -- narrative and 
pictorial. Instead of winding up with visions of American-style anomie, he 
winds up with a mundaneness so pronounced it appears profound. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, then, the paintings should be immensely dull. They are not. 
For one thing, the elements are so consistent -- house, night sky, motivated 
light source -- that these appear to be serial objects. And watching such 
objects transmute from realist images to minimal abstractions -- dark canvases 
bisected by single lines of variegated light -- is quite unnerving. Aesthetic 
thrills, however, are not what this very mature body of work is about. It is 
about becoming comfortable with the empty spaces between moments, places and 
events.

POMONA; CITY WON'T PUT FIREFIGHTING, CARD CLUB ISSUES ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TALLY GOLDSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an hour of emotional speeches from residents, most of whom spoke in 
favor of establishing card clubs in Pomona, the City Council decided June 29 
not to put the issue on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council voted 5 to 2 to uphold its original decisions updating 
the city's gaming ordinance, the first steps toward approving two card clubs in 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also decided to go ahead with plans to transfer firefighting 
services to the Los Angeles County Fire Department rather than put the volatile 
issue on the ballot. The transfer is scheduled to take place next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The council considered putting the issues on the ballot because of the 
plethora of conflicting opinions among residents, Councilwoman Paula Lantz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel anything that has such a large response is a warning sign that 
people ought to be more involved," she said. Lantz and Councilman Willie White 
voted to put the issues on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some residents said they believe the clubs would be too important a 
revenue source to reject, others said they were afraid that gambling would 
increase crime and violence in the city. Neither Lantz nor White supported the 
Fire Department transfer, but both council members favored card clubs in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "A city should have its own fire department," White said. "Given the chance, I 
think the majority of people would have voted to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Swearingen, a Pomona firefighter for 25 years, said the transfer was 
necessary. "I care about the safety of these citizens," he said. "I knew that 
if we didn't transfer, we'd end up going the way of the dinosaur." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Baker, president of the Pomona Firefighters Assn., said he is glad the 
political maneuvering is over. But the issue continues to be mired in 
allegations of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Two African American women sued the city last week seeking to stop the 
department transfer. Lydia Cook and Terrie Owens, who failed Fire Department 
entrance exams, charged the city with discrimination in its hiring practices. 
Attorney Leo James Terrell, whose law office represents the women, said that by 
transferring the department to the county, the city is circumventing its 1989 
agreement with the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People to hire 
more minorities.

LOCAL LEVELS OF SMOG SHOW DECLINE FOR YEAR SO FAR; POLLUTION: THERE HAVE BEEN 
ONLY 10 FIRST-STAGE ALERTS. EXPERTS CREDIT THE RECENT WEATHER FOR THE 
BETTER-THAN-PREDICTED AIR QUALITY.

<P>
 First it was too cool and damp for much smog, then too hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those atypical weather patterns have thus far helped make 1994 even 
more smog-free than 1993, which had the fewest first-degree smog alerts ever 
recorded in the San Gabriel Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been 10 first-stage smog alerts in the San Gabriel Valley so far 
this year, compared with 13 at this point last year, according to the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists begin tracking yearly smog levels every January, but the real 
smog season is May through October. 
</P>
<P>
 This May, unseasonable cloudiness blocked the sun's rays, which normally 
intensify smog by trapping it, lid-like, with its heat, said Bill Kelly, AQMD 
spokesman. And rain cleared some of the pollutants from the air. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, the last two weeks in June were unusually hot, exceeding 100 
degrees in several San Gabriel Valley cities. Although meteorologists warned 
residents of approaching first-stage smog alerts, the temperature grew so hot 
in the valley that the ground air rose, punching through the inversion layer 
and releasing much of the smog, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the daily smog alerts expected June 22 to 29, only one, on June 24, 
materialized, said Joe Cassmassi, senior meteorologist with the AQMD. "We 
weren't expecting that kind of heat so early in the season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-stage smog alert is issued when the ozone exceeds 0.20 parts per 
million in any of the three local cities measured--Glendora, Pomona or 
Pasadena. On those days, everyone is advised to refrain from vigorous activity 
outside, and people with heart or lung problems are urged to spend as much time 
indoors as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists generally have expected this year's smog levels to be higher 
than last because the El Nino weather conditions that kept smog to a minimum in 
1993 have vanished. There were 19 first-stage alerts in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But the weather in the past two months has been so out of character for the 
region that meteorologists no longer know what to expect for smog levels this 
year, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of unhealthful days, when the ozone exceeds 0.12 parts per million, 
has zig-zagged over the past few years, higher in 1990 and 1992, lower in 1991 
and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether this year is slightly more or less smoggy than last, 
AQMD meteorologists say air pollution is declining on the whole because of 
tougher state laws on industries that emit pollutants, said Claudia Keats, an 
AQMD spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to tally alerts and unhealthful days for the valley, the AQMD uses 
the numbers from whatever station has the worst record--typically Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 The valley has not had a second-degree smog alert, issued when the ozone 
exceeds 0.35 parts per million, since 1986, Kelly said. Clearing the Air

A DANCE TO LIFT THE SPIRIT; RECITAL TO HELP VICTIMS OF TRAGEDY IN RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Growing up an exile in Burundi, Nola Kambanda said she was always at the top 
of her class. It was not the honor roll. It was a hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other (high school) students would make lists of people they wanted to 
kill," said Kambanda, who was born in Rwanda and lived in Burundi a few years 
after a failed Hutu rebellion in 1972 left 10,000 Tutsi and 150,000 Hutu dead. 
"They knew I was a Tutsi, so I was always first on the list of people to be 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a student at Los Angeles City College, Kambanda, 22, performs traditional 
Rwandan dances at local cultural events with five other dancers from Rwanda, 
Uganda and Malawi. When the ethnic civil war resumed in Rwanda three months 
ago, she wondered how she could alert Southern Californians to the horrors and 
raise money to help the victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Her answer: a $10-a-ticket rally, dance recital and fashion show, to be held 
at 1 p.m. Saturday at Santa Monica College. Kambanda and her fellow dancers 
will perform, actor Danny Glover will speak and ABC News correspondent Larry 
Carroll will emcee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems people (here) are not aware. And the international community has 
refused to call it genocide, so no one is helping us," said Kambanda. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest part of planning the event, she said, was staying focused on daily 
life while worrying about loved ones in Rwanda, where relief agencies estimate 
that 200,000 to 500,000 people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (dancers) all had finals to study for," said Kambanda, who is studying 
engineering and computer science. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then, we all have lost family. I have first cousins who have been killed. 
Another girl . . . lost her sister. And we all have family still not accounted 
for. It's difficult trying to find out who has been killed and who wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping the cause is Ghanaian-born Akosua Busia, who met Kambanda while she 
was emceeing a beauty pageant last year. Busia, a writer and actress who had a 
role in "The Color Purple," said she wanted to help Kambanda because she 
admired the student's stand-alone spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started the planning, they didn't have anyone helping them out," 
Busia said. She contacted Carroll and Glover. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Busia's idea to have some of the dancers speak during the show about 
the pain and anger of losing family to the ethnic warfare in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear of mass numbers of people dying in a remote place you have 
never heard of, it's hard to relate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda, once an independent kingdom, became a part of German East Africa in 
1899 and fell under Belgian rule in 1916. The Belgians educated the Tutsis, an 
ethnic group known for their height, who became the elite of Rwandan society. 
The Hutus, stockier and shorter, made up 90% of Rwanda's population and 
resented the Tutsis' domination. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda gained independence in 1962, but the ethnic friction continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "After these countries gained independence, we had leaders who exploited the 
ethnic rivalries for their own good," said Segun Oyekunle, an editor at The 
African Times, a Los Angeles-based newspaper that reports on the African 
Diaspora. 
</P>
<P>
 A mysterious plane crash in April killed Rwanda's president, a Hutu, and 
Burundi's president as well. "The Hutu reacted, thinking the Tutsi were 
responsible for the plane crash," said Oyekunle. "As a result, we have all this 
carnage." 
</P>
<P>
 While the blood bath has been well-documented, relief money is limited, said 
Neil Frame, a procurement director for Operation USA, one of the few local 
relief organizations active in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Frame, whose organization will benefit from the fund-raiser, said public 
response to the crisis in Rwanda "has been underwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 "We received $10,000 from an Australian group, $1,000 from the Liberty Hill 
Foundation (a Santa Monica-based community funding organization) and $100 from 
the general public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical to the relief effort is medical supplies. Frame said his group has 
collected about 22 tons that will be flown to Burundi and distributed to 
Rwandan refugees in that country, and to Tanzania, where about 437,000 Rwandans 
have fled, according to Refugees International, a fact-finding group. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Frame said, another crisis is waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are being displaced from the areas where they buy or raise food. 
Famine is caused by the displacement of people. They become reliant on relief 
agencies for food, and it becomes a vicious cycle. And when they congregate in 
places where they think they can find food, it makes them more vulnerable to 
attack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Food, shelter and portable water, he said, are needed most. The U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees last month appealed for $56.7 million for three 
months' worth of gas, food, administrative costs and relief supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing the traditional dance of her country to help raise money may also 
diminish the perception that Rwanda is no more than a blood-soaked land of 
horrors, Kambanda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dance is so beautiful," she said. "We want to show people there is more 
to our culture than ethnic tensions and people killing other people."

AMID TRANSIENCE, HISTORIC HOMES ENDURE; ARCHITECTURE: AN 8-BLOCK NEIGHBORHOOD 
OF 75-YEAR-OLD DWELLINGS HAS BEEN GRANTED LANDMARK STATUS BY A LOS ANGELES 
CULTURAL HERITAGE PANEL.

 In a verdant pocket of Hollywood, just south of Sunset Boulevard, is a slice 
of "Mayberry R.F.D." Americana. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a neighborhood where everyone comes to walk their dogs, where older 
people take their constitutionals and where women walk with their baby 
strollers," said actor Michael Corbett, who lives in the neighborhood southeast 
of the intersection of Fairfax Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. "To be in L.A. and 
to be in a little neighborhood like this is really something." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the ever-changing character of transient Los Angeles 
neighborhoods, this melange of Colonial, Spanish, Italian and Craftsman 
architecture now seems certain to remain. After a five-year battle with the 
labyrinthine city bureaucracy, Corbett and a handful of other residents have 
gotten the eight-block Hollywood area declared a Los Angeles landmark by the 
city's Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly won status, which became official this spring, means that all 160 
single-family homes in the designated spot must maintain their original facades 
and stay true to the structure's architectural period. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents "started talking about (the area) becoming a historical landmark to 
fight encroachment and because we wanted to preserve one of the few 
(single-family housing residential zoning) neighborhoods left in L.A.," said 
Corbett, best known for his role as David Kimble on "The Young and The 
Restless," a soap opera character who fell into an industrial trash compactor a 
year ago. "Now, no one can come in and tear down a house and build a different 
structure . . . or plant a hedge without the (Spaulding Square Neighborhood 
Assn.) permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Fernandez, executive assistant to the city's Cultural Heritage 
Commission, said that receiving historical landmark status protects 
neighborhoods, despite what some might view as laborious architectural review 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've ever had two Craftsman houses destroyed to put up a three-story 
apartment building, then you can realize the importance of having a (review 
board) make sure that something is architecturally compatible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1916 housing tract, named Spaulding Square after the man who subdivided 
it, Albert Starr Spaulding, was originally for film executives and 
up-and-coming actors working in the movie industry flourishing nearby. Part of 
the area's draw was its proximity to a Hollywood-line railroad stop at 
Spaulding and Fountain avenues, which enabled film industry people to travel to 
the studios sans the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood was noted not only for its famous residents -- actress 
Lucille Ball, film director Hugo Hass ("King Solomon's Mines") and 
cinematographer Daniel Fapp ("Westside Story") -- but also for its role as a 
location for numerous films, including many Laurel & Hardy movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbett said that when he bought his 1914 Craftsman-style house five years 
ago, "it looked like a crack house." He restored his bungalow to its original 
condition, replete with a gable-covered porch, period columns painted black, 
and wide windows opening onto a brilliantly colored landscape design resembling 
a "Sunset" magazine spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Once bitten by the inspiration to renew the old, Corbett went further, 
spearheading a neighborhood movement to plant new trees along the strip between 
the sidewalk and the street, where some Black Acacia trees had begun dying off 
and falling onto cars. After a painstaking struggle to win city approval, 
Corbett supervised the planting of 160 Chinese evergreen elm, Brazilian pepper, 
liquidambar and camphor trees, a project residents hope will soon provide 
shade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trees make a neighborhood a much more homey, less urban environment, and it 
makes you forget that you are in the heart of L.A.," said Corbett, who has 
rented out his residence as a location for movies such as "What's Love Got to 
Do With It," assorted TV series and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are trying to get a grant proposal to get the original street lights 
put back," Corbett said. "It's very satisfying to have been even a little part 
of L.A. history. I am from back East, where there are lots of trees and people 
walking their dogs. That is the kind of place (where) I want to live."

A JOB THAT GREW ON HER; SIERRA MADRE: 'MAMA PETE' OPENED HER PRESCHOOL 50 YEARS 
AGO TO AID WOMEN IN WARTIME FACTORIES. TODAY, WOMEN ARE STILL WORKING AND SHE'S 
STILL THERE.

<P>
 In 1944, when the men went off to war the women went to work in defense 
factories -- and their children came to Mama Pete's. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, they're still coming. 
</P>
<P>
 For half a century, Marjorie Peterson has presided over a wood-shingled 
storybook house in Sierra Madre where ceramic elves peer from the back-yard 
bushes and 2- to 5-year-olds get lessons on manners and ABCs -- and lots of 
hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the war ended, I thought everyone would go home and that would be the 
end of our day-care job," recalls Peterson, now 78. "But they didn't. Mothers 
are still working and we still have children here." 
</P>
<P>
 What started as an ad-hoc nursery during the war years bloomed into a 
full-fledged preschool named Mama Pete's for its founder, with a playground and 
swimming pool. And her toddlers have grown into parents, even grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Manuel, now a 33-year-old Monrovia police officer, returns to the school 
each year to give the children safety lessons. Elisa Hicks came to Mama Pete's 
in diapers and 20 years later is now a full-time teacher's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The original nursery, Peterson says, "just happened by accident. I had always 
taken care of children -- I baby-sat, taught Sunday school. During the war, 
women were looking for someone to care for their children. So I took in the 
first baby, and before I knew it I had 10 of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The working mothers were "Rosie the Riveters" who, in the absence of their 
husbands, earned a living and contributed to the war effort by crafting 
airplane parts and precision instruments at firms such as Douglas Aircraft and 
Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 The center operated around the clock then, catering to the 24-hour production 
schedule at defense plants. At midnight, when the swing shift ended and the 
graveyard shift began, Peterson would wake to receive sleeping infants and 
roust others from their cribs to return to their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have nightmares that I gave the wrong children to the wrong 
parents, or that I ran out of children and didn't have any left when the 
parents came," she remembers, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some busy mothers boarded their children there all week, bringing them home 
only on Sundays. In those days, she says, "it was really more like foster care 
than day care." 
</P>
<P>
 Her own son and daughter mixed easily with her little charges. "We treated all 
the children like they were all ours, so they were all like brothers and 
sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 One baby girl, left for a year by an unwed mother, nearly became a part of 
their family. The mother reclaimed the child after Peterson and her husband 
expressed an interest in adopting her. Twenty-two years later, she returned to 
visit Mama Pete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to imagine not having seen her from 1 year old to 23," Peterson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She was only one of Peterson's former students who was drawn back to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisa Hicks came to Mama Pete's as a toddler while her mother was occupied 
full time with caring for her brother, who was hospitalized with spina bifida. 
Hicks' father and brother died when she was 13, forcing her mother to go to 
work. Instead of going home to an empty house after school, Hicks began 
volunteering at Mama Pete's. In her senior year of high school, she got 
work-study credit for the job, and during summer break from Biola University in 
La Mirada she taught swimming. Now 22 and recently graduated, she works full 
time as a teacher's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's like a second mom to me," Hicks says of Peterson, taking a break from 
blowing bubbles to giggling youngsters. "I like the way she treats the children 
here. She treats them like little people, with respect." 
</P>
<P>
 When Peterson enters the classroom during a snack time, one little boy 
stretches his arms up for a hug. As she cuddles him, another child asks 
politely, "Mama Pete, can I have a hug?" That sets off a chain reaction and 
soon three or four beaming children are clinging to her legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned so much from her -- not just about children but about life 
itself," says Cathy Sieves, who has been substitute teaching at the school for 
30 years. "The first day of public school, the teacher could tell a Mama Pete 
child because they were so well-behaved." 
</P>
<P>
 Through five decades of child-rearing, Peterson has watched the way children 
have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't seem to be running in such a high gear all the time, 50 years 
ago," she says. "I don't know if it's the way we live or TV. Now we're teaching 
things to children they used to teach them in first grade." 
</P>
<P>
 In an age when parents worry which interactive videos their children need to 
become computer literate, Peterson stresses simpler priorities. Preschoolers 
need to learn colors, shapes and alphabet letters. They need to learn manners. 
And they need plenty of time to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they can learn a lot during playtime because they don't even 
realize they're learning," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Peterson and her husband, who died 10 years ago, built a 
school building in the back yard, with an apartment on the second floor that 
they rent out. In the yard behind it is a swimming pool. Children are kept busy 
with a playhouse, a sandlot with swings and slide, a blacktop for tricycles, a 
crafts corner and a menagerie of pet guinea pigs, hamsters and turtles. Two 
preschool teachers and two teacher's aides care for 24 students. Full-time day 
care costs $105 a week; half-days cost $50 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1984 Olympics, Peterson staged athletic games for the youngsters. A 
pint-sized torchbearer opened the ceremony, each child represented a country 
and there were chocolate gold medals for everyone. Another time she invited a 
movie insect trainer to bring pet tarantulas for the children to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 During the school's annual safety week, another of Peterson's alumni shows up. 
Manuel, the Monrovia police officer, rides in on his motorcycle to caution the 
children about crossing the street and about talking to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother's children attend the school, and his own son is on the waiting 
list. Mama Pete's is so popular that pregnant women sometimes place their 
unborn babies on the two-year waiting list, hoping there'll be a place by the 
time they're preschool age. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel says it's worth the wait. "Turning your kid over to someone for them to 
care for and teach, I couldn't think of a better person for the job."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Small business operators in the Pasadena area will soon be able to get free 
management advice when a government-sponsored consulting service opens a 
three-person Pasadena office in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Los Angeles County Small Business Development Center, which has 
operated for four years in Pomona, is expanding to Pasadena, East Los Angeles 
and South-Central Los Angeles, said center Director Toni Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles office sites have yet to be chosen, Pasadena 
employees will work out of 2061 N. Los Robles Ave. About $50,000 of the 
$200,000 yearly operating costs for the office will come from Los Angles 
County. The Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, Pasadena City College and the city of 
Pasadena are also helping to establish the new office, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomona center, at 375 S. Main St., provides about 2,500 small businesses 
per year with the services of free, professional management consultants. They 
give financial, operating, marketing and other advice for businesses with fewer 
than 500 employees, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomona center is operated by Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, in 
cooperation with Citrus Community College in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 Yearly funding of about $300,000 comes from the federal Small Business 
Administration, the Chancellor's Office of the California Community Colleges, 
and the California Trade and Commerce Agency.

TOPICS; CIVICS; HELPING EMIGRES FIGHT CULTURAL 'PARALYSIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most citizens of the former Soviet Union desperately want democracy, says 
Sophia Balakrishnan, 55, a Soviet emigre. Over the past several decades, 
however, entiregenerations have grown up in a society that undermined 
individual accountability by demanding deference to the Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the principal hurdle for residents of the former Soviet Union is 
not economic or political but, rather, psychological, Balakrishnan says. 
Citizens who formerly relied on the state to regulate nearly every aspect of 
their lives, she says, must now learn self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
 That state of affairs prompted Balakrishnan, a translator and former tour 
guide who emigrated to the United States in 1976, to start the Center for the 
Psychology of Democracy in Westwood four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, run with a staff of one -- Balakrishnan -- is a nonprofit 
organization of academics that sponsors seminars and workshops throughout the 
Southland. It seeks to foster civic education and self-reliance among Russian 
emigres, and deepen American understanding of the problems Russians face. 
</P>
<P>
 Such learning, Balakrishnan says, is crucial. Without it, Balakrishnan says, 
residents of Russia will line up behind totalitarian demagogues promising to 
restore old-style "law and order." And many Russian emigres here, clinging to 
their old ways, will become a welfare-dependent underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 Says John D. McNeil, a UCLA professor emeritus in education and a volunteer 
adviser to the center: The center "provides civic education at its best, both 
for the Russian emigres and for us to understand them. Balakrishnan brings in a 
very unusual and solid perspective on all this." 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, Balakrishnan was an official tour guide for, among others, Nixon 
Administration officials and the American press corps. She says she found 
herself increasingly drawn to Americans' individualism and can-do attitude. 
After the ouster of former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev and the subsequent 
restrictions on Soviet contacts with foreigners, she left the tour company, 
then decided to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a Cold War thaw in 1976, Balakrishnan applied for an exit 
visa, listing fictitious relatives abroad who would sponsor her. After a 
nail-biting eight-month wait, she was given permission to emigrate. Five years 
later, she became an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, fearing the long reach of Soviet authorities, she worked here under 
an American pseudonym for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia 
University, Balakrishnan moved to Santa Monica and began helping fellow 
emigres. However, she soon found that their problems were more than a matter of 
learning a new language and customs. Rather, she found that emigres' 
expectations of the world were completely different from those of Americans, 
resulting in a pervasive "paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she says, Soviet emigres often do not even know how to begin 
looking for a job, let alone how to start their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the former Soviet Union, she explains, a person's profession was determined 
in school in accordance with society's needs. The schools, in turn, were linked 
to professional institutions, and the students "graduated" from school to a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 A future engineer would not look for a temporary job outside his field just to 
make money, nor would he think to create his own job. The old order rewarded 
those who went along with the bureaucracy, and punished those who took the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 So in Russia today, budding entrepreneurs often face hostility from fellow 
citizens, many of whom regard such activity with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom is equated with stealing or cheating," Balakrishnan said, and 
individuals thought to be making too much money often receive death threats. 
"Shops have been burned, people attacked and abused because they are more 
enterprising than others." 
</P>
<P>
 That rubs off on emigres, Balakrishnan said. Many renew their dependency on 
government by going on welfare. And even those who find jobs remain affected by 
their life under a totalitarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask American business people who deal with (Russians)," she says. "They will 
tell you that the (Russians) do not look into your eyes while talking; instead, 
they look away from your face and mumble something. This behavior has become a 
habit. Because punishment followed so readily from self-expression, they are 
afraid of showing what they think and feel." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she said, "most (Russians) do only exactly what they have been 
told to do; they do not take any initiative to do more, to improve their way of 
doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions have been the subject of numerous workshops and seminars 
conducted by the center. Recommendations arising from those sessions are being 
put to use. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil, for example, says several of his graduate students now include civics 
instruction while teaching English to Russian emigres in the Fairfax area. 
Soon, he said, his students hope to offer such courses to emigres in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has also begun a study of the psychology of democracy in 
association with Pepperdine University and the prestigious Association of 
Humanistic Psychology. The study will focus on the adjustment problems faced by 
current residents of Russia and Russians who have emigrated to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Balakrishnan: "We can send the Russians 5,000 pairs of shoes. But when 
the shoes wear out, they will be in the same place they are today. We must help 
these people make the transition, both in Russia and here. The consequences, if 
we do not, can be very dire."

TOPICS; ENVIRONMENT; HIGH-TECH TRACKER OF TREES; COMPUTER PROGRAM STORES 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION, CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF FOLIAGE ON PUBLIC

<P>
 When Claremont residents telephone Mark Hodnick inquiring about the species of 
tree growing in front of their houses, Hodnick can give them answers without 
leaving his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it be a Liquidambar styraciflua, an Australian Tea Tree or the city's 
one macadamia nut tree, Hodnick has the data. In fact, Hodnick, the parks, 
facilities and urban forest manager for the city, has the facts about all of 
Claremont's 22,700 trees at his fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Monrovia, Pasadena and Temple City, Claremont uses a computer program 
called Treekeeper to track and store information about trees on city property. 
Hodnick simply enters an address into the system, and, presto, up comes 
everything you could ever want to know about a tree at that location, including 
its age, condition, specific site, pruning cycle -- even whether it has birds' 
nests on its branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the city started using the program earlier this year, city employees 
relied mostly on their memories to figure out when a tree needed pruning or 
other maintenance, Hodnick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has really made a difference to us. We feel that we're on the cutting 
edge of urban forestry management," Hodnick said. "It becomes an invaluable 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
 The program cost about $32,000 to install and get running. But it's an 
investment, he said, adding that the city's trees are valued at $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the city did not know that until Treekeeper. Nor did they know they 
had a rare macadamia nut tree -- usually found in Hawaii -- on West Arrow 
Highway. And they had no idea exactly how many trees were in the city. "We were 
surprised by the number of trees we had," Hodnick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Treekeeper was developed by the Davey Resource Group of Kent, Ohio. The 
company's Irvine-based office has provided service for about 50 clients in 
Southern California, said Project Manager Steve Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities use the program to see trends, Brown said, such as which trees flourish 
and which wither. And, he added, Treekeeper helps the city deal with liability 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Street trees can become a liability if they're not maintained. They'll start 
falling on people," Hodnick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodnick said he heard about Treekeeper when he worked for the city of 
Pasadena, which has been using the program since 1989. Monrovia has been using 
the program for about five years. Before Temple City's public works employees 
began using Treekeeper, they recorded data on index cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the Treekeeper representative, said the program involves switching from 
a paper-based or memory-based system to a computer-based system. "It completely 
automates tree maintenance," he said.

<P>
 CLAREMONT: A Los Angeles man who allegedly pretended to have a handgun in 
order to rob a gas station June 30 was arrested an hour later after the 
passenger in his car tipped off police. Marshall Mitchell, 35, allegedly 
entered the station at 699 E. Foothill Blvd. at about 11:40 p.m. and robbed it 
of $500. He then returned to his car, in which an acquaintance was waiting. 
Mitchell then dropped off his passenger in San Bernardino. The passenger called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 GLENDORA: The Mann movie theatre at 1321 Grand Ave. was robbed June 28 by two 
armed men, one of whom wielded a knife, the other a revolver. The robbers 
ordered employees to get on the ground and demanded they open the safe, police 
said. The robbers also dragged several female employees by their hair and one 
suspect hit an employee with his revolver. Police arriving on the scene at 
about 10:15 p.m. arrested three suspects as they were driving out of the 
theater parking lot. Dwayne Anthony Tucker, 30, of Azusa and Sheldon Dajun 
Jones, 18, of Redlands are being held in Glendora City Jail on suspicion of 
armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. In addition, Nancy Julissa 
Chavez, 22, of Baldwin Park, driver of the car, is being held on suspicion of 
armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 EL MONTE: A 20-year-old El Monte man was shot and killed outside a 7-Eleven 
store at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. The victim, whose name was not released, was 
standing with three friends in the parking lot of the store at 3243 Santa Anita 
Ave. when they were confronted by a man in his 20s, deputies said. The victim 
and his friends got into the victim's 1983 gray Buick Regal and attempted to 
drive away. The suspect fired four rounds into the car; one of the rounds 
struck the driver in the upper torso. He died at the scene. The victim's 
friends were not injured. Deputies believe the incident may have been 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 ROWLAND HEIGHTS: A 16-year-old Florida boy who was wanted in connection with a 
double murder in Pompano Beach, Fla., was arrested Sunday night at a local 
motel. The youth allegedly shot two women, ages 19 and 20, on Friday, police 
said. He had been a passenger in a car with them; his relationship to them and 
the motive are unknown. Florida police had heard that the boy was headed to Los 
Angeles to visit friends. Sheriff's deputies arrested the youth at the Motel 6 
at Nogales Avenue and the Pomona Freeway at about 8:50 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 WEST COVINA: Two West Covina detectives flew to Greenville, Miss., last week 
to retrieve a murder suspect who allegedly shot two men execution-style in West 
Covina on June 16. Emmanuel Gaisie, 23, of Covina was wanted in connection with 
the killing of Cedrick Delane Washington, 22, of Covina and the shooting of 
Shawn Mark Alexander, 23, of Placentia, who survived a bullet wound to the 
head. Police suspect the incident might have been drug-related. Gaisie is being 
held in the West Covina City Jail on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST VALLEY; VICTIM RESTITUTION LAW GETS ASSEMBLY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Assembly has approved a bill by Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) 
to reform California's victim restitution system. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would enable victims of crime or their families to collect money paid 
by the offender as restitution. It would also enable courts to impose 
restitution for misdemeanor offenses and would include future earning capacity 
as criteria in defining a defendant's ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Legislature is, at long last, beginning to act on the behalf of 
victims," Hoge said. The bill must be passed by the Senate and signed by the 
governor to become law.

COMMUNITY NEWS: POMONA; CAMP FOR AT-RISK YOUTHS SEEKS DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sleeping bags and jackets for 100 boys, ages 11 to 13, are being sought by the 
state parole office in Pomona, which is helping sponsor a summer camp for 
at-risk children. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys -- Pomona-area residents who are at risk of gang involvement or the 
offspring of parolees -- will spend Wednesday through Saturday at Holcomb 
Valley in Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these boys have never been to the mountains or out of the city at 
all," said Pomona parole office spokesman Craig Perry. "It lets them see 
there's something else that goes on besides street gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is sponsored in cooperation with the Boy Scouts of America. 
Contributions or cash to purchase the equipment and clothing may be sent to the 
Parole and Community Services Task Force, Summer Camp Fund, 1295 E. Hope Ave., 
Pomona, Calif. 91767, or call Perry at (909) 620-4445. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions may also be made June 18 at a fund-raising carwash from 9 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. at the Union 76 gas station at White and Orange Grove avenues in 
Pomona. Scouts, some boys who are going to camp, parole officers and others 
will wash cars for donations.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; SKATE DANCERS, POLICE REACH TRUCE ON BOARDWALK ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 20 years skaters have congregated at their favorite pathway just north of 
the Venice Beach Pavilion to dance and twirl to funk, rap and rock 'n' roll. 
Now they fear their recreation, which is also a top tourist attraction, may be 
in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 On two occasions recently, police say, patrol cars responding to emergency 
radio calls were hindered from reaching the beach because of skaters on the 
pathway, an extension of Market Street. Police say they use the pathway, which 
leads to the beach, as an emergency access road. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first incident, on June 24, the skaters were temporarily banned from 
the spot. A core group of about 30 regulars then formed the Skate Dancers Assn. 
of Venice and took their concerns to Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's office. 
</P>
<P>
 They were allowed back on the site after a meeting last Friday involving 
police, city recreation and parks officials and Niki Tennant, a deputy to 
Galanter. Skaters agreed in the meeting to keep the path clear in emergency 
situations in return for a lifting of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The skaters say their longtime venue is ideal because of its smooth, flat, 
wide surface and the ample space for spectators on a grassy area nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "At our Friday meeting, we all agreed that the skate dancers are an integral 
part of Venice Beach," Tennant said. "But the police are concerned about 
emergency access issues and liability issues. On some Sundays there are huge 
crowds, and police sometimes have three to four emergency access calls a day 
beyond the boardwalk." 
</P>
<P>
 Tennant also said the city attorney's office has rendered an opinion that a 
skating ban at that particular spot was legally unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 Some skaters who witnessed the June 24 incident said the patrol car was 
delayed for only a few seconds. Two skaters who were in the way quickly left 
the pathway once the car's siren sounded, they said. Skaters also deny the 
Police Department's contention that skaters blocked a patrol car again last 
Sunday. They charge that police have lost sight of public safety priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many more important problems for the police to concentrate on in 
this area, such as crime, gangs and illegal vending," said Gerry Clark, a 
member of Skate Dancers Assn. of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the goodwill exhibited in Friday's meeting, many skaters say that, 
since then, they have come under increased scrutiny from the police. The police 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Capt. Dave Powers of the Los Angeles Police Department: "We put on extra 
patrols because of the Fourth of July holiday. It wasn't in response to what 
the skaters were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice Boardwalk is one of the largest tourist attractions in Los Angeles 
County, with millions of visitors each year, and the skate dancers put on one 
of the most popular events. Over the weekend, skaters collected more than 1,500 
signatures from residents, tourists, business owners and other skaters on a 
petition to designate the Market Street pathway as a special skate dancing 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said city Recreation and Parks officials are looking for alternative 
sites in an effort to find a solution. "We feel we have been fair and impartial 
in enforcing the law," Powers said. "Skaters are a part of the Venice 
ecosystem." ADRIAN MAHER

TRIAL BEGINS IN FORMER MAYOR'S SUIT; SOUTH PASADENA: LEE PRENTISS SAYS THE 
COUNCIL, MOTIVATED BY OPPOSITION TO HIS CONSERVATISM, ACTED TO REVOKE HIS 
BUILDING PERMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Pasadena City Council moved to revoke a former mayor's building 
permit against the advice of the city attorney, two key witnesses have 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony came last week in Pasadena Superior Court as the trial began in 
the case of former Mayor Lee D. Prentiss, who claims the city pulled his 
building permit for political, not planning, reasons, and thus violated his 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 All the defendants have denied the charges as ridiculous in interviews during 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prentiss' suit alleges that city leaders, motivated by malice and opposition 
to his conservative politics, instructed a city official nearly four years ago 
to revoke a permit for a three-story, 1,750-square-foot extension to his 
86-year-old Craftsman-style home. The suit names ex-Mayor Evelyn Fierro, 
Councilman Harry Knapp and his wife Clarice, ex-Mayor James C. Hodge Jr., Mayor 
Amedee O. Richards and Transportation Commissioner Joanne Nuckols. 
</P>
<P>
 Prentiss received the permit the month before it was revoked and already had 
cut a new arch in a wall, removed cement and bricks and poured new cement 
foundations, his suit says.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the Oaklawn Avenue house was on the state Historic 
Resources Inventory and the expansion plans thus needed environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the state Supreme Court last July let stand an appellate court ruling 
that the city had wrongfully revoked the permit to expand 3,500-square-foot 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial got off to a fiery start Thursday when former City Manager John 
Bernardi testified that the council decided to pull Prentiss' permit even 
though then-City Atty. Charles S. Vose advised against it. Vose resigned a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was political. I indicated there was no grounds to revoke the 
permit," said Bernardi, adding that building permits fall within the purview of 
the city's head of planning, not the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, a 30-year city employee, said Fierro told him "Mr. Prentiss and 
myself (Bernardi) were good old boys who destroyed the city and it was time for 
pay-back." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman James S. Woollacott said that in a breach of the Brown Act, 
which restricts what public agencies can do in closed meetings, the council 
decided to revoke Prentiss' permit.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; POLICE AUDIT RECOMMENDS STRENGTHENING LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $100,000 management audit of the Beverly Hills Police Department has been 
made public, and the report outlined several dozen ways to improve the 
department without raising costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-page study recommends strengthening management supervision and 
leadership in the 132-officer department, redeploying patrol officers, changing 
dispatch policies and making better use of existing technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By implementing some of the recommendations, consultants from the Virginia 
firm Towers Perrin said the department could improve response time, boost 
police visibility and increase the public's sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, though, the audit was complimentary to the department. Bill Evans, 
the senior consultant from Towers Perrin, praised the department, saying it 
"has been matched by few of the more than 200 police departments the 
consultants have studied over the last 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Police Chief Marvin Iannone said he was pleased with the audit 
and agreed with most of the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he supported recommendations that supervision be improved and that 
additional civilian staff be hired to support officers in the detective 
division. But he added: "There are a few (recommendations) that will require 
more analysis by my staff, as we're not sure that they will fit into the 
context of policing Beverly Hills." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been supportive of this audit because I knew that once the light 
was shown on our department, the whole world could see how truly excellent our 
department is," Iannone said. 
</P>
<P>
 One recommendation that is sure to become a contentious issue with the rank 
and file is the suggestion to streamline the pay bonuses that officers are 
eligible to receive. Currently, officers can increase their base pay up to 
27.5% with bonuses given for fitness, education and assignments other than core 
patrol duties. The audit recommends tying the bonuses to annual job-performance 
appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also suggests some modification of the department's organizational 
structure and either eliminating or transferring 17 positions -- 13 of them 
sworn and four of them civilian. One of those 17 positions -- a deputy chief's 
post -- had already been eliminated when the audit was released. The man who 
had held the job, Ron Garner, was reassigned as director of emergency 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit of the $18-million police department is part of a broader city 
management audit program under which all departments will be reviewed over the 
next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the City Council initiated the study, the police union, the Beverly Hills 
Police Officers' Assn., had criticized spending $100,000 on it.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the city will recoup the $100,000 cost of the police audit in the 
form of financial savings and the "societal" benefit of improved police 
service. SUSAN STEINBERG

 Ground was broken Tuesday for a new $8-million, 286-space parking structure in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, to be completed in the fall of 1995, will be at 345 N. Beverly

congestion along the busy commercial street. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking garage, the ninth city-owned one to be built, will provide six

will boost the number of parking spaces in the city, including on- and 
off-street metered parking, to 7,500, according to city officials.

</P>
<P>
 Invariably, those unacquainted with the anti-graffiti tactic scoff at first 
hearing the idea. Oh sure, painted vines will stop taggers who routinely jump 
fences, scale heights, cross barbed wire, wriggle through bushes and ignore 
barking dogs to spray-paint monikers on seemingly inaccessible walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some unknown reason, the vines work. It's a mystery even to those who 
have spent years stamping a paint-laden, vine-shaped sponge onto fresh coats of 
Navajo white. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the vine ladies of La Puente: two women who began painting the vines 
15 years ago and two others who now want to start nonprofit anti-graffiti 
corporations using the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly don't know why it works," said Loretta Chase, who lives in 
unincorporated La Puente and estimates she has painted 10 miles of the vines in 
the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 The vines sprouted on walls in East Los Angeles last year thanks to the 
Maravilla Foundation, a nonprofit neighborhood cleanup agency that took its 
painting lessons from La Puente. Chase painted the faux vines on the parking 
lot walls at the Hollywood Bowl and the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Los 
Angeles, at their request. And Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina has 
adopted La Puente's painted greens as part of the anti-graffiti effort that her 
office occasionally supervises in her district. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our M.O. now; we don't just do (plain) paint-overs," said Molina's 
press deputy, Robert Alaniz. "Once they paint vines and leaves on a wall, you 
don't see any more graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the vines keep off graffiti because a spray-painted name gets 
visually lost amid the tangle of ersatz leaves and stems. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say most of the vines are tended by vigilant touch-up crews who simply 
add a green leaf or two to cover up stray graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others suggest that community pride is the secret, with taggers driven 
away by the outpouring of neighborhood cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, most of the vine-painting efforts include paint donated by 
nonprofit agencies or neighborhood stores. With community activists, local 
politicians and schools handling the organizing chores, crews of children, 
parents and even taggers themselves put up the vines in a Saturday afternoon of 
Tom Sawyer-like painting enthusiasm. Neighbors honk and wave, provide free 
drinks and food and even drop whatever they're doing to lend a hand, painters 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 What tagger would dare incur the wrath of an entire neighborhood once the 
walls are finished, asks William Gonzalez, a manager with the Maravilla 
Foundation. The nonprofit anti-graffiti and neighborhood cleanup agency in East 
Los Angeles has covered walls with Navajo white in the past year for various 
vine-painting projects in East Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley, Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids tell their older brothers, 'Don't mess with the wall 
because we did it,' " he added. "I was a skeptic myself, but it works." 
</P>
<P>
 But why vines? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea sprang from energetic Jo Ann Sanchez, a 55-year-old North Whittier 
homemaker who in the summer of 1978 was searching for a project for her newly 
established Avocado Heights Women's Club, a group that included residents from 
La Puente, Bassett, North Whittier and Hacienda Heights. The women decided to 
beautify the graffiti-blighted block walls along Workman Mill Road in Bassett. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my idea to plant creeping fig vines, the kind used on freeways," said 
Sanchez, a former model and manicurist who sports personalized license plates 
reading "2 HUNEY," a variation on her nickname, Honey. "We figured if we 
covered the walls in green it would be beautiful and they wouldn't write on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The group got permission from the 69 homeowners whose block walls bordered the 
then-rural thoroughfare. Sanchez and her women's club members dug holes, stuck 
the baby vines in the dirt and waited. But the plants withered under homeowner 
neglect and abuse from bicycle-riding children. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Sanchez latched onto an idea borrowed from a neighbor who had seen 
painted vines in Newport Beach. Why not here? she thought. So, the women's club 
members armed themselves with 25 gallons of paint and marched out to the block 
walls to try their artistic hands on a half-mile stretch. Twirling a 
four-inch-wide roller brush to create leaves took some skill, and the results 
were mixed, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of (the walls) were beautiful and some were horrible. I mean, real 
eyesores," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the vines were a unique improvement over the graffiti, and the project 
garnered some small press coverage, she said. Then, the club broke up, the 
vines faded over time, more houses sprang up along Workman Mill Road and 
graffiti took over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Chase, 50, a former women's club member, who decided three years ago to 
revive the vines. With the help of the Workman Mill Homeowner's Assn., which 
raised $1,000, and painting tips from Sanchez, Chase and other volunteers 
decided to give the vines a more coherent look. 
</P>
<P>
 They adopted a technique by which sponges cut in the shape of leaves could be 
dipped into paint and stamped onto the walls. The sponges enable small children 
to help on the project and speed up the work, said Chase, a tall, thin woman 
who exudes cheery enthusiasm when she talks about the vines. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting the five miles of block walls on both sides of Workman Mill Road and 
on nearby streets took every Saturday for four months in 1991, Chase said. The 
group threw a big potluck dinner to celebrate at the end, but it wasn't over 
for Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina's office has called her to help with numerous vine-painting projects in 
neighboring areas. Chase paints the stems herself, gives some basic 
leaf-sponging information and oversees volunteers gathered by others, she said. 
Increasingly, she spots painted vines cropping up on walls she never touched. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have picked up on it," Chase said. "The artwork is different, 
but it's basically leaves and vines." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who picked up on it recently is Irma Sandoval, a Guatemalan 
immigrant and La Puente mother of three. Despite her poor English, Sandoval has 
won recognition for countless hours of volunteer work in local schools and for 
her vine painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom is famous!" boasts her 14-year-old son, Kenneth. Indeed, Sandoval, 47, 
said that she has organized schoolchildren and adults to help paint more than 
90 walls with vines. Paint has come from donations or from state Assemblywoman 
Hilda Solis (D-El Monte), whose office has helped Sandoval with some of the 
painting projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A quiet, earnest woman with a bold decorating style -- the walkway to her 
house is hung with bright orange papier-mache parrots to match the house's trim 
-- Sandoval began painting vines as an offshoot of the arts and crafts work she 
was teaching neighborhood children three years ago. The idea was to give the 
children a task and clean up the neighborhood at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 She printed T-shirts bearing the logo "Hope in Youth," which are worn by some 
of her charges. Now, she said, she would like to create a nonprofit corporation 
to have the many Spanish-speaking immigrant children who have settled in La 
Puente and neighboring areas paint vines and embark on other craft projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has begun only the preliminary steps to create the agency, she is 
serene. "I believe that God is going to help me (on to) where I am supposed to 
go," she said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Of similar, deeply held faith is Valerie Brannon, another La Puente vine 
painter. The painting bug bit her hard last year, said Brannon, 39, the mother 
of a 9-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 After joining a community group in what she thought would be a one-time, 
anti-graffiti vine-painting outing in La Puente in May last year, Brannon 
couldn't put the paintbrush down. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanned and athletic-looking from her previous years as a riding instructor and 
horse-stable owner, Brannon went on to paint 16 other murals herself in the 
streets surrounding her La Puente home. One includes a vine mural blocks long 
running the entire length of the Alta-Dena dairy fence on Hambledon Avenue in 
the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work, however, departs from simple painted leaves and stems. She 
encourages children to paint small animals and scenes in the spaces between the 
leaves. She herself, with no artistic training, has begun doing full-fledged 
mural panels, including a number of animals in a Noah's ark scene, a Nativity 
and Virgin Mary murals, as well as nature scenes with wolves and dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some help has come from the Maravilla Foundation, but Brannon said she has 
bought thousands of dollars of paint out of her salary as a licensed vocational 
nurse at a nearby convalescent home.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like to paint," she said. "It's what drives my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning she gets up at 6:30 to drive past her murals. If there's any 
defacement, she whips out paint kept at the ready in her Honda Civic hatchback. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think I'm nuts," Brannon said of the gang members she encounters on the 
street. " 'La Torita!' they used to shout at me from their cars, 'the stubborn 
little bull.' But now they call me the 'Rainbow Lady.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The new moniker comes from the logo she uses on her murals, a picture of a 
brush painting a rainbow with a heart underneath. Two months ago, she quit her 
job. Now, like Sandoval, she wants to form a nonprofit corporation to paint 
murals full time using her logo, Young Hearts With Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Also like Sandoval, she believes God will direct her efforts if it is meant to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three times I prayed for art students and they just walked up," she said of 
occasions when she was trying to paint something that she lacked the technical 
training to carry out. "The Lord knows the plans for Young Hearts With Hope. He 
has already decided it. So far, all the doors have been opened to us." 
</P>
<P>
 All the vine painting in her city and surrounding areas delights Sanchez, who 
started it all in the San Gabriel Valley 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprises me to see the vines up here and up there," she said. "Sometimes 
it's not so pretty, but still, it's prettier than graffiti."

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; MARCH PLANNED TO PROTEST VICE CRIME ON EAST 
SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, West Hollywood residents have complained about rampant prostitution 
and other crime on the economically depressed east side of town. Now, in the 
wake of a July 4 slaying in their neighborhood, they plan to stop complaining 
and start marching. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of local activists has scheduled a neighborhood walk Friday night to 
"take back the streets" from male hustlers and transvestite prostitutes who ply 
their trade despite the existence of a prostitution abatement zone on Santa 
Monica Boulevard near La Brea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The march is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. in Plummer Park, then proceed about 
seven blocks east on Santa Monica to La Brea and back again. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice crime "brings down the area," said Ruth Williams, a West Hollywood public 
safety commissioner and founder and chairwoman of the Alliance of Citizens for 
the East Side, which is organizing the march. "You can't attract development 
and revitalization when you've got prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The march dovetails with other recent community efforts to combat the 
decades-old prostitution problem. The city of West Hollywood earlier this year 
formed a new multi-agency task force to study the issue, and Sheriff's 
Department deputies have launched sting operations against suspected repeat 
offenders in the abatement zone, according to city spokeswoman Nancy 
Greenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet residents say the problem is getting worse and leading to more serious 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on the morning of July 4, a 50-year-old male motorist was shot and 
killed by a pedestrian after driving into a carwash on Santa Monica Boulevard, 
according to Sheriff's Deputy Larry Mead. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers later arrested 25-year-old William Allen Wells of San Diego in 
connection with the slaying, but they have declined to speculate publicly on a 
motive, Mead said. But Williams and other residents claim that prostitution has 
over the years spawned numerous related crimes, including murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitution "gives a terrible image to the city," said Bill Senigram, an east 
side homeowner who plans to march Friday night. "If we can march in force, then 
maybe we can get (the prostitutes) into the outreach programs and off the 
streets." SCOTT COLLINS

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY; FIGHTING TAINT WITH PAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who want to replace graffiti-covered walls with painted vines, mural 
painters in the La Puente area offer a few tips. 
</P>
<P>
 1.Organize a group of volunteer painters and set a painting date. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Call the numbers that follow to solicit advice and training. Homeowners 
generally should be contacted beforehand and should sign permission forms. 
Liability forms should be signed by those painting. If children are involved, 
their parents should sign the forms. 
</P>

 3. On the painting day, be sure to bring enough paint and supplies to get the 
project started. Sometimes groups waste time waiting for the donated paint to 
arrive and can't reach local officials on the weekend, according to experienced 
vine painters. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Provide homeowners with touch-up paint to blot out any later defacement.

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; ON THE DEFENSIVE; RISING FEAR OF CRIME FUELS A BOOM IN 
SECURITY ITEMS -- EVEN IN PLACES THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging by the security measures its residents take, the Westside might seem 
one of the most dangerous places in Los Angeles, if not the entire state. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the kudzu-like proliferation of signs warning of armed response from 
home security services, plus the fleets of silently cruising private patrol 
cars, the homes rigged with motion detectors and security lights, and the 
omnipresent oinking of auto alarms.  
</P>
<P>
 That's not to mention the proliferation of portable security devices: 
restraining clubs locked across steering wheels, canisters of pepper spray, 
palm-sized stun guns and hand-activated personal alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Given this, an out-of-towner might assume that crime runs rampant in such 
usually quiet neighborhoods as Malibu, Brentwood and the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, of course, what most of the Westside's more affluent residents are 
doing is what they do best -- placing themselves at the leading edge of a 
nationwide trend. In this case, it's the boom in spending on auto, home and 
personal security. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Americans spent more than $400 million on safety equipment and 
services, double the amount of 15 years ago, according to American Demographics 
magazine. As the fear of violent and once-unheard-of crimes such as carjackings 
and follow-home robberies permeate the consciousness of suburban America, a 
world of items such as blindness-inducing flashlights, life-sized, latex 
"Safe-T-Men" (for people who live or drive alone) and keychain-attached batons 
are becoming increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, the call to arms has been particularly strong. Jon Cobb, vice 
president at Westec, perhaps the most recognizable of the home security 
agencies that patrol the area, said sales of the service are up 20% to 25% this 
year for homes in and around West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, at Security 20/20 in Beverly Hills, consultant Mike Peterson said 
sales of pepper spray have been "very favorable" since the company began 
selling the item in May after its legalization by the state. "We're getting 
people from all over West Los Angeles," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the surge in security purchases are anxious suburbanites concerned 
about crime in their neighborhoods. In a Time magazine/CNN poll taken last 
year, in fact, 30% of those surveyed nationwide said they believed that crime 
is just as prevalent in the suburbs as it is in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Paty Lancaster, whose Mar Vista house was burglarized in March, says that in 
talking to neighbors after the break-in, she was surprised to learn how many 
people in the area had also experienced crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until people talk to each other, you don't hear about it, but it turns out 
it's been happening a lot," said Lancaster, who helped form a Neighborhood 
Watch group on her block. "We're just more aware of it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood resident Richard Kjeldsen, who has lived in the area for more than 
two decades, says he does not personally feel at greater risk. But concern 
about crime, he adds, has nevertheless increased dramatically among neighbors. 
"A lot of my friends are frantic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of crime, though, is not so clear-cut. Though pockets of Venice 
and Hollywood do suffer from high crime, the areas of the Westside where the 
most is spent on security are usually the safest. And although violent crime 
has risen in suburban areas, according to FBI statistics, murder rates in 1992 
were still 81% lower in the suburbs than in large central cities, rates of 
robbery were 88% lower and rates of rape were 56% lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Los Angeles, which has the second-highest rate of suburban crime among 
major American cities (behind only Miami), suburban crime still lags far behind 
that of the central city area. 
</P>
<P>
 Security experts attribute the public's rising concern as much to media 
reports as to crime rates. On a daily basis, people are exposed to more 
accounts of crime than ever before, a phenomenon noted recently by the Tyndall 
Report, a magazine that monitors television news. A February article in the 
magazine stated that "violent crime has become more newsworthy because . . . 
the news media have chosen to make it so." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the crime statistics, crime is not necessarily up . . . (but) 
it's a lot more visible in the media," concurred Jon Cobb. "People are more 
aware of what's going on in and around their communities." Agreed Hemsworth: "A 
lot of it is perception. Crime is up in certain areas and it's down in certain 
areas."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for West Los Angeles, where the local boom in security is perhaps most 
evident, the crime picture is a mixed one. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of robberies increased 110, about 8%, from 1992 to 1993, but the 
number of homicides and rapes declined during that period. Overall, crime is 
down in the area, said Capt. Constance Dial, patrol commanding officer of the 
West Los Angeles Division. 
</P>
<P>
 In sheer numbers, the biggest crime in West Los Angeles remains that of 
auto-related theft. According to police statistics, last year there were 4,083 
thefts from and burglaries of autos in West Los Angeles and 3,403 stolen 
vehicles, in both cases a slight decline from 1992 figures. Many stolen cars 
are subsequently dispatched to so-called chop shops, officials say, where a 
$20,000 auto can be quickly broken down into $40,000 worth of illegally sold 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very desirable area for auto thieves to steal cars from," said 
John Raber of LoJack, which markets a device that allows police to track 
vehicles after they are taken. In the Los Angeles area, Raber says, the highest 
percentage of stolen cars equipped with LoJack are from the Westside. "There's 
a real good selection of cars to choose from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Westside's biggest threat is auto theft and break-ins does 
little to assuage residents who consider personal crime their No. 1 worry. 
Regardless of whether their fears are well-founded, residents say they feel 
that such crimes as violent attacks and home break-ins are rising sharply, and 
that they are more random than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime used to be in the 'bad' parts of town," said Ken Hudson, president of 
Front Line, a Torrance-based business that offers courses in personal security 
and disaster preparedness. "Now people see it happening everywhere and they 
feel more vulnerable." Brian Hemsworth, managing editor of Safe and Secure 
Living magazine, agreed: "Most people we talk to, they're scared." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has resulted in a surge in sales of security goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Counter Spy Shop in Beverly Hills, which sells an array of corporate 
and personal security equipment, manager Judy Fish says that all types of 
customers now walk through the door, from those who want to spend a few 
thousand dollars for covert video cameras planted in toy animals to those who 
want a standard stun gun. "We are selling pepper spray to 75-year-old women," 
Fish said. "There are people who would absolutely not leave their house without 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Maria Bugarin. Last week, Bugarin, who works in Brentwood at a 
property management firm, bought her first canister of pepper spray. It now 
hangs from her key chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (automated teller machine) robberies influenced my decision, and hearing 
about carjacking and all the assaults at night," said Bugarin, who is single 
and in her 30s. "That got the best of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she has never been the victim of crime, the administrative assistant 
says the burgeoning homeless population and the city's 1992 riots have made her 
feel more vulnerable, even in an area such as Brentwood. "Crime can take place 
anywhere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in security say that initial small purchases such as Bugarin's often 
lead to the acquisition of more sophisticated security equipment, a key factor 
fueling the growth in the field. "Once a person becomes interested in security 
in one part of their life, they become interested in security in all parts of 
their lives," said Hemsworth, whose Canoga Park-based publication began two 
years ago in response to the security boom. "The same person who is out there 
buying a firearm is also very interested in locking devices, auto security and 
home protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that interest, to be sure, arises from the suggestions of security 
experts. For those who feel they need personal protection, for instance, 
experts recommend a "layer of defenses" -- perhaps a personal alarm used in 
conjunction with pepper spray -- not a single device or weapon. For example, a 
stun gun only works if it can be put in contact with an assailant's skin. Thus, 
to stop someone who is farther than arm's length away, pepper spray might be 
more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go out and buy a .357-magnum and stick it in your back pocket if that's what 
you need to do to protect yourself, but don't think that's going to solve all 
your problems," said Mike Peterson of Security 20/20. "No one should believe 
any one thing is a magic cure-all." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Westside residents are also taking extra precautions at home. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mack, vice president of Protection One, a home security business based in 
Culver City, said that although his company's alarm systems are in homes 
throughout Southern California, the bulk of the patrol services are for 
residents on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, where an 
ever-increasing number of homeowners and Neighborhood Watch groups are 
requesting his company's services (all told, he said, there are more than 
23,000 homeowners groups in California, far outdistancing the number in other 
states). "These people want to build their own communities, wall themselves off 
and get their own security," Mack said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Front Line, the Torrance company that offers personal security training, 
Hudson estimates that 70% of his students are either single professional women 
or suburban mothers ages 25 to 40. Though few trainees say they have been 
personally victimized by crime, most know of a crime that occurred nearby and 
feel that police are simply too undermanned and underpowered to combat crime 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents say that taking charge of their own security not only makes 
them feel less vulnerable but also gives them peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bugarin: "I feel a little more self-confident. It makes you aware of what 
you can do to someone else. You're no longer defenseless."

HEALTH: CARCINOGENS, TWO SCHOOLS AND EPA ACTION AT MONTEREY PARK LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many thanks to Richard Winton for his outstanding article on the Operating 
Industries dump (April 28). I was outraged to learn that the EPA has known for 
years that the controls were not working properly, and the flares were not 
burning hot enough. 
</P>
<P>
 This condition allows cancer-causing contaminants to be released into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the summer, the EPA promises some protection, and by 1997 new 
controls will be put in. That is not only reprehensible, it is unacceptable. It 
should also be criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Schurr High School is within 1,000 feet of the dump, and Wilcox Elementary 
School is close by. Did the EPA or CURE Inc. notify the schools that the air 
was deadly? Did they try to protect the students and staff? The EPA and CURE 
Inc. and New Cure Inc. have jeopardized the health and safety of every man, 
woman, child and pet in parts of Montebello and southern Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only conclude that John Wise, deputy regional administrator for the 
EPA, must bear the responsibility for the short-term health problems residents 
have been experiencing. He must also bear responsibility for any long-term 
health problems residents will develop. His inaction and insensitivity is 
unforgivable. We have all been breathing cancer-causing contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the Environmental Protection Agency isn't protecting anyone, 
and CURE Inc. and New Cure Inc. haven't cured anything.

GOVERNMENT: TAX ON UTILITIES IN DUARTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am among those in Duarte who opposed the utility tax in statements made at 
the May 10 meeting. I do this in principle for seeking improvement in 
governmental financial responsibility at all levels. It seems appropriate to 
start at home in our city. I would like to see, using a perhaps shopworn 
phrase, a reinvention of government financing practices. I would not place 
blame on anyone for our situation. This would be wrong and would not be 
constructive nor productive even if it were correct. 
</P>
<P>
 From my observation, by far the greatest number of residents who spoke at the 
meeting had something constructive to suggest or merely expressed their opinion 
on the various proposals under consideration. They did not purport blame, nor 
threat, nor any other non-constructive message. It is unfortunate that a few 
chose to blame or threaten. We have some people in our city, just as in our 
society as a whole, who tend to choose these tactics when emotions rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, in the process of improving government, we can also show there is a 
better way to resolve our differences. This might have the benefit of improving 
people's attitude and behavior toward each other when faced with difficult 
issues. I would be proud to see that improvement also begin in Duarte.  
</P>
<P>
 It is also unfortunate that The Times statement on this meeting exaggerated 
the significance of these blameful and threatening statements with the 
expression: "Many of the more than 20 residents who spoke on the tax blamed 
poor city management. . . ." From my observation, this is incorrect. It would 
be more appropriate to say, "Although a few of the more than 20 residents who 
spoke on the subject blamed poor city management, by far the greatest number 
simply expressed their opinion on the various proposals, including the tax, or 
offered alternatives in a constructive way."

SUMMER BRINGS WARNINGS ABOUT DANGERS OF DROWNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 2-year-old Rebecca Boice drowned last month in her grandparents' 
Claremont swimming pool, she became the third toddler in three days to die in a 
pool in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the season of hot, sunny days comes increased danger for young 
children near swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 36 children younger than 5 drowned in Los Angeles County, according 
to statistics from the County Health Department. For every child who drowns, 
many others suffer from a near-drowning episode, said Billie Weiss, a Los 
Angeles County Health Department epidemiologist and director of the 
department's injury and violence prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 Drowning is the leading cause of death for children ages 1 to 5 in California, 
Weiss said, adding that most of the deaths occur in back-yard swimming pools.  
</P>
<P>
 "People see a pool as recreation," Weiss said. "They don't see it as a risk 
for young children." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss recommends creating layers of protection for a child: 
</P>
<P>
 * Put a barrier fence between the house and the pool. The fence should contain 
self-closing, self-latching gates and should have vertical openings no wider 
than four inches. The fence should be at least 50 inches high and the latching 
device should be located where children cannot reach it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install an approved pool cover with a lock, and keep it closed and locked 
when the pool is not in use. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep lifesaving devices, such as lifesaving rings and a long stick with a 
hook on it, near the pool in case a child falls in. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a phone in the pool area so you don't have to go inside to answer the 
phone and so you can call 911 immediately if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn CPR. "Had somebody at the (Claremont) scene known CPR . . . maybe that 
could have made the difference," Claremont Police Lt. Ted Kamena said of 
Rebecca's June 8 death. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't rely on the child's swimming expertise. Children who know how to swim 
often don't remember when they fall in the water. Twenty-five percent of the 
children who drown have had swimming lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never leave a child alone in or near a pool, bathtub or any body of water. 
All caretakers should know how to swim and know water rescue techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley Drowning Prevention Task Force offers literature on the 
subject. Information: (818) 814-8811.

SANTA MONICA: EFFECTS OF PROPOSITIONS D AND E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passage of Propositions D and E in the recent Santa Monica election will 
benefit the city in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
 One of particular note was highlighted in your recent front-page article, 
"Savoring a World of Beauty After 66 Years In Shadows" (May 23). 
</P>
<P>
 As your readers may recall, in 1958 mathematician Sam Genensky joined the RAND 
Corp. working on strategic systems for the U.S. Air Force, among other 
projects. Mr. Genensky's eyes had been damaged in an accident at birth. In 
spite of his limited eyesight, he persevered, attended college and became a 
noted mathematician. While at RAND, he and several colleagues developed a 
device based on closed-circuit television technology that enables people with 
severely limited vision to read and write. A prototype was built for Genensky's 
own use and is now being used all over the world by partially sighted persons. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad some of our local residents dwell only on the negative aspects of 
RAND! Who knows what other benefits to mankind may come out of RAND's research!

LIFEGUARDS: READER ENJOYS ARTICLE ABOUT TRAINING ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have occasionally been stirred by well-written articles in The Times.Now 
that I've retired I feel no hindrance of work to keep me from telling you I 
really enjoyed the article on lifeguard training ("Rescue Me," June 16.) 
</P>
<P>
 The article was very entertaining and informative, with just the right amount 
of sensitivity and done with good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 I look forward to seeing more of the section's articles.

MEDIA: FLASHBACKS TO '60S DAYS OF ACTIVISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm always so relieved when I hear that the press does not have a "liberal 
bias." Nonetheless, it's always comforting when the Westside section proves 
this non-bias with profiles glorifying leftists such as Tony Russo of Pentagon 
Papers fame (for anyone under 35, these are called footnotes in history) and 
Carol Wells -- a dissident holdover from the '60s days of radical campus 
activism living in a state of suspended animation. 
</P>
<P>
 Such articles trigger flashbacks of another time and place. For others, I 
guess living the old battles of our adolescence over and over again is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that all art (and I suppose speech and food, too) is politics 
trivializes all art as well as the joy of existence for the sake of existing -- 
something we fight to obtain for animals trees and refuse to people. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressionable journalists (who) glorify '60s radicalism and the 
dysfunctional, value-neutral -- and, therefore, valueless -- society the elites 
from that time create for us, ought to inquire why so many of the "intellectual 
elite" from those long-gone days never seemed to get a life.

CIVIC CENTER: RAND CAMPAIGN SCRUTINIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to thank those citizens who supported our campaign against the 
City Council/RAND Civic Center Plan for 2.1 million square feet of development, 
23,000 additional car trips and globally irresponsible air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Our grass-roots campaign is part of a Santa Monica residents movement 
motivated by a vision that respects the history and the environmental quality 
that was once cherished in our community. Unfortunately, RAND's slick, 
big-money campaign won out. Like many cities in this country, we will have to 
learn by repeating what history has tried to teach us. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike those who supported the plan, opponents will not have to bear the 
political responsibility for its folly. But all Santa Monicans will have to 
suffer its negative fiscal, environmental and social consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters should remember the City Council/RAND's promise of a tax-free Civic 
Center this November when they are confronted with a large ($50 million to $60 
million) bond measure to build a new Civic Center parking structure and 
"police, fire and emergency facilities." We should also remember how our right 
to "public safety" was held hostage to approving mega-development standards for 
RAND, and how in November a new police facility will be tied to the approval of 
a six-story parking structure on Fourth Street. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND was up front about one thing, the need to "clean up our city." With the 
help of every City Council and Planning Commission member and $140,000 of your 
tax dollars along with RAND's $200,000-plus in campaign funds, sprinkled on 
everyone from the newspapers to developers to political consultants, RAND did 
"clean up" -- on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we were outspent 30 to 1 and opposed by the full weight of the city's 
entrenched elite bureaucracy, 40% of the voters (over 6,500 Santa Monicans) 
still saw through the cynical, misleading City Council/RAND campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks again to all of you who see a better future for Santa Monica. Please 
send this message to City Hall in the elections this November. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Many thanks to the reporting staff of the Los Angeles Times for coverage of 
the recent Santa Monica Civic Center issue. 
</P>
<P>
 This coverage was, for the most part, comprehensive, balanced and fair, while 
the issue was virtually nonexistent for the electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for performing your watchdog function. I hope that the Times will 
continue to cover the issue and to publicize the forthcoming deviations from 
what was promised.

EMPLOYMENT: HUGHES' SUPPORT FOR HARMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, Hughes Aircraft Co., long a high-tech fixture in Playa del Rey, El 
Segundo and Torrance, generated controversy by distributing a form letter 
"encouraging" its employees to give money to incumbent Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey), believing that Harman could help Hughes and the rest of the 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, (last week), Hughes announced 3,200 job cuts in California. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt that the many Hughes employees who dutifully gave Jane Harman their 
contributions and votes, and who will soon join the unemployment rolls, feel 
that they made a wise investment.

VENICE: LATINO VIEW OF GANG WAR SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I noticed that the article by Jeffrey Kramer on the Venice gang war contained 
no quotes from Latinos, who constitute 50% of the people in the Oakwood 
neighborhood.Twenty-five percent are black and 25% are white. The article 
implies, by its failure to quote from any Latinos, that this is a neighborhood 
with a black majority. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a spokesperson for the Latino community. I have no idea what they 
think or feel, but I would like to know, and that is the job of the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Every story trots out that tired old conspiracy rumor that big developers have 
sponsored the gang war. Let's have more depth in the future.

 They adorn miles and miles of walls along city streets in the San Gabriel 
Valley, East Los Angeles and parts of Hollywood: simple and often 
primitive-looking painted green leaves on swirling brown vines. 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably, those unacquainted with the anti-graffiti tactic scoff at the 
idea. Oh sure, they laugh, painted vines will stop taggers who routinely jump 
fences, scale heights, cross barbed wire, wriggle through bushes and ignore 
barking dogs to spray-paint monikers on seemingly inaccessible walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some unknown reason, they work. "I honestly don't know why," said 
Loretta Chase, who lives in unincorporated La Puente and estimates she has 
painted 10 miles of the vines in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 The vines sprouted on walls in East Los Angeles last year thanks to the 
Maravilla Foundation, a nonprofit neighborhood cleanup agency. Chase painted 
the faux vines on the parking lot walls at the Hollywood Bowl and the nearby 
John Anson Ford Amphitheatre. And Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina 
has adopted La Puente's painted greens as part of an anti-graffiti effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the vines keep off graffiti because a spray-painted name gets 
visually lost amid the tangle of ersatz leaves and stems. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say most of the vines are tended by vigilant touch-up crews who simply 
add a green leaf or two to cover up stray graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others suggest that community pride is the secret, with taggers driven 
away by the outpouring of neighborhood cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, most of the vine-painting efforts include paint donated by 
nonprofit agencies or neighborhood stores. With community activists, local 
politicians and schools handling the organizing chores, crews of children, 
parents and even taggers themselves put up the vines in a Saturday afternoon of 
Tom Sawyer-like painting enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
 But why vines? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea sprang from energetic Jo Ann Sanchez, a 55-year-old North Whittier 
homemaker who in the summer of 1978 was searching for a project for her 
newly-established Avocado Heights Women's Club. The women decided to beautify 
some graffiti-blighted walls by planting real vines along a neighborhood 
street, but the plants died. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Sanchez latched onto an idea borrowed from a neighbor who had seen 
painted vines in Newport Beach. Why not here? she thought. So, the women's club 
members armed themselves with roller brushes and 25 gallons of paint and 
marched out to paint over a half-mile stretch of block walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the club broke up and the vines faded over time, more houses sprang up 
along Workman Mill Road and graffiti took over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Chase, 50, a former women's club member, who decided three years ago to 
revive the vines. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other volunteers adopted a technique by which sponges cut in the shape 
of leaves could be dipped into paint and stamped onto the walls. The sponges 
enable small children to help on the project and speed up the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have picked up on it," Chase said. "The artwork is different, 
but it's basically leaves and vines." 
</P>
<P>
 All the vine painting in her city and surrounding areas delights Sanchez, who 
started it all in the San Gabriel Valley 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprises me to see the vines up here and up there," she said. "Sometimes 
it's not so pretty, but still, it's prettier than graffiti."

SCOTT WANTS TO GET CAREER BACK ON TRACK AFTER CANCER BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Scott has run the mile under four minutes 135 times -- a figure 
unapproached in history. He is the American record-holder in the event and has 
ranked among the country's top eight in the 1,500 meters for 15 consecutive 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott concedes his most challenging test of time came in May as he waited 
for results of surgery to probe for the spread of testicular cancer. Scott was 
hospitalized for four days after the 3 1/2-hour operation but biopsies were not 
completed until several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the operation, the three-time Olympian who trains under Azusa 
Pacific University Coach Irv Ray learned the good news. The tests turned out 
negative, precluding the need -- at least for the time being -- for 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to keep my mind off (chemotherapy)," Scott said. "I was told the 
results three days after I was released, but it seemed like a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, 38, will have a chest X-ray and a blood test every month for the next 
two years to check for relapse. Urologist Kevin O'Brien, however, said the 
prognosis for recovery without chemotherapy is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors made an 18-inch incision from Scott's abdomen to pubic bone in the May 
24 operation, delving almost to his backbone, to remove nearly 40 lymph nodes 
for analysis. Three weeks earlier, Scott had undergone surgery to remove a 
cancerous left testicle after a tumor was discovered during a physical for a 
vasectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one was a piece of cake," Scott said. "But when they cut you from the 
breast bone to the intestines to take out the lymph nodes, that's pretty 
drastic surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said the procedure and recovery time after the operation could have 
been more demanding if it were not for Scott's excellent physical condition 
developed through years of a rigorous 90-mile-a-week training regimen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve underestimated the second surgery and was a little devastated," O'Brien 
said. "I suspect he thought it would be a lot like the first. Luckily, we only 
had to go six inches deep because he was so skinny. In most people, we have to 
cut through at least six inches of fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Scott, plagued by a constant fever, lost nearly 15 pounds off his 
6-foot-1, 165-pound frame in the weeks after the surgery. His resting heart 
rate, which usually hovers close to 40 beats a minute, skyrocketed to 70. 
</P>
<P>
 The athlete's heart rate has dropped to under 60 beats the past week and he 
has resumed his normal activities. Scott, however, has no plans to return to 
running for several months, despite clearance from O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the heart rate tells me is that I'm not totally recovered yet, so that 
means I shouldn't be doing any training of any type," Scott said. "I'm thinking 
of starting on a stationary bike or doing some mountain biking, but it would be 
futile to do anything. It would just drag me further into a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott, whose U.S. record of 3 minutes 47.69 seconds in 1982 ranks as the 
fifth fastest mile of all time, has entertained no thoughts of retiring and has 
designs of breaking the four-minute mile a record 136th time. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-time U.S. national 1,500-meter champion hopes to start training by 
October, run an abbreviated season in 1995 and take a shot at the 1,500 in the 
1996 U.S. Olympic Trials. After that, he plans to compete in the Masters (age 
40 and over) circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's cancer differed from Philadelphia Phillies' first baseman John Kruk, 
who returned to play earlier this year after diagnosis and treatment. Kruk's 
cancer can be treated with radiation. Scott's condition is only treatable with 
chemotherapy and surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott chose surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chemotherapy can scar your lungs among other things and you want to avoid 
something like that if you want to continue running at a high level," said 
Scott, a Leucadia resident.  
</P>
<P>
 "Give a runner a choice between shin splints and a bad case of flu and he'll 
take the shin splints," he said. "It's just an injury. Chemo is like an 
illness. Surgery is like an injury. And it's not as hard on the body as chemo." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott felt lethargic during training and suspected a problem for nearly six 
months before the cancer was diagnosed. He ignored a warning sign of a shrunken 
testicle and sensitivity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there was something happening down there," Scott said. "I let this 
thing go because I thought, 'Nothing can happen to me. I'm invincible.' Cancer 
isn't discriminatory, it's one of those things that happens. It can affect 
anybody, but I still find it astonishing that something like this can happen to 
someone who has been training and taking care of their body as I have for so 
many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Testicular cancer typically strikes men between the ages of 18 and 40 and has 
a 95% cure rate if caught in the early stages. The cause is unknown, but 
O'Brien speculates trauma from running might have prompted Scott's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the initial physical examination, Scott was whisked onto the 
operating table for the first surgery, but the discovery did little to deflate 
Scott's spirits. He said he was more nervous in the weeks before the 1984 
Olympic 1,500 final than he was for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine times out of 10, doctors paint the absolute worst picture they can to 
cover themselves," said Scott, whose father is a physician. "If they gave me a 
95% cure rate, then that was as good as 100% to me."

SOUTH BAY; AFTER THREE YEARS, FORMER CLIENTS APPLAUD TRAVEL AGENT'S ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry and Deb Whipple of Lawndale will celebrate two unusual anniversaries 
this month: the day their travel agent allegedly fled with almost $1,000 of 
their trip deposit, and the honeymoon they took in spite of the setback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whipples are among more than 400 South Bay residents who Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies say were left holding their bags when their travel 
agent, Susan Reindl, suddenly closed the doors of Apollo Travel Service in 
Rancho Palos Verdes three years ago and disappeared with almost $500,000 in 
trip deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year investigation, deputies arrested Reindl on June 28 at a 
Harbor City travel agency where she was working. The arrest warrant charged 
Reindl with 74 felonies involving grand theft and travel-promotion violations. 
Reindl pleaded not guilty at her arraignment June 29 and was later released 
after posting $250,000 bail. A judge on Tuesday is scheduled to set the date 
for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Reindl could face up to 10 years in prison, said Laura Aalto, a 
Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who is handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The court could also ask Reindl to reimburse travelers left in the lurch, and 
a criminal conviction could mean that travelers who were defrauded would be 
among the first in line to collect from Reindl's assets filed under bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But local residents who were left ticketless, whether or not they receive 
their money back, were glad to hear of Reindl's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire the perseverance of the Sheriff's Department," said Larry Whipple, 
51, a retired Air Force projects manager. "I'd just about given up." 
</P>
<P>
 After Reindl closed shop, Whipple said, he and his wife paid Carnival Cruise 
Lines another $550 and took their scheduled 10-day honeymoon cruise. Whipple 
said Carnival already had received about $1,100 of the couple's original $2,000 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to have a good time, regardless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl eventually filed a Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy and a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy for Apollo Travel. In previous court proceedings, she said her 
business was hurt by the Gulf War and accused a former employee of embezzling 
$80,000 from Apollo, opening his own travel agency, and stealing 60% of her 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Reindl's attorney, Mona Soo Hoo, repeated those claims and 
added that the recession contributed to Apollo's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Department investigators allege that Reindl bilked clients by 
failing to make trip reservations or by making reservations and canceling them 
later. When asked about an employee who may have contributed to Apollo's 
downfall, investigators and the district attorney's office note that charges 
have been filed against Reindl only. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Aalto said she had no evidence that Reindl has been living lavishly 
over the past three years, but said she did not seek such information. 
</P>
<P>
 Whipple said he received a Nov. 4, 1993, letter stating that assets related to 
the Reindl case "may become available." He said he sent in his claim Nov. 21 
just as he began to feel the Apollo Travel case was "one more somebody bilking 
a bunch of people and trying to get away from it invoking bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Aalto said, it is a coincidence that the bankruptcy court sent out 
notices a few months before Reindl was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Whipples managed to salvage their honeymoon, other South Bay 
residents were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor City resident Helen Vaca said she and 13 relatives lost about $14,000 
in deposits for a seven-day cruise to Mexico. Vaca, who helped form a support 
group called Victims of Apollo Travel, says she was also disturbed at seeing 
Reindl work at a travel agency two blocks from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like UFO sightings," Vaca said, adding that Reindl was spotted in 
supermarkets and other locales. 
</P>
<P>
 Soo Hoo, however, said Reindl's effort to "live openly" in the South Bay shows 
that her client has no intention of evading investigators. "She goes to the 
same hairdresser," Soo Hoo said. "She shops at the same market." 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl had been working part-time at the Bo Lam Travel Service, 1662 W. 
Sepulveda Blvd., for nine months when she was arrested, said owner Telry Lim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim said she knew of the bankruptcy but assumed Reindl's problems were behind 
her. She said she has checked her travel agency's records and has no reason to 
believe Reindl did anything underhanded.  
</P>
<P>
 But she would not hire Reindl again, Lim said.

OUT AND ABOUT / 'FOREVER TANGO': LATIN LOVE HITS THE WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tango, the sensual dance born in turn-of-the-century Argentine bordellos, has 
come to the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin and non-Latin lovers alike can learn to tango with cast members of the 
new show "Forever Tango: the Eternal Dance," at the Westside Pavilion on 
Saturday and July 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to bring the tango to our customers," said Mary Lankester, senior 
marketing director of the Westside Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The pavilion helped organize the dance sessions, which began June 18, after 
being approached by promoters of the tango show. "Forever Tango" opened June 10 
at the Wilshire Theater and is scheduled to run through July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those on hand for the pavilion's tango classes June 25 were Cora and 
Walter Ebeling of Westwood Horizons retirement community. The tango, they said, 
brought them together two years ago at a New Year's Eve party, where Walter 
asked Cora to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've danced all my life," said Cora. "I especially love the Latin dances. I 
love Walter and dancing with him, and we just get along beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ebelings and two other couples won tickets to "Forever Tango" as they 
stood on the Pavilion stage, learning the complex dance with Gloria and Eduardo 
Arquimbau, a veteran husband-and-wife tango team that stars in the show. The 
Buenos Aires residents have traveled the world touring in tango shows such as 
the 1986 Broadway hit "Tango Argentino." 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it's a tremendous satisfaction to bring our dance to the people," 
said Eduardo. "It is much more than just a dance we are bringing, though, it is 
also our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 For Gloria and Eduardo, who have been together for 30 years, the glamorous 
dance, refined in the upper-class dance halls of Paris in the early 1900s, is 
more than a hobby or a form of entertainment. It is a dance that develops a 
life of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tango allows everybody to express their personality," Eduardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars of "Forever Tango: the Eternal Dance" will be demonstrating their 
techniques next to Nordstrom at Westside Pavilion, 10850 W. Pico Blvd., Level 
3, 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Saturday and July 16. For information: (310)

LOSS OF SANTA MONICA PROGRAM IS BLOW TO BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1976, when Art Harris was offered baseball coaching positions at West Los 
Angeles and Santa Monica colleges, he asked a question that remains pertinent 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Where was Santa Monica College going to play after the school built a library 
on its baseball field? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer today was the same in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't know," said Harris, who accepted the West L.A. job because the 
school had a baseball field. "I don't think you can build a viable, successful 
baseball program without an on-campus field. It would be like teaching 
chemistry without a laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica recently announced the suspension of its baseball program for the 
1995 season after failing to strike a deal for a proposed joint venture with 
West L.A. The Corsairs proposed moving the baseball team to West L.A., which 
has a field but no team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took 20 years to prove me right," said Harris, who was reassigned to a 
teaching job in 1986 after West L.A. dropped its program. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's decision means that in 1995 there will be no baseball at the 
community college level on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the kids on the Westside are getting cheated," said Kevin Brockway, 
Santa Monica's first-year coach. "Now they have dissolved both programs." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a situation that Santa Monica's Avie Bridges wanted to avoid. Caught in 
a maelstrom, Bridges, in her second year as the school's athletic director, has 
had to cut programs for financial and political reasons. She tentatively 
dropped men's volleyball and men's tennis and added women's volleyball in May 
in an attempt to meet government gender-equity requirements. Men's volleyball 
was reinstated when the proposed baseball deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges, along with school dean Jeff Shimizu, pushed to save the baseball 
program by proposing a joint program with West L.A. Santa Monica offered to pay 
75% of the costs associated with running the program. Those costs, estimated at 
$15,000, included equipment, transportation and liability insurance. In 
exchange, West L.A. would have paid the stipend for a baseball coach and an 
assistant and provide the field. 
</P>
<P>
 A third party, Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI), offered to raise 
$100,000 -- a total of $50,000 each from the Dodgers and the Angels -- to 
renovate the field at West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A. also would have been able to add a softball program, either run 
separately or jointly with Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea needed approval from two different community college school districts 
-- Los Angeles City and Santa Monica -- and from the governing boards for the 
Western State Conference and the California Community College Commission on 
Athletics. All those parties endorsed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "West L.A., however, would not honor the agreement," Bridges said. "Jeff and I 
worked very hard to consolidate the two programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want West L.A. to look like the bad guys, but ultimately they said 
they can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A. squelched the deal after its president, Evelyn Wong, requested 
written verification that RBI would pay to renovate the field. Wong said she 
was notified by RBI that the Dodgers had pulled out of the agreement and that 
the Angels would contribute only $46,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was unwilling to make a commitment to the conference until we receive a 
written commitment for the $46,000." Wong said. "We were exploring whether the 
money could pay for the renovation when the deadline came." 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges said Santa Monica still would be receptive to operating a joint 
program with West L.A. if the school receives funding. Two weeks after making 
her decision, Wong said she still has not heard from RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to drop baseball at Santa Monica did not surprise Brockway, who 
replaced 15-year Coach Marty Berson. The school had threatened to shut down the 
program after Berson's departure but chose to hire Brockway and continue to 
play its games on a makeshift Little League field at Marine Park. The Corsairs 
were 7-30 under Brockway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave up a lot to keep (the Santa Monica) program going," said Brockway, who 
is married and has a child. "I gave up a good job that paid real well and time 
I could have spent with my family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I'll find another coaching job. But I feel sorry for the 25 to 30 
players who will not be playing baseball next season." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the area's top baseball players have leapfrogged Santa Monica to 
play for more successful programs at El Camino and L.A. Harbor, schools that 
have on-campus fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obstacles, Santa Monica won 20 or more games from 1983-92. 
Berson's record was 296-282. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1976-86, West L.A. was 279-134 under Harris, who was the school's only 
baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who also works for the Dodgers as a scout, said he had about 100 
players drafted. Included in the group are former major leaguers such as 
pitcher Jeff Demon, outfielders Rodney McCray and Jim Vatcher, and catcher 
Jorge Pedre. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 55, lost his coaching position in 1986 when the L.A. Community College 
School District decided to eliminate mandatory physical education classes. 
Harris, a physical education teacher, was reassigned to teach health at West 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason not to have two baseball and two softball teams," Harris 
said. "There is the money and the facilities, but it's up to the top level 
administrators to make it a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris believes both schools could field competitive teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first step in the commitment would be to hire a full-time teacher as 
coach and there are a few around," he said. "The next level of commitment would 
be, in Santa Monica's case, to turn Clover Park into a first-rate baseball 
facility. They have the room and the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "At West L.A., they should do what they said they were going to do 18 years 
ago: Put dugouts in, grate the field, add a sprinkling system and lights." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Santa Monica's players and recruits must search for new 
teams. Not everyone is expected to get a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will hurt the mediocre players who will not get a chance to improve 
their skills," Brockway said. "Even the good players are going to go to another 
team and push someone else off the roster." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Corsair freshmen recruits affected by the decision included outfielder 
Joey Coraso (Culver City High), first baseman Kevin Moore (Beverly Hills), 
outfielder Lee Reinis (University), pitcher Jeremy Shaw (Palisades) and 
shortstop Tony Temblador (Venice). 
</P>
<P>
 Temblador, who said he was invited to try out for Los Angeles City College, 
said he will have trouble making the trip to the campus in East Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to buy a car and, financially, I'm not sure if I can afford that right 
now," Temblador said. "It's kind of disappointing because I love to play and I 
wanted a chance to keep my career going." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Crossroads baseball Coach Chuck Ice said the loss of Santa Monica's 
program will be felt even at the high school level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's definitely a blow to baseball on the Westside," said Ice, who is 
the athletic director at Crossroads. "In a sense it lowers the legitimacy of 
sports at both schools because baseball is a big-time sport." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner at the moment is the Santa Monica men's volleyball program, which 
was tentatively dropped in May. But coach Jonathan Penn has mixed feelings 
about the move to drop baseball and keep men's volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been such a roller-coaster ride for so long," said Penn, who led the 
Corsairs to an 11-8 record in his first season as coach. "From the beginning, 
they pitted us against each other. Fortunately, Kevin and I never saw it that 
way. We fought to save both programs. It's unfortunate it came to a situation 
where one program has to go for the other to stay."

A FEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AT NEW CONCERT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The concerts at the Orange County Fair are moving to a larger venue this year, 
from the 6,000-capacity Arlington Theatre to the mammoth Pacific Amphitheatre, 
though that isn't necessarily going to make getting a seat any easier.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific can seat 18,765, but the fair will only be employing the 8,500 
fixed seats. The lawn area will be closed, fair representatives say, to avoid 
the noise problems that led to the demise last year of the Pacific as a 
commercial concert site.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, two shows a night were being held at the Arlington, but each act will 
only be giving a single performance at the Pacific, meaning there will be 3,500 
fewer seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, the fair has, in its concert lineup, given people little inducement to 
want to fill those seats on most nights. With a couple of stellar exceptions, 
the 17-show schedule (see Page 11) features the fair's usual uninspiring 
musical corn dogs and cotton candy, acts that the county's small concert 
nightclubs would only book on a slow week, if at all.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been some standouts in recent years, such as the Everly Brothers 
and Merle Haggard, and this year is no exception. Amid the pleasant but 
mummified likes of Loverboy, Jan and Dean and the Kentucky Headhunters, rapper 
Queen Latifah will appear Sunday and New Orleans' Neville Brothers on July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Latifah is a familiar face in many American homes because of her starring role 
in the Fox TV series "Living Single," but that mainstream standing in no way 
dilutes the strength of her music. Her machine-gun articulation and relentless 
rhythms, backed up by the intent of her words, could go head-to-head with those 
of any gangsta rapper,  
</P>
<P>
 She was born Dana Owens in Newark, N.J. A Muslim friend gave her the name 
Latifah, which she says stands for "delicate and sensitive," qualities that 
aren't at the forefront of her often angry work. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no adolescent bullet-splatter fly-girl fantasies here. Rather, 
the anger in her rhymes on songs like "U.N.I.T.Y.," "Nature of a Sista' " and 
"Latifah's Had It Up 2 Here" is aimed at sexism and the limitations society -- 
and other rappers -- place on women. Although she also addresses lighter and 
romantic themes and never fails to deliver the beat, her current "Black Reign" 
album doesn't shy away from grappling with weightier material, such as the 
death of her brother in "Winki's Theme." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Neville Brothers, the fair is bringing in the heart and soul of New 
Orleans, which is no small thing. Beginning in the mid-'50s with keyboardist 
brother Art's "Mardi Gras Mambo," the Nevilles have been a shaping force in 
Crescent City music for four decades. Saxophonist Charles Neville brings 
decades of jazz and R&B chops to the band and vocalist and percussionist Cyril 
a world beat sensibility.  
</P>
<P>
 The best known of the four brothers is Aaron, who had one of the most 
memorable ballads in soul music with the 1966 hit "Tell It Like It Is." 
Combined, the Nevilles and their four (no-relation) band-mates are a national 
treasure, a musical history lesson, a roiling dance party and a celebration of 
life. Over infectious grooves, the brothers weave sinuous cross-rhythms, 
gorgeous vocal harmonies, socially conscious themes and practically every 
American music style that has held a backbeat. There is a new concert album, 
"Live on Planet Earth," worth checking out, but their best, and one of the 
richest albums in years, is their 1990 "Brother's Keeper." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevilles have been a staple for years at other regional fairs, such as 
Seattle's Bumbershoot Fest, which this Labor Day weekend will also be 
presenting Bonnie Raitt, John Hiatt, Buddy Guy, Richard Thompson, Penn & 
Teller, Jackson Browne, David Lindley, Ben Harper and a host of other vital, 
creative acts. It doesn't, however, have a petting zoo.

STILL DEVELOPING; THE MASTERS MAY BE FROZEN IN TIME, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE 
PAGEANT HAS TO BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After six decades of staying as still as humanly possible, things are really 
starting to move at the Pageant of the Masters. The pageant, in which live 
models re-create works of art, runs Friday through Aug. 29 at Irvine Bowl in 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the show ends with Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper." But it 
opens with a series of posters from 1915 to 1928 featuring Buster Keaton and 
other silent comedians, and director Glen Eytchison hinted that one of the 
characters again just might emerge from his poster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that as long as 'The Last Supper' is still there, it's OK to 
experiment with things that people might feel are inappropriate," Eytchison 
explained. "Last year, the show opened with a series of magic posters in which 
the magicians stepped out of the tableaux and performed the tricks the posters 
portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to broaden the concept of what is and isn't acceptable," he said. 
"If we're going to attract a new audience and be competitive, we've got to grow 
and change, try new things. Some will work; some won't." 
</P>
<P>
 The pageant's 61st season boasts almost two dozen tableaux and series. Among 
other unusual offerings are scenes from Buddhist temples of Japan re-created on 
the main stage and hillside locations, and a dish, a comb and a clock: a 
Charles X clock, a gold Scythian comb from the 2nd Century BC and a silver 
Persian hunting dish from the year 309. (How'd they pin that date down?) 
</P>
<P>
 All of which raises the question, what are the pageant's limits? Could one of 
those Where's-Waldos-from-hell types by 15th-Century Dutch painter Hieronymus 
Bosch be staged, for instance? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two primary physical limitations," Eytchison explained. "The height 
of the proscenium, 12-foot-8, and the size and shape of human beings. A Bosch 
painting would have a whole bunch of characters who are physically distorted 
and in really unusual positions. I only found one Bosch we were capable of 
reproducing, and it wasn't very well received. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I often put things in that I think the audience may not like very 
much. Magritte, Picasso . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience doesn't like Picasso?  
</P>
<P>
 "If you see a painting by Renoir of two beautiful women on a boat on a lake, 
it's pleasant; it's pretty, not very challenging," said Eytchison, at the helm 
for 16 years. "In other words, commercial. Picasso or Matisse were not 
concerned about being perfect in their representations of humans. Characters 
look distorted, and that's less commercially acceptable to our audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they're refreshing, and they're used to break up all the prettiness of 
the show. Pretty gets boring unless you break it up. The idea is variety, in 
subject matter, in medium, in time period and composition, even the tempo of 
the music that accompanies the art." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the news this year isn't all visual. Festival grounds were threatened 
by, but ultimately spared, damage from the Laguna Canyon firestorm last fall, 
but the orchestra pit, makeup and wardrobe areas and production offices fell 
victim to a mudslide two weeks later. Damage estimates topped $500,000; 
reconstruction was completed by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat less catastrophic, but news nonetheless, "Voice of the Pageant" Thurl 
Ravenscroft has retired after two decades. Ravenscroft, who was also the voice 
of Kellogg's Tony the Tiger for four decades, will be replaced by another basso 
, Skip Conover. 
</P>
<P>
 All money earned by the pageant and the Festival of Arts -- the festival 
features exhibits by 160 artists and artisans, a Junior Art gallery, workshops, 
demonstrations and entertainment at the same location -- goes back into the 
community in the form of grants and scholarships, about $150,000 annually, in 
the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "And of course there's rent," Eytchison said. Annual lease payments to Laguna 
Beach have approached $500,000 in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working 20 hours a day here," he said. "The pageant is a lot 
technique, but mostly it's dedicated and loyal volunteers and staff who don't 
go home until it's right. What you won't find is someone who stands up and 
says, 'It's 11 o'clock; I'm going to take a union coffee break. I've worked all 
over the country, and I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Pageant of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Nightly at 8:30 p.m., Friday, July 8, through Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Irvine Bowl Park, 650 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) or Santa Ana (5) Freeway to the Laguna 
(133) Freeway and head south through Laguna Canyon. Shuttle buses run 
continuously until midnight from Laguna Canyon lots and downtown parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $10 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 497-6582.

CLASSIC THE WEEK: AMOS MILBURN "THE BEST OF AMOS MILBURN -- DOWN THE ROAD 
APIECE" (1946-57) EMI/ALADDIN  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pianist/vocalist Milburn was a synthesis of all that was great in classic 
rhythm & blues. 
</P>
<P>
 He could pound out a boogie like Pete Johnson, jump a blues number like Louie 
Jordan or caress a ballad like Nat King Cole, and he did so with style, 
elegance and a sense of cool that earned him hordes of fans for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 A suave and handsome figure, Milburn would perform hunched over his piano, his 
whole body in rhythm with his music, a smile of unrestrained joy parting his 
lips as he performed such hits as "Chicken Shack Boogie," "Bad, Bad Whiskey" 
and "One Scotch, One Bourbon, One Beer." His voice, urbane though it was, 
worked as effectively on an up-tempo shout as it did on smoother numbers. But 
with the success of "Bad, Bad Whiskey" in 1950, Milburn began concentrating 
more and more on boozing songs, and unfortunately, lived up to his legend as 
his drinking increased and his performances became more erratic. The effects of 
the bottle eventually brought about a series of strokes and may have 
contributed to an early grave for Milburn, but his music lives on in this 
generous collection comprising 26 tracks, 17 of which hit the Top 10 on the R & 
B charts. BUDDY SEIGAL

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: BERES HAMMOND "IN CONTROL" ELEKTRA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of the songs here aren't much to speak of, the lyrics are nothing new, 
and the production varies from gimmicky to mundane. None of that, however, 
distracts much from the tremendous singing of Jamaican Beres Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a voice that sounds like a cross between the simmering sensuality of 
Teddy Pendergrass, the organic ebullience of reggae great Toots Hibbert and the 
overwhelming soulfulness of relative unknown Sam Butler. (If you haven't heard 
Butler, get thee hence to a CD shop and get "The Gospel at Colonus" cast album 
and Bob Telson's "An Ant Alone.") 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond may also be something of an unknown quantity in the States, but his 
recording career in Jamaica stretches back to 1975. "In Control" is his major 
label debut, and it's an auspicious one. Though the material often isn't much 
to sing about, Hammond's is a voice bursting with life and joy, overriding the 
songs and taking them to emotional reaches the lyrics and melody wouldn't go to 
unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stronger tracks, he really soars. "We've Found It" is a mid-tempo 
slinky soul burner in which the barely harnessed passion of Hammond's very 
Pendergrass-influenced vocal pushes up against the rhythm as if they are a pair 
of tango dancers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just Say No" verges on being a novelty tune, propelled by the manic toasting 
of guest Buju Banton, who has about the most growly voice this side of South 
Africa's Mahlathini Nezintombi Zomgoashiyo. But when Banton finishes his 
echo-laden, humorous auctioneering and hands the microphone off to Hammond, the 
effect is majestic, as Hammond's pleading voice glides heavenward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop Them" and "No Crime" are also standouts. The latter would be just a rote 
indictment of violence were it not for Hammond's begging refrain of "Please not 
today" that puts the song on a human scale, implying you can't stave off the 
anger and evil of the world, just don't let it in right now. 
</P>
<P>
 If the remaining songs fall short, one needn't go far to affix blame: Hammond 
is also the writer of all the songs, and the producer of most of the album. 
There's nothing bad. Most of the songs are as good as mainstream American pop, 
and "It's Not Too Late," a duet with Marcia Griffiths, could easily become a 
soft-soul hit here. But if a voice as special as Hammond's were paired with 
equally powerful material, he'd be unstoppable. JIM WASHBURN

WANNA DANCE?; TWICE A WEEK, VIPS HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT PLACE TO BE 
</P>

<P>
 Metropolis enters the summer nightclub sweepstakes with weekend soirees as 
only this shining star in the county galaxy can throw. If the feel of a 
bright-lights, big-city club is your thing, check out the latest installations 
at the Irvine hot spot: Boogie Nights on Fridays and Summer Love on Saturdays.  
</P>
<P>
 Both evenings add a new ingredient to Metropolis, which seemed to have 
everything already -- dancing, billiards, a restaurant, a sushi bar -- but 
apparently was without (gasp!) a VIP room. Now, for these two nights anyway, 
that oversight has been addressed. The restaurant, however, lost half its space 
to this chamber for the chosen ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Venus Club, the private room is a fabulous little cocktail bar 
within the parent club. Passes tout "showgirls and cocktails for players." 
According to current lingo, that would parlay into nostalgic kitsch warped just 
enough for the young and hip modern consumer. "Players" takes its cue from the 
swingers who look to everyone from Dean Martin to Shaft for their cool panache. 
"Showgirls" is up for interpretation, but camp should define the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 These "upscale" exotic dancers who tease without going topless aren't 
showgirls, but girls on show. They trot unimaginatively like those in any 
topless joint, albeit clothed in nice lingerie. These females share the stage 
with male counterparts, for everyone's enjoyment; their dances are all within 
the boundaries of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment is supposed to take a new turn this weekend with peep-show 
skits, such as a woman slaving over an ironing board clad in barely nothing, 
while the male dancer watches. It could prove more titillating seeing the roles 
reversed, but at least the skits are a move in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit the Venus Club to host Jonathon Marshal, better known as Scorchman. His 
resume stretches back a decade and includes stints at El Paso Cantina, 
Pinnafini's, NYC, Visions, Bacchus and, most recently, the Empire Ballroom -- 
from which Metropolis owners, John and Gregg Hanour, lured him away. Scorchman 
clocks in as a deejay at the Hanour brothers' other dig, the Shark Club, every 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Scorchman's mailing list primarily covers Newport Beach, the patrons 
invited to the Venus Club are mainly Newport types. He hopes to cultivate a 
following from the fashion industry, and already folks such as Mossimo 
Giannulli, Jason Bleik and members of the Quiksilver design team have been seen 
near the dancer's stage, imported beer in hand. To keep them and other special 
clientele coming, a limousine service is provided courtesy of Metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the rest of us, entrance into the Venus Club is still pretty relaxed as 
Scorchman builds up a regular list of VIPs. Ask the entrance guard for 
Scorchman and he'll decide whether you qualify for a pass. What it takes is 
strictly up to Scorch. If not, you can watch the action within from the other 
side of a bar that serves as a divider between the VIP room and the dance 
floor. The ultimate goal is to make such passes so coveted that those allowed 
in will know they are special, says the host. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for what's up with the rest of the club: 
</P>
<P>
 Boogie Nights feature an absolutely cool band by that name and the vinyl 
mastery of Sean Perry. The '70s disco theme has been so played out everywhere, 
but with Boogie Nights the band, Metropolis gives this genre a fresh energy. 
The four-piece kit of Greg Brady look-alikes cranks out tight covers of disco 
hits, including a finale medley that had everyone kung-fu fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In between the band's four short sets, Perry spins vintage hip-hop and disco, 
but keeps the funk and rare groove until the end of the night, when the crowd 
lightens up. Perry continues to carve out a reputation in Los Angeles on this 
danceable stuff. Maybe throwing in a couple funk tracks earlier would be a good 
break from all the disco. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's Summer Love derives its happy vibes not from any flower power, but 
from the '90s hippie -- the house-music fan. DJ Chris Lee is at the helm, 
getting assistance some evenings from Tony Largo. This night attracts more 
patrons than Fridays, so come ready to squeeze your way through the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanours make partying on a budget a breeze. Pop in early and skip the $7 
cover that goes into effect at 10 p.m. Fridays and 9 p.m. Saturdays. Deals last 
until 10 p.m. both days, with half-price specials on all well drinks, beer and 
wine and appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10, the prices climb back to regular: domestic beer, $3.50; import, $4; 
hefty 21-ounce bottles of Sapporo, Asahi, Kiren, Becks and Steinlager are $5; 
wells, $4 to $5; a glass of wine, $4; soda and bottled water, $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Fete note: On July 20, "90210" fans can join actor Brian Austin Greene in 
celebrating his 21st birthday at Metropolis. The 18-and-over soiree will kick 
off Greene's regular gig there as host every Wednesday thereafter. Known as 
Il's House, the night will feature an '80s flashback and hip-hop menu by Los 
Angeles-based deejay Tony Stewart.

DO IT!: BEGINNING MOUNTAIN-BIKERS CAN SADDLE UP IN CHINO HILLS STATE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County Wheelmen, the biggest bicycling club in the county, is primarily 
a road riders' group. A handful of mountain bikers, however, have also found a 
place there. 
</P>
<P>
 That niche has a name in the monthly Wheelmen newsletter: Goat Hill Corner, 
which lists rides and other events. Although the road cyclists have at least a 
half-dozen group rides to choose from each week, the pickings are a bit slimmer 
for mountain bikers, who stage but two or three events a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, those group events are cozy ones, with participation usually 
running between six and 17 riders. Though road rides can accommodate big 
numbers, small is beautiful on back-country fire roads and trails. 
</P>
<P>
 The next event for the Goat Hill gang is an ideal one for newcomers to the 
group, said ride leader Paul Cadwell. The Saturday morning ride enters Chino 
Hills State Park off Carbon Canyon Road and heads up Telegraph Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a really excellent beginner's ride," Cadwell said. Anyone with a 
mountain bike and helmet is invited to join in; Wheelmen membership is not 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 Telegraph Canyon starts off as a gradual climb on a scenic, oak-shaded fire 
road before getting steeper as it nears a saddle at the top of the rise. From 
there, several trails and fire breaks take off in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
 A rider in reasonably good condition can make the climb to the saddle in about 
40 minutes, Cadwell said. He likes to keep the group rides loose, with flexible 
itineraries that allow for riders' different abilities and how far they feel 
like riding. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not necessary to reserve a spot. Cadwell requests, however, that everyone 
wear a helmet, bring water and carry a tool kit and spare tube for emergencies. 
Also, it is important to be at the rendezvous by the designated time because 
the riders won't wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Goat Hill rides include an Aug. 7 ramble in Aliso and Wood Canyons 
Regional Park, and a return to Chino Hills Aug. 14. And on the last Wednesday 
of July and August, twilight rides in Huntington Beach are planned for 6:30 
p.m.

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: A CHAMPS MEETING WILL REKINDLE HUNTINGTON'S FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes., Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can we chat? Good. Rockin' Fig was so excited he was sputtering. 
</P>
<P>
 Big. I'm talkin' big. It's gonna be big.  
</P>
<P>
 Whoa, Figgy. We talking concept here for a major film? 
</P>
<P>
 Noooo way, man. I'm talking about a world championship event on the West 
Coast. Here. Huntington Beach. Your back yard. Right in the U.S. of A. Love it 
or leave it.  
</P>
<P>
 Ahhh. Fig is talking about two back-to-back contests. The first is the 13th 
annual Op Pro Surfing Championship from July 26 through July 31. The second is 
the U.S. Open of Surfing, a World Championship Tour (WCT) event from Aug. 2 
through Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 What caliber of surfers are we talking about? 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who's anybody will be here, Americans, Australians, Hawaiians. World 
champ Derek Ho for sure and Gary Elkerton, the world tour runner-up, and a 
bunch of former Op winners, such as Barton Lynch. The U.S. Open will bring the 
Top 48 surfers in the world to Huntington Beach for the first time in two 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years? Why so long? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the surfing industry has been plagued by the recession, and the ASP 
(Assn. of Surfing Professionals) couldn't get a sponsor. But things are coming 
back for 1994. It's going to bust loose on the West Coast for those two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's talk recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it has cut a lot of things, such as sponsorships -- the people who will 
pay for wet suits, surfboards, related gear, travel expenses and contest fees 
-- for pro surfers for one. And earnings have dropped, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Having a WCT event here is pretty rare. Though there are 40 to 50 other 
contests run during the year, there are only 11 world tour events. This year, 
WCT events are being run in Australia, Japan, France, Brazil, Hawaii and 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 While sponsorship for some professional contests starts around $20,000, a 
world tour event runs more than $100,000, and that's just to guarantee the 
purse. It could cost another $100,000 for site preparation, travel, staffing, 
advertising, judges and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Op Pro used to be on the world tour, but clothing company 
Ocean Pacific hit rough times and couldn't afford a WCT event, so Ocean Pacific 
opted for a scaled-down contest. 
</P>
<P>
 For the U.S. Open, Prime Ticket Network signed on early as the initial sponsor 
and has since brought in other companies to help put on the big bash -- and, 
presumably, to lessen expenses. Those other companies include 1-800-Collect and 
Sebastian Hair Care. Coca-Cola will be visible at the contest because the 
soft-drink company is the 1994 world tour's umbrella sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just kind of funny that Southern California, which has the most 
surfing-related businesses per capita, couldn't get a world tour event on its 
coastline.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Huntington Beach, traditionally a site of major contests in the 
state, will be the center of attention again. Fig also says to get your wallets 
ready because they're going to charge for admission for both events. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Fig and I were talking, a young surfer overheard us and said, 
"Whattaya mean, they're gonna charge? It's not free?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes and no. According to Mike Kingsbury, a spokesman for both the Op Pro 
and the U.S. Open, an admission will be charged to sit in the stands on 
weekends. The good news is that standing on the sand is free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seating is free during the week for both the Op Pro and U.S. Open," Kingsbury 
said. "However, at the Op Pro we will be charging for premium stadium seating 
on Saturday and Sunday. For the U.S. Open, reserve seating packages are for 
Friday through Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost for reserve seats at the Op Pro are $5 per day, $6 for both days and $20 
for a package that includes seating at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost for seats at the U.S. Open are $7 a day and $15 for all three days. 
Tickets are available at Huntington Surf & Sport, Jack's Surfboards and 
TicketMaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Figgy isn't too concerned about the prospect of forking over a few quid. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't fret. You pay a few bucks to see someone slam a homer at Anaheim 
Stadium. Wouldn't you pay a few bucks to go see (Rob) Machado do some lip 
slices?  
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury also said there will be a free beach expo during the U.S Open, 
inside a futuristic surf stadium to be built on the sand. The expo will feature 
more than 40 exhibits offering glimpses of the newest surfing equipment, other 
beach-oriented products and mountain bikes usually restricted to trade 
insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Local surf shops such as Jack's Surfboards and Huntington Surf & Sport and 
ocean apparel manufacturers such as Rusty, Billabong will have booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury said some top shapers such as Rusty Preisendorfer and Bob Hurley 
will demonstrate shaping techniques during the expo.

CATCH OF THE SUMMER DAYS; MARINE INSTITUTE OFFERS MENU TO SINK YOUR KIDS INTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a little ironic that in Orange County, where you can be at the Pacific 
Ocean in a matter of minutes, many of us have had no closer encounter with 
marine life than pet-store aquariums or the prefab deep of Disneyland's 
submarine ride ("Captain! Off the port side! Could that be a . . . a sea 
serpent?" 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the summer to change that.  
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, the Orange County Marine Institute is offering programs to help 
bipeds of all ages get up-close and personal with their aquatic neighbors, 
whether they be microscopic plankton, glowing midshipmen (the fish, not the 
sailors), sea lions, dolphins or whales.  
</P>
<P>
 And in addition to the institute's usual day camps for children, the nonprofit 
facility recently premiered three cruise programs aboard the R/V Sea Explorer, 
its new 70-foot vessel outfitted with an underwater viewing theater that lets 
visitors see and converse with divers as they explore the ocean's floor. 
</P>
<P>
 On land, the institute debuts "A Beachcomber's Guide to the Marine Life 
Refuge," a 90-minute session in which visitors sort through natural "clues" 
that have washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 Also new this summer is a parent-child overnight program aboard the tall ship 
Pilgrim, a 130-foot replica of the square-rigger that carried Richard Henry 
Dana from Boston to the California coast in the 1830s, the journey related in 
Dana's book, "Two Years Before the Mast." (Leave the Dramamine at home; the 
Pilgrim will remain moored near the institute during the program.) 
</P>
<P>
 The institute has also beefed up its live theater offerings. Besides the 
annual staging of "Two Years Before the Mast," children's theater returns to 
the Pilgrim in an adaptation of the Norwegian folk tale "East of the Sun, West 
of the Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Institute summer sessions began July 1 and continue through late 
August. Dates, times and costs vary, and most programs are suitable for school 
kids and up. Here's the skinny of some of them: ABOARD THE PILGRIM 
</P>
<P>
 Children's theater hasn't graced the deck of the Pilgrim for years, but a new 
collaboration with the Laguna Playhouse may mark its return on an ongoing 
basis. On Sunday, Laguna Playhouse's youth theater director, Joe Lauderdale, 
will stage a 50-minute adaptation of "East of the Sun, West of the Moon." 
Lauderdale and his six-adult cast toured the show to Anaheim schools last May 
and June. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Stetson, the Pilgrim's program director, said he is considering a 
number of options to expand the theater series, including commissioning a 
family piece specifically for production on board the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 For older children and adults, artist and writer Daniel Trent will present his 
"Two Years Before the Mast," a one-man, living-history piece based on Dana's 
book. Trent, who co-wrote the piece, has stepped into the director/producer 
role this summer and will bring in actor Jeffrey Paul Whitman to appear in the 
story's multiple parts. The show runs Aug. 6, 13 and 20. Tickets: $15 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of living history, parents and children age 8 and up can 
re-create some of Dana's experiences during an overnight program aboard the 
Pilgrim. Led by staff members in period costume, participants will learn sea 
chanteys, hoist barrels and tell time by the bells. Stetson says visitors will 
even row out to gather cowhides, a chore Dana and his shipmates performed often 
during the Pilgrim's hide-trading journey along the California coast. Fee: $90 
per parent/child pair. ON THE SEA EXPLORER 
</P>
<P>
 When the Florida-built Sea Explorer motored into Dana Point Harbor last 
spring, it greatly enhanced the number and variety of programs the institute 
could offer to the public.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the vessel's chief attributes is the ROV, or remote-operated vehicle 
that resembles a small submarine. The ROV is equipped with lights and a video 
camera through which visitors on board can -- as the institute's associate 
director, Harry Helling, put it -- "see what's going on under the boat without 
getting wet." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we've had to bring (sea) animals out of their environment," 
Helling said. "Now we can observe them in their own habitat. It's like the 
difference of seeing a fish caught on a hook and flopping on the deck and 
watching it . . . dancing in the current in and out of the reefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Sea Explorer equipment includes a wet lab with video-microscopes that 
broadcast magnified images of sea life onto video monitors and improved nets 
that allow researchers to bring a wider variety of fish and sea life to 
on-board tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Underwater Interactive Audio-Video Cruise, visitors in the ship's 
viewing salon chat with divers exploring kelp forests and rocky reefs within 
the Dana Point Marine Life Refuge. Fee: $16 to $22. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute Harbor Eco-Tour introduces visitors to the cultural, biological 
and physical changes brought to the area by the construction of Dana Point 
Harbor, demonstrated through tools such as clips of "Creature From the Black 
Lagoon" (filmed in Dana Point before the jetty was built) to video-microscope 
viewings of delicate glass skeleton shrimp that dwell on the docks and pier 
pilings. Fee: $4 to $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Come nightfall, the institute offers a three-hour Marine Wildlife Dusk Cruise 
and a new Bioluminescence Night Cruise, a 2 1/2-hour encounter with some of the 
ocean's more glowing personalities, including the midshipman (a fish with 780 
dots on its skin that emit a blue-green glow) and the sea pen (an invertebrate 
with tiny tentacles that send pulses of light up and down its body when 
touched.) Fee for each program: $16 to $22. DAY CAMPS 
</P>
<P>
 A Sea Adventure Camp for children 8 to 10 runs weekly through Aug. 26. 
Activities include tide-pool explorations, beach outings and research outings 
aboard the Sea Explorer. Fee: $149. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten- to 13-year-olds in the Traveling Sea Adventure Camp take part in a day 
trip to San Diego's Sea World park, Sea Explorer voyages, tide-pool 
explorations and (hang on to your body boards) three days of snorkeling and 
surf riding at the beach. Fee: $159. 
</P>
<P>
 Availability is limited for both series. Already sold out are the institute's 
popular Mommy and Me and the Sea preschoolers' program and the Junior Sea Camp.

SPECIAL SCREENING: THERE'S MORE TO FORD'S 'STAGECOACH' THAN A SCENIC RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monument Valley must have felt like a second home to director John Ford. When 
the studio bosses said, "Let's make a movie," he said, "Good, book us to 
Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford kept going back there to film his many Westerns, acknowledged as high 
points in this distinctly American genre. The beautifully rugged vistas -- a 
contrast of jutting peaks and desert expanses -- in northeastern Arizona and 
trailing into Utah were the right backdrop. Even when the story sagged, which 
wasn't often, the landscape held up. 
</P>
<P>
 It holds up sturdily in "Stagecoach," one of Ford's first and best films in a 
library that includes "My Darling Clementine" (1946) and "The Man Who Shot 
Liberty Valance" (1962). The 1939 release (screening Tuesday evening in a free 
presentation at the new Newport Beach Central Library) won an Oscar for 
cinematographer Bert Glennon, who captured Monument Valley the way Ford liked 
-- as a pristine metaphor of an undisciplined, purer time in our history. 
</P>
<P>
 There may have been little environmental pollution back then, but you couldn't 
say the same about the people and their character. Ford usually played with our 
well-established, simple notions of good guys and bad guys in Westerns, and he 
does the same in "Stagecoach." Ford is probably the first director to kiss off 
the Tom Mix mold of hero -- he brought irony to the frontier film. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Stagecoach," it's this revelation of just who everybody is, what they want 
and what they're willing to do for it that makes the picture more than just a 
romp over picturesque countryside. Ford and screenwriter Dudley Nichols give us 
a coach full of interesting, sometimes comical, sometimes devious folks and 
then exposes them under the glare of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is straightforward. The stagecoach, driven by a forever-flustered 
Andy Devine, is heading to a grimy Old West outpost. Geronimo and his 
war-minded Apaches stand in the way. Along the route, the sheriff picks up the 
Ringo Kid, a likable outlaw played with typical aw-shucks heroism by John 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other passengers are Doc (Thomas Mitchell), a boozing doctor; Dallas 
(Claire Trevor), the hooker who's run out of town, then clumsily wooed by the 
Kid; Hatfield (John Carradine), a Confederate officer turned card hustler; Mrs. 
Mallory (Louise Platt), the pregnant wife of a cavalry officer, and Gatewood 
(Berton Churchill), an obnoxious banker who might just be an embezzler. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the panoramic sweeps, Ford and Glennon bring craftsmanship to the 
tighter shots, both indoors and outdoors, when the cast becomes the focus. An 
especially striking set-piece comes shortly after Doc delivers Mrs. Mallory's 
baby and the Ringo Kid gazes down the long adobe hallway leading to the 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The lighting is near-phosphorescent, and the camera is set up perfectly, 
adding an evocative layer of drama to this important scene. The boldness of 
that shot is soon replaced by something more muted when the Kid and Dallas meet 
outside. Under a darkening sky, he proposes, their faces poignant under the 
natural illumination. 
</P>
<P>
 Before and after the screening, Arthur Taussig, editor of The Film Analyst 
newsletter, will discuss Ford and the Western.

RESTAURANTS: GREAT SCOTT'S -- WELL, MUCH IMPROVED, ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar has beefed up its already extensive menu with a 
selection of aged prime steaks. Make mine rare, and hold the tartar sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you don't know the history of this chain, the first Scott's opened 
about 20 years ago in San Francisco, where the company has two restaurants, the 
Lombard Street original and a later edition in the Embarcadero. I ate often and 
enthusiastically in the Lombard Street place during my years in the Bay Area. 
They served a mean seafood saute, and you could always count on the chance to 
mingle with the crowd of well-dressed men and women, Chardonnay glasses in 
hand, who lined up inside the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago Scott's opened a showcase restaurant in the South Coast Plaza 
area. It was, and is, one of Orange County's most beautiful dining spots, but 
the quality of food preparation was not impressive in those early days, so I 
didn't return until recently. Maybe because of the cold-water seafood, Scott's 
San Francisco operation still impresses me more, but the Scott's in Costa Mesa 
is much improved, and there's a lot to like about it now. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always been stunned by the sheer beauty of this sprawling, cream-colored 
place. The fully open, all-copper kitchen looks pulled straight from the pages 
of Architectural Digest. The main dining room is flooded with ambient light 
from overhead skylights, and rows of bulbous, translucent lamps, five feet 
across, hang from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans twirl languidly overhead, too. They help give the place the air of a 
dreamy Bahamian resort, or something out of a novel by Graham Greene. And on 
the subject of languidness, the leather designer chairs are among the most 
comfortable I've ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is frequently overrun by people having dinner before hitting 
the nearby Performing Arts Center (the best time for dinner is during 
performance hours: after 8, before 10). Even so, the highly professional staff 
appears to handle everybody without any major glitches. Busboys keep lots of 
crusty sourdough on your table and refill drinks constantly. Waiters are always 
on the run, and they never seem to miss a trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, a man named Michael Silver has embellished the new menu with one 
of the county's best wine lists, an all-California selection featuring 
steak-friendly red wines such as the velvety smooth '87 Kalin Reserve Cabernet 
Sauvignon ($36) on up to the lofty Opus One, which you can order by the glass 
($9 for three ounces, cowboy). 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the story doesn't end there. The restaurant still suffers from high 
prices and unfulfilled promises. Perhaps if Scott's were more modest it would 
be reasonable to settle for what you get, but when a restaurant is excellent in 
so many ways -- ambience, service, wine selection -- it's hard to understand 
why the food doesn't knock you out.  
</P>
<P>
 Some dishes come close, though. Gustav Anders, move over -- poivre lox, sliced 
razor-thin and served with tiny buttered bagels and herbed cream cheese, is the 
equal of any salmon I've ever tasted. The tomatoey Dungeness crab bisque is 
thick and complex; you feel the texture of the crab before you taste it, then 
it stays with you.  
</P>
<P>
 Hearts of romaine is another terrific starter, with a fine balsamic 
vinaigrette that runs in rivulets onto the plate. But you'll come down to earth 
if you order the grimly overcooked artichoke, stodgily breaded popcorn shrimp 
or starchy, clam-stingy chowder. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrees run the same gamut of quality. The menu tells you that seafood is 
cooked moist in the center, but isn't always the case. Three of the fish I've 
tried -- charbroiled Mexican dorado, grilled petrale sole and potato-crusted 
Mexican sea bass -- arrived badly overcooked. The dorado was positively 
frazzled.  
</P>
<P>
 The best non-steak entree might be seafood jambalaya, even if no 
self-respecting Cajun would go near it. It's a big bowl of spicy rice, sausage, 
chicken, prawns and lots of fresh fish. That the fish turns out to be salmon 
shouldn't matter unless you are one of those purists, or Cajuns. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's talk about meat. Only 1% of American beef is designated prime, and 
Scott's has it -- cornfed prime beef aged 28 days. We tried three cuts and 
found them tender and juicy but not quite as flavorful as the meat at a Peter 
Luger's, Ruth's Chris or other top-notch steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of them might be the 16-ounce rib eye. This meat was the most 
flavorful, and you could cut it with a fork, though there was rather a surfeit 
of gristle. The 14-ounce New York strip, more expensive and less gristly than 
the rib eye, did not have nearly as much flavor. I prefer the filet mignon, 
also 14 ounces, to the New York. It may not be as flavorful as the rib eye, but 
it has tenderness to spare. Really serious steak eaters can go for the 36-ounce 
Porterhouse, $58 for two people. 
</P>
<P>
 The side dishes intended for the meats are all steakhouse classics -- thick 
fries, sauteed spinach with roasted garlic, fried onion rings. Desserts are of 
the steakhouse type, too, rich pies and tortes that will push that cholesterol 
count into the stratosphere. Try peanut butter pie, sitting in a pool of melted 
chocolate, or the whipped cream-topped banana Savannah, layers of caramel and 
fresh banana.  
</P>
<P>
 Then repair to the bar for a much needed after-dinner coffee and muse about 
the great things that might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's Seafood Bar and Grill is expensive. Appetizers, soups and salads are 
$3.25 to $11.50. Entrees are $12.95 to $36.95. Steaks are $14.50 to $58. 
Desserts are $4 to $5.95.

PARKER'S PLACE: TAKE A BIG GULP OF 'JULIP' THIS SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recommended summer reading lists always kind of annoy me, unless one of my 
books is prominently featured, which doesn't happen nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there are too many books on the lists. Few of us will read 15 novels 
this summer, and even fewer of us are willing to entrust a three-month season 
to someone else's literary bent. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the latent idea behind summer reading lists that the books chosen 
are somehow more fun, dumber, less challenging and in general trashier than the 
books that we choose to read in spring, fall, winter. Maybe this goes along 
with the mindlessness promoted by beer-on-the-beach commercials and tourist 
town chambers of commerce, but it's always struck me as condescending and 
manipulative. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the name of brevity, and in order to point out a new book by a writer 
you'll be hearing a lot about in the next year, I'd like to say that Jim 
Harrison's "Julip" would be as good as any other book you might read this 
summer, and probably better than most. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has been an immensely popular writer in rather small circles for the 
better part of 20 years. He has published seven volumes of poetry, six novels, 
one book of nonfiction and three collections of novellas. His latest book is 
made up of three novellas, the title, "Julip" being the first story in the 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's loyal and vocal following has become passionate about his skewed 
sense of humor, his understated yet powerful command of drama, and the often 
odd but always interesting characters that populate his stories. (Harrison 
lives in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and many of his stories are set 
there.) Fans have also come to revel in Harrison's language, a truly 
idiosyncratic combination of the clear, the unexpected, the opinionated, the 
self-deprecating, the mordant. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a representative Harrison paragraph. It comes halfway through the 
third and best novella in this volume, "The Beige Dolorosa," which is the story 
of a 50-year-old English professor fired for a series of politically incorrect 
offenses of which he is basically innocent. He's visiting friends on an Arizona 
ranch, trying to figure out what happened, patch up a profoundly interrupted 
life.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was noon, but then who cared? I made a mental note to research time as 
disease. There are strange things afoot in the universe. Even the obvious fact 
that I had shown all the alertness of a supermarket mushroom during the long 
nightmare meant nothing. I was not about to recast my hopes as people make vain 
New Year's resolutions. I could not remember a single overnight miracle in the 
sheer tonnage of fiction and poetry I had spent my life reading. There was 
suddenly the idea that I had learned nothing from this life." 
</P>
<P>
 Novellas are an interesting form, and nobody is writing them any better these 
days than Harrison. Each story is usually about 90 pages long, which, back to 
the summer-reading-should-be-fun speciousness, makes for a comfortable 
poolside, morning-at-the-beach, or evening read. A novella is a lot roomier 
than a short story, and a good one contains all the drama of a novel -- but a 
great deal is left unsaid. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Harrison's reputation and readership vaulted with his first novella 
collection, "Legends of the Fall," published in 1978. I just picked up my 
paperback version of that book, which has been loaned and read so many times (I 
reread it once a year, generally in the fall) that the back cover is gone, the 
front is ready to fall off and the pages are dog-eared, dog-chewed and ready to 
spill from the binding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legends of the Fall" is just that good. The first of the stories is probably 
the best Harrison has ever written, titled simply, "Revenge." At its center is 
a tragic romance that ends up taking not only a life, but the souls of the 
three characters involved. It's as good a romance -- and a story about men -- 
as I've ever read. ("Revenge" was made into a movie a few years ago that was 
clobbered pretty soundly by critics, and bombed in spite of stars Kevin 
Costner, Madeline Stowe and Anthony Quinn, but was actually pretty good, I 
thought. Don't see it before you read the book.) 
</P>
<P>
 One of Harrison's great skills -- and perhaps one of the reasons he hasn't 
reached a mass audience yet -- is his wonderful unpredictability. The story 
following "Revenge," for instance, is a truly comic tale about a mid-life 
crisis called "The Man Who Gave Up His Name." His 1981 novel, "Warlock" is 
richly comic too, while his critically acclaimed "Dalva" is brooding, 
mysterious, poetic. In one of his Esquire magazine food columns (he's a 
notorious, self-described glutton), Harrison once said something about trying 
to remain "a moving target," which describes perfectly his wide swings between 
comedy and drama. To get both, as you do in "Julip," is a terrific value at 
$21.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the high quality of the three stories in "Julip" -- the title story, 
"The Seven-Ounce Man" and "The Beige Dolorosa" -- there's another reason that 
this book may be of interest to you. Harrison is an American writer who is now 
coming into a richly deserved bit of mega-success, oddly enough, via Hollywood. 
The movie "Wolf," written by Harrison, opened to mixed reviews and fine box 
office last month. It stars Jack Nicholson -- a longtime friend and supporter 
of the writer -- and Michelle Pfeiffer. Later this year, "Legends of the Fall" 
(the title story of that volume) will hit the screen.  
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly gratifying to see Harrison getting famous, though perhaps a 
little distressing that it has taken movies of his books, rather than the books 
themselves, to do it. It's ironic too that he's bad-mouthed Hollywood 
generously in his stories and articles, though always with the confession that 
he's after the lucre and notoriety that Hollywood can bestow on novelists. He 
once said that he was a poet who wrote novels to support his poetry (something 
like that), and it now seems apparent that he's a novelist who writes 
screenplays to support his novels. 
</P>
<P>
 What's most important, though, is that a person not compromise the quality of 
what he or she does in order to find success in it, and Harrison has not. 
There's a wonderful resilience in "Julip," a richness and a sense of fun that 
are hard to find in books these days. Books like this are what summer reading 
should be about.

3-HOUR TOUR: LOVE IS ABLOOM ON NEWPORT AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to the Times Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget February. It's on those long, hot summer nights that thoughts naturally 
turn to romance. And even in the middle of a business district, romances can 
blossom. Take, for instance, one long block of Newport Avenue in Costa Mesa, 
where you can really spice up existing relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 5:20 p.m.: The Petal Pusher offers drive-through fresh flowers, but what 
really makes it special are Robin Snyder-Bissett's distinctive bouquets using 
her signature sunflowers as well as Casablancas, mountain lilies, liatris and 
Hawaiian ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to do your basic bouquet," Snyder-Bissett said. "No carnations, no 
baby's breath. I don't use a lot of filler -- unless it's a green, like bells 
of Ireland, because that's different. Look at this! King protea, (it's) like a 
big human pipe cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody wants a romantic bouquet, I'd use tea roses, lilies and 
lisianthus. Tea roses as opposed to regular roses, lilies because they're the 
oldest, and that's kind of romantic, lisianthus because it's delicate. A lot of 
people think lisianthus is a rose, but it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunflowers are romantic too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunflowers mean adoration," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 5:20 to 5:40: Nothing sets a romantic mood like music. Tower Records and Video 
recently had stacks and stacks of Johnny Mathis, Frank Sinatra and Julio 
Iglesias but had sold out of Cyborgasm, which features the sounds of you know 
what. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 For my money, I'd try "Classic Weepies," more than "75 minutes of the world's 
most moving classical music" (currently No. 2 on the charts), Arleen Auger's 
"Love Songs," Cecilia Bartoli's "The Impatient Lover" or Luciano Pavoratti's 
"Amore." Among videos, choose from "Love Matters," "Love Street," "Love Child," 
"Love Field," "Love Nest" and "Love Story." Possibilities also include "The 
Lover" and "Lovers' Lovers," and more complex titles such as "Love Among the 
Ruins," "Love in the Afternoon" and "Love With the Proper Stranger." 
</P>
<P>
 By no means overlook "Mad Love," "Love and Bullets" -- can either stop Charles 
Bronson? -- and "Love Kills." 
</P>
<P>
 5:40 to 6: If you want your evening to really pack a wallop, Country Store 
Nutrition offers an entire shelf of, um, "energy" sources, including ginseng 
for women and ginseng for men. Also, Siberian ginseng, Manchurian ginseng, 
Chinese red ginseng, Korean white ginseng, ginseng and royal jelly, ginseng tea 
and "performance" ginseng. Appraising the power of red panax ginseng extractum, 
owner Jessie Talayeh said, "It's like taking 25 coffees in a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the gym, because Mui Macho has finally been packaged, and in a natural 
herbal formula to boot. On the same shelf are plum balls, pumpkin seed oil, 
Ultra High Performance Excel and Legendary Cyclone Cider. Elsewhere in the 
store you'll find ambergris and Arabian musk perfume oils, musk and night queen 
incense, and Kiss My Face pure olive oil soap. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're considering popping a very big question, also consider Mega Stress 
with C.  
</P>
<P>
 6 to 6:20: You might stop in at Condom Revolution, where you can build your 
very own custom Love in a Bucket. (Buckets range from $15 to $99, but generally 
run $25 to $35.) 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be romantic, put some kind of nice candle in there -- candles 
set the mood," advised owner Dean Charter. "And a love oil, something that 
warms up, and maybe a nice piece of lingerie, something fun. You might add some 
fresh chocolates for dessert, for the taste sensation. In fact, folks might 
want to make themselves into dessert, with whipped cream and chocolate, a 
fantasy dessert, like 'I'm your hot fudge sundae . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 6:20 to 7:50: Not before dinner, I'm not! 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, many people's fantasy dessert runs more to chef Alan Greeley's 
passion fruit and lime souffle; if you want to check it out, call the Golden 
Truffle in advance. Then get down to the rest of Greeley's "French Caribbean" 
cuisine: appetizers, including lobster and shrimp leek dumplings with saffron 
chili sauce and Caribbean pickles ($7.50), "utility foods" such as Jamaican 
jerk chicken salad ($7.95). 
</P>
<P>
 The dishes range from "seasoned well to spicy"; either way, your taste buds 
will really open up. If they need further encouragement, Greeley will provide a 
jerk-like "turbo-charged A1 sauce" with guavas and raisins, or a jalapeno 
cilantro sauce, or a sweet tangerine smoked chili barbecue sauce, or any of 
several other concoctions -- all, he said, "100% serious stuff." Cool off with 
tropical snow cones, a fruit and tropical sorbet fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Roses and a candle on each table, soft lighting . . .  
</P>
<P>
 7:50 to 8: Having consummated your souffle, or your cones, as the case may be, 
this may not be the moment to go play basketball or handball, but if you get to 
Lions Park before dusk, when it closes, it could be perfect for a short 
after-dinner stroll, or to ask somebody to go steady or something. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're feeling frisky, go play on the playground. If you felt frisky some 
time ago and have some news to share, the fountain sculpture called "Mother and 
Child" might be just the spot. If you're feeling very frisky right now, just 
head home!

 Alexi Lalas' goatee got an impromptu trim, while the legend of Univision 
announcer Andres Cantor continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas and Cantor were both guests of David Letterman on the "Late Show" 
Wednesday night, and Letterman did some real cutting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Before doing what a lot of people would probably like to do, Letterman, near 
the end of an interview with Lalas, asked: "Can I trim that up for you, just a 
little, just a little, just take a little off? Even it off. That's all we're 
going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman trimmed about an inch off the goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas then kicked a soccer ball into the balcony of the Ed Sullivan Theater, 
causing Cantor to scream: "GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLL!!!!!" 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Lalas talked about how he was just a fan at the World Cup four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Italy, bumming around with high school friends, drinking beer, 
chasing women," Lalas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need a World Cup for that," Letterman interjected.

 British commentators strongly criticized the referees of Tuesday's two games. 
Of the Mexico-Bulgaria game, which Bulgaria won on penalty kicks, the Daily 
Mail's Kier Radnedge wrote: "The World Cup refereeing crisis intensified as a 
Syrian official who was plainly out of his depth did his level best to ruin a 
dramatic evening in Giants Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 In what he called "nightmarish refereeing," Radnedge said, "Jamal Al-Sharif 
manufactured two expulsions of nonsensical irrationality." 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Mirror newspaper added: "The game was ruined by ludicrous refereeing 
from Syria's Jamal Al-Sharif, who showed two soft cards and earlier awarded 
Mexico a dubious penalty."  
</P>
<P>
 And from San Francisco, Michael Hart in the London Evening Standard asked: 
"Can someone explain to me why Italy's Gianfranco Zola was sent off against 
Nigeria by the Mexican referee Arturo Brizio? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can someone explain why 196 players have been cautioned here in 44 games, 
compared with 163 during the entire tournament in Italy in 1990 and 135 in 
Mexico in 1986? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can someone explain why a total of 13 players have been sent off in the World 
Cup for some of the most innocuous misdemeanors I've ever seen? 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are witnessing is referees shooting form the hip like Wild West 
gunslingers. Book first and ask questions afterwards. One bemused U.S. TV 
commentator said: 'The referee seems to be giving his yellow card a lot of air 
time.' 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA must go back to the drawing board because this is not a violent World 
Cup and the game doesn't need this cosmetic surgery."

 This World Cup is becoming too surreal for comfort. Let us simply try and 
count the ways in which what passes for normality in soccer has been 
transformed into something of an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a team from the U.S., most of whose players are obscure -- to put it 
mildly -- and whose goalkeeper is more intent on an acting career, comes within 
15 minutes of forcing Brazil into extra time. This was in no script written 
outside Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Two, a game in Giants Stadium between Saudi Arabia and Morocco drew a crowd of 
72,000. Think about it: two Arab teams playing in New Jersey, no less, and 
selling out. 
</P>
<P>
 It would only have been understandable had it been played in Casablanca or 
Riyadh with (Humphrey) Bogart as referee and (Peter) O'Toole and Omar Sharif 
working the lines. Equally amazing, Russia against Cameroon drew an even bigger 
crowd."

 The Netherlands national team got to Dallas five hours late Wednesday after a 
Dutch reporter told a flight attendant he had a bomb in his bag, police said. A 
chartered Boeing 727 carrying 163 people was preparing to leave Orlando 
International Airport for Dallas, where the Dutch will face Brazil in 
Saturday's quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the plane was towed to a remote area of the airport where 
bomb-sniffing dogs checked the aircraft and the luggage. No bomb was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities took Lex Muller, 54, of the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper in 
Rotterdam, into custody for questioning. Charges are unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears he was just shooting his mouth off without realizing the 
consequences of what he was saying," Sgt. Mike Holloway of the Orlando police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway said a flight attendant asked Muller to put his carry-on bag in the 
overhead bin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want to do it, and he told her it had a bomb in it," Holloway said. 
"She told him, 'Sir, don't even joke about that, we take that very seriously.' 
And then he said it again." 
</P>
<P>
 The flight attendant reported that Muller, who was angry about tough American 
security procedures, then said he had a gun in the bag. Holloway said Muller 
told police he actually said there was no gun in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller was released to a Dutch diplomatic official, who urged authorities not 
to arrest him. ELLIOTT ALMOND

<P>
 The game posted a 7.1 Nielsen rating and a 17 share, the best for KMEX in its 
33-year history, and reached 355,000 households. It peaked during the dramatic 
finish, when Bulgaria won on penalty kicks, getting an 8.5 rating and reaching 
425,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 In Latino households, the game got a 43.7 rating and a 73 share, meaning it

 What happened to Hugo Sanchez? He didn't play in the World Cup for Mexico

 Before getting in trouble at the Orlando airport, Muller, who had also been 
contributing articles to the Orlando Sentinel, refused to take part in a media 
security check when departing the Citrus Bowl after Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 All reporters were subjected to the search. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not allow it," Muller wrote for Tuesday's Sentinel editions. "I was 
surprised and upset that they would want to do this. Why should we open our bag 
when we leave the stadium? This is an experience I have not had in my 20 years 
covering soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Muller was just warming up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to explain that someone stole something in the stadium, and that 
was the cause for the check. That is a pity, but it is not a reason to control 
all the media. It is their failure, not our guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 And this: 
</P>
<P>
 "It also is the responsibility of the host committee to watch out for the 
security of the stadium. I can swear that I would never steal something in a 
stadium, and if I ever did, it would be the whole stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 In closing:

 Italians were dancing in the streets again late Tuesday night after Italy's 
defeat of Nigeria, which put Italy in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the front-page commentary of the Milan daily, Corriere della Sera, 
Gianfranco Teotino said, "On the brink of the precipice, Italy had not been put 
down by the modest Nigerian team of excellent athletes, robust kickers, and 
inexpert footballers, but primarily through its own fault, and then by some 
demented refereeing. . . . (It was) incredible, the expulsion of (Gianfranco) 
Zola, thrown out 12 minutes after entering the field, for not having committed 
a foul." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an Italy Which Is All Heart" was the headline in the national sports 
daily, Gazzetta dello Sport, Italy's most-read sports daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gazzetta's editorial was entitled, "From Prison to Paradise," and started: 
"Again in 10 against 11, refereed by a crazy Mexican, who throws Zola out for a 
mysterious foul and has to see four goal kick fouls in order to concede one, 
the Italian team creates one of the most exciting events of its history." 
</P>
<P>
 La Gazzetta also collected comments from soccer enthusiasts and experts. Film 
director Franco Zeffirelli from Jerusalem, where he is working, said: "Tonight 
I am really very proud to be Italian. This national team is making us suffer, 
but in the end it is repaying us for all our sufferings." 
</P>
<P>
 "Italian Team to Give You a Heart Attack," was the headline of the Rome daily 
La Repubblica. The front-page comment by Gianni Mura from Boston, said victory 
came, "Despite (Coach Arrigo) Sacchi and that referee . . . " and referred to 
an "ugly and useful victory, once more in 10 men against 11, and then that 
small joy is disrupted by the news that in Italy, to celebrate, someone starts 
shooting and kills a child." 
</P>
<P>
 A boy in Herculaneum, near Naples, took out his father's illegally owned 
pistol and accidentally shot a 7-year-old cousin.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; WICKED NORTH'S PROBLEM FOUND: IT'S A BONE CHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wicked North, fourth as the 3-5 favorite in last Saturday's $750,000 
Hollywood Gold Cup, will undergo arthroscopic surgery today at Chino Valley 
Hospital to have a bone chip removed from his right front ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays taken Sunday after The Wicked North had finished nearly nine lengths 
behind the winning Slew Of Damascus discovered the chip and the 5-year-old Far 
North horse probably won't run again until the Santa Anita winter meeting, 
which begins Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Gold Cup, The Wicked North was considered the top handicap horse in 
the nation. He had rattled off victories in the Oaklawn Handicap and 
Californian after having been penalized from first to fourth in the Santa Anita 
Handicap. The Gold Cup was the first race since the San Carlos Handicap on Jan. 
8 that The Wicked North hadn't crossed the wire first. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the loss, jockey Kent Desormeaux talked about how The Wicked 
North hadn't been training well before the Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just no gas in the tank today," he said. "The only indication we 
got was from his works early in the week. He just wasn't himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer David Bernstein said Wednesday that owner Phil Hersh is hoping The 
Wicked North can return to racing in the fall, but that it doesn't seem 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really depends on the horse," Bernstein said. "He'll be off for some 
period of time, maybe four-five months. He's had a (rugged) campaign. He's run 
in 10 stakes in 11 months." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incentive isn't lacking for trainer Wayne Lukas to run Tabasco Cat in the 
$200,000 Swaps Stakes on July 23. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, there is the money. Hollywood Park doubles the purse of the 1 
1/4-mile Swaps if the field includes the winner of a Triple Crown race and the 
Storm Cat colt, of course, won the Preakness and Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, there was last Saturday's Affirmed Handicap. R Friar Tuck, a 
reformed claimer, won the race in a $47.20 upset, completing the 1 1/8 miles in 
a moderate 1:49. Most of those same horses figure to return in the Swaps, so 
the competition won't be particularly strong. Trainer Randy Winick has already 
said that Brocco won't make the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, Tabasco Cat won't be running in the Swaps and, in fact, 
won't be seen in action in California for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
 As attractive as the Swaps may be, Lukas said Wednesday, Tabasco Cat will race 
in the Jim Dandy Stakes July 31 at Saratoga, then in the Travers three weeks 
later. The plan after that is for one more start -- the Jockey Club Gold Cup at 
Belmont Park -- before the Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not giving any thought (to the Swaps)," Lukas said. "There are two 
reasons. We don't want to run (Tabasco Cat) a mile and a quarter after a layoff 
and it would shorten our program by a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lukas won't be represented in the Swaps, he will send out the 
probable favorite in Saturday's Landaluce Stakes, the meeting's championship 
race for 2-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
 A $150,000 purchase by Lukas for owners Robert and Beverly Lewis at the 
Keeneland September sale last year, Serena's Song beat maidens by 10 lengths in 
her first California start on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing fifth and fourth in two races at Churchill Downs, the daughter 
of Rahy took the lead from her outside post in her Hollywood Park debut, then 
romped home under Gary Stevens. She completed the five furlongs in 57 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "She put everything together," Lucas said. "She impressed me . . . and she 
impressed Gary Stevens. She ran 57 2/5 and she just galloped the last eighth of 
a mile. She's a very gifted filly and she's doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas is back, working for his father, Wayne, at their Santa Anita base. 
Injured critically when run over by Tabasco Cat nearly seven months ago, Lukas 
resumed work on June 27. "He's doing very well," the elder Lukas said. "He's 
putting in about four-five hours a day and he's doing a lot of walking with the 
different sets (of horses). It's still a healing process, but he's enjoying it 
immensely. It's super (to have him back)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway worked five furlongs in 58 4/5 Tuesday morning, preparing for her 
rematch with Sardula in Sunday's $200,000 Hollywood Oaks. The only other 
3-year-old filly likely to run in the race is Fancy 'N Fabulous. . . . X-rays 
taken on Bien Bien's right front foot Monday proved negative, so the Manila 
horse may come back in the $250,000 Sunset Handicap on July 24. "His foot got a 
little hot and we don't want to take any chances," said trainer Paco Gonzalez. 
"The X-rays were all clean, but we will get a second opinion."

ENERGY OFFICIALS PLAN $31 BILLION IN CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Energy Department Wednesday announced plans to open bidding on contracts 
worth $31 billion over the next five years to operate its laboratories, storage 
centers and production facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said that injecting competition into the 
lucrative business of managing the department's facilities will "open the 
doors" of those sites and save billions of dollars. It also will forge a new 
relationship between the government and its nuclear contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 One Energy Department official said that the reforms should reduce the annual 
costs of running the department's production and research network by at least 
$2.5 billion. But the savings will not go to taxpayers. Instead, the money will 
be used in the $160-billion cleanup of the nation's contaminated Cold War 
weapons facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's announcement was the first time that the Energy Department has 
declared that three of its largest and most complex sites -- Savannah River, 
S.C.; Hanford, Wash., and a test site in the Nevada Desert -- will be opened to 
competition. Contracts for those three sites are worth $17.5 billion over five 
years and likely will lead to competition throughout the department's sprawling 
production and research complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department also said that it will seek to renegotiate existing 
contracts worth some $13.5 billion to encourage efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The department already had announced that it was accepting bids for $8.4 
billion in management contracts for its Rocky Flats nuclear weapons production 
site in Colorado and its Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. In total, 
including those two sites, the department will put $40 billion worth of 
contracts on the block over five years. 
</P>

 That figure tops the value of contracts that the Energy Department has opened 
up for competition over the last 25 years. Only seven times since 1968 has the 
department forced an existing contractor at one of its facilities to compete 
with others for the right to continue its management.

COMMISSION TO RULE ON WHEAT-IMPORT DISPUTE; TRADE: THE ADVISORY OPINION WILL 
SAY WHETHER U.S. FARMERS ARE BEING HURT BY CANADIAN SALES. 
</P>

<P>
 The International Trade Commission will rule Friday whether imports of 
Canadian wheat are hurting U.S. farmers in what has become an increasingly 
bitter trade dispute between the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission acts only in an advisory capacity. Any findings or 
recommendations it hands down are used by the White House in making decisions, 
which could include sanctions against Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, industry analysts are watching the ruling for indications of what, if 
any, action the United States might take against Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in the ITC decision because we hope it will give show us 
what direction the U.S. intends to take as the battle shapes up," a grain 
industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most industry analysts predict a split decision when the six-member panel 
hands down its findings late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheat trade dispute has spiraled from a minor flap over the surge in 
imports of Canadian durum wheat into what could be the beginning of a 
full-fledged trade war between the world's two largest trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States imported 2.5 million metric tons of Canadian durum wheat in 
1993, a record high that could be attributed to a shortage of domestic 
supplies. (Critics of U.S. farm and export subsidy programs point out that the 
United States continued to export huge amounts of subsidized durum wheat even 
after the huge loss caused by last year's devastating Midwest floods.) U.S. 
food processors were therefore forced to look elsewhere for durum wheat, which 
is used in pasta, and they turned to the cheaper Canadian product. U.S. farmers 
then demanded that Washington act to stop these imports, arguing that they 
would permanently lose a share of the domestic market to the cheaper Canadian 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States accused Canada of creating an unfair trading environment by 
using hidden subsidies and practicing predatory pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada asserts that the accusations of wheat dumping have not been sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade Minister Roy MacLaren noted that U.S. trade law "allows vested interests 
to use the courts to compete instead of the free market." 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings between Washington and Ottawa went nowhere, with both sides standing 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton told the ITC to investigate the matter. The findings to be 
released Friday are the results of that inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the United States will probably make good on threats of import 
quotas of about 1 million metric tons, with tariffs on imports beyond that 
number. Canada has threatened to retaliate, which would bring other sectors of 
agriculture into the fracas and complicate the issue further. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate matter, Canada Wednesday won a long-running dispute with the 
United States over softwood lumber imports when an international trade panel 
handed down a third ruling in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, composed of three Americans and two Canadians, found that the ITC 
failed to prove its assertion that imports of Canadian softwood had injured the 
U.S. industry. The ITC had proven there was injury to the U.S. industry, the 
panel said, but not that that imports of Canadian lumber were the cause. The 
trade panel sent the case back to the ITC, telling it that more evidence was 
needed to prove that there had been a violation under terms of the Free Trade 
Agreement.

BONDS, STOCKS MIXED DESPITE FED RESTRAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yields of most Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed Wednesday despite an 
apparent decision by the Federal Reserve Board to keep short-term interest 
rates steady for now. In the stock market, blue-chip stocks rose but the broad 
range of other issues had a quiet, mixed session. 
</P>
<P>
 After concluding its much anticipated two-day meeting, Fed policy-makers 
issued a brief statement that "there will be no further announcement." 
Strategists said the statement was a clear signal that the Fed was not boosting 
rates for now despite the dollar's recent slide against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond edged up to 7.59% 
from 7.58% late Tuesday. Yields on shorter-term securities posted slight drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they were surprised by the Treasury market's apparent 
indifference to the decision to keep monetary policy unchanged for the next six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The market also seemed to ignore a decline in commodity prices for the second 
day in a row, a potential sign of lower inflation. The Commodity Research 
Bureau index, a gauge of daily changes in various commodities, dropped 1.42 on 
Wednesday to 225.31. It had dropped 3.30 points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors tend to buy on signs of lower inflation, since inflation can 
eat away at the value of fixed-income investments such as Treasury securities. 
"Normally you'd expect the bond market to do better under those circumstances," 
said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The next major scheduled news will be June employment statistics due on 
Friday, considered the month's most important economic report. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar stabilized near 99 Japanese yen and rallied from its 14-month low 
against the German mark after a spokesman for French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur said monetary issues would be a main topic at the Group of Seven 
summit. The dollar ended at 1.5750 marks Wednesday after a roller-coaster 
session where it dropped to 1.5650 marks, the lowest since late April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative mood prevailed in the financial markets for much of the day. Solid 
gains for a handful of major stocks hoisted the Dow Jones industrial average up 
22.02 points to 3,674.50. 
</P>
<P>
 But declines and advances were separated by only about 60 issues at the close 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the day's highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Cyclical stocks that contributed to the rise in the Dow industrials included 
International Paper, up 1 3/4 to 68 3/4, Aluminum Co. of America, up 1 1/8 to 
77 and Caterpillar, up 2 3/4 to 104 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texaco got a lift from Tuesday's announcement of a plan to reorganize, 
cutting its payroll and costs. It rose 1 5/8 to 62 1/2 in heavy NYSE volume. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Big Board's volume leader was Dime Bancorp, which fell 1 3/8 to 9 1/4. 
The company has reached a definitive agreement to merge with Anchor Bancorp. 
Anchor fell 7/16 to 15 1/2 on the Nasdaq stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the session's biggest losers was Summa Four, which tumbled 10 1/4 to 
11 3/4 in heavy Nasdaq volume. The company released an earnings preview that 
disappointed Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another casualty of heavy selling was Salomon, which lost 2 to 45 1/2. The 
parent of the Salomon Brothers brokerage said it expects to report an after-tax 
loss of $200 million for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks ended with moderate losses as dismay over the dollar's fall 
against the yen induced dealer position adjustment. The 225-share Nikkei 
average closed off 205.34 points at 20,629.03. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's DAX average ended up 3.01 points at 2,035.70, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average closed 18.3 points lower at 2,946.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices were lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for 
current delivery fell $2.10 per troy ounce to $383.40.

 Lion's Roar Bumps STP: The box-office success of "The Lion King" helped 
catapult the film's soundtrack into the No. 1 position on the nation's pop 
album chart, with sales last week topping 272,000 units -- a 67% gain over the 
previous week and 105,000 units more than its closest competitor, Stone Temple 
Pilots' "Purple," which slips to No. 2. Meanwhile, sales for the soundtrack's 
sister recording, "The Lion King Sing-Along," jumped by 46%, pushing it from 
78th place to No. 52 on Billboard magazine's upcoming pop chart. Other big 
sellers this week include: country singer Alan Jackson's "Who Am I?," which 
enters at No. 7 with 84,000 units sold, and R&B star Keith Sweat's 
81,000-selling "Get Up on It," which lands at No. 8 during its first week in 
the stores.

 Tupac's Legal File: Rapper Tupac Shakur, wearing a red bandanna and jersey, 
was in a New York courtroom this week where a detective testifying in a sodomy 
and sexual abuse case against the rapper said he didn't know how a voice 
mailbox possibly containing messages to the rapper from the alleged victim were 
erased. Shakur's defense attorney has charged that police "destroyed" several 
messages, in which, he said, the woman repeatedly thanked Shakur for letting 
her perform oral sex on him on a disco dance floor earlier that month. In 
Tuesday's state Supreme Court hearing, Detective James Flaherty offered no 
explanation of how the messages were deleted, saying simply: "We tried to pull 
the messages back and they were gone." Shakur, 22, and Charles Fuller, 23, have 
pleaded innocent to charges of sodomy and sexual abuse in the alleged November 
attack on a 20-year-old woman in Shakur's hotel suite. . . . Elsewhere in New 
York on Tuesday, a minor traffic accident led to rapper Flavor Flav's arrest on 
charges of driving after his license had been suspended 43 times. The Public 
Enemy star was arrested after he parked his car in the Bronx and hit a cab when 
he opened the door. Police learned he had no valid license as they filled out 
an accident report. MOVIES

think Elvis (Presley) was a person who came along at the right time. . . . 
Black people been goin' out shakin' their behind for centuries . . . and that's 
all Elvis was doing, was copying that. And he was doing our kind of music. He 
was doing the Willie Mae Thornton ("Hound Dog"). That's black music. So what am

he's the king -- that's a piece of bunk."

CLUB REVIEW; DOLL HUT IS A '50S FIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With '50s chic in vogue in the Southland, locating true samplings of Americana 
aren't that easy to find. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Linda's Doll Hut, a doll-sized rockabilly club on an unmodernized 
street corner in Anaheim, is such a find.Many of the patrons appear to have 
stepped out of a '50s car brochure. Clad in old-school Levi's that complement 
the venue's roadhouse feel, many of the women sport close-cropped bangs while 
the men favor ducktails and work shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Jemison, the Doll Hut's 29-year-old owner, is the life of this 
75-capacity house, a former darts and billiards bar. A social worker turned 
club owner, Jemison books the bands, manages the door, runs the sound board, 
works the bar, plays pool (which is free at the Doll Hut) and even jumps on the 
dance floor when a particular song moves her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you can also catch Orange County punk bands such as Offspring and 
Social Distortion (some of its members periodically play under the name Fuel) 
performing at the Doll Hut, the current Monday night house band, Russell Scott 
and the Red Hots, is one of the club's best attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a Day-Glo Elvis poster pinned up behind the "stage," the decor 
primarily consists of band stickers slapped haphazardly on the club's 
wood-paneled walls. But two-thirds of the stickers are about local bands -- 
which also dominate the jukebox. 
</P>
<P>

$3 to $5. HEIDI SIEGMUND

TV RATINGS; VIEWERS DECIDE TO TAKE A HOLIDAY FROM THE TUBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DANIEL CERONE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All the back-yard barbecues, outdoor fireworks and blockbuster movies over the 
Fourth of July weekend took the sparkle off the four TV networks' prime-time 
ratings last week. Their usually low summer ratings dipped even lower--off 8% 
from the previous week and down 32% from the regular season. (Daytime ratings 
measuring audience interest in the media coverage of the preliminary hearing of 
O.J. Simpson will be released Friday.) 
</P>
<P>
 CBS came out slightly on top with an 8.5 rating, followed by ABC's 8.4, NBC's 
7.9 and Fox's 5.4, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures released Wednesday 
(each ratings point represents 942,000 U.S. homes). 
</P>
<P>
 Fox met with moderate success Wednesday in launching Aaron Spelling's new 
series, "Models Inc.," which it hopes will build an audience for the fall. The 
soap opera, starring Linda Gray as the head of a chic modeling agency, finished 
33rd among 96 prime-time programs. But it squarely hit the young target Fox is 
aiming for, ranking No. 11 with adults 18 to 34. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-rated program for the week was a repeat of last season's top-rated 
show, ABC's "Home Improvement." Besides newsmagazines loaded with segments on 
the Simpson case, the networks mostly ran series repeats and leftover episodes 
of series that won't be back next season, such as "Good Advice" on CBS and 
"Dinosaurs" on ABC. Southland Ratings

 OFFICIAL PARTY: The county's dean of local politics, Board of Supervisors 
Chairman Thomas F. Riley, has been making the circuit of appreciation dinners 
in this, his final year in office. Wednesday, the party came to his Hall of 
Administration office as past staffers gathered for the general's 82nd birthday 
celebration. There was also a congratulatory lunch at the Balboa Bay Club. . . 
. "This has been a great day!" Riley said. "I'm feeling good."

 TICKET TO HEAVEN? The California Angels may be in last place, but maybe 
they'll be rewarded for good deeds. The Angels and Coca-Cola have donated 
$50,000 to help Santa Ana build much-needed lights for its El Salvador Park 
baseball field. . . . Mayor Daniel H. Young this week offered the Angels a gift 
in return: "A guarantee that you will win the majority of the rest of your 
games this season." To make it official, the guarantee was drawn up by City 
Atty. Edward J. Cooper.

 SUMMER B-BALL: Just because Byron Scott plays for the Indiana Pacers instead 
of the Los Angeles Lakers doesn't mean he's forgotten where he likes to spend 
his summers. . . . Scott is returning to Orange County for two more of his 
basketball camps. The first is at Chapman University July 25-29 (it's $225, 
$325 if you stay overnight) and the second at Santa Margarita High School, Aug. 
8-12 ($200). It's the ninth year of Scott's youth camps, open to boys and girls 
age 8 to 17.

 IF THIS SHUE FITS: Don't think that Andrew Shue is going to be treated like 
any other player when he joins the Anaheim Splash indoor soccer team for its 
July 19 and 21 games at The Pond of Anaheim. Ten fans of Shue, who plays Billy 
on TV's "Melrose Place," will be chosen for each game as guest "Mermaids." 
That's the name of the team's dance/spirit squad. Spokesman John Nicoletti says 
they expect such a flood of applicants that they'll hold a drawing to choose 
the 20. It's women only -- but no age limit.

 FORMER NIBS DIBS: The hottest gossip item in the White House concerns that 
ultimate of bureaucratic issues -- jockeying for primo office space. Now that 
Thomas (Mack) McLarty is no longer the chief of staff and will surrender his 
spacious corner suite to Leon E. Panetta, where will McLarty hang his hat? No 
ruling yet, but Panetta is to move into his new digs next week. Here are the 
choices: McLarty could move into the office being vacated by White House 
counselor David Gergen -- who, in turn, is moving into a plush suite on the 
State Department's seventh floor, bumping L. Craig Johnstone, director of the 
Office of Resources, Plans and Policy, to a less prestigious locale. 
Unfortunately, Gergen's old office is in the basement, not on the coveted first 
floor with the Oval Office. . . . Another possibility: McLarty could take over 
the office of President Clinton's senior adviser George Stephanopoulos, which 
is next door to the Oval Office, but is very small and, of course, is very 
occupied. He also could take over the space that is assigned to Clinton's 
counselor Bruce Lindsey just across the hall from Stephanopoulos. But it is 
small and has no windows. Then there is the dining room next to the Oval 
Office, which could be turned into office space. . . . Clinton has deep 
affection for McLarty, whom he has known since kindergarten, but will he give 
up his dining room for him?

 APROPOS MALAPROP: Congressional consideration of defense spending in the 
post-Cold War era often involves balancing Pentagon desires with the impact on 
jobs. As Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) demonstrated last week, the line 
between those two can become blurred for lawmakers from states hit hard by 
defense cutbacks. . . . During floor discussion on whether to continue building 
B-2 Stealth bombers -- against the wishes of the Pentagon -- Feinstein praised 
the aircraft, saying that it "can deliver a large payroll, precision or 
carpet." The verbal slip was amended in the next day's Congressional Record to 
read payload. California would retain 22,000 high-paying jobs and $2.5 billion 
in defense contracts if the Senate's July 1 vote to build long-range bombers is 
adopted by the House.

 SAME OLD GANG: If it seems like Bob Dole, the quick-witted and quick-tempered 
Republican from Kansas, is the only senator ever quoted in the newspaper, you 
aren't far wrong. A UC Irvine professor, Richard McKenzie, has studied the 
number of times each senator was quoted over a 15-month span in 108 newspapers. 
Dole, whose post as Senate minority leader makes him the highest-ranking 
Republican official in Washington, beat out the next most-quoted senator by 
more than 2 to 1, 26,794 times to 11,741 for Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.). Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) was third (10,811), followed 
by Democrats Sam Nunn of Georgia and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. All 
five hold leadership positions or chair powerful committees. . . . Another sure 
route to fame is to get in trouble, like Sen. Bob Packwood, the Oregon 
Republican accused of sexual harassment. He was the sixth most-quoted. Merely 
being popular and influential with colleagues isn't enough. The leading 
contenders to replace the retiring Mitchell as majority leader, unquestionably 
by virtue of their reputation among colleagues, are nowhere in the news: Tom 
Daschle (D-S.D.) was 86th out of 100; Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) was 45th.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; CHILDREN HAVE A FRIEND IN 
CHARITABLE COP

 Making promises doesn't come easy to LAPD Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall resident remembers making only three. The first came on his 
wedding day, the second on the day he joined the Los Angeles Police Department. 
The third was made when a grieving but thankful mom, in the midst of 
transporting the body of her 11-year-old daughter home to Argentina, pleaded 
with him to continue his work and help other children get the organ transplants 
they desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Promise me, you'll do it for Veronica. Make her death mean something," she 
implored.  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year veteran, who commands the LAPD's South Bureau, says he was so 
moved by the mother's spirit that he agreed. He credits that commitment and the 
remarkable courage Veronica showed in fighting a battle she eventually lost for 
the inspiration to start the Encino-based World Children's Transplant Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the failed effort to save Veronica showed Kroeker how to move 
the dream forward. That journey began in Argentina, when Kroeker met the young 
girl on a business trip. With the help of a lot of committed people in Texas, 
California and Canada, Kroeker managed to raise $100,000 and get enough in-kind 
donations to pay for travel, housing and three transplant operations for 
Veronica. But the experience also taught him that this was not the most 
efficient operating plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years and approximately $1 million later, Kroeker and the WCTF he founded 
are still growing. A board of directors has signed on. Plans are under way to 
establish WCTF groups in Mexico, the Czech Republic, Colombia and Armenia. The 
organization already has centers in Los Angeles, Argentina, Costa Rica and 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out just raising money for transplant operations," Kroeker says. 
"Now, our strategy is focused on establishing centers, based on the three Ts: 
training, technology and teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the group has developed the new philosophy, it has become impossible to 
count the number of children who have been helped. 
</P>
<P>
 WCTF tailors its centers to the needs of its service area. This means one 
location may focus on new training in transplant techniques for doctors, while 
another may raise money to buy new high-tech equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's just fine with me, because this effort isn't about claiming credit for 
helping X amount of children," Kroeker says. "It's about giving people the help 
they need to heal these children." 
</P>
<P>
 WCTF has also focused its energy on teaching and publicizing the importance of 
organ donations. Companies like Gannett and Patrick Media helped by donating 
billboards and art direction. Celebrities such as Lorenzo Lamas, Mark Spitz and 
Bobby Unser also donated their time. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this charitable work and self-effacing talk by Kroeker sounds strange 
for a cop, friends and associates say it's not. "He's a good cop and a 
genuinely good person who just has a great commitment to helping people," says 
screenwriter-journalist Michael Graham.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone who knows Mark thinks this work is unusual for him," 
says Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, president of the Los Angeles Police Commission. 
Greenebaum is helping organize the WCTF annual fund-raising dinner, scheduled 
for Wednesday at the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Boeckmann from Galpin Motors, a WCTF board member, said he got involved 
with Kroeker's group a year and a half ago "because Mark and I are friends and 
I wanted to help kids. Anyone who knows Mark knows he's deeply committed to 
helping people." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker comes from a background of public service. His parents were Mennonite 
missionaries, and he spent his first nine years in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker emphasizes that the focus must remain on the children. "This began 
because I was inspired by Veronica, and in many ways I still am."

AROUND THE VALLEY: THICK-HEADED, THIN-SKINNED HERO IN HIS 15 MINUTES OF FLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study of the modern suburban male would surely discover three traits common 
to all, which from time to time align in a sort of moronic convergence, a 
testosterone-induced epiphany. For an example, read on.  
</P>
<P>
 The first trait is a tendency to scoff at pain -- until, of course, actually 
subjected to it. Hence, the predilection of those carrying the Y chromosome to 
engage in such activities as running 26 miles after a dinner of pork steak and 
martinis or attempting to bench-press their body weight after years of lifting 
nothing heavier than a can of Foster's. 
</P>
<P>
 At the onset of pain, however, the suburban male undergoes a dramatic 
transformation from swaggering Viking in Nikes to whimpering, whining puppy. 
Every female in sight becomes a potential mother figure -- comforter, nurse, 
servant -- as the male grows confident that his leg cramps are surely a sign 
that he will not live till dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trait is a deep-seated belief that any job, no matter how complex 
or labor-intensive, requires "about 15 minutes" to accomplish. This inability 
to come to grips with time is the reason "just checking a file" on the computer 
turns into "Uh, honey, I think I erased the hard disk." 
</P>
<P>
 The third trait is the refusal to acknowledge the traits described above as 
well as the dozen or so others that daily plague the modern suburban male, 
making him appear, at times, a chump. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate to say it, but a convergence of the three has me broiling in the flames 
of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 I began the weekend with a simple task: repair a sagging trellis and plant a 
few bushes to liven up an otherwise barren deck. A "15-minute" job involving 
power tools and dirt. What could be finer? 
</P>
<P>
 My sensible wife declined invitations to behold her husband drinking deeply of 
the fountain of manhood and opted instead for the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parting words were barely audible above my toolbox rummaging. "Don't 
forget to wear sunscreen," she said. "Silly woman," thought I. "Sunscreen? I'll 
be done in 15 minutes and spend the rest of the day sprawled out in 
air-conditioned comfort with a brew-ha-ha in one hand and a remote control in 
the other. No one's ever been burned by a television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dammit, I'm working in the most masculine sense of the word -- building 
stuff, tilling the earth. Betcha that guy in the Diet Coke ad doesn't wear 
sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," I reasoned in a flash of rationality, "if I slather myself up with 
sun goo, all the dust and junk kicked up by my tornado of productivity will 
stick to me like a breaded cutlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Scanning my brain for historical precedent, I flipped madly through my mental 
Rolodex past the day I met Eddie Van Halen, past the 1987 Rose Bowl, to that 
moment during my overpriced education when a professor said something about our 
hominid forebears not worrying about sunscreen as they pressed on across the 
African savanna in their quest for fire, carrion and larger cranial capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so those who survived childhood usually died around 30, but how much 
damage could a little time in the sun do to a guy with ancestors like those? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dr. Morgan Lindberg, a North Hollywood dermatologist, that was my 
first mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of sunscreen products available and people should use those," 
said Lindberg. "Once you're burned, there is no way to reverse that. You have 
to sort of live through it." 
</P>
<P>
 While most of us do apply a liberal coat when we go to the beach, we often 
forget when doing other things. Like I did, on that 15-minute job that ended up 
claiming four of the hottest and brightest hours of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultraviolet rays flame-broiled my pasty-white back, giving me what feels 
like the worst sunburn in the annals of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The burn was so severe that I was physically ill that night, cutting short 
what I had promised my wife would be an extravagant evening of fine food, 
overpriced wine and dancing. But not even a New York steak on the Sunset Strip 
or a table close to Weird Al Yankovich made me feel any better. 
</P>
<P>
 This sickness is caused by the body's inability to maintain its proper 
temperature, said Dr. Patricia Cavender, a Tarzana dermatologist. "Your skin is 
hot and inflamed," she said. "Your body has a harder time maintaining 
homeostasis." And you need that homeo stuff. Honest. 
</P>
<P>
 But what my wife wanted to know was simpler. "Why didn't you wear sunscreen?" 
she demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The best I could muster was a halfhearted "I dunno." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavender helpfully pointed out that free will does not guarantee common sense. 
"Adults make a lot of choices," she said. "Some people choose to smoke. Some 
people who have high cholesterol choose to eat red meat and butter." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, with my back baked the color of grilled salmon, I muddled through the 
next few days pleading with my wife to hose me down with one or another of the 
$30 worth of medicinal potions I bought. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your body telling you there is something wrong," Lindberg said. 
"That's what pain is, a warning from your brain telling you to stay out of the 
heat for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 I got the message. I writhed in agony as the nights wore on, waking my wife at 
hourly intervals to remind her that I could not sleep. I watched late-night 
television, but turned it off after tiring of Sally Struthers whining hour 
after hour about exciting careers in air-conditioning repair. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about whining and how annoying I find it. I congratulated himself 
for never whining, for being so brave in the face of pain, and figured that 
maybe next week, I could take apart the air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, 15 minutes. Max.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FREAK ACCIDENT RATTLES DISARCINA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina took no chances Wednesday. Prompted by an 
accident Tuesday, he wore batting gloves, for the first time this season, in 
the game against the Boston Red Sox.  
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina's bat flew out of his hands in the ninth inning Tuesday and hit two 
young boys, one of whom spent the night in critical condition with a skull 
fracture. The boy was listed in serious condition on Wednesday, according to 
hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Schellekes, 8, of Gilmanton, N.H., spent the night in intensive care 
after going into shock, and also had a three-inch gash over his right eye. His 
cousin, Matthew O'Connor, 10, also suffered cuts and was held overnight for 
observation.  
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi and assistant Tim Mead visited the boys and 
their parents Wednesday, and Manager Marcel Lachemann called them. It was the 
first time either youngster had attended a major league game and they had moved 
to vacant seats closer to the field after the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty much a helpless feeling," DiSarcina said. "I let the bat slip 
out of my hands a couple of times, but nothing like that ever happened. . . . 
My dad went to security officials and got the names and addresses. I'm going to 
send some stuff to them when I get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Security officials said both teams sent over souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have decided that they will bring up reliever Scott Lewis from 
triple-A Vancouver by July 15. He's expected to replace Craig Lefferts, who has 
allowed 62 baserunners in 34 2/3 innings, yielding a team-high .350 batting 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also are exploring the possibility of recalling Troy Percival, who 
has 10 saves for Vancouver. Percival, considered to be the Angels' closer of 
the future when they didn't protect Bryan Harvey, is fully recovered from 
reconstructive elbow surgery of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Lachemann said Vancouver starter Andrew Lorraine (9-3, 3.24 earned-run 
average) is ready to be called up to the big leagues whenever they need him. 
Lorraine could be used in the bullpen, Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel pitching coach Chuck Hernandez, whose newborn baby remains in intensive 
care, is expected to rejoin the team Friday in New York. His wife, Donna, is 
expected to be released from the hospital today.

 Angel third baseman Spike Owen hit a foul ball off his right heel in the 
seventh inning and is expected to miss a couple of games. BOB NIGHTENGALE

LOCAL NOTES: KOHLER RESIGNS AT LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Kohler has resigned as the Laguna Beach baseball coach, he announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohler, a walk-on, said he resigned to spend more time with his family, but 
added that he was unhappy with the program's direction.The team was 6-17, 2-13 
and last in the Pacific Coast League, in Kohler's only season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were great, but the administration was non-supportive at best," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Barbara Callard said she disagreed with Kohler's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the administration does everything it can to support the athletic 
program," Callard said.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; BLESZYNSKI'S LESSON OF THE DAY IS APPLICATION OF GOLDEN 
RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Ania Bleszynski, an award-winning math and science scholar, the numbers did 
not add up. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of last year, Tara Snyder was fifth-ranked among girls' junior 
tennis players in the nation. Bleszynski was 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 So why all of a sudden, Bleszynski wondered, was she seeded No. 1 over Snyder 
in the Olympic Festival? 
</P>
<P>
 Now she knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski, 17, from Thousand Oaks, trounced Snyder, 6-2, 6-1, Wednesday in 
the gold medal match at the Dwight Davis Memorial Tennis Center. "I don't know 
how they knew that, but, yes, now I do feel like I should be No. 1," Bleszynski 
said, referring to the event organizers who rated the players. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first-ever meeting, Snyder was no match for the Stanford-bound 
Bleszynski, who dispatched the 17-year-old from Wichita, Kan., in a little more 
than 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski's second gold medal-winning effort of the day -- in mixed doubles 
-- didn't take much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Harvard-Westlake High standout teamed with Mark Loughrin of 
Greendale, Wis., to rout Ry Tarpley of Milton, Mass., and Traci Green of 
Philadelphia, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatigue from Bleszynski's earlier singles match was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never played with as good of a mixed doubles partner as Ania," Loughrin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarpley was equally impressed. "They're a great team," he said of the pair, 
who first played together Friday. "There was not a lot we could do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Making short work of Snyder helped Bleszynski rebound for mixed doubles in 
temperatures and humidity that pushed the heat index to near 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, who routinely trains in such weather, hoped the blistering conditions 
might cause her opponent to wilt in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I can play all day if I have to," she said before the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first set, Snyder played a waiting game, seemingly content to let 
Bleszynski force the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski was uncharacteristically aggressive and charged the net to cut off 
Snyder's passing lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 When patience didn't work, Snyder turned the aggressor in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was trying to go for it more, trying to hit winners," Bleszynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't work, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "She tried to change her game, which I guess was smart," Bleszynski said. "I 
don't know if she changed it to the right game -- obviously not. It worked out 
fine for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The weather never became a factor. Bleszynski expressed concern about the heat 
after feeling weak during both of her matches Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really tired (Tuesday)," she said. "I didn't feel like I was hitting 
strong, running strong or serving strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure I could last today, but I felt fine the whole match." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 155-pound Bleszynski appeared strong throughout, hammering away 
at Snyder with power and finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first serve was a little off," Bleszynski said. "I missed too many. But 
she had trouble with my second serve kicking to her backhand. So it didn't 
really matter too much."

NEW TRIAL ORDERED AFTER JUDGE CALLS LAWYER 'PRETTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge's remark that a defense lawyer was a "pretty girl" has prompted the 
South Carolina Supreme Court to give her client a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge Hubert Long told jurors in the 1991 trial to ignore the mistakes 
of lawyer Ann Briks Walsh, who had improperly asked a prosecution witness 
whether he had a criminal record. He prefaced his remark by saying, "I hate to 
fuss at a pretty girl." He repeated the phrase later in the comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court said the remark improperly cast Walsh in a negative light 
before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh was defending Beondi Pace on grand larceny charges.

 The man accused of kidnaping and murdering Polly Klaas last year pleaded not 
guilty Wednesday, and plans to challenge the special circumstances that could 
lead to the death penalty. A lawyer for Richard Allen Davis, 39, also said he 
is conducting a survey that he expects will lead to a motion to move the trial 
out of Sonoma County, where the 12-year-old victim lived.Davis entered not 
guilty pleas to 12 charges ranging from murder and sexual assault to stealing a 
nightgown. Public Defender Barry Collins said he plans to challenge for lack of 
evidence at least three charges that would constitute the special circumstances 
necessary to sentence Allen to death. Those include lying in wait, sexual 
battery and the nightgown robbery. Prosecutors said the garment found on 
Polly's body was taken from one of the other girls attending her slumber party. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly was abducted at knifepoint Oct. 1 from her home in Petaluma, touching 
off an extensive search that ended after Davis' arrest Nov. 30. Her body was 
found Dec. 4 by the side of U.S. 101 in Cloverdale.

 Fire crews had the end of a weeklong battle in sight, expecting that today 
they will encircle a mountain wildfire that destroyed 12 houses and five mobile 
homes south of Palm Springs. Authorities said they expected to have the 
19,600-acre blaze contained by tonight and virtually extinguished by Sunday 
night, said Karen McKinley, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman. Meanwhile, a 
10,000-acre fire 60 miles to the northwest in the San Bernardino National 
Forest was only 25% ringed by firebreaks Wednesday, but its movement northeast 
was slowing.

CAMARILLO MEDICAL BUILDING DAMAGED IN FIRE; DISASTER: DOCTORS AND DENTISTS 
SCRAMBLE TO CANCEL APPOINTMENTS AND FIND NEW WORK SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of Camarillo residents had doctor and dentist appointments canceled 
Wednesday after fire caused $3 million in damage at a private medical building 
near St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Four firefighters who suffered minor injuries were treated at the scene, but 
no occupants of the building were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-alarm blaze gutted about seven offices in the two-story building, 
which included dialysis and physical therapy centers. Every office in the 
19-suite building sustained damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentists and doctors in the Courtyard building at 3801 Las Posas Road spent 
Wednesday scrambling to reach their patients and find new office space. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those offices not damaged by the fire will be forced to close for a few 
days because of smoke and water damage. Patients of the more than 20 doctors, 
dentists and therapists in the building will be forced in the next few weeks to 
go to other offices, delay appointments, or find new doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have another office in Oxnard, but it's still going to affect us really 
badly," said Larry Brown, a physical therapist who has had an office at the 
Courtyard for over two years and employs eight people there. "We're waiting to 
see if we can get the appointment book so we can contact people." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said the blaze would not have caused so much damage if the 
13-year-old building had been outfitted with sprinklers. The 40,844-square-foot 
building was constructed in 1981, the year before a county ordinance was passed 
requiring commercial buildings to have sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage would have been significantly less," said Sandi Wells, spokeswoman 
for the Fire Department. "It would have kept the fire right in the area where 
it originated." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said it was difficult to fight the blaze because the building's 
tile roof contained a lot of the heat, and was difficult for firefighters to 
punch holes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pressure cooker in there," Ventura County Fire Capt. Gary Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was caused by a failure in electrical wiring between the first and 
second floors of the building, a Fire Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after the fire was first reported at 5:45 a.m., doctors and their 
insurance agents were on scene to assess the damage. In the afternoon, 
firefighters allowed some tenants to return to their offices to retrieve 
appointment books and medical files. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do root canals, so it's something people might not mind avoiding," said 
Dr. Gregory Roda, who sees about 15 patients a day. "I've been getting pages 
all day from colleagues offering office space and other kinds of help." 
</P>
<P>
 Roda, who gets his patients from other dentists' referrals, said he is not 
taking any new patients for now, and hopes to establish temporary office space 
in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael McCarthy, who moved into the building in January and remodeled his 
office for about $400,000, said he and his partner, Phil Snow, made 
arrangements to move back to their old office on North Loop Drive in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Their practice sees about 50 to 60 patients a day, McCarthy said, and he wants 
as little disruption as possible. McCarthy said he hoped to recover some of his 
equipment Wednesday afternoon in order to set up shop in his old office as 
early as Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still kind of in shock over the whole thing," McCarthy said, as he stared 
at the burned building. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 patients who receive dialysis treatments at the Camarillo Kidney 
Dialysis office are being temporarily rerouted to the Conejo Valley Renal 
Center in Thousand Oaks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those patients who did show up for treatments, we made sure were going to be 
OK without dialysis for the day, and we sent them home," said Ray Ronquillo, 
area manager for National Medical Care, which owns the Camarillo Kidney 
Dialysis office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronquillo called the fire "a minor setback for the facility," which sustained 
only minor water damage. Ronquillo hopes to reopen by Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael Morrissette's office received only minor smoke damage and his 
office manager Sue Casedy said they plan to reopen for business Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Casedy said she canceled 19 dental appointments for Wednesday and Thursday, 
and some patients were not upset at all. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, who was scheduled to have several teeth pulled, told Casedy, "Oh 
goody, I get a reprieve."

WILDLIFE VOLUNTEERS FACED WITH CRISIS; ANIMALS: BULK OF INJURED OR HOMELESS 
BIRDS MUST NOW BE CARED FOR WITHIN THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wildlife volunteers in Ventura County are scrambling to find their way out of 
a crisis caused when Santa Barbara's network for injured or homeless birds 
announced it could no longer accept most Ventura County animals. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emergency meeting with the well-organized Santa Barbara Wildlife Care 
Network, Ventura County's small cadre of volunteers recently learned that the 
bulk of the 800 or so Ventura County animals taken across the county line each 
year must now be cared for in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara County will still accept sea birds, but it will no longer take 
hummingbirds, finches, sparrows, starlings, crows, doves or other so-called 
perching birds. And even when Santa Barbara does take the sea birds, Ventura 
County must cover the cost of caring for those birds, estimated at $25 to $100 
per bird. 
</P>
<P>
 That is in addition to the costs of caring for an estimated 800 injured or 
orphaned birds each year that never leave the county. The Santa Barbara group 
will, however, continue to accept small mammals, such as squirrels or bobcats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara County group's move leaves Ventura County strapped for funds 
and searching for volunteers, said Judi Kelly, an Ojai "rehabber" who 
specializes in rehabilitating songbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are desperately in need of rehabbers, and we need money. A lot of money," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who has about 30 birds in her back-yard aviaries and 10 chicks in an 
incubator, takes the little ones that need constant care with her to work every 
day as a Ventura special education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids do quite well with them," she said. "They feed them and help clean 
the cages." But, like the other six rehabbers in the county, Kelly has reached 
her limit. She can't take in any more birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Ferrer,) one of the 16 to 18 volunteers who rehabilitate or transport 
birds, has about 150 wild birds on her family's 18-acre ranch at the Ventura 
County/Santa Barbara County line. Of those, 75 are crows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take the crows because a lot of people don't have room for them," Ferrer 
said. "A whole bunch of hummingbirds can be fed in an incubator, but the big 
birds take more room and they have to be fed individually." 
</P>
<P>
 Her 18 back-yard aviaries and five to 25 cages also include lodgings for 
another 150 domestic animals, parakeets or ducks that have strayed from their 
homes. She takes in about 1,100 birds a year, with about 800 of them coming 
from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those she keeps until they are ready for release, and others, like sea 
birds, she sends along to volunteers in Santa Barbara County who have expertise 
in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the rehabbers do it because they are concerned about preserving a 
species, and that's good," Ferrer said. "But to me, each little creature that 
comes to me that has eyes and a little face is a little thing that needs to be 
saved." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Network took its action reluctantly, said 
organization president Diane Cannon. Santa Barbara lost a few of its volunteers 
this year and the burden of accepting Ventura County birds simply became too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Santa Barbara's commitment to help Ventura County was only 
temporary when the organization was formed in 1988, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we care less about the animals because of a county boundary," 
she said. "But if your resources are stretched to the point where you're going 
to break, you've got to make some pragmatic choices or your own organization 
will fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrer and many of the other volunteers in Ventura County know they will have 
to get through this season and possibly the next one with much less help from 
Santa Barbara County than they have come to depend on. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have hoped that Jerry Thompson, a master falconer in Simi Valley who 
runs a program for raptor rehabilitation, will be successful in his attempt to 
open a wildlife center at the Point Mugu Navy base. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson is in negotiations with the base to create a wildlife center on two 
acres, using an existing building and trailer for an office. He is in the 
process of raising the estimated $100,000 he thinks it will take to open the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to open the center within the next six months, at first caring 
mostly for raptors. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're working on the perching birds and shore birds as well," he said. 
"We eventually hope to be able to accept all kinds of wildlife there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That would take a big load off the volunteers in Ventura County. With the 
exception of Ferrer and Kelly who live on ranches, the other volunteers live in 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Lancaster, a Ventura High School soccer coach who also volunteers as a 
girls' softball coach, started out being a transporter for the group. Every 
day, she picks up birds from Ventura County Animal Control shelter at the 
Camarillo airport, from rehabbers, or from individuals who have found stranded 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, she has also been pressed into service rehabilitating birds, and 
now has 10 birds in aviaries in the yard of her west Ventura home. She has 
begun making baby bird formula, which includes egg yolks, monkey chow, vitamins 
and other ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it because I love the work," she said, crediting her family for support 
and help. "My family doesn't get cookies any more. All they see is bird food." 
</P>
<P>
 The group is looking for volunteers to take six or 10 birds at a time. With 
enough help, she said, they can keep their volunteers limited to those numbers 
instead of overwhelming them with more birds than they can handle, as has been 
the case in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Quebbemann) joined the group last year saying she could help out with 
two birds. "I had 22 in two weeks," she said. Last week, she had 20 chicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to hold their little heads up and shove the food down their throats," 
she said. 
</P>

 Quebbemann, who is curtailing her activities because of a severe illness in 
her family, said one of the best parts of the work is seeing the birds survive 
until they are well enough to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing more rewarding than taking this little bitty baby that can't 
hold its head up and then moving it to an aviary where it can fly, and then one 
day, letting it go," she said. "They come back and beg at you for a few days 
afterward and you kind of have to wean them from you."

<P>
 Capt. Roger Reese, who oversees wildlife protection in Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties for the California Department of Fish and Game, said the 
volunteers have done an excellent job filling the need in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been working with Ferrer and Thompson to help the Ventura County group 
work together until the wildlife center opens at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we can put something together here," he said. "We'll try to get 
more volunteers and more funds and more support. The main thing is that we keep 
it going." FYI

COUNTY FACES $17-MILLION SHORTFALL IN '95 BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County administrators unveiled an $880.5-million budget proposal 
Wednesday that boosts criminal justice programs while projecting cuts in health 
and social services programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of its tightest budget years yet, the county nonetheless expects to 
increase overall spending by 4.7% and add 342 employees to its staff in fiscal 
year 1995 -- most of them sheriff's deputies, jail workers and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg warned that county leaders 
still must pare the budget to adjust for a $17-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without question, your board is now facing the most difficult budget deficit 
and reduction situation since the passage of Proposition 13," Wittenberg wrote 
the Board of Supervisors in a letter attached to the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg recommended eliminating the budget shortfall by drawing $9 million 
from reserves and slicing $8 million from county programs. He stopped short of 
recommending specific cuts, saying that department heads would present their 
recommendations to supervisors in final hearings that begin July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choices they will present to you will all seem unacceptable and certainly 
unpopular, but some must be made," Wittenberg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He also warned that the state could leave the county another $10 million short 
before the end of July and suggested the board consider new ways of providing 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we call it reinventing, restructuring, downsizing or cuts, the time 
is here for change in Ventura County government," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn said he was prepared to turn some of the county's 
responsibilities over to the state or the cities. "I think county government 
needs to look at itself and maybe spin off some of the things that it does," he 
said Wednesday. "We need to do that, and now is the time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 State cuts and a sluggish economy have combined to make crafting Ventura 
County's budget increasingly difficult. Supervisors have cut $44.2 million in 
programs in the past five years. Even so, the size of the budget, which 
includes funding for flood and sanitation districts, continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Wittenberg asked all his department heads, except public safety 
agencies, to propose 2% cuts in their budgets. When Gov. Pete Wilson announced 
new state reductions in June, the supervisors asked for deeper cuts, ranging 
from 8% to 18% for most departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget proposal released Wednesday recommends $179.2 million for criminal 
justice, a 20% increase. The county's share of that figure is $103.1 million, 
with the remainder coming from state and federal sources or from fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of that increase comes from the extension of a half-cent sales tax 
approved last year under Proposition 172. In March, the board promised $24 
million of the sales tax revenue to the Sheriff's Department and district 
attorney. Another $4 million has yet to be committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for health and social programs, which range from Ventura County 
Medical Center to mandated welfare services, will rise to $188.8 million, up 
7.5%. But some of that funding could be lost to state cuts. And the county's 
share, only about $17 million of the total, is dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg said the county would not know the full extent of state reductions 
until the end of the month, at about the same time the supervisors consider the 
final budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg's budget leaves undecided the fate of the county's library system. 
The 15-branch system receives its own pool of property tax money, but will need 
a contribution from the county government to keep all libraries open. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the supervisors came through with a $1.6-million bailout for the 
libraries. Wittenberg did not include that figure in his proposed budget, but 
gives supervisors the option of spending contingency funds set aside for 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members spent the past two weeks meeting with county department heads 
about the budget situation. Even so, they reached little consensus on where to 
make cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have to be deep and they're going to have to hurt," said 
Supervisor Susan Lacey. "But where they're going to be, we haven't heard from 
all the departments yet." Proposed 1995 County Budget 04,20,16,16,10 General 
fund 1993-94 1994-95 % change Human resources $175.6 million $188.8 million

DUCK RACE; COUNTY SYMPHONY'S FUND-RAISER, REVAMPED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW, 
SCHEDULED FOR NEXT MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Confident now that it has its ducks in a row, the Ventura County Symphony 
announced Wednesday that the recently canceled Great American Duck Race will be 
held Aug. 6 on local waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The race -- which gives a shot at winning a car or other prizes to entrants 
who sponsor one of 10,000 rubber ducks dumped into a Santa Clara River canal -- 
had been abruptly called off two days before its original June 25 date. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation followed a warning from local prosecutors that the event had 
been promoted in violation of a state law prohibiting lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Because participants were required to donate $5 to participate, the June 25 
duck race would have been a lottery under the penal code. To comply with the 
law, symphony officials are now offering the public free chances in the race, 
said Karine Beesley, the orchestra's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beesley said she still hopes that most people will realize the duck race 
is an important fund-raiser for the symphony and will still make the requested 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got four weeks now, so we're hoping that the public gets behind us," 
she said. "But we need to let people know that we need their donations, if at 
all possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office said it had a legal obligation to warn the 
symphony on the law after several other nonprofit and charitable groups 
complained about the way the duck race was being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago local prosecutors drafted legislation to revise the law to 
permit lotteries for nonprofit groups. The proposal was sent to each state 
legislator representing the county but was never enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) has introduced similar legislation, 
which passed the Assembly but not the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphony's problems have rekindled talk of trying again to revise the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that charities and nonprofit groups should be allowed to have 
lotteries, as long as there is some reasonable limit on it," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Schwartz, who drafted the earlier proposal by Ventura County 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, however, said, "I wouldn't feel comfortable with someone paying 
$10,000 for a chance to win a house." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell's unsuccessful efforts came after Santa Clara High School officials 
were advised that selling raffle tickets for a fiesta was illegal, said 
O'Connell, now running for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with the law, the symphony reprinted a promotional flyer and changed 
a brochure that will be distributed soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make it very clear that there is no obligation to donate to the 
symphony to sponsor a duck, to participate in this race," Beesley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beesley added: "People need to understand that the symphony is dependent 
on contributions for over 55% of its budget. We would hope that they would 
believe and understand that our orchestra is important to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised through the event will go the the symphony's Education Outreach 
program, which benefit music programs in local schools, Beesley said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 To sponsor a duck for the Great American Duck Race for $5, or to adopt one for 
free, write to the Ventura County Symphony, 3451 Foothill Road, Ventura 93003. 
Sponsors of the first ducks to drift across the finish line Aug. 6 will win one 
of 18 prizes. For more information, call 643-8646.

DISTRICT TRUSTEES CRITICIZE REPORT BY GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final grand jury report released last week is "like a hit-and-run attack" 
on the Ventura County Community College District that is full of omissions and 
outright errors, a governing board member said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees of the three-campus district, speaking publicly for the first time 
about the critical report, complained that jurors were ill-informed about the 
financial workings of the district and sloppy in their description of the 
colleges' activities and missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large the grand jury has breached its duty to the public in Ventura 
County," Trustee Gregory Cole said at the governing board meeting late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a hit-and-run attack," he said. "They get the big headlines . . . 
but nobody's going to hold them accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Allan Jacobs said the grand jury failed to account for the 
costs of implementing some of its recommendations. He also complained that 
jurors treated the district like a company bent on making a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in the same business as someone who's out there making a product to 
sell," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993-94 Ventura County grand jury concluded that the Ventura County 
Community College District was fiscally mismanaged to the point of jeopardizing 
its financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 It also criticized officials for failing to safeguard the district from budget 
crises, and recommended a series of sweeping reforms to insulate the district 
from further mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends the district build up its reserve fund, establish 
contingency plans for shortfalls in state revenue, and require departmental 
audits every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 At their Tuesday night meeting, trustees cited inaccuracies in the report and 
complained about the jury's professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Cole said, the grand jury wrongly attributed fee increases and 
the resulting enrollment dip to the college district. The state Legislature, 
Cole noted, sets the fees for California community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole also complained that he was treated rudely during a meeting with several 
members of the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never have I ever seen a witness treated the way I was treated," Cole said 
about his interview, which was conducted a month before the final report was 
due. "A lot of these individuals already had their own agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 But grand jurors contacted Wednesday stood by the report, pointing out that 
financial information showing that several college enterprises lost tens of 
thousands of dollars came from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to get chewed up," said grand jury Foreman Lloyd Fellows. "We 
did find some problems with the bookstores and the cafeterias that some of the 
grand jurors felt signaled mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having loose control over those signaled looseness elsewhere," Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to district records, the cafeterias at Moorpark and Oxnard colleges 
lost about $55,000 between them in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1993. The 
Oxnard College bookstore also lost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the so-called enterprise funds are supposed to make money. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the grand jurors, who were dismissed from service when their report 
was submitted last Friday, said the criticism is coming from politicians 
worried about their elected positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to tell you the soul searching that went into that report and the 
hours that went into it," said Jay Flashner, who served on the grand jury 
committee which investigated the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems "have to rest with the elected individuals because they're 
responsible," Flashner said. "These trustees are protecting their particular 
position, and I can understand that. But don't say we didn't do our job, 
because we did an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand juror Edy Everett said district officials should quit griping about the 
report and focus on the tasks at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's expedient for the community college district to go in an offense mode 
because it directs attention away from the report itself and into these 
personal side issues," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the report is accurate," she said. "There are issues that need to 
be addressed by the college district. And it would be for everybody's benefit 
to look past the rhetoric and set to work fixing these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole was not the only governing board member disappointed with the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Timothy Hirschberg said the jury failed to evaluate the positive 
programs conducted at the colleges. He also said the jury "glossed over" the 
progress the district has made in increasing its reserves over the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it hard to believe there isn't more to commend on all three campuses," 
Hirschberg said. "I had hoped for suggestions rather than wasted criticism."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; SEN. FEINSTEIN TOURS PORT ON CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein made a brief stop in Ventura County Wednesday, touring 
the Port of Hueneme as part of a campaign swing through Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic incumbent, who took a 45-minute tour of the port before holding 
a brief press conference, is being challenged for reelection by Rep. Michael 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Oxnard Harbor District invited Feinstein for a visit in the 
wake of her support of legislation to allow the district and the U.S. Naval 
Construction Battalion Center to share a wharf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ports shouldn't be kitsch or boutiques," said Feinstein, adding that 
California should take full advantage of its proximity to Asia. Instead, she 
said, they should provide "jobs for people, production and movement of goods 
and services." 
</P>
<P>
 The joint-use agreement between the harbor and the Navy will allow the harbor 
to make improvements to Wharf No. 3 and then lease it. The profits will be 
shared by the Navy and the harbor, said U.S. Navy Capt. Ray Fosse, president of 
the Board of Harbor Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 During the visit, her first to the port, Feinstein met with representatives 
from Sunkist Growers, Del Monte Fresh Produce, Cool Carriers USA and BMW of 
North America. She was presented with a framed aerial photograph of the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Quarles, a spokesman for Sunkist Growers, said Feinstein is trying to 
persuade Thailand to buy American citrus products. Quarles said Thailand has an 
embargo against U.S. citrus because of certain agricultural pests here.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; STATE TO INSTALL GATE AT MCGRATH BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by an increase in crime at McGrath State Beach, park officials will 
install a gate at the entrance to the popular beach area between Oxnard and 
Ventura, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting July 15, park rangers will close the new gate nightly at 10 p.m. and 
reopen every morning at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased incidents of vandalism, theft, public disturbances and other crimes 
in recent months triggered the decision to install the gate, state park 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rangers and lifeguards respond to late-night emergencies at McGrath, 
they do not perform nightly patrols of the state beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials said they hope the new gate will also keep motorists in 
four-wheel drive vehicles away from the sensitive wetlands along the mouth of 
the Santa Clara River. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 Vandals have destroyed an estimated $10,000 worth of public landscaping in 
Camarillo's Mission Oaks neighborhood in recent weeks, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spate of incidents, vandals have ripped out newly installed 
drought-resistant plants and irrigation equipment in a $120,000 street 
beautification project roughly bounded by Woodcreek Road, Santa Rosa Road, Oak 
Canyon Road and Mission Oaks Boulevard, said Ernie Villasenor, the city's 
street superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 The acts of vandalism occurred late last month and no arrests had been made as 
of Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Glenn Sander urged people with information 
about the vandalism to call the department at 482-9844. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CHAVEZ SCHOOL PLANS CIVIL RIGHTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A committee is trying to raise money to expand the library at Cesar E. Chavez 
School in Oxnard and create a civil rights learning center there so children 
will know the history of the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to teach children how to obtain civil liberties through a non-violent 
way," Principal Anthony Zubia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's library has not been updated since 1992, when the school expanded 
from kindergarten through third grade to include students up to the sixth 
grade, Zubia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-person committee of residents, parents and school officials was 
appointed by the Oxnard School District last year to oversee the changing of 
the school's name from the Juanita School. The committee was also charged with 
creating a center where students could learn about Chavez, Martin Luther King 
and Mahatma Gandhi, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will hold a $50-a-person fund-raiser on July 16 at the Oxnard 
Hilton Inn. The event, from 1 to 10 p.m. will include lunch, music and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee hopes to raise $10,000 at the event, which would be matched by 
the school district, Zubia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools in the Oxnard School District also are struggling to maintain 
their libraries and have held fund-raisers in recent years, said district 
Administrator Richard Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of budget cuts in educational programs statewide, local school 
officials have been unable to expand libraries or even keep them current, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the Chavez fund-raiser, call the district at 
483-2389. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: GAVIOTA; CHEVRON TO CHALLENGE DENIAL OF PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chevron Corp. will ask the California Coastal Commission next week to overturn 
a decision by the commission's executive director to deny the oil company an 
emergency permit to ship oil by tanker from Gaviota to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron will request that the commission cast aside the decision of Executive 
Director Peter M. Douglas, who last month turned down Chevron's fifth emergency 
request to resume tanker shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 In requesting the permit, the oil company claimed the Jan. 17 earthquake 
damaged an oil pipeline and that the company needs to ship by sea to get its 
product to Los Angeles-area markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said he believed Chevron could not prove an emergency existed since 
the company has been processing at capacity -- about 80,000 barrels per day -- 
from its Point Arguello fields since the earthquake. A company spokesman said 
Chevron is still able to produce at capacity levels only because oil is being 
rerouted through other pipelines at a much higher expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's shipping permit was suspended by the commission Feb. 1 after it 
failed to secure a pipeline with all necessary state permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Chevron reached a deal with Pacific Pipeline Inc. to 
construct a pipeline, but because the project is still undergoing regulatory 
scrutiny by the California Public Utilities Commission, it failed to meet the 
Feb. 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanker shipping operations were scheduled to cease by Jan. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will consider the company's request at its meeting Wednesday in 
Huntington Beach. J.E. MITCHELL

 As part of a once-a-year service, Harrison Industries will accept additional 
curbside trash from Ventura customers between Monday and July 15 at no 
additional cost, company officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 On their regularly scheduled collection days, garbage trucks will pick up the 
equivalent of two extra 35-gallon barrels or bags, or the same amount of 
bundled brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura customers can also arrange disposal of large items, such as furniture 
or appliances, which will be picked up at half the normal cost, officials said. 
Arrangements must be made at least one day in advance.

 Camarillo city officials have selected a Torrance-based company to provide 
building and safety services for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, Charles Abbott Associates Inc., outbid several other agencies, 
including Ventura County, to win the contract to provide building and safety 
inspections, licenses and other services, City Manager Bill Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company received favorable recommendations from several other cities that 
use its services, Little said. "We anticipate that the users of our building 
and safety services will receive similar levels of competent and efficient 
assistance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 12-month contract, the company will receive no more than $420,000 of 
the fees it collects, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on available services, residents should call 388-5395.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WEISS FILES PROTEST OF ELECTION RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura accountant Scott Weiss, who was one vote short of forcing an election 
run-off for the position of Ventura County auditor-controller, has challenged 
the results of the June 7 election in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss claims that election officials should have tried to ascertain the 
identities of more than 23,000 voters who either punched their ballots for more 
than one candidate or did not pick any candidate for auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition, filed Wednesday, said election officials failed to determine if 
the intent of the 274 voters who cast an "over-vote" could be found out. 
</P>
<P>
 It made the same complaint in reference to the 23,395 voters who did not cast 
a vote in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal action came one week after the Board of Supervisors formally 
certified the 113,866 ballots cast in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss decided against putting up $10,000 of his own money for a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have said that, based on a 1987 court decision and a case in 
1984, when Ventura County did a recount of over-votes, officials are not 
required to count ballots in which votes were cast for two or more candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lawsuit, Weiss said that "had such votes been counted as required by 
the Elections Code, (he) would have received more votes" than opponent Richard 
Morrisset. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAKING REPAIRS TO 
CAMPUSES

<P>
 For students in the Conejo and Simi Valley school districts, summer is a 
chance to get away from the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But for dozens of district workers, the warm summer months are the best time 
to get into vacant classrooms and repair the damage created by the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just swoop in and work like crazy," said Assistant Supt. Sarah Hart of the 
Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some work that was done immediately after the earthquake," she 
said. "But the bulk of the work was scheduled for this summer when the students 
weren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said many Thousand Oaks schools are still being inspected in a "line by 
line, room by room" inventory of what needs to be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every school in the district has some damage," Hart said. "It's just a matter 
of degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High School, which received mainly cosmetic damage from the Jan. 
17 quake, has about five restoration projects planned for this summer, 
including replacing broken windows, repainting buildings and dismantling an 
entire wing of temporary classrooms that were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to about $1 million the Thousand Oaks district annually sets aside 
for school maintenance, Conejo Valley Unified anticipates needing another $1.5 
million specifically for earthquake repairs, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district expects about 97% of that money will come from federal and state 
disaster relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, district officials also hope to complete many of their 
earthquake repairs during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High School was closed for nearly two months after the quake and 
students were forced to attend class at rival school Royal High. Damage 
estimates for Simi Valley High were about $3 million. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 Two women who authorities believe supplied methamphetamine to dealers in 
Thousand Oaks have been arrested on suspicion of possession of the drug for 
sale, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Cosby, 31, and Rosa Marie Rodriguez, 34, both of Lancaster in Los 
Angeles County, were arrested late Tuesday at a fast-food restaurant on San 
Fernando Road in Santa Clarita, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were taken into custody while attempting to deliver a pound of 
methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $73,000 to an undercover 
Ventura County sheriff's detective, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests followed a three-month investigation in which detectives traced 
drug sales from street dealers to the two women, who they suspect are wholesale 
suppliers, said Sgt. Gary Pentis of the sheriff's East Valley narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses where the women lived in Lancaster, on Norberry and Cedar streets, 
were searched after the arrest, and evidence of drug dealing, such as scales, a 
ledger, several ounces of methamphetamine and $6,300 in cash, was found, Pentis 
said. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies assisted in the search. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were booked into Ventura County Jail but released late Wednesday on 
$20,000 bail each. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MILLER WILL SEEK CITY COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Promising a law-and-order platform for his campaign, former Simi Valley Police 
Chief Lindsey Paul Miller said Wednesday that he will run for election to one 
of two open City Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he plans to formally announce his candidacy on July 21 at 11:30 
a.m. in Rancho Tapo Park, adding his name to a list of four other Simi Valley 
candidates for the council seats now held by Sandi Webb and Judy Mikels. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 55, spent nearly 33 years as a policeman -- 20 with the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department and the rest as chief of Simi Valley Police until 
his Feb. 11 retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the 13-plus years I've worked for the city, I've enjoyed being here and 
I think I have a continuing contribution to make because of my knowledge of law 
enforcement and of the community," Miller said. "My No. 1 priority is to keep 
the City Council focused on law enforcement as an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are Dean F. Kunicki, 49, president of a Thousand Oaks-based 
company; Michael S. Mc Caffrey, 34, an insurance underwriter; Debi Schultze, 
37, a mortgage loan processor; and Joseph R. Vesalga, 39, a computer operator.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PUBLIC CAN VIEW CLAS EXAM EXCERPTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County residents who have wondered about the fuss surrounding the 
state's new student assessment tests will have an opportunity to see the exams 
for themselves later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to defuse opposition to the California Learning Assessment System 
exams, the state Department of Education is making available for public review 
portions of the tests that were given this spring to fourth-, eighth- and 
10th-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 The exams' reading and writing sections, which were the most controversial 
parts of the tests, will be on display at the Ventura County superintendent of 
schools office at Camarillo Airport and about 50 locations throughout the state 
for one month beginning July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The literature excerpts contained in the exams are protected by copyright, so 
visitors will not be allowed to photocopy the entire tests, state education 
officials said. But they will be able to request photocopies of the test 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the state is allowing this public review, education officials will 
have to rewrite the entire language arts sections of the tests for the spring 
of 1995, Department of Education spokeswoman Susie Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some county education officials said that allowing the public to see the 
tests will help build support for the controversial exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once people see the tests, they're going to see they're not as detrimental as 
they thought," Rovina Salinas, a learning resource specialist who will monitor 
the CLAS exam display in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous standardized assessment exams, CLAS aims to measure student 
performance mainly through open-ended, essay-type questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The exams have come under fire from conservative groups partly because they 
ask students to relate certain literary excerpts to their own experiences with 
questions that opponents have characterized as prying and overly personal. MAIA

CHARGES OF LOW BIDS, INSIDER TRADING CLOUD COLLEGE HORSE SALE; AUCTION: ONLY 17 
ANIMALS FROM MOORPARK STABLE REMAIN. WOULD-BE BUYERS COMPLAIN THAT THE OTHERS 
WERE SOLD EARLIER TO OFFICIALS' FRIENDS FOR FAR TOO LITTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite recent assurances that Moorpark College still owned 40 horses for its 
equestrian program, the college president said this week that most of the 
animals have now been sold without appraisals or public bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the taxpayer-owned horses that equestrians say could have fetched 
$2,000 each at a public auction were sold to insiders for as little as $300, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 17 of about 40 horses in the program earlier this year are still 
available for sale to the public, Moorpark College President James Walker told 
Ventura County Community College District trustees Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The others all were sold this spring and have been transported to buyers. But 
at least a dozen of those animals have not yet been paid for, he said. Walker 
said he did not know why the college allowed buyers to pick up the horses 
without paying for them first. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, college district Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin said district lawyers 
say the sales contracts are non-binding because the governing board never gave 
Program Director Don Anderson permission to sell the animals. But trustees have 
not decided whether to try to get them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way the district can get that property back is to sue," Lakin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But several Ventura County residents are angry that they had no chance to buy 
the horses, which originally were donated to the college or bred in the equine 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, whose June 30 retirement caused closure of the 26-year-old 
riding-and-training program, has said that he sold or agreed to sell the horses 
for an average of $350 each. He said he determined the values based on his 
decades of experience in the horse business. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential buyers complained that the horses are worth much more and accused 
the program director of selling the horses to his friends at a fraction of 
their market value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who would pay to transport a horse worth only $300," said Neil 
Jensen, an Oxnard rancher who wanted a chance to buy some of the horses. "Even 
up north, you can't touch a good saddle horse for less than $2,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who lives at the Newbury Park ranch where he ran the program, was 
not available for comment on Wednesday. But he said last month that he 
negotiated the highest possible price for the animals. He said he sold the 
horses with permission of college administrators and that he had feared the 
animals might end up being slaughtered and turned into dog food. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, the district trustees declared the remaining horses surplus 
property and approved a sealed-bid auction for July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is planning to advertise the auction. And administrators have 
proposed a set of qualifications to weed out buyers who would sell the horses 
for their flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 A district committee made up of Anderson, Newbury Park horseman Jim Frazier, 
Jeff Alexander of the Thousand Oaks Corral and Kay Skeeters of the Ojai Valley 
Farms was formed to set the value of the horses and conduct the auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bidding criteria include riding experience, the proposed use of 
the horse, a description of the buyer's stable and a list of personal 
references. 
</P>
<P>
 "A determination will be made by the committee whether that individual 
(bidder) is acceptable," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michelle Erich, a Port Hueneme attorney whose daughter, Shyla, 
participated in the equine program last year, said the auction rules are skewed 
against people outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "In screening prospective buyers, I see a real potential for misuse," she told 
trustees. "I think a lot of people with friends on the committee are going to 
find horses at a good price." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said after the board meeting that certain revisions will be made to the 
bidding application to ensure that everyone gets a chance to bid on a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Walker said proceeds from horse sales have always gone 
into a special fund at Moorpark College. But he noted that the college has not 
yet received payment from a Utah rancher who purchased at least a dozen of the 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson sold scores of horses belonging to the Moorpark College Equine 
Program over the years without keeping track of how much he received for each 
animal, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier, an independent horse appraiser brought in by Anderson, estimated that 
they are worth an average of $385, still far below what some horse owners say 
they are worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pick up a Horse Trader and find me a horse for $300 that's rideable," said 
Erich, who wanted to buy a chestnut quarter horse called Royal for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter was told (Royal) was 12," Erich said. "She described him as a 
'push button.' Now I'm told he needs an experienced rider, he has no trail 
experience and that he shies easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said last month that Royal was 18 and worth only $300. A subsequent 
appraisal by Frazier said the quarter horse was instead 20 and worth up to 
$450.

PARENTS ALL WORKED UP ABOUT EROTIC CABLE TV PROGRAMMING; THOUSAND OAKS: SOME 
RESIDENTS WORRY THAT KIDS MAY BE VIEWING SOFT-CORE SPICE CHANNEL DESPITE 
SCRAMBLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A squiggle down the middle of her television screen does not disguise the 
scenes of sex well enough for Thousand Oaks mother of two Tracy Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the picture's peculiar casts of magenta and green, especially since 
sexually explicit noises ring from her television as clearly as the voices of 
Bert and Ernie on Sesame Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon is one of a dozen residents to file complaints with the city of 
Thousand Oaks over the Spice Channel, a soft-core pornography offering 
available to nearly 32,000 Conejo Valley homes through Ventura County 
Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting tonight, members of the Citizens Advisory Cable TV Issues 
Committee will discuss whether the city should send the cable company a formal 
complaint for insufficiently scrambling the signals of the pay-per-view 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company has offered to install traps for free to completely block 
the signal, some residents said that is not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids can always just go to someone else's house and watch it," said Dillon, 
who had a trap put on her TV. "That's what made me join in on the complaint. 
What really concerns me is, from what I understand, a good number of junior 
high kids know about it. That's scary. Twelve-year-old boys definitely don't 
need to think that is how things are." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spice Channel costs $7.95 for 24 hours of service. Unlike the Playboy 
Channel, which features titillating game shows and sitcoms as well as adult 
movies, Spice shows erotic movies almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroline Milton, the city's media services coordinator, said she sent a letter 
to VCC on June 22, asking them to address concerns of residents that Channel 53 
is not scrambled enough to prevent viewers from getting peeks at the sex shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We normally do not give them a time limit to respond," Milton said. "But in 
this case I would have expected to receive a written response by now." 
</P>
<P>
 VCC President David LaRue said he has not sent a written response because his 
company is still working to improve its scrambling of the Spice signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we have succeeded, but I don't want to give them a written response 
until I'm sure," LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has little actual control over what VCC does about the Spice 
Channel's unwelcome presence, said Tracy Westen, the city's legal consultant on 
cable matters. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRue said he hopes to allay residents' concerns at tonight's meeting. He said 
VCC has increased the level of scrambling on the Spice Channel in the last 
three weeks, and has knocked out more of the picture and in some cases, 
eliminated the audio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks a little like a herringbone suit now," LaRue said. "With this level 
of scrambling, I can't imagine anyone complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was not sure what percentage of VCC customers could still hear the 
audio, which differs in volume and clarity on each TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park resident Jeanne Anderson, who complained about Spice to the city, 
turned on her television Wednesday to check the results of the increased 
scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the visual is scrambled but the words are clear as a bell," she said. 
"I don't think they've eliminated enough of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Anderson discovered that her 12- and 16-year-old sons had been 
watching the channel for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I went in and turned it on, and there were two women making love in 
magenta," Anderson said. "Who knows how many hours of porn my kids have 
watched?" 
</P>
<P>
 LaRue said he thought it unlikely that any sexually explicit images could 
actually have been seen since Spice became available in January. 
</P>

 "It's a little like an abstract painting," he said. "It's hard to tell people 
what they are or aren't seeing. It's simply a perception. But if they were 
looking for a certain kind of activity on the Spice Channel, I can't prove they 
didn't see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have complained to Milton and other city officials, including 
Councilwoman Jamie Zukowski and Mayor Alex Fiore, that the scrambling on Spice 
seemed less effective than on other channels such as Home Box Office and 
Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt that perhaps this was an advertisement," Zukowski said. "Why do 
they have complete scrambling in some cases and only reduced in others?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we initially put it on we had it scrambled at the same levels as other 
channels like HBO," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this spring, customers of Oxnard-based Jones Intercable had similar 
complaints about receiving unwanted audio from the Spice Channel. Dennis Scala, 
city liaison with Jones Intercable, said the company has promised to install 
better scrambling devices this month to eliminate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, VCC will have to show customers like Anderson that her cable 
service will not include any part of the Spice Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this doesn't disappear within a few weeks, then I'm canceling," she said. 
"This shouldn't be coming into the house just because I want to get the 
Learning Channel."

VENTURA CHAMBER CHIEF GETS JOB BACK FOR 1 YEAR AFTER ABRUPT DISMISSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overturning a decision by its executive committee, the Greater Ventura Chamber 
of Commerce's board of directors voted Wednesday to reinstate popular veteran 
chamber director Jim Barroca -- at least until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really great, exhilarating experience to hear that," Barroca said 
after learning of the board's unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber's nine-person executive committee announced Barroca's firing 
Thursday. But after a holiday weekend marked by outrage over the abrupt 
dismissal, the full board of directors devoted their entire July meeting to the 
matter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-member board debated behind closed doors for more than two hours before 
finally announcing that Barroca, who turned 61 last Saturday, may stay until 
his next birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, chamber officials hope to hire a new director whom Barroca 
will train. 
</P>
<P>
 Barroca, who learned of his reinstatement after returning to work Wednesday 
evening to prepare a chamber agenda, said he considers the move a second 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I've really got to prove myself," he said. He said he had been at a local 
eatery drowning his sorrows with a couple of margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barroca began working for the chamber nearly 23 years ago, and over time has 
earned the deep trust and admiration of many of the organization's 1,400 
members. Local business owners describe him as a hands-on, supportive 
administrator who never fails to go to bat for the little guy. 
</P>
<P>
 But many also agree that after nearly a quarter century at the helm, it is 
time for new blood at the chamber. What they objected to, they say, was the 
executive committee's awkward, heavy-handed way of handling the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's gotta go, he's gotta go," said gas station owner Kevin Corse. "That's 
OK. But don't do this to him."  
</P>
<P>
 The chamber's executive committee wanted someone more dynamic and progressive, 
someone with an aggressive vision for Ventura's future, Councilwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a fresh, new start," said Measures, the city's liaison to 
the chamber. "The chamber was looking for a proactive person who will bring new 
ideas to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Executive committee members have been generally closemouthed on their 
reasoning, but in announcing Barroca's reinstatement Wednesday, chamber 
President Bob Alviani said it is time for the chamber to go in a different 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Change would be healthy," he said, "but it should be a smooth transition." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson the directors learned from this incident, he said, is that they 
need to be more involved in the workings of the chamber and not leave details 
up to the executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber's attempt to move in another direction was the latest in a series 
of changes in key jobs around the city. In the name of economic vitality and 
increased tourism, the City Council recently hired an economic development 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The local tourism bureau just hired a new director from Pismo Beach, and the 
council has recently launched a search for a new city manager. Former City 
Manager John Baker, disparaged by some local shopkeepers as anti-business, left 
City Hall last week to start his own consulting business. 
</P>
<P>
 However, just as change has become a Ventura buzzword, some old-timers in town 
wonder just how much Ventura should try to transform itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's stop and think -- how sophisticated is the city of Ventura?" said Ed 
Warren, owner of Smokey's Saloon and Dining Hall downtown, about the initial 
Barroca decision. "We may be out of our league, trying to get somebody more 
sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, said Councilman Gregory L. Carson, a tourism booster who is leading 
the charge to revamp the city's aging downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That mentality is exactly the reason I'm involved at the level I'm at," he 
said. "Change is a difficult thing to go through. But I think we need a lot of 
change."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: STALLED ON THE ON-RAMP TO THE ROAD TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Since the Middle Ages, colleges and universities have been centers of 
intellectual life. And while there are many who might argue the value of 
education for education's sake, institutions of higher learning have also had a 
more practical reason for being: To make it easier for those who attend them to 
get work. Graduates have long assumed that the years spent locked in 
education's ivory towers or roaming its hallowed halls should earn them 
first-class accommodations on the road to success. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that long ago, they would have been right. A couple of generations back, a 
college degree almost guaranteed a plum job. Even 20 years ago, many of us -- 
on campuses witnessing the end of a war and the start of a sexual and social 
revolution -- felt that graduation was a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 To many of today's grads, it now seems like an end. 
</P>
<P>
 For this week's Centerpiece, staff writer Pancho Doll talked to nine recent 
graduates of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks to find out about 
their job prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Doll was sympathetic to the plight of these grads, none of whom had found 
full-time employment as of publication of this section. Doll himself finished 
school in 1986 and found that his job prospects were rather bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just graduated from the University of Missouri and moved to San 
Francisco, just because," he said. "I went to a placement agency and much to my 
chagrin, found there were no jobs for aspiring novelists. Instead, I ended up 
with what was probably the most mind-numbing temp job ever ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gulf Oil had been bought out by some other company, or maybe it was the other 
way around, but anyway, the personnel files had to be merged and in order to 
determine which folders came from what company, the Gulf employees needed to 
have an adhesive label with a purple G attached to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The file room occupied half a floor in a high rise building and for eight 
hours a day I worked my way down a row of file cabinets seven feet high, 
pulling out one folder after another, affixing labels." 
</P>
<P>
 Have no fear, things did improve for the struggling writer, who eventually 
landed a job in his field, though it got him no closer to the swells on Russian 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first newspaper job paid $5.75 an hour," he said. "After 4 1/2 years of 
college, I was earning less money than many of the migrant laborers I was 
covering." 
</P>
<P>
 While some recent graduates were stalled on the on-ramp to working life, 11 
young debutantes were sailing into society at the 37th Las Patronas 
Presentation Ball, which you can read about in Leonard Reed's On the Road 
column. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those of you who are already gainfully employed and secure in, or at 
least resigned to, your place in society, there are plenty of ways this weekend 
to socialize with friends while spending your hard-earned money. Check out our 
11-day calendar for details.

NIGHT LIFE: ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY; THE ORDINAIRES MOSTLY PERFORM COVER SONGS, 
BUT THEY SELECT THE GOOD STUFF AND GIVE IT THEIR OWN TWIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The name Ordinaires is a pun derived from The King's back-up band, the 
Jordanaires. But the Ordinaires are just two guys, neither of whom is Elvis, 
nor are they ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Fishell and Steve White, in fact, will be making extraordinary music 
every Thursday night this month at Jolly's in Oxnard. Affordable to kings and 
transients alike, there is no cover charge at Jolly's. 
</P>
<P>
 White and Fishell are probably best known as members of the Convertibles, but 
they've had plenty of other musical aliases as well, including the Bar Stool 
Pigeons, Blind Egg White & the Poachers, and some groups that didn't last long 
enough to get names. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known each other since we were kids," said White. "He went to Hueneme 
High and I went to Oxnard High, but we had mutual friends. We used to argue a 
lot about music, still do. We play about three or four times a week, either out 
or at home, and at least once a week with the Ordinaires." 
</P>
<P>
 As a duo, it's easy to get gigs, easier to carry the gear around and easiest 
to split the loot at the end of the night. One might infer that a duo also 
produces a stripped down, low-budget sound. One would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 For two guys, they make a lot of money because they have friends, most of whom 
are machines: Suffice to say that the machines are electric and mysterious, but 
from the prerecorded tracks comes a drummer, a bass player, bird calls, all 
sorts of stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, ya just gotta hear it," said Fishell, getting to the gist of the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The living, breathing portion of the show includes Fishell shredding on guitar 
and White on everything else, including keyboards, harmonica, sax, flute, 
guitar. Plus, White sings better than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we're a bar band, we'll play almost anything," said Fishell. "So far, 
we've managed to resist 'Stairway to Heaven,' but we'll play 'Happy Birthday.' 
We don't have a set list. We know all the Convertibles' songs plus plenty of 
others. Steve gets the Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, and all the soul stuff. He's 
the best. I get the Bob Dylan songs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ordinaires do mostly cover songs, but they select the good stuff and then 
give it their own twist. The Ordinaires also do Elvis and B.B. King. The 
Temptations' classic "Just My Imagination," with the help of the machines, 
becomes a very cool reggae song featuring a flute solo by White. 
</P>
<P>
 In the daytime, Fishell keeps on picking. He's a guitar teacher with a lot of 
customers and some noted alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got somewhere between 20 and 30 students. It's a great way to learn all 
the Metallica songs," Fishell said. "Scott Morris from Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was 
one of my students. He's so good that he teaches now. I taught Tim Anderson 
from J.D.'s Last Ride, and Bill Coffey of the Mudheads, but he was always more 
of a singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I even used to teach Darren Cruz from the Ska Daddyz when he was just a 
little kid. I have this guy right now named Hans who is going to be great. He's 
only 18 and he's never even been in a band." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I've gotta keep my day job to pay for my daughter's lessons," added 
White. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, I give you a deal," said Fishell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ordinaires for free? Such a deal. Details

<P>
 * WHAT: The Ordinaires.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: RHYTHM RANGERS WILL HEADLINE PIER CONCERTS; ONE OF THE AREA'S 
HARDEST-WORKING BANDS HAS NOT HAD A PERSONNEL CHANGE IN FOUR YEARS. THE RESULT 
IS TIGHT, SEASONED MUSICIANSHIP. 
</P>

 To beat the heat and enjoy some great free country music this weekend, head to 
the beach. The Ventura Pier Summer Concert Series, featuring live music each 
weekend through Sept. 3, kicks off Saturday with music by Bill McIllwain from 
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on the pier, and a performance by the Geary Hanley band from 
2 to 5 p.m. on the Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, you can catch the duo Sibling Rivalry on the pier from 1 to 4 p.m. And 
the Rhythm Rangers headline the event noon to 3 p.m. on the Promenade. Both 
days will also feature line dance demo groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rhythm Rangers have earned a reputation for their variety. And with 24 
gigs this month, including three in one day, it is arguably the hardest-working 
band in the area. But given the range of their haunts, it's surprising they're 
not schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Going on the trail with the Rhythm Rangers would take you to a range of 
venues, from rustic hangouts like the Deer Lodge and Maxie's to family-oriented 
community center dances, from Conejo Valley Days to country weddings and 
fund-raisers, from the posh Ojai Valley Inn and Westlake Yacht Club to such 
hotels as the Doubletree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we augment with Randy Covington on pedal steel in certain venues, we 
haven't had a personnel change in four years," said Michael J. Smith, guitarist 
and band leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is tight, seasoned musicianship. "There's a great mix of talent and 
experience," drummer Louie Nilsen said. "But the bottom line is that we have 
fun -- we don't take ourselves too seriously. If you're not enjoying it, man, 
forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the fellas do take their audience seriously. And the result pays 
off in a range of fans from bikers to bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I like about seeing the Rhythm Rangers at any event is 
their variety. No matter what they've been hired to do -- rock 'n' roll, rhythm 
and blues or country -- they play the music so well that it sounds like that's 
all they've ever done," KHAY radio deejay Charlye Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd heard them at country events and I loved their country music. Then I was 
invited to the Seabee Ball, where they were all dressed up. And I told them I 
wasn't used to seeing them in a country club setting. Mike joked, 'We can do 
these fancy deals because we're probably the only band in town that owns their 
own tuxedos.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it takes more than tuxedos and bolo ties to make a band. These guys have 
paid their dues in other bands and on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not country wanna-bes riding the Urban Cowboy II wave of the past 
couple years," Smith said. "I personally have been doing country music since 
the early '80s. And we're rooted in that sound. Even though we seem to be 
changing hats in certain venues, it's all the same hat -- American roots music, 
country, rock 'n' roll and R & B." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, because of the recent success of country and R & B pairings, they 
were invited to open for the Temptations at the California Strawberry Festival 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I like about the Rhythm Rangers is the way classic oldies they've 
adapted sound brand new," Parker said. "And their original songs are not only 
very good but very danceable. Alan (Drettler) and Louie do something with the 
beat that makes it totally their signature sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and lead guitarist Craig Newton share lead vocals and write the band's 
original songs, some of which -- "The Dancer," "Alaska Boogie" and "Wheels" -- 
are their most requested tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 And they recently debuted "Line Dance Romance," a clever boy-meets-girl tune 
with a good electric slide beat and a hook about that sweet body heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have their own style," Parker said. "Listening to the Rhythm Rangers do 
Rhythm Rangers' original material is spending time in musical heaven." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Rhythm Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura Pier Summer Concert Series, Ventura Beach Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Noon to 3 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: Free. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: Upcoming performances: tonight, the Palms, Carpinteria; Friday, 
Maxie's in Oak View; Saturday, family dance at Camarillo Recreation Center; 
July 11, 18 and 25, the Borderline in Thousand Oaks; July 14, 21 and 28, City 
Line Club, Santa Barbara; July 15, 16, 29 and 30, Starting Gate in Ventura; 
July 22 and 23, Frontier Club in Santa Paula; July 24, Crazy Bull in Camarillo.

SIGHTS; BOLD PAINTINGS GIVE FORM TO ABSTRACTION; REYNA CASTANO'S WORKS AT 
CONEJO ART MUSEUM ARE REFLECTIVE BUT GREGARIOUS. COLORS CONVEY DIFFERING 
INTENSITIES OF LIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her bright, boldly realized paintings, Mexican artist Reyna Castano 
creates a vivid visual world. In it, bristling energy merges with -- and 
sometimes scrapes against -- a kind of meditative buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 Castano's ample show at the Conejo Art Museum in Thousand Oaks reveals an 
aesthetic that is surprisingly mature for a 30-year-old artist. But then, her 
studies did include dance and architecture, and influences of both disciplines 
are evident in her work. 
</P>
<P>
 If Castano's byword is abstraction, the results are anything but cerebral or 
rarefied. These paintings are reflective but also gregarious, highly textured 
-- sometimes rough and tactile, like stucco -- and, in the end, easy to love. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is an abstract language, with converging colors and forms bathed in 
different intensities of light, which relate ambiguously to landscape and the 
figure. Lines dissect shapes that float on cloudy washes of color. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, representational interpretations are invited. Is that a 
cubist-altered canine in "Expectation"? The title of "Fruit Bowl" gives us some 
way of understanding the splashes of bright red and gold-leafed gaudiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior states of unrest are manifested in such works as "The Wound," with 
its blood drips amid murky greens and blacks, or in "Prognosis of the Storm." 
The large, horizontal piece taking up one wall, "Axioma V." is about the 
tension between opposing forces -- sedimental activity framing, almost choking, 
a central red outburst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juegos de Astucia" is laid out as a rectangular grid pattern, drawn with a 
rough, hands-on simplicity. Variations in texture and density of paint give it 
a nearly topographical surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrasting with her other, more clearly resolved images, "Sentimientos 
Ocultos" is scruffier, with forms and relationships left unfinished. To good 
effect, Castano here shows a more assertive, jagged-edged attack on the canvas, 
with fervid swipes of paint instead of carefully built-up composite images. 
</P>
<P>
 Art history enters into Castano's pictorial sense -- specifically modes of 
painting from the American abstract Expressionist school, and strains in Latin 
American art. That the work looks like something from the pre-Conceptual, 
pre-Pop, pre-Minimal days of the '50s is refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see in her work shades of abstract Expressionist Arshille Gorky's 
quasi-organic blobs, especially in "The Fury." Cubist ideas of planar 
redistribution are in full force here. But these art world links are tempered 
by an appealing earthiness that suggests a kind of happy marriage of visceral 
painting-for-painting's-sake with a more academic awareness of precedents. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something gently mystical in her art. Castano manages to find a path 
between extroversion and introspection, exploring the visual-metaphorical 
friction between color and form. And, to boot, she's found a look worth looking 
at. THERAPEUTIC AVENUES 
</P>
<P>
 During the last week of June, visitors to the Camarillo State Hospital were 
treated to the annual display of work from the Art Therapy program. As usual, 
the event revealed the kind of work, at once innocent and turbulent, that has 
made this show one of the unusual highlights of the county's art scene. 
</P>
<P>
 These exhibitions invariably offer the viewer an enlightening glimpse into 
aesthetic expressions from alternative points of view. They also demonstrate, 
by example, the virtues of the therapy program here. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's show -- which included work from the Camarillo Hospital as 
well as other mental health services around the county -- was less exclusive an 
opportunity than before, thanks to the recent opening of the Art Life Gallery. 
This regular gallery space, in the heart of the hospital in Unit 16, provides a 
continuing venue and public interface for the patient-artists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent annual show, which closed July 2, common themes emerged as in 
years past. Artists are identified by first names to protect privacy. Abstract 
paintings, mostly of the drip-and-splatter school, lived happily alongside 
cartoon figures (including Robert S.'s Elmer Fudd and Paul B.'s Bart Simpson), 
hearts and religious imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick's "Sweepstake Winner" depicts an automobile, proudly gleaming, viewed 
as an object of almost religious significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more striking work stemmed from bold simplicity. Gidget M.'s 
"Green in the Night" finds an amorphous animal figure swimming in sinister 
blackness, and Noah T.'s "In the Pink" finds a vague face-like form, pink and 
blue, swirling in chocolate brown: It's a face in the ooze. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers might see the abstract works here as Rorschach results, signifying 
deeper-set psychological conditions. A.T.P. has gone straight to the source 
with his own "Rorschach" blot. To these eyes, it looks like a menacing, 
conniving feline from the cartoon domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural forces rendered symbolic and haunting seem to be at the root of Chris 
R.'s "Black Hole Blaze" -- a dichotomy of raging fire and a mysterious vacuum. 
Connie's "Dark Rainbow" is just that: terraced bands of color on the darkest 
end of the spectrum, rather than the typical radiance associated with a 
rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, on campier terrain, there is Martin P.'s "Country Singers," a C&W 
fan's sketchbook of portraits of his favorite singers -- Jim Reeves, Faron 
Young, Buck Owens -- all looking roughly the same, with the same dreamy look in

 What makes much of this art so fascinating is freshness of perspective, a rare 
thing in this age of info overload and homogeneity of experience. These images 
seem to come from out of the blue, while also floating in an ether of uncommon 
sincerity. Details

THEATER REVIEW; RELAX FOR A SPELL WITH A 'MIDSUMMER' TREAT; START BRUSHING UP 
ON SHAKESPEARE WITH A PRODUCTION THAT IS ENTERTAINING, IMAGINATIVE AND 
ACCESSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Embarking on a series of planned admission-free productions, Simi Valley's 
A.R.T.S. theater company is currently presenting that old reliable, "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 If you, or your children, have never seen Shakespeare performed live, this is 
a terrific start. Not only is the show broadly funny and relatively easy to 
follow, this production is notably brief -- less than two hours, including 
intermission. So, while the very young probably won't appreciate it, nobody 
else is likely to get especially antsy. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the play, remember, in which fairy king Oberon persuades the imp Puck 
to cast a spell in which Oberon's wife, Titania, falls in love with the first 
person she sees upon awakening. That turns out to be Bottom, a low-born actor 
whom Puck has given the head of a donkey. Puck also gives a dose of the magic 
potion to two young men, Lysander and Demetrius, causing them to lust after 
each other's fiancees, much to the women's confusion and distress. High-jinks 
ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is imaginatively directed by Irene Silbert, and, for the most part, 
the acting ranges from adequate to quite good. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the breadth and depth of the Simi Valley talent pool (or so indecisive 
is the director) that several parts here have been double- or triple-cast, so 
who plays what varies from night to night. Don't count on the printed program 
to indicate who's appearing as whom at a given performance. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Toni Beery, who gave a characteristically (for her) dizzy spin 
to distressed and confused young lover Helena during the opening weekend, is 
off to study drama in London. Henceforth, the part will be played by Janeece 
Flint. Of the three actresses listed as alternates for Amazon queen Hippolyta, 
none played the part at Friday's opening. Instead, she was played without 
announcement by Shelly Mazer, who on other nights is scheduled to double other 
roles. With so many actors looking for something to do, director Silbert has 
nevertheless cast herself in the (male) role of Quince, leader of the troupe of 
actors, evidently alternating in the role with Hallie Kemper. 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's performance, the wandering actors were played with great flair by 
Silbert, Lee Altmar, Philippe Fanjeaud, Joel Uyeda and Ron Rosen, who may or 
not be in those parts when you see the show. Andre Hotchko and Geoffrey Murtch 
played Lysander and Demetrius, James Egan and Jan Glasband were Oberon and 
Titania, and Puck was an assured performance by 13-year-old Jenny Cariker. All 
are scheduled to continue in those roles throughout the run, and there's a 
large and rather unwieldy chorus of youthful fairies. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion among players notwithstanding, the audience should have a good 
time at this highly recommended show. And if you don't like it, you can always 
ask for your money back. 
</P>
<P>
 (A.R.T.S., incidentally, stands for Actors' Repertory Theatre of Simi, though 
we suspect that they devised the acronym and then came up with something for it 
to stand for.) Details 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8 and Sunday at 7 through July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center, 3190 Cochran Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Free, first-come, first-served 
</P>
<P>

CENTERPIECE: 9 DEGREES OF FRUSTRATION; NEW COLLEGE GRADUATES TRY TO WORK IT OUT 
AMID BLEAK JOB PROSPECTS. EXPECTATIONS ARE LOWERED, AND PART-TIME; AND TEMP 
POSITIONS ARE FACTS OF LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 After taking the last exam of her college career, Kendra Pfenning couldn't 
decide if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders, or an even heavier one 
had settled there. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pfenning and the three women she shared a suite with at California 
Lutheran University, the month leading up to graduation was a blur of activity: 
finals, term papers, student government duties, recitals, packing. The four 
were so busy they had to tape episodes of "Melrose Place" and "Beverly Hills 
90210" to watch later. 
</P>
<P>
 During a rare pause, one roommate, Staci Stouch, previewed the postgraduate 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't have a place to live. I won't have a job. I'll be $24,000 in debt, 
and my parents are anxious to get me out of their pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than a month after graduation, those four women and a similar group 
of male roommates -- three of whom graduated last year -- are still coming to 
terms with the demands of being independent adults -- principally, finding 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 These nine young adults -- three of whom are the children of Lutheran pastors 
-- all come from middle-class backgrounds, and all attended a private, 
religious university. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a group, they are representative of that rather hefty segment of the 
recent college graduate population that is looking for work and meeting with 
little success. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the nine has secured permanent, full-time employment. And the three 
who are roommates from previous academic terms have been in the job market for 
a full year. 
</P>
<P>
 How an ex -- roommate is doing is arguably the clearest gauge of the economy 
for many young adults. Newly minted baccalaureates may not be able to cite the 
latest Labor Department statistics, but they definitely know whether former 
roomies are festering in retail sales or knocking 'em dead at in R & D at a 
corporation. UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Biermann, 23, of Simi Valley graduated last summer. He got married and 
moved to the Seattle area, where he and his wife now live with their baby boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the pressure of the job market even more now that I have a little 
kid," Biermann said. "I don't dwell on it, but I definitely feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 He landed a temporary job at Microsoft, and since February he's been shuffling 
through assignments in the licensing department at the Redmond, Wash., software 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something I would want to do for any length of time," he said. "I 
was aiming for marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 As a temp, Beirmann's identification badge is a different color than those of 
permanent employees, the self-described "microserfs." But the main difference 
comes when paychecks are opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Microserfs get full salary and stock options; Biermann gets a check from which 
a substantial portion of the money for his position has been paid to the agency 
that placed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though it's better to raise a family here, I've thought of returning to 
(Southern California)," he said. "I'm more connected down there. I have lots of 
friends already in the working world." KEEPING THE FAITH 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is Steve Foster, who shared a room with Biermann during their 
school years. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster is a pastor's son, looking bright and earnest from the top of his 
close-cropped hair to the freshly laundered cotton laces in his deck shoes. He 
used his biology degree to land a three-month paid internship with Amgen, the 
Fortune 500 biotech firm in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 He's hopeful of landing a permanent job, since Amgen frequently hires CLU 
biology graduates. If not, he has resumes in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother-in-law does a lot of work in personnel," Foster said. "I sent him 
my resume for a critique. The first thing he told me to do was take my 
grade-point average off. I graduated with a 3.61, and I worked hard for it. But 
I guess it's like high school. Once you get into college, how you did in high 
school doesn't mean a thing. Once you get into the work force, nobody cares how 
you did in college." THANKS, BUT NO THANKS 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen was not the answer for Stouch, a 23-year-old communication arts major. 
She was the runner-up for a job in the company's public relations department. 
</P>
<P>
 She's been replaying the interview in her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a stewardess in the blue suit and heels," she said. "The heels 
were a really dumb idea because I got nervous and wobbly." 
</P>
<P>
 She now lives at home in Lancaster while looking for work in Ventura County, 
where she can be closer to her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother has told her it may take until September to find a job, a prospect 
that is hardly reassuring to Stouch. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, three or even six months is not an unusually long job search, according 
to career placement counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring of college graduates has picked up, according to the College Employment 
Research Institute at Michigan State University in East Lansing. But the gain 
was just 1%, hardly noticeable, given that hiring declined 30% from the high in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are really launching careers through contract, part-time and temp 
employment rather than entering as permanent hires," said Vernicka Tyson, 
director of the institute. "It's taking longer for them to get connected." 
MAKING SACRIFICES 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Murray, credits her internship at KADY television for landing her a 
part-time job at the station. A communication arts major from Newbury Park, 
Murray works 25 hours as a technician producing the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 When she took the internship, she wondered whether the sacrifices she made, 
like working Friday nights, would impress the managers enough to win her a paid 
job after graduation, or if she would be just another waitress with a college 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Both prospects turned out to be true. Since the job at KADY pays less than $6 
an hour, Murray has to keep serving up meatloaf and chicken-fried steak while 
she lives at home to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to keep waiting tables," she said, "if I want to move out on my own 
in the fall." RISE & SHINE 
</P>
<P>
 After all, what good is a job if it doesn't provide independence. Lack of 
autonomy is something Pfenning feels resoundingly at 9 a.m. every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to sleep late, but my dad, he's the rooster in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 She explained that her bed is up against an interior wall and at 9 a.m. her 
dad, all 6 feet 3 inches, 230 pounds of him, bangs on the wall just above her 
head to wake her up. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfenning told her friends she's anxious to find a job in Southern California, 
if not Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would almost be easier to stay in school and just have to worry about 
grades and exams," she said. CAREER STUDENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, throughout the recession, the number of people seeking higher 
education has risen. The Council of Graduate Schools reports that applications 
increased at an average of 7% per year. 
</P>
<P>
 One man and one woman in our group of nine graduates will be continuing their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's roommate, Sean Kelly, a 22-year-old voice major from Diamond Bar, 
will go on to graduate school in Minnesota to study music and divinity with the 
aim of becoming either a choir director or a Lutheran minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Downs, an international business major, will study for a year in Europe, 
funded by a scholarship from the Rotary Club. Before she leaves, she's spending 
the summer in Thousand Oaks, where she shares an apartment with Craig Kuehne. 
STRICTLY LOW-BUDGET 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne shared a room last year with Biermann and another '93 graduate named 
Mark McCracken. So far opportunities have been slow to develop for McCracken 
and Kuehne, both of whom want to make feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 Both delayed the career search after graduation. McCracken manned a steam 
table for a caterer. Kuehne worked as a sales clerk for Blockbuster Video 
before he quit over "creative differences." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great loss," he said sardonically. "I was earning $4.25, and just 
before I quit, I was set for a raise. I could have gotten as much as 12 cents 
more per hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Both are now working on a film project tentatively called "The Aimless 
Avenger," which McCracken describes as a martial 
arts-action-adventure-comedy-love story with a heart. 
</P>
<P>
 McCracken stars as the Avenger. Kuehne directs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the first American martial artist since Bruce Lee who can act," McCracken 
declared, "and I want to bring a different type of martial arts action movie to 
this country. I mean, there's so many bad martial arts films, I have to think 
mine has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehne is betting on it. 
</P>
<P>
 All the production equipment for "Aimless" -- a digital video mixer, two VHS 
stereo tape decks, a super-VHS deck, camera and mount and a Macintosh computer 
for the sound effects -- Kuehne purchased on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I now have five credit cards," Kuehne said with a nervous laugh. "They just 
keep sending them to me." 
</P>
<P>
 A few low-budget films from new, young directors have been produced this way, 
but it's hardly a front door into The Business. Nevertheless, McCracken is 
planning his long-term strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I make it, I'm going to move back to Colorado and work from 
there," he said. "I mean Coppola doesn't live in Hollywood, does he?" 
</P>
<P>
 For all his enthusiasm, he recognizes that "Aimless" might not take off and 
that even if the dream of making feature films dies, he'll still have car 
payments to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "Domino's is the only job I've ever left where I was on good terms," he said. 
"I can always go back to delivering pizzas." Real Life, 101

 The literary toilers of Ventura County have once again made their presence 
felt at the internationally renowned annual Santa Barbara Writers Conference, 
held each June. Collectively, over the years, they have accumulated too many 
awards to list. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Bill Spellman of Ojai brought home a science fiction award from the 
conference at the Miramar Hotel. The Venturans have also found agents, 
publishers and romance at the conference. Kitty Dill met Gordon Durich, a 
writer from Australia. They returned as a married couple. We are a particularly 
fortunate writing community to have a local conference that attracts the best 
and the brightest from all over the world.

 My son, the marine archeologist who can stuff everything he owns into a 
backpack, has begged us for years to "minimalize." It's a splendid idea, one 
that most of us never address. But after you hear Elaine St. James, author of 
"Simplify Your Life," describe 100 ways to slow down and enjoy things that 
really matter, you will give this serious thought, particularly rat-pack 
writers. One of the suggestions in the book published by Hyperion is to get rid 
of indoor plants and animals. I have been staring at my three mangy plants, 
willing their final demise and, since a huge white heron ate all the goldfish 
in our pond, we are well on the way to simplification. St. James will talk at 
7:30 p.m. Tuesday to Ventura County Writers Club members and guests on "Finding 
More Time to Write," Ottavio's Banquet Facilities, 340 Mobil Ave., Camarillo. 
There is a $5 fee to guests. Call 482-5648.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; DISCOUNTERS PUT MORE FILMGOERS IN THE PICTURE; 
VENUES SUCH AS AMERICAN FAMILY THEATRES IN OXNARD LURE THOSE WHO SAVE MONEY BY 
WAITING TO SEE A FILM.

 Call them the Wal-Mart of movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Discount movie houses such as American Family Theatres, which is celebrating 
its first anniversary at The Esplanade mall in Oxnard, are doing a brisk 
business from dollar-conscious filmgoers willing to postpone their trip to the 
theater until a few months after a film is released. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater co-owner Tom Brand said studios are responsible for setting the ticket 
price on first-run films, but after a picture has been out for a month or two, 
the distributor will let theaters show it for a reduced price. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of a discount theater has been around forever," Brand said. "The old 
discount theater was 99 cents, had a single screen and was kind of a dump. It 
was a picture's last stop before condemnation. What's changed in the discount 
world is the facility. We try to provide a nice movie experience, one that's as 
comfortable as theaters where you spend $7." 
</P>
<P>
 The standard ticket price for American Family is $2 and Brand reports that the 
theater is making money on that. American Family, owners of 16 screens in 
Southern California, has increased its holdings by 50% this year and Brand 
projects 50% growth next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has responded to the concept. Obviously there's a niche we're 
filling." 
</P>
<P>
 Discounting seems to be a trend, according to a study by the National Assn. of 
Theater Owners and the Motion Picture Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey -- based on a poll of theater owners representing more than half the 
screens in the United States -- found that the average ticket price last year 
was $4.14, down from $5.15 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 American has another strategy to distinguish itself from other Theaters, said 
co-owner Jay Brand, Tom's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't bring hard R in. We try to limit to family entertainment rather than 
the kick-ass, exploitative sort of (junk)," said Jay Brand. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Stone appeared only briefly on American Family screens in "Fatal 
Instinct," Jay Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watch more carefully now. "Beverly Hills Cop" is acceptable, even though 
the language was a bit tough. Freddy Krueger wouldn't make it on our screens." 
</P>
<P>
 It's ironic that Brand should mention the movie about the famous haunting on 
Elm Street since his theater is itself rumored to be haunted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's historian of the paranormal, Richard Senate, said former 
employees of the theater have told him of menacing shadows late at night and of 
chill winds that blow through the projection room. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter began after a gang-related homicide at the theater in 1979 
associated with a screening of the movie "The Warriors." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brand said he was unaware of the incident and expressed surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really? Wow, I guess I won't go there alone."

ROCK TALK; DANCING UNDER THE STARS; THE GIPSY KINGS, THE GROUP FROM FRANCE THAT 
SINGS IN SPANISH, OFFER THEIR GUITAR MAGIC AT THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY BOWL. 
</P>

 Get your dancing shoes ready, because as strange as it may seem, those mellow 
Gipsy Kings figure to put on a dance show under the stars at the Santa Barbara 
County Bowl. According to their bio, the band won't be happy unless you're 
dancing. There probably won't be a mosh pit going, just proper yuppies dancing 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to know more? Don't feel alone. After two days, the management at last 
set a time for an interview and, of course, never called back. For all the 
money this band is making -- tickets to this gig are $35 -- one would think 
someone on the tour could afford a watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently something was lost in the translation, which is understandable 
because the band lives in the South of France, speaks French but sings in 
Spanish. Translators are necessary for interviews, if and when they ever take 
place. At least the local fans won't have to endure that interminable "Howzit 
goin' Santa Barbara?" routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gipsy Kings may be short of spellers, but they are long on relatives who 
can play guitar. All sons or cousins of the late flamenco great Jose Reyes, the 
band members will doubtlessly be playing selections off the band's sixth and 
latest album, "Love & Liberte." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And in the It-Must-Be-Summer-Department: There's going to be a booze cruise 
going out of Santa Barbara at the end of the month. That's where bands play 
loud music and fans try to hold down all that beer while they drink and dance 
at the same time, even as the boat itself rocks and rolls. Appropriately called 
"Boozacarooza," this one will feature a bunch of S.B. bands including Creature 
Feature, Popsicko, Silverjet, Bigelf and Scarecrow. The Condor will become the 
Titanic for the night. The capacity is only 100, so call 682-2403 if you're 
into a sea cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Even-Art-Department: Art's Bar is an unpretentious little watering 
hole on De La Vina Street, voted "Most Popular Neighborhood Bar" year after 
year in the Santa Barbara press. There may not be a Farmer John, an Aunt Jemima 
or a Sara Lee, but there's an Art. Boy, is there. Not so much like Rick of 
"Casablanca" or Sam from "Cheers," Art Lopez is more like Jack Nicholson in 
"Wolf." Art is shorter, but his roar is similar. At Art's, there's no Plan B -- 
it's his way or the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Art's Bar, which never has a cover, does have live music, usually three days a 
week, and usually blues since Art bought the joint and renamed the Wimbledon 
Tavern after himself in 1984. But lately, Art has been getting the blues from 
the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, nobody comes to see these blues bands anymore," growled Art. "No fans 
means no money and money is the name of the game. So I've started booking rock 
bands. I don't like a lot of it -- too loud -- but they have fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Art's new repertoire includes the Hell Hounds, Jellin, Bob Angst , 
Strange Brew plus a couple of Ventura County rock bands, Finnhead out of Oxnard 
and Sinister Fisch from Ventura. Even one of Art's old favorites, those rockin' 
blues dudes in the Crawdads, are on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told those guys I'd give 'em one more chance or else. They better quit 
playing that blues junk and change to rock." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad for the upcoming July 24 Yes show at the Santa Barbara County Bowl 
notes "This Event Features Special Audio Enhancement." Does this mean they're 
going to hook you up to electrodes then plug you into the soundboard so your 
liver quivers along with the bass? Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bowl spokesman Jamie Boller, "You will be allowed into a special 
section behind the soundboard to get the really good sound. You should bring a 
Walkman, then tune it to a certain frequency to get the ultimate sound. The 
only other time I've heard of this before is on last year's Metallica tour. 
It's a first for us. There are still seats available for this section at $29.50 
while the high dollar seats are $31.50." 
</P>
<P>
 Now isn't this sort of like all the football fans who go to the big game and 
end up watching the game on the stadium big screen? It would be more convenient 
if Yes just came over, cooked dinner, did a set on the deck and then did the 
dishes. 
</P>

 A benign Orange County invasion will be coming to the Beach Shack in Santa 
Barbara on July 15. It won't be a line of bulldozers and cement trucks coming 
to build shopping malls, but a tour featuring a quartet of OC bands, 
collectively called "Out From Behind the Orange Curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 On the bill will be Standing Hawthorne, Strange, Soul Scream and that R&B, 
funk band with already quite the S.B. following, Goldfish.

GOINGS ON; THEATER GROUP CLOSES SEASON, LOOKS TO FUTURE; AMID HOPEFUL INTERNAL 
CHANGES, THE SANTA BARBARA ENSEMBLE FINISHES WITH PERFORMANCES OF 'WHAT THE 
BUTLER SAW.'

 As the Santa Barbara Ensemble Theatre Company closes the door on its 1993-1994 
season with a production of Joe Orton's "What the Butler Saw," beginning 
tonight, it may very well be opening up the gate to its future. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has a new managing director, Patricia Baldwin, who most recently 
worked with the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater of New York, and an entirely new 
12-member board of directors. This is the team that will lead the theater group 
into its 15th season next October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Theater has gone through a financial struggle the last few years, and 
we're just coming out of it," said Christopher Vore, a regular lead actor with 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Vore said the new board members want to "support the artistic vision of the 
artistic director and create a solid foundation for the theater to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 As for now the company's newest production -- which centers around Dr. 
Prentice, a high society psychiatrist who occupies his time seducing women -- 
will run through Aug. 14 at the Alhecama Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty wild and zany farce. It's a typical, classic farce in a way, 
but sort of a set-up for undermining all sorts of other things. It really takes 
a stab at the Establishment," said Vore, who plays the role of Dr. Rance, a 
Government Institutions inspector. "What starts out as a simple sort of 
seduction turns out to be a nightmare for Dr. Prentice." 
</P>
<P>
 Show times are Wednesday through Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sundays July 17 and Aug. 
7 at 2 p.m.; and Sundays July 10, 17, 24, 31 and Aug. 14 at 7 p.m. General 
admission ranges from $14 to $19. Call 962-8606. The theater is located at 914 
Santa Barbara St. 
</P>

</P>
<P>

through July 17 for the 75th anniversary Santa Barbara National Horse Show. 
Daily hours are 8 a.m. to about 10 p.m. General admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 The first part of the show will be dedicated to saddle horses, harness ponies,

will include a Royal Lipizzaner Stallion presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Part two of the horse show will focus on the hunter-jumper division. Evening 
shows July 14 to 16 will begin at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandstand admission to all evening shows is free, box seats are $8 (adults), 
$5 (children). Call 687-8711.

 Santa Barbara's New Vic Theater has a new home for its film screenings -- the 
Lobero Theatre. And the housewarming party is tonight. This evening of 
celebration will begin with a grand reopening reception at the Old Towne Cafe, 
in the historic El Paseo complex, from 6 to 7:30 p.m. There will be live music 
and hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
 From there it's on to the Lobero, where the former Victoria Street Theater 
group will open its summer film series with an 8 p.m. showing of "High 
Lonesome." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie will be repeated Saturday and Sunday at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., with an 
additional 5 p.m. showing on Sunday. Tickets are $6 adults, $4 seniors and 
children. Call 963-0761 for tickets and information. The Lobero is located at 
33 E. Canon Perdido St. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Turning back the clock, the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation and 
the Santa Barbara Shakespeare Festival will team up to stage "Merchant of 
Venice" Sunday at the Casa de la Guerra adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Show time is 2 p.m. General admission, which includes a post-performance 
reception, is $30. Call 965-0093. The adobe is located at 17 E. De la Guerra 
St. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 More than 60 floral displays and "living sculptures" will be on display this 
weekend at the third annual "Art in Full Bloom" exhibit at the Santa Barbara 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of related museum events opens with the gala preview party from 6 
to 9 p.m. Friday. Guests can view the floral art while dining on a buffet 
supper prepared by the Wine Cask. Tickets are $75. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Saturday and Sunday, the work will be on display to the general public 
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. There will also be a series of lectures and video 
presentations on the art of floral design. Admission to the museum is $5 
general, $1 for children under age 12. Lectures are $10 each, which includes 
the admission charge. For more information call 963-4364, ext. 325. The museum 
is located at 1130 State St.

ON THE ROAD: CURTSY TO HIGH SOCIETY IS VIEWED IN NEW LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Melanie Ann Chieu, in flowing white gown, walks in measured steps along the 
edge of the parquet dance floor in the Gold Coast Room of Doubletree Inn. 
Periodically she stops, faces the crowd and, to the nod of her tuxedoed father, 
slowly dips into a full curtsy. Everyone applauds. 
</P>
<P>
 History would have it that Melanie Ann is being introduced to society. 
</P>
<P>
 In France in 1817, for example, Melanie Ann would have taken the same curtsy 
and in so doing placed herself solidly in a marriage market of only the 
richest, most elite, most genealogically conscious suitors. A century later, 
with F. Scott Fitzgerald's mansioned Newport, R.I., crowd, Melanie Ann's future 
would have been equally assured -- or imprisoned, depending upon your point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's 1994 in a seaside oil patch gone suburban, a place where civic debate 
centers on mall expansion, beach parking, gang threats. No vaulted chateaux 
surrounded by vineyards, no Grey Rocks manse with marble-faced ballroom 
overlooking a brooding sea, no ruling oligarchs whose closed circle of families 
have only each other to carry on names, fortunes, manners. Just a chain hotel 
jammed with 300 women in every conceivable mode of dress and men in black 
tuxedos, many of them rented. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Spirit will not be foiled, least of all when galvanized by proud 
legacies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 37th Las Patronas Presentation Ball, held annually. And Melanie 
Ann Chieu, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Frank Chieu of Camarillo, is joined by 11 
others being presented to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Patronas, a philanthropic wing of the Assistance League of Ventura County, 
has pulled out the stops for this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The multipurpose Gold Coast Room is so enhanced as to look built for the 
event: debutante entrances are canopied by floor-to-ceiling mini white lights 
and ribbons. The vast ceiling is a relief of faux "vaults" created by arching 
ribbons and white lights. Cream roses with blush pink centers are in profusion. 
Tall slender crystal vases on each table hold lilies and Gerber daisies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the heavy-stock programs are gilded with the impression of a gold fan, 
symbol of this event. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner would please a DeGaulle or a Kennedy: shrimp, avocado and mango salad 
followed by a triple entree of beef tenderloin, lamb loin and New Zealand 
venison in a choice of Montmorency cherry and pinon chutney or pecan-rosemary 
beurre blanc sauce Perigueux. Wine? In sequence, of course: Sauvignon Blanc, 
Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon. The lemon curd tart with caramel sauce dessert 
is followed by chocolate truffles. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Ann Chieu doesn't usually eat this way, and neither do the other 11 
debutantes. In fact, Melanie Ann doesn't really live in the traditions of 
American high society. That she is a debutante at all shows shift enough in the 
demography and cast of these balls. 
</P>
<P>
 She's certainly not here to find a husband. Melanie Ann just graduated from 
Adolfo Camarillo High School as a National Merit commended scholar and cited by 
the National Forensic League for her debating prowess. She spent last summer at 
Harvard, earned straight A's, and applied for early admission to Cornell, which 
did the smart thing and snapped her up. At Cornell, she'll major in industrial 
and labor relations, one of the best programs of its kind in the U.S. Men may 
someday work for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Ann Chieu, it is plain, simply doesn't need a boost or an intro to 
make it in this world, to be somebody to her family, or to carry out proud 
legacies. 
</P>
<P>
 But she curtsies as thousands before her have in this formalized ritual of 
class, and as she does she has a thought running through her head: "My family 
won't always be with me like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she expands on that thought: "This is about closure. And commencement. 
This is about my going on to the next thing, about making decisions for myself. 
It feels symbolic." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an insightful remark from a young woman who, when asked how she became 
a debutante in the first place, said: "I wouldn't call it an aspiration. But 
the two things they said would happen -- that I'd make close friends and be 
closer to my dad, things at first I didn't believe -- happened. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happy about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Ann also notes that the ball is congruent with her own volunteer work 
in the National Charity League and her high school's Ticktocker club. Indeed, 
Las Patronas donates $75 of each $150 ball ticket to the Assistance League 
School for Developmentally Delayed Children, in Oxnard; the Girls' and Teen 
Clubs, in Ventura; the Buffy Bear Project, providing teddy bears to city and 
county fire and police departments for children in trauma situations; and 
Operations School Bell, which provides two complete outfits of new clothes to 
underprivileged school-age children. Combined with donations generated by an 
earlier mail solicitation, Las Patronas this year will donate about $50,000 to 
these causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the most telling part for Melanie Ann Chieu, a nephrologist's 
daughter whose immigrant legacies are anything but Mayflower, whose 
predilections kept her off the beach in 1992 and instead sent her to China to 
study the practice of medicine, whose very mien is an uncommon combination of 
ebullience and reflection. No, if Melanie Ann Chieu could suffer an oxymoron 
and be called a debutante of the '90s, it would be for an everyday sensibility 
that is not born of any particular class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I continue to realize that the most important things in life I haven't 
learned in school but rather involve the people I've met," she says. "By doing 
this, I've gotten perspective that I wouldn't have gotten." 
</P>
<P>
 That's about as true as things get, whether learned in need and disability or 
mined privately amid flowers and gowns and roast lamb dinners.

FASHION; SEEKING A SECURE SELF-IMAGE IN STOMACH-STAPLING SURGERY; THE 
PROCEDURE, WHICH DECREASES THE BODY'S CAPACITY TO HOLD FOOD, REQUIRES 12 WEEKS 
OF HEALING AND A WHOLE NEW STYLE OF EATING.

<P>
 In the beige-and-mauve ballroom of the Hyatt Westlake Hotel, a woman stands at 
the podium, addressing a small crowd of listeners who are clustered in the back 
three rows. 
</P>
<P>
 The attendees are small in number, but not, as it were, in volume. 
</P>
<P>
 They are here to learn about Lite Life, which sounds like a diet cola, but 
isn't. Instead, it's a program offering a fairly radical procedure, one that 
will ultimately yield what we all look for: a secure self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience sees before-and-after slides of men and women who have slimmed 
down to less than half their body weight. They learn of an extensive 
psychological support system that is part of the package. Then they hear the 
procedure's name: vertical staple gastroplasty -- having the major part of 
one's stomach stapled off. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea tends to take one's breath away, which may explain why, as details 
unfold, there are so few questions from members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sheilah Clayton, a general surgeon who operates at St. Luke Medical Center 
in Pasadena, the closest Lite Life-approved clinic, lays out the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike Jenny Craig, this is surgery," she says. "It's serious and should be 
considered so." 
</P>
<P>
 She names the requirements for candidates: Healthy patients must be 100 pounds 
overweight, those who are medically compromised at least 75 pounds overweight. 
Each must have failed at other weight control measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want you to be desperate when you come to us," Clayton says later. "We 
don't want someone who has never been on a diet. We want you to have tried it 
all, and know that you need help." 
</P>
<P>
 She flashes a drawing of a stomach on the screen. It has four rows of surgical 
staples descending from the base of the esophagus, creating a very small 
receptacle for food. After surgery and months of stretching, this pocket will 
have a capacity of about six ounces, less than a fifth of the original stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a ring placed around the stomach at the bottom of the staple line, 
reducing the outlet to about the width of a thumb -- forcing the stomach's 
owner to chew food more thoroughly than he or she imagined practical. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result: The nervous system is made to consider a full pocket as a full 
stomach. When this happens, the brain receives a signal that all is well; the 
desire to eat shuts down. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure was considered experimental by the general medical community 
until three years ago; but Lite Life clinics, now sponsored by Ornda Health 
Corp. of Tennessee, have performed it 700 times since 1987. In tracking those 
patients five years after surgery, Clayton says 70% of them have stayed within 
30% of their ideal weight. 
</P>
<P>
 These results are far better than non-surgical weight loss programs, which 
Lite Life has documented at an overall 95% failure rate. But, the commitment is 
far greater: 12 weeks of healing, a whole new style of eating. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an unappealing discussion on what happens when one fails to maintain 
the required method of chewing, and the presentation ends. A Lite Life client, 
Jaz Zander, who is wearing a Size 6 pants outfit, is available for questions. 
But the attendees seem almost to avoid her and head for the doctor instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Zander, a contract specialist at the Port Hueneme naval base, can identify 
better with them than they can with her. She is just under 100 pounds lighter 
than in spring, 1993, when she needed help to tie her shoelaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, her home was devoid of mirrors, and she bought her clothes 
without trying them on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tended to want to blend against the background," she said. "I wore big, 
baggy sweaters and big, baggy pants. They always looked the same, although they 
were different baggy pants and different baggy sweaters." 
</P>
<P>
 Zander found herself increasingly reluctant to attend social events. She felt 
vulnerable, and she had trouble fitting into restaurant booths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was gaining and losing 160 pounds a year over and over again. Weight 
Watchers had a revolving door just for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slim until her late 20s, Zander entered a period of stress when she began 
dealing with her anxiety by eating, and was unable to break the habit for two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of people have learned to deal with tension this way. They gain a 
fixation that can't be easily avoided -- there's no way to swear off food. And 
there's no way to cloak the result. Compulsive gamblers can look pretty good at 
a party; compulsive eaters can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, there's a kind of competitiveness about weight. People who don't have 
it seem proud of the fact, and they are sometimes constrained to tell those who 
have it what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Zander's circle was supportive for the most part, but she was intent on 
change. Pleased now that she chose surgery, she talks of four years of 
indecision after learning of the procedure. There was always another diet to 
try -- and, for a long time, there was an image hang-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept thinking: 'I'm going to have this scar -- I won't be able to wear a 
two-piece bathing suit.' Then, I realized, 'When you weigh 235 pounds, why 
would you be wearing a two-piece suit in the first place?' 
</P>
<P>
 "After that," she said, "I had a good laugh and decided to go for it."

FOR THE KIDS; CAMPERS TAKE A JOURNEY THROUGH THE RAIN FOREST; PROGRAM AT OXNARD 
CHILDREN'S MUSEUM TEACHES YOUNGSTERS ABOUT THE DIMINISHING WILDERNESS.

 First came traditional summer camp -- swimming, tennis and crafts. Then came 
computer camp with its high-tech approach, and drama camp with its show-biz 
slant. Now, we have rain forest camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Gull Wings Children's Museum mixes environmental consciousness with fun during 
its weeklong Rainforest Camp. Elementary school-age children learn about the 
rain forest by doing things like preparing soup from vegetables and fruits that 
grow there. 
</P>
<P>
 It all happens at the Oxnard museum from 9 a.m. to noon July 25 through 29. 
The cost is $30 per child. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum offered the unusual camp for the first time last summer and it was 
a hit. So many kids signed up that there was a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Rainforest Camp? It's not just that the diminishing rain forests 
throughout the world are of concern, said museum director Gig Wishon. "It's 
fascinating -- the animals and the vegetation are so unique," she said. "And 
the bugs are big." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one day during the camp the kids will get a up-close look at some of 
the rain forest animals. Brenda Josephsen, who trains birds and does animal 
shows, will bring in some of her exotic animal collection, including a python, 
boa constrictor, cockatoo, iguana, chinchilla and basilisk, a lizard with a 
crest at the back of his head that makes him resemble a dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything the children do is somehow related to the rain forest. One day they 
make clay models of animals that live there. They do a rain forest mural. They 
craft instruments like the rain stick (actually a decorated Pringles container 
with things that rattle inside.) They make bread in the shape of snakes. They 
make puppets and see a puppet show. And they hear stories every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, the museum is offering a Backyard Science Camp for elementary 
school-age children. The kids will conduct experiments, like making mold and 
creating rain. 
</P>
<P>
 That camp runs 9 a.m. to noon Aug. 22 through 26 at the museum. The cost is 
$30. 
</P>

 If it's culture you're looking for, the Thousand Oaks branch of the American 
Assn. of University Women is holding its summer youth cultural program for kids 
entering grades one through six. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the weeklong programs touches on a different country. The participants 
learn about the food, games, music, dance, crafts, drama and folklore of each 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions run from 9:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. at the Arts Council Center, 482 
Greenmeadow Drive, Thousand Oaks. The cost is $45 per week. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAUW has been offering the program since 1976. It kicks off July 11 with 
Ireland as the focus country. Then a study of Japan begins July 18, India on 
July 25, and finally, Mexico on Aug. 1. Because of the program's popularity, 
the first two sessions are already full. For information, call 492-4401. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole gang from "Winnie the Pooh" will be at the Arts Council Center in 
Thousand Oaks for performances that begin Saturday and run through July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a combination of A.A. Milne stories about the famous bear and his pals 
and is performed by the Young Artists Ensemble, a group of theatrically minded 
children, ages 10-14. 
</P>
<P>
 This family production will be in the courtyard of the center at 482 
Greenmeadow Drive. Shows are on Saturdays and Sundays, at 1 and 3 p.m. Tickets 
are $4. For information, call 499-4355. 
</P>

 You don't have to go to the drive-in to see movies under the stars. In Simi 
Valley, you can sit on a blanket or lawn chair at Rancho Simi Community Park's 
Bicentennial Amphitheater and see some family-oriented movies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District will show "We're Back, 
A Dinosaur Story" at 8 p.m. It's free, but the district is hoping for $1 
donations to keep the summer program running. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the lineup for the rest of the summer: Aug. 1, "All Dogs Go to Heaven;" 
Aug. 21 and 22, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." All shows begin about 8 p.m.

JAUNTS; CLUB GETS BIKE RIDERS TO HEAD FOR THE HILLS; GROUP'S WEEKEND RIDES 
RANGE FROM THREE-HOUR 'JAUNTS' TO SIX-HOUR HILL-CLIMBING MARATHONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They called it a beginner ride. A somewhat gentle jaunt in the Santa Monica 
Mountains for those new to mountain biking, or those who needed to get in 
better shape before tackling truly rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be three hours and 15 minutes of sweaty up-and-down pumping 
in 90-degree heat. It was hills sometimes too steep to ride so the bikes had to 
be pushed up. It was a hairy ride down the side of a mountain. It was like a 
roller coaster -- not exactly fun at the time, but well worth the adrenaline 
rush at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Ranch Mountain Bikers club holds rides every weekend, usually in 
Ventura County. The A Team rides are for experienced riders in good shape who 
can wrestle with steep terrain for three to five hours. The B Team rides, on 
alternate weekends, are easier and shorter, two to three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a B Team ride that drew two dozen or so riders to Rancho Sierra 
Vista park in Newbury Park on a recent Sunday morning. About six or seven had 
never ridden with the group before. Some had never ridden off-road at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Their leaders were not twenty-something jocks. Joe Dillman, who organizes the 
B Team rides, is a snappy, 70-year-old, white-haired, semi-retired financial 
planner. Randy Rogers, 48, who leads the rigorous A Team rides, suffered a 
heart attack six years ago. But now he leads the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal that day was to pedal from Rancho Sierra Vista eastward on the Los 
Robles Trail to a trail head near Lynn Road and Ventu Park Road. In single 
file, the group wheeled along the dirt path over the grassy meadows, eventually 
crossing West Potrero Road. At that point, a couple of riders dropped out, 
unable to handle the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more rugged ground was yet to come. The shadeless trail grew steeper 
in places -- not much of a problem for some riders. As it turned out, some were 
A Team bikers who simply do all the club rides. But for the novices, the hills 
meant getting off and pushing the bike uphill, almost as torturous as trying to 
ride it. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more riders dropped out, exhausted by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for the thermally challenged," Dillman joked. They stopped often for 
water and to wait for stragglers. 
</P>
<P>
 The riders wound up Rasnow Peak and down switchbacks on the other side, 
passing a couple of bikers -- no hikers -- along the way. When it was over, 
about a third of the original group had dropped out, and a few had taken spills 
and wore the dirt to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 For those conditioned to the demands of the sport, the ride that day "not even 
slightly winded them," Rogers said. "If you get into it and keep at it, you'll 
be in better shape than if you join a gym." 
</P>
<P>
 While the B Team rides are for beginners in reasonably good shape who have 
done a little riding, there are occasional C Team rides for what Rogers calls 
rank beginners who need some instruction. Once or twice a year, the group also 
holds a bike clinic to provide some technical know-how, along with a short 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers formed the group in 1988 after he bought a mountain bike and sought the 
company of other riders. Then the club nearly fizzled out after he had his 
heart attack. "The doctor told me I would never ride again," he said. After a 
year, though, he was back on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership now numbers nearly 200 bikers, with rides attracting up to a couple 
dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 The rides are free, but those who join the club get a biweekly newsletter with 
a riding schedule. It costs $12 per year, or $24 for both A and B Team 
newsletters and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rides have taken them to Lancaster, Mt. Pinos, Santa Barbara and Big 
Bear. Once a year they hold their Bikini Beach Ride from the Santa Monica Pier 
to Redondo Beach. (So-named because of the prize awarded for the photograph of 
the skimpiest bikini.) They get even sillier. At their annual pool party they 
stage crazy bike contests, like a 100-foot race in the lowest gear. 
</P>
<P>
 But they don't do anything crazy on the trail. High-speed riding is forbidden. 
That's what gets trails closed to mountain bikers and gives the sport a bad 
name, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trails are not being closed off to bikers at the rate they were a few years 
ago, he said. "Bikers are getting the message to sink in." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * COMING UP: The North Ranch Mountain Bikers' next ride will start at 8 a.m. 
Saturday in Tujunga at the Foothill Freeway and La Tuna Canyon Road. This is a 
B Team ride for beginners in reasonably good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 * GETTING STARTED: The club has a C Team ride for rank beginners with no 
experience at 8 a.m. July 16 in Wildwood Park, Thousand Oaks. Riders meet at 
the intersection of Avenida de los Arboles and Big Sky Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * CLINIC: The club also has scheduled a clinic at 8 a.m. Aug. 14, at the south 
end of Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * CALL: For club information, call 373-8824.

SHOP TALK; MERCHANTS TO CUT PRICES AS THEY MOVE OUTDOORS; ABOUT 30 TO 50 
RETAILERS ARE EXPECTED TO OFFER BIG SAVINGS AT THE SALE, SPONSORED BY THE 
DOWNTOWN VENTURA ASSN.

 You had better sit down for this one. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you weren't aware, on Saturday and Sunday, the Downtown Ventura Assn. 
is sponsoring the second annual Downtown Sidewalk Sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere from 30 to 50 retailers are expected to slash prices on their 
merchandise -- antiques, thrift items, clothing, furniture, just about anything 
you can find on and near the downtown section of Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you still conscious? Have a glass of water. Check your pulse. Read on. 
</P>
<P>
 We spoke to some of the merchants planning to participate in this mass sale to 
see what kind of meat they were going to throw to hungry shoppers. So, without 
further ado, here's a taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Bookstore: "We'll be selling overstocked, brand-new books at 
ridiculously low prices," said Ed Elrod, co-owner of the store. "We'll have the 
mis-shipments, the ones the dog chewed up, the ones the parrots chewed up, a 
lot of new stuff that was missent to us or came damaged that had been marked 
down. We'll also have leftovers." 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the damaged books to be 60% off and the rest to be discounted 50%. 
And, yes, there are a few children's books that were chewed by the store 
parrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the books used to be stored near the bird cages. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Leather: Purses will be going for about a 30% markdown -- from the $60 
range down to the $30 range. Wallets and belts will be going for a 20% 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow Your Dream: The gift store, specializing in Victoriana, will have 
Victorian wrapping paper and Mary Engelbreit items -- greeting cards, T-shirts, 
mugs, etc. -- at 15% off. Other selected merchandise will be marked down 20% to 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fantasia: Clothing will be on sale, and some of the store's wide selection of 
trolls will be 30% off. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Deco Boutique & Shoe Salon: Much of the store's designer label clothing 
will be 30% to 50% off, and a good selection of shoes and jewelry will be 
discounted similarly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Things: As co-coordinator of the sidewalk sale, store owner Sherilene 
Oelschiager said she hasn't had much time to think about what she will put out 
on the sidewalk. But she did say some sand dollars, nautilus shells and 
selected other shells will be on sale. Don't be surprised to find some 
discounted wind chimes and fish mobiles as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladies & Gentlemen: Georgia Olivas Madrid, owner of this new and resale 
designer clothing store and the event's other coordinator, said at least half 
of her merchandise will be on sale. "From 30% to 40% to 50% off, at least," she 
said. "There's a lot of merchandise I want to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing Room Only Bakery: Look for retail items such as Thermos bottles, mugs 
and serving trays to be sold at discount prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society Discovery Shop: The thrift store will have 
selected merchandise -- clothing and otherwise -- at 50% off the usual price. 
</P>
<P>
 For Your Home and Landmark 38: These sibling furniture stores will be selling 
sale-priced lamps, artwork and a variety of furniture -- chairs, coffee-table 
and end-table sets, living room furniture, bedroom furniture, accessories and 
other items. 
</P>
<P>
 And, by the way, For Your Home, a new kid on the block, started its 60-day 
grand opening sale last week. A wide selection of furniture and artwork has 
been marked down. 
</P>
<P>
 The sidewalk sale will run 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. 
Sunday. That's 13 hours of discount shopping. We suggest you rest up.

EARTHWATCH: LOW-CHOLESTEROL QUEST HEALTHY FOR PLANET TOO; NEW SELF-TESTING 
DEVICE COULD ENCOURAGE AMERICANS TO EAT LESS MEAT, A SMART MOVE FOR THEIR 
HEARTS AND HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You might not think there's a connection between your cholesterol level and 
the planet's health, but registered nurse Linda Glatts -- director of education 
at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks and a Seventh-day 
Adventist -- does. 
</P>
<P>
 Glatts hopes the recent introduction of the the Advanced Care Cholesterol 
Test, a trademark product Johnson & Johnson is selling through drug stores, 
will help people choose a healthier lifestyle -- healthy for them and for the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that it's available over the counter, a cholesterol test will raise 
consciousness of the problem, and a lot more responsibility will rest with the 
lay person to control (his or her) diet," said Glatts, a vegetarian with a 
master's degree in cardiopulmonary nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 That, she speculated, might result in a reduction in meat consumption, which 
in turn will have an environmental impact, because cattle raising consumes half 
the fresh water used in our state and almost 80% of the grain crops produced in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be more planet-friendly and nutritionally efficient if crops such as 
corn and soybeans were more often used to sustain people. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-day Adventists embrace -- but don't require -- vegetarianism. The 
faith proscribes cigarettes and alcohol and strongly recommends a vegetarian 
diet that allows dairy products and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members -- more than half, according to an article in the American 
Journal of Clinical Nutrition -- follow the diet, and have become the subject 
of several medical studies. One study, conducted by Loma Linda University 
Center for Health Research, a Seventh-day Adventist institution, found that 
lifelong members of the denomination live on average a decade longer than 
members of the general U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, other faiths advocate good habits, healthful living and temperance. 
But the Adventists, with their century of low-fat eating, realized their 
conduct can have a practical impact on the health of the rest of us and the 
planet's health, according to the Adventists' national media center in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent edition of one of their publications, "Vibrant Life," contained the 
article "Can You Have Your Environment and Eat It Too?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not right having to let your lawn go brown because of scarce, expensive 
water just so other people can cling to a diet which results in cardiac 
disease," Glatts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glatts, whose husband, Tom, is pastor of an Adventist church in Newhall, 
advocates an approach to diet and lifestyle that others could easily embrace. 
The initial letters of their eight principles for healthful living spell "new 
start": nutrition, exercise, water, sunshine, temperance, air, rest and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Doris Derelian, president-elect of the American Dietetic Assn., said she 
also welcomed the over-the-counter test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been wondering when the test was going to be available (because) we 
think consumers need to have much more information about their health and what 
kind of behavior to adopt," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Derelian said, however, that the test should not necessarily prompt us all to 
stampede to vegetarianism. Rather, it might be used to encourage people to take 
the advice of professional dietitians and eat meat in small amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 She described "condiment portions" -- the small amounts it takes to flavor 
food -- dishes she has seen in cookbooks such as "In the Kitchen With Rosie." 
</P>
<P>
 In countries where water and topsoil are managed thriftily -- not devoted to 
meat production -- folks think up all kinds of ways to use meat for flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholesterol awareness, indeed, is no longer linked to the idea of a grim 
lifestyle. The latest issue of "The Journal of Gastronomy," published by the 
American Institute of Wine & Food in San Francisco is devoted to the societal 
and environmental aspects of find food. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT CURIOUSLY POPULAR; IN THREADBARE 
SURROUNDINGS, TOKYO SUKIYAKI IN OXNARD SERVES UP FARE THAT DISAPPOINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how they are configured, Japanese restaurants typically rely upon 
two things: freshness in seafood and spare, sometimes ascetic, dining space. 
The Japanese dining experience is designed, indeed, to impart an elegant 
simplicity, a subtle cuisine unencumbered by goopy sauces, overwrought 
handling, hoopla in dining room decor. The result, when everything works, is a 
light but fortifying fare, artfully presented and not without some incendiary 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo Sukiyaki is sandwiched between a bar and a bodega in a small strip mall 
on Gonzales Road in Oxnard. Its dining space is designed to give the secluded 
ryokan impression: slender, wood-accented, intimate spaces with booths kept 
separate from the kitchen by wood-slat walls, all beneath wood and paper 
lantern lights. And its menu is heavily seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 But both of those familiar values are undermined. 
</P>
<P>
 The room feels and looks tired, even threadbare, though things are clean. And 
the food, in visits taken over many months, has varied widely -- some of it 
good, some of it just OK, some of it barred from success by misconception, some 
of it perilously stale. 
</P>
<P>
 The place seems no shorter on customers for these problems, a fact that 
mystifies. But popularity does not an assessment make, and, sadly, this one is 
without happy comment on an otherwise preferred and cunning island cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Among appetizers, the gyoza ($3.25) was most reliable -- nicely seared and 
plump with fresh ground pork filling. But the dipping sauce only once had the 
right slightly sweet, slightly tart, vinegar edge; on another visit it suffered 
from a massive overdose of chili oil, requiring dilution with soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrimp and vegetable tempura ($3.95 and $3.50, respectively) were adequate, if 
a bit plain. Happily, the shrimp, which were cooked just until done, were 
fresh. The same cannot be said about the octopus sushi ($2.95 apiece). In one 
recent visit it was over the hill, its once-pearly white meat going gray, its 
once sea-sweet scent bearing a sour edge, its once-spongy texture going tough. 
It went uneaten. Tuna sushi, however, was fresh and just as it should be -- 
clear in flavor, bright in color, and virtually free of scent. Spareribs 
($4.50) were under-flavored and over-cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The small dinner salad ($1.50 or included with entree orders) is straight 
iceberg, lightly tossed in rice vinegar and oil with sesame seeds -- again, 
adequate at best. Dinners are accompanied, however, by a simple miso broth, 
suffused with flower-shaped carrot slice and fine noodles, and the result is 
altogether light and refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful entrees were the most Americanized: salmon teriyaki 
($13.95) and chicken teriyaki ($10.50). In each case, large premium filets were 
properly cooked and dressed with a densely flavorful sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, tuna teriyaki ($10.95) was featured as a special one night, and the 
beautifully cut tuna steak was clearly straddling that nervous place no sauce 
can hide: the zone between fresh and stale, between rosy red and brownish 
purple, between light flavor and meat-like heaviness. It went largely uneaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicy tuna teriyaki ($8.95), another special, was dry and overcooked and a 
massive presence of chopped fresh jalapenos overwhelmed fish and sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Yosenabe ($13.95), or soup stew, was quite satisfying. Its ample helping of 
tiny sweet clams was tender from infusion at the last minute, and its generous 
fish fillet, fresh vegetables and thick noodles were worthy complements to the 
light seafood broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most disappointing of all was a near success called Salmon Batayaki 
(on special for $12 and on the menu as Butter-Yaki Salmon for $14.95). Akin to 
French salmon in parchment paper with fresh spring vegetables, this version 
encases in waxed paper a generous salmon fillet atop sliced onions, one lemon 
slice (with bitter peel), fresh parsley (with peppery stems), and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the fish was slightly overbaked, less than that-day fresh, and lacking 
in light vegetable essences, fragrance, or balanced flavor. Adequate enough for 
the truly hungry and certainly not a complete flop, this dish still begs the 
ugly question: Why bother? 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert? I passed every time. 
</P>
<P>
 It just seemed too much bother. Details

 Gerry Hassenflug, owner of Gerry's Busy Oak Cafe in Oak View, had that 
persistent thought creep into her head again recently. It's the thought that 
tells her to start serving dinner at her restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost did it," she said. "Then I said, 'Why even think about it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The breakfast-lunch establishment is open 6 a.m.-2 p.m. daily, and is usually 
pretty crowded. Hassenflug is convinced that if the Busy Oak were open in the 
evening she'd do equally well. 
</P>
<P>
 That's in large part, she said, because of her new outdoor smoking area -- a 
patio with full awning and clear vinyl dropcloth covering, and eight tables, 
that serves as a smoking room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting the smokers from Ojai. You can't smoke there," said Hassenflug. 
"I know we'd be busy at night, but I can't handle it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 So Hassenflug is keeping with her daytime hours, at least until she is sure 
she has found a dedicated support staff for the evening. "I tried (dinner 
hours) when I first opened," she said. "I was working 16 hours a day. I lost 12 
pounds the first week." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry's Busy Oak Cafe is located at 409 Ventura Ave. 
</P>

 It's official -- The Greek at the Harbor is open. The restaurant began 
operating last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who follow The Greek in its move from Oxnard to the Ventura Harbor 
may notice a few changes, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. For one thing, 
it's now open Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the menu is much the same as it was. But New York steak has 
been added and more significant changes are being planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be adding specials and several seafood items," said co-owner Lynn 
Mikelatos. "Our chef (Nikos Xidarakos) is going to do a special of the day, a 
seafood a la chef." 
</P>
<P>
 As for entertainment, the restaurant will have belly dancing Sunday through 
Thursday at 8:15 p.m., and Friday and Saturday at 7:15 and 9 p.m. Following 
each show, the restaurant's servers will present a Greek dance performance, 
featuring the "famous wine dance" by Jerome Dabour. 
</P>
<P>
 In the restaurant's first incarnation, Dabour was a waiter and performer. This 
time around, he is waiter, performer and partner in the business, along with 
Mikelatos and her husband, Makis. The restaurant is located at 1583 Spinnaker 
Drive, Suite 101.

$500,000 EGYPTIAN BOWL STOLEN FROM HERMITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $500,000 glass bowl dating from the 3rd Century BC was stolen from the 
Hermitage Museum, reports said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-inch bowl, made of glass and gold leaf in the Egyptian city of 
Alexandria, was kept in a back room of the museum, which has outdated security 
and fire alarm systems. Last year, thieves stole two vases and some Roman 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermitage recently signed a $2.5-million contract with Minnesota-based 
Honeywell Inc. to install a better alarm system and artificial climate control.

GIRL IS FREED UNHARMED AFTER BRIEF KIDNAPING; CRIME: SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SAYS MAN 
RELEASED HER FROM PICKUP WHEN HE SAW POLICE ON ROUTINE PATROL NEAR SCHOOL WHERE 
ABDUCTION OCCURRED. 
</P>

<P>
 A 7-year-old girl leaving a summer school class was shoved into a pickup truck 
Wednesday by a man who then drove off with her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But minutes later, the man saw several police vehicles in the area and told 
the girl to get out, she later told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief abduction comes a week after a man was arrested in Tustin on 
suspicion of kidnaping another 7-year-old girl from her bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl abducted Wednesday, who was not identified, was leaving her summer 
school class just before noon at Marjorie Veeh Elementary School, in the 1700 
block of San Juan Street, Sgt. Mike Pettifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 As she walked toward her waiting mother, she passed the passenger side of a 
small, white pickup with a camper shell, Pettifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She felt a push and was put into the vehicle by force," Pettifer said. The 
man slammed the passenger door, "ran around to his side and took off." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was among more than 350 summer school students getting out of class, 
according to Brad Lantz, director of student services for the Tustin Unified 
School District. Each day, an administrator and several teachers walk students 
to waiting buses and to parents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the departing crowd, neither the teachers nor the girl's mother saw her 
being forced into the pickup truck, police and school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the truck with the frightened, weeping girl approached the intersection of 
San Juan and Red Hill Avenue, about 100 yards from the school, the driver 
spotted several Tustin police patrol cars on routine patrol, Pettifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man commented on the police cars and told the girl -- in English -- to get 
out of the truck and go back to school, she later told school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she didn't respond," Pettifer said. "She was probably very upset, 
and crying. Her English wasn't very good." 
</P>
<P>
 When the man repeated the instructions in Spanish, the girl got out and ran 
back to the school, where she contacted a custodian, who took her to the 
principal. Together, they located the girl's mother, who was wandering around 
the school, looking for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were contacted, but they didn't find the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was described as a Latino, about 35 years of age and wearing a 
ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning teachers in each of the kindergarten through fifth-grade classes 
at Veeh will discuss the abduction with students and repeat warnings about what 
to do if approached by a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The normal safety instructions, are to stay away from strangers, to run and 
call for assistance if they are approached or grabbed," Lantz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a flyer containing the same basic information will be sent home 
with the students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have not been any similar incidents at Tustin schools, Lantz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, 7-year-old Fabiola Lopez was abducted as she slept in her bed in 
Tustin. However, the girl's uncle, Hernan Salazar, heard her cries and chased 
the man who was carrying her off, causing him to release her. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, Pablo Bojorquez, a 35-year-old ice cream vendor, was arrested on 
suspicion of kidnaping and burglary.

JUDGES POSTPONE DECISION ON NEW LEGAL-AID CONTRACT; LAW: JOB OF REPRESENTING 
INDIGENT CLIENTS MAY BE PUT OUT TO BID. ONE FIRM HAS HAD A LOCK ON THE WORK FOR 
15 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Unable to decide Wednesday on a controversial county contract that provides 
legal aid to hundreds of poor people each year, Orange County Central Court 
judges decided to meet again next week to consider giving other lawyers a 
chance to bid on the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Presiding Municipal Judge Gregory H. Lewis said the Santa Ana 
law firm of attorney William W. Stewart will remain the county's designated 
attorney to represent indigent clients in Central Court. The firm has held the 
contract for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, I see no reason to effect a change in this 
intermediate period of time," Lewis said Wednesday following a closed meeting 
with other judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's handling of the contract -- worth between $700,000 and $1 million 
per year -- has been the subject of recent criticism by two judges who have 
complained that the attorney has largely abandoned his role in the courtroom, 
farming out much of the contract caseload to other defense attorneys who share 
in the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judges Margaret R. Anderson and Pamela L. Iles, both members of a 
county advisory committee on indigent defense issues, have also expressed 
concern that the Santa Ana attorney has been splitting time between his 
import-export business in South America and tending to the indigent-defense 
contract in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 One year remains on Stewart's contract with the county. But Lewis said the 
proposed changes have nothing to do with the complaints aired by Anderson and 
Iles. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has defended his firm's handling of the contract and has denounced the 
judges' criticisms, saying that clients have received "excellent" 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he and other Central Court judges have been seeking "greater 
coverage" in the courts, where judges have reported delays in getting contract 
lawyers to court hearings for their indigent clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract change proposed by Lewis would involve placing the contract out 
for bids and possibly choosing up to three law firms to share the contract 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the judges' discussion was closed to the public and Lewis said all 
future judges' sessions will be closed until a reorganization is complete. Any 
plan proposed by the judges would have to be reviewed by the county Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking this step by step," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office generally handles indigent defense cases, but in 
criminal cases with more than one defendant, or in which public defenders have 
other conflicts of interest, assignments are made to private attorneys under 
contract to the county.

LEGAL BRAWL BREWING OVER PENSION SPIKING; GOVERNMENT: HUNTINGTON BEACH AND THE 
STATE ARE AT ODDS OVER THE CITY'S DECISION TO ALLOW $13 MILLION IN EXTRA 
BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and DEBRA CANO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach City Council appears headed for a legal clash with the 
state over a recent city decision to allow employees to continue artificially 
inflating their retirement benefits, a practice expected to ultimately cost 
taxpayers $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted Tuesday not to restrict "spiking" of final-year salaries, 
which boosts pensions, despite a new state law that makes most aspects of that 
tactic illegal. Council members, although nearly unanimously opposed to 
spiking, argued that the city is in a legal bind because the practice is 
written into contracts previously bargained with several municipal employee 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reasoning doesn't sit well with an official from the state agency that 
oversees public employee pension funds, who suggested Wednesday that the new 
anti-spiking law supersedes any union agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't break a state law no matter what's been bargained in a contract," 
said Bob Walton, assistant executive officer at the state Public Employees 
Retirement System (PERS). "It would be like having a contract saying all 
employees can drive 65 m.p.h., then insisting they can continue to drive 65 
m.p.h. even after state law reduces the speed limit to 55 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council voted not to pay a $743,632 bill from the state for 
city employee pensions inflated through spiking. In a letter to PERS, the city 
argued that it is not obligated to pay the bill, Councilman Dave Sullivan said. 
The city gave PERS a July 22 deadline to say whether it would demand the 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that if they can agree with us, it would mean we're out from 
under paying this bill or any future bill," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton acknowledged that PERS "had some fault in not educating people as well 
as we should have" on the complexities of the state's retirement system. But 
that, he said, does not dismiss the city from its obligation to make up the 
money owed or risk being tossed out of the state pension system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're unsuccessful in collecting from an employer, then the board's option 
is to terminate the employer's contract with PERS," Walton said. "That's 
something no one likes to do. But we can't administer a retirement system 
without proper employee contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the differing interpretations, it may be left up to the courts to decide 
who will foot the bill for spiking, which has become an emotion-charged issue 
in scores of cities and counties up and down the state. In some municipalities, 
administrators ended up getting retirement checks bigger than their top 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking occurs when employee pensions are artificially inflated by adding the 
value of unused vacation days, car allowances and other perks to the final 
year's salary, which is used by PERS to determine retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Such inflated pensions strain the state retirement fund. Normally, pensions 
are financed by a pool of money contributed by both the employee and the 
employer. Spiked pensions, however, balloon beyond an amount that can be paid 
off by the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice began in the early 1980s as elected officials sought ways to 
compensate employees whose wages began to fall behind private-sector salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking took hold in Huntington Beach about a decade ago. Officials say it 
began with top city administrators, then trickled down to other employees, 
including public-safety personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a slippery move by the then-city administrator, and over a 
period of time other employees got wind of it and wanted to be included on the 
gravy train," said Sullivan, a spiking opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he and other Huntington Beach officials believe they would face lawsuits 
from employee groups if they attempted to ignore bargaining agreements that 
allow spiking to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "If two parties agree to terms, neither side can unilaterally violate those 
terms," Sullivan said. "The whole council really wants to stop this, and the 
council's action was no way an endorsement to spiking. It was obeying the law 
and not violating the collective bargaining act." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the city would have borne the cost of defending any lawsuits filed 
against the city by the labor groups, he said. Reasoned Sullivan: "Why incur 
more costs that are avoidable?" 
</P>
<P>
 The total price tag for pension-spiking in Huntington Beach is expected to 
reach $13 million. About $3 million represents unfunded pensions for 39 city 
employees who have already retired. Another $10 million would go to 153 
employees who have said they plan to soon retire with inflated pensions.

FIRE ALARM; AFTER LAST YEAR'S DISASTER, LAGUNA RACES TO AVERT A REPEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With last October's monstrous firestorm still a painful memory and the arrival 
of a new fire season, Laguna Beach officials are trying everything -- including 
hiring goats and state prison inmates -- to prevent another disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing our best. We're running as fast as we can go," Fire Chief Richard 
Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful that fire damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes here and blackened 
more than 14,000 acres, residents of this beach community with only two major 
access roads are jittery amid the hot summer weather and tinder-dry hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big risk this city has left . . . is the unburned part," resident Robert 
Williamson said. "There's a lot of combustible material up in those hills." 
</P>
<P>
 City administrators and fire officials, some of whom lost their homes in the 
Oct. 27 blaze, are waging an effort to make sure disaster doesn't descend upon 
the city again. 
</P>
<P>
 A bulwark of the city's defense network is the planned extension of a 
four-mile firebreak that now protects part of the city into a 10-mile break 
that will eventually encircle the entire town and snake into fire-prone inner 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual work force is being assembled to maintain the existing firebreak 
and clear other open areas of flammable brush.  
</P>
<P>
 About 800 goats have been nibbling at the weeds, foxtails and wild oats at the 
north end of town, and on Wednesday the voracious animals crossed to the east 
side of Laguna Canyon Road and began working their way south. The goats are 
bred by a Bay Area breeder for such assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the goats, city officials hope to hire state prison inmate 
crews managed by the state Department of Forestry to further clear the land, 
something they have done in the past, according to Dewberry. 
</P>
<P>
 However, before the firebreak can be enlarged -- a task that may take two or 
three years to complete -- federal and state biologists must complete an 
assessment of the area's plant and animal habitat to make sure not too much 
environmentally sensitive brush is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people wanted us to have it all done by fire season," 
Dewberry said. "It's just not possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The October disaster was deeply felt at all levels of this community, with the 
blaze destroying the homes of City Councilman Robert F. Gentry, City Manager 
Kenneth C. Frank and other local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone seems to be fire conscious, everyone wants something done," said Api 
Weinert, the city's fire prevention specialist. "We're moving as quickly as 
possible with the resources we have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beside enlarging the firebreak, firefighters are completing inspections of 
more than 1,500 homes next to open-space areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes and surrounding vegetation are being assessed for fire vulnerability 
and property owners are being given "helpful recommendations" about how to 
reduce the fire risk for themselves and their neighborhoods, Weinert said. 
</P>
<P>
 If residents don't resolve the problem, Weinert said, the city has the 
authority to have the work done and bill the homeowner by putting a lien on the 
property, as with the city's weed abatement program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a home on the property and a lot of dead brush (and) debris, the 
Fire Department will proceed to do it that way if the homeowner does not 
comply," he said. "We'd much rather see the property owners take care of their 
own property." 
</P>
<P>
 Dewberry, who has stressed fire prevention at dozens of homeowners meetings in 
the past six months, said residents are more worried about fire now than at any 
other time in his 24 years with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people who live at the edge of wild land are very aware of their 
vulnerability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the city's shrinking finances, the City Council increased the Fire 
Department's budget 6% this year. The city will spend $350,000, the largest 
single new expense in the budget, on fire prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach is also counting on about $1 million in federal funds to help pay 
for its fire-prevention effort. 
</P>

 "This year, further fire improvements are probably the No. 1 public safety 
priority," Frank said. "The increase in the Fire Department's budget was by far 
a larger increase than any other department's budget." 
</P>
<P>
 City residents have differing opinions whether officials are doing enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilse Lenschow, president of the North Laguna Community Assn., is satisfied, 
saying, "We're happy something's being done." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Williamson believes the city is acting too slowly, saying, "It's like 
they're nickel-and-diming the thing. We could lose everything that didn't burn 
before."

UNIONS SET TRANSIT STRIKE FOR JULY 18; LABOR: WALKOUT OF MTA BUS AND RAIL 
WORKERS IS PLANNED UNLESS CONTRACT AGREEMENT IS REACHED. PLANS ARE READIED IN 
THE EVENT OF A SHUTDOWN. 
</P>

 Unions representing 6,500 employees who operate bus and rail lines for the Los 
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Wednesday set a strike 
deadline of 12:01 a.m. July 18 unless an agreement is reached on new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson declined to seek a court order imposing a mandatory 60-day 
"cooling-off" period, but did not rule out such a move later. The MTA board 
asked Wilson not to seek the cooling-off period -- apparently a tactic to 
pressure the unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said a cooling-off period "would not be the best course of action at 
this time." He noted that an immediate cooling-off period would "exhaust the 
last remaining authority of the governor to intervene, leaving the critical bus 
routes vulnerable to a strike as students return to school in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations continued Wednesday at an undisclosed hotel with a state mediator 
carrying proposals between the parties, who occasionally met face to face. 
Transit officials continued working on a strike plan, including training 
non-union workers to drive buses. Talks were scheduled to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no movement," said Goldy Norton, spokesman for the United 
Transportation Union. "We're right where we were in April." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the MTA board, said he 
was optimistic that an agreement could be reached. "I think we're going to make 
some progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a strike occurs, it would be the first shutdown of the nation's 
second-largest bus system since 1982, when drivers walked off the job for five 
days. There have been four bus strikes in the last 20 years, including a 68-day 
walkout in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 1.3 million daily boardings on MTA buses, and 50,000 people ride the 
Blue Line and Red Line each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of a strike, the MTA plans to operate several of the busiest bus 
lines immediately and continue service on the Blue Line trolley and Red Line 
subway. Bus and train service would operate only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike would not include Metrolink commuter rail service, which added cars 
to its trains Wednesday in preparation for a walkout, or other local transit 
lines. The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday also authorized expansion of 
DASH shuttle bus lines, which operate Downtown, and commuter express buses, 
which run between Downtown and the suburbs, in the event of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have requested a 3% raise in addition to an existing 
cost-of-living increase. MTA officials, who are considering a fare increase to 
help ease a $126-million operating deficit, have offered no pay raise and are 
seeking to reduce the agency's contribution for workers' health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has gone on the offensive in the labor battle, taking out half-page 
ads in the Los Angeles Times asserting that the region's bus drivers -- earning 
an average of $68,000 a year -- are among the highest-paid in the country.

VAN HAMPERED BEFORE CRASH, INVESTIGATORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The van in which 14 Los Angeles residents were killed Sunday was apparently 
limping along, emergency lights flashing, in the right-hand lane of a Texas 
interstate when a tractor-trailer slammed into it from the rear, authorities 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That new theory contradicts the ones that were offered immediately after the 
wreck in which 12 children and two adults were killed. Mike Cox, a spokesman 
for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said fatigue on the part of the 
trucker may have been a factor in the disastrous accident, one of the worst in 
Texas history. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier speculation was that the van either swerved onto the highway or that 
the truck blew a tire and the driver lost control of his rig. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cox said there was evidence to suggest that Claudia Funches of Los 
Angeles, the driver of the van, was moving slowly but legally when hit from 
behind by the truck about 9:30 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no skid marks at all, no evidence that the truck driver braked," 
Cox said. "(Investigators) do believe fatigue may have played a part in the 
accident on the part of the trucker." 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been charged in the accident, but a grand jury is expected to hear 
evidence in the case after the team reconstructing what happened completes its 
work. That could take at least a month, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, based on preliminary interviews, the van developed mechanical 
troubles, apparently because it was overloaded with 18 people traveling to 
Vicksburg, Miss., for a family reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said the shocks on the 1977 Dodge van were so shot because of the weight 
of so many passengers that the tires were hitting the inside of the wheel wells 
at every bump. Because there were speed bumps on the side of the highway, 
Funches apparently decided she would be better off driving slowly on the 
highway, with warning lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been driving on the roadway for at least a minute when hit from behind 
by the truck, driven by Richie Ware of Arlington, Tex., Cox said. The force of 
the impact was so great that the van was crumpled and a fire started as it was 
being pushed down the road by the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Funches had been 
driving without a license for the last 10 years. The records show that her 
license was suspended in February, 1984, for failure to appear on traffic 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 She was stopped once in 1990 and cited for driving on a suspended license, not 
having proof of insurance and not having a child in a safety seat. Cox said the 
van had two rows of seats at most and probably most of the passengers were 
crammed in the rear section of the vehicle that was hit by the truck. He said 
the damage from the fire made it impossible to determine whether anyone was 
wearing seat belts, but it was clear that there were not enough for the number 
of people in the van.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't tell," he said. "Our feeling is they were not." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said Texas law requires safety restraints only for those in the front seat 
and children under 4.

CULTURAL MYSTERY TOUR; VISITORS: BUS TRIP TO L.A.'S EASTSIDE KICKS OFF A SERIES 
THAT WILL SHOWCASE THE CITY'S OFTEN-OVERLOOKED MULTIETHNIC ATTRACTIONS AND 
COUNTER NEGATIVE MEDIA IMAGES. KOREATOWN, SOUTH-CENTRAL ARE AMONG FUTURE 
DESTINATIONS.

 As West Coast correspondent for the Cairo daily Al-Ahram, Soraya Abdoul Seoud 
seldom ventured across the river to Los Angeles' Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid to come to this area," Abdoul said Wednesday as she rode in a 
bus down bustling Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, one of the neighborhood's main drags. 
"All you hear about in the media is the negative side." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdoul and other foreign journalists were among three dozen participants in a 
novel bus tour of the district that has long stood as the heart of Los Angeles' 
Mexican and Mexican American communities. The visit is the first in a series of 
"Insight Tours," designed to coincide with World Cup festivities, that will 
focus on several Los Angeles neighborhoods often viewed from the outside as 
simmering caldrons of gang violence and ethnic tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A.'s neighborhoods have really been maligned, but that's where you find 
some of the richest areas of the city," said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, executive 
director of the Tourism Industry Development Council, the nonprofit group 
sponsoring the tours. "You can experience the cultures of 80 countries in a 
half-hour drive through L.A. -- and we want to show that off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, organizers said, is to showcase the city's multiethnic vitality and 
give journalists and visitors a touch of Los Angeles distinct from the glitzy 
image prevalent in glossy tourist brochures and promotional videos. Hollywood 
chic and beach cool this was not. Disneyland wasn't mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants on Wednesday viewed the Eastside's acclaimed murals, learned 
about the Chicano rights movement and were able to talk with area artists, 
activists and even gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad to have a job, that someone gave us a chance," Frank Rangel, a 
25-year-old in baggy shorts and high-top sneakers, told the group. "This is an 
opportunity to make it honestly." 
</P>
<P>
 Rangel and other gang members and ex-gang members are employed at Homeboy 
Bakery, a project of Dolores Mission, the Roman Catholic church and social 
service center in Boyle Heights. One tour participant wanted to know if gang 
rivalries ever disrupted business. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we come past that (bakery) gate," Rangel said, "we're all brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Father Gregory Boyle, acclaimed for his work with gang youth in the 
area, spoke of the pressing need for employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs are the best antidote to crime and gang activity in our neighborhood," 
Boyle told the visitors, who were gathered in a chapel used at night as a 
shelter for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers, who financed the tours through donations, initially hoped to 
attract some of the hundreds of foreign and out-of-town reporters here to cover 
World Cup matches in Pasadena. However, those assigned expressly to soccer 
coverage have expressed little interest, so organizers turned to other 
journalists and people in the tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming days, participants are scheduled to take similar alternative tours 
of the Pico-Union/Koreatown area, Hollywood and South-Central Los Angeles. For 
weeks, residents of the poor and working-class neighborhoods have been meeting 
and devising itineraries designed to highlight their diverse districts, which 
are rarely part of official promotions of the region's $8-billion tourist 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad people have come to see that our community is not as bad as it is 
painted," said Juana Beatriz Gutierrez, a mother of nine who is co-founder and 
president of the Mothers of East Los Angeles, an activist group that helped 
plan Wednesday's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tour bus -- on loan from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- 
cruised down Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles, Jesus Salvador Trevino, a 
filmmaker who was reared on the Eastside, spoke over the intercom about the 
infamous events of Aug. 29, 1970, when protesters and police clashed in what is 
remembered as the largest Chicano demonstration ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Further on in the tour, he pointed out a shuttered synagogue, mute testament 
to Boyle Heights' once-thriving Jewish community -- whose former prominence 
surprised many tour participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The spider web of freeways that converge on the Eastside, Trevino noted, were 
built at the expense of tens of thousands of Mexican American families who were 
forced to move. "The story of Mexican Americans is the story of dislocation," 
Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniel Bernheim, who writes from Los Angeles for the Glasgow, 
Scotland-based Herald, the visit provided a pleasant contrast to his 
media-shaped preconceptions of the Eastside. "I had a certain image from these 
sensationalistic headlines," Bernheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, Bernheim was struck by the volume of people out walking, a rarity 
in car-crazed Los Angeles. "People, even children, aren't afraid of being on 
the streets," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 At Self-Help Graphics, a nonprofit arts center, Margaret Garcia, a 
neighborhood native, was creating a silk-screen print as the visitors arrived. 
"There's a lot more going on here than the stereotypes," Garcia explained. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tour was over, most seemed to agree that they had learned about a 
part of town hitherto obscured in news reports of drive-by shootings and other 
misdeeds. Some, such as Huell Howser, host of a weekly program on public 
television in Los Angeles, said the visit would spur them to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that encourages Angelenos to visit other parts of their city is 
commendable, and very much needed," Howser said afterward, as he and others 
munched on Mexican food from La Parrilla restaurant. "I've met people whom I 
wouldn't have met and seen things I wouldn't have seen if I hadn't been on this 
trip."

JACKSON AND ARSON CASES IN LIMBO; INVESTIGATIONS: GRAND JURY DISBANDED WITHOUT 
BRINGING INDICTMENTS AGAINST EITHER THE POP SUPERSTAR OR TWO FIREFIGHTERS 
SUSPECTED OF SETTING CALABASAS/MALIBU BLAZE. LAWYERS URGE RESOLUTION OF BOTH 
ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers in two high-profile cases -- the investigation of sexual molestation 
allegations against pop superstar Michael Jackson and the probe of the deadly 
Calabasas/Malibu arson fire -- said Wednesday that Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti 
should charge their clients or exonerate them now that a grand jury 
investigating both matters has disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 23 grand jurors ended their term last Thursday without handing up 
criminal indictments against Jackson, who was accused last year of sexually 
molesting a 13-year-old male acquaintance. The grand jurors also took no action 
in the case of Steven Shelp and Nicholas Durepo, two firefighters whom 
sheriff's officials have accused of setting one of the most damaging arson 
fires in Los Angeles history. A new grand jury has been impaneled and could 
take up the work of its predecessor, although officials would not confirm that 
either case is now before it. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have been filed in either case, and defense lawyers said they are 
frustrated that their clients have been left under a very public cloud of 
suspicion for so long -- almost a year in Jackson's case. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters, like Jackson, have denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations against Shelp and Durepo, their lawyers contend, have 
prevented the men from advancing their careers as firefighters. Shelp has been 
taken off active firefighting duties and placed on administrative duty by the 
Los Angeles Fire Department while the investigation continues. Durepo, a 
volunteer with the Manhattan Beach Fire Department, has been placed on unpaid 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm upset. They have to either fish or cut bait," said Donald Calabria, a 
lawyer for Durepo. "They have to let us know so we can defend these guys. If 
they have something, I want to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials named Shelp and Durepo as suspects late last year, asking 
Garcetti to file a criminal case against them. But the district attorney balked 
at immediately filing criminal charges, sending the case back to sheriff's 
homicide detectives for more investigation. Several months later, prosecutors 
began presenting witnesses to the grand jury in an effort to obtain an 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block, while not mentioning Shelp and Durepo by name, has said 
he believes they started the fire so they could put it out and be heroes, and 
increase their chances of getting full-time firefighting jobs as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 2 fire killed three people, caused more than $350 million in damage 
and took days to bring under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Safechuck, a friend of Durepo's, said he has spoken to both firefighters 
recently. "They really don't know what's going on," Safechuck said. "They are 
frustrated. Nobody will say anything to them. They are in limbo. They want to 
know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran, a lawyer for Jackson, also expressed frustration at the 
slow pace of the sexual molestation investigation, and said he plans to contact 
Garcetti soon about resolving the case as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am hopeful there are no new witnesses and that this thing is over," Cochran 
said. He said Jackson, who cut short a world tour last year in the midst of 
intensive media coverage of the allegations, has slowly begun emerging from 
seclusion and is busy recording an album in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would certainly like to have resolution in this matter," Cochran said. "He 
would like to get on with his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing Jackson said they have not heard of, or been notified of, 
any witnesses going before a grand jury in recent months, and they said they 
have seen little, if any, activity to suggest that a criminal investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jackson's mother was brought before the grand jury four months ago, 
Garcetti said he expected to wrap up the Jackson investigation within a month. 
At that time, the entertainer's lawyers were criticizing the slow pace of the 
inquiry, in which evidence was being gathered not only by the Los Angeles 
County grand jury but also by authorities in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Cochran suggested that the emergence of Deputy Dist. Atty. 
William Hodgman as one of the prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson murder case is a 
good sign for his client because Hodgman had been assigned to the Jackson 
investigation and presumably would not be asked to handle both, particularly if 
a prosecution of Jackson was imminent. "I am optimistic about that," Cochran 
said. "But it is pure speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had no comment Wednesday other than to say that both criminal 
investigations are continuing. One source close to the grand jury said the 
Malibu arson case is expected to be brought before the new grand jury within 
two weeks, an indication that authorities are still seeking to establish enough 
evidence to bring criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing such a case to a new grand jury requires that prosecutors virtually 
start over in trying to persuade grand jurors to indict a suspect, although the 
jurors can be provided with sworn testimony from witnesses who went before 
prior grand juries, according to court experts.

ADMISSION WAIVED AT 13 INNER-CITY SWIMMING POOLS; RECREATION: COUNTY HOPES TO 
EASE TENSIONS AFTER COMPLAINTS ABOUT FEES AND ATTACKS ON LIFEGUARDS AT WILL 
ROGERS PARK FACILITY. DONATIONS MAKE UP LOST REVENUE. 
</P>

<P>
 George Delgado, 11, and Darrell Smith, 13, frolicked Wednesday in the cool 
water of the Will Rogers Park pool in Watts, paying no attention to the 
business-suited officials preparing to make an important announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 George and Darrell had already heard the news and were among the first to take 
advantage of the fact that the pool would no longer charge children $1 to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is happy," said George, preparing to make a big splash into the 
water. "Now all my friends can go swimming." 
</P>
<P>
 As he played, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, flanked 
by officials from Shell Oil and the Southern California Gas Co., made the 
announcement that because of corporate donations, Will Rogers and 12 other 
nearby pools will be free to all for the rest of the summer. She also kicked 
off a "Save Our Pools" campaign to raise $500,000 to wipe out fees this year at 
the 14 other county-operated swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign, she said, "will ensure that the neediest patrons using our parks 
will be provided no-cost, free-of-charge access to our pools this summer to 
swim, take swimming lessons or cool off on hot days." 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes after three recent attacks on lifeguards at Will Rogers. The 
violence, though not directly linked to the imposition of pool fees, drew 
attention to neighborhood displeasure with the recently imposed charges of $1 
for children and $2 for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most serious incident, lifeguard Paul Alba was severely beaten after he 
tried to protect a 13-year-old boy apparently being hazed by older youths. Alba 
remains in critical condition at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
Lifeguards have set up a fund for Alba's family at the county Department of 
Parks and Recreation, 433 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles 90020. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old, described by authorities as a gang member, was arrested last 
week on suspicion of being involved in another attack on a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the incidents, Burke met with several corporate officials and 
managed to raise nearly $73,000 to rescind the fees -- $15,000 from Shell, 
$10,000 from the gas company and $48,000 from an anonymous individual donor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main purpose is to help kids swim this summer," Burke said. "We can't 
allow a swimming pool to become a war zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard D. Farman, chief executive officer for the gas company, said that the 
company was intrigued by the idea of helping. "There was an immediate need that 
needed to be filled," he said. "We said 'Let's do it; let's make it happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 More money is still needed to remove the pool fees countywide. The gas company 
has agreed to help coordinate the campaign, targeting 50 to 100 area 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "A $1 admission fee may not sound like much, but many of these pools are 
located in low-income neighborhoods where the kids are hard-pressed to come up 
with a fee," Farman said. The drive will provide money only for this summer's 
fees, he said, adding that next year the county will have to seek a more 
lasting solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hopeful signs, pool attendance at Will Rogers Park was down 
dramatically Wednesday, leading some to speculate that the fees and the 
violence have driven away patrons. Although security has been stepped up, only 
100 children came to the pool, which normally attracts 500 swimmers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are scared after all the problems," said a 13-year-old swimmer. Tom 
Slaughter, an area pool supervisor, said something needs to be done or the 
summer will be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems people are holding back," Slaughter said. "This pool should be 
packed. Maybe the decision to make it free again will help bring the people 
back."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; RESERVOIR TO 
BE CLOSED FOR CHLORINE TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Reservoir will be closed for two days of treatment beginning today, 
during which recreational activities such as walking, jogging and bicycling 
will be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure will be in effect from 6:30 a.m. today until 6:30 a.m. Saturday, 
said Los Angeles Department of Water and Power spokeswoman Debra Sass. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.3-billion-gallon reservoir will be injected with chlorine to control 
algae and bacterial growth that typically occurs in warm summer months and is a 
continuing problem, Sass said. 
</P>
<P>
 The water will be treated with portable equipment that pumps liquid chlorine 
solution directly into the reservoir, she said. Because the equipment will be 
placed on the reservoir's perimeter road, access must be temporarily 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the reservoir will be removed from service, there will be no

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 'TOTMOBILE' WILL DELIVER SPECIAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A custom-built "classroom on wheels" for infant victims of cerebral palsy, 
Down's syndrome and other medical problems is scheduled to begin touring the 
county next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the new "Totmobile" is to bring help and educational services 
to families who live considerable distances from the Santa Ana base of the 
United Cerebral Palsy Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents live too far from our center," said Wendy Briles, the 
association's director of infant services. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the $100,000 portable classroom, which is pulled by a truck, teachers 
from the association can go to schools, parks, health centers and other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll travel all over the county -- wherever our services are needed," Briles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle is staffed by physical, occupational and speech therapists and 
nurses who work with children from birth through age 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The free services are provided for developmentally disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
 A key component of the program is parental involvement, according to Briles. 
Parents are shown how to play their part in teaching the children how to see 
themselves, improve their motor skills and develop cognitive and 
socio-emotional abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are provided in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 Briles demonstrated a computer program that helps children understand 
cause-and-effect relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 By touching various parts of a computer screen, children can electronically 
explore a house and attempt to awaken a sleepy mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle also contains colorful toys, a flannel board for storytelling, 
adaptive chairs and a diaper-changing table, which Briles described as "one of 
our most important features." 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Reyes, the association's infant-center coordinator, said it's "a good idea 
to start them at a very early age" in the program if optimal results are to be 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The association works with 220 infants. Reyes said that number will increase 
when the Totmobile is in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Totmobile, it's really going to help us a lot, especially with South 
County families," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that one mother had to ride three buses to take her child to the 
center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes said the association encourages parents to provide emotional support to 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to talk, to cry, to show any emotions they are going through that 
day," Reyes said. She said each child is different, which makes it challenging 
to address all their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the children show marked improvement in their ability to walk, talk 
and do all the other things children do, it becomes clear that the effort was 
worth it, Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see the progress, it's such a big event for us," Reyes said. "And 
for the parents too." ALAN EYERLY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; 2 GUNMEN 
STEAL $300,000 FROM GUARDS AT RACETRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two gunmen walked into the paddock level at Hollywood Park racetrack in 
Inglewood on Tuesday, handcuffed two guards filling automated teller machines 
and made off with two bags containing a total of $300,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers approached the armored car guards as they put money in the first 
of two machines about 6:40 a.m., took their guns, made them get down on the 
floor and handcuffed them, Inglewood Police Sgt. John Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the racetrack's upper level was not restricted at the time of the 
robbery because, at that time, employees are usually at work and trainers are 
exercising horses, Knapp said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SUSPECTED IN 
KIDNAPING ARRESTED IN UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man suspected of kidnaping and assaulting a Val Verde real estate agent was 
arrested early Wednesday morning at a topless club in Ogden, Utah, when he 
allegedly displayed a handgun to one of the dancers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 26, is accused of abducting Paula Harrington, 26, at 
gunpoint June 29 by posing as a prospective home buyer. She was found three 
days later tied to a bed in a motel in Gila Bend, Ariz., about 70 miles 
southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue also is suspected in an unspecified number of similar crimes, including 
the abduction of a woman and unauthorized use of her credit card last month in 
Wyoming, Mich., a suburb of Grand Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden police officers arrested Shue about 2 a.m. Wednesday at the Ladies of 
Lace club, said Jack Callahan, an FBI spokesman for the Phoenix office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a Las Vegas-style supper club known to feature topless dancers and 
was displaying a pistol to one of the dancers, who reported it to her manager," 
Callahan said, adding that the manager called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, vacationing in Lake Tahoe with her husband, Chris, said she was 
relieved when police officials called her husband Wednesday morning to report 
the arrest. Harrington has acknowledged that Shue assaulted her during the 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so relieved he didn't hurt anyone else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, who has used numerous aliases since becoming a fugitive, was using a 
false name when he was arrested, authorities said. Ogden police found 
identification with his true name while booking him, and a computer check 
revealed federal warrants for fraud and unlawful flight in the Michigan case. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue appeared in federal court in Salt Lake City on Wednesday afternoon on 
charges of fraud and unlawful flight for Michigan incident, said Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Paul Warner. Warner said Shue will be charged in the Harrington kidnaping 
today when a warrant arrives from the FBI in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Extradition issues still have to be determined, but officials said they 
believe the case will be tried in Los Angeles.MARK SABBATINI

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SKINHEAD HELD IN ATTACK 
ON HASIDIC JEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed skinhead was in custody Wednesday after allegedly attacking 
a Hasidic Jew with a pipe on a West Hollywood street. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old victim, Zev Katz of Miami, was struck once in the stomach 
Tuesday before he and a group of friends subdued the assailant. The attack took 
place about 9:15 p.m. near a synagogue where Katz and his friends are working 
as counselors at a summer camp for Russian immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy came out of nowhere yelling, 'I hate Jews! I'll kill you!' " said 
Katz, a rabbinical student, who was treated by paramedics for a minor bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies said the suspect, who refuses to identify himself, appears 
to be about 18. He was being held at the West Hollywood sheriff's station 
Wednesday in lieu of $150,000 bail and was booked on suspicion of committing a 
hate crime and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokesman Rich Erickson said the suspect told investigators that he 
is a skinhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he and fellow counselors at the Chabad Russian Synagogue's summer 
camp were sitting in a car parked outside an apartment they share, waiting for 
other friends. "Everything was quiet and peaceful and then I hear this guy 
beside the car shouting vulgarities and anti-Semitic expressions at us," Katz 
said. "It was frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he got out of the car on the driver's side and that the attacker 
began swinging a three-foot-long pipe and a screwdriver at him as the others 
watched in horror. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed the pipe and then somebody else grabbed the screwdriver, and (the 
attacker) began to run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he and the others chased the suspect for about 150 feet and tackled 
him in an alley, where they sat on him until deputies arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Naftoli Estulin said Katz and the other counselors, who are from various 
parts of the country, arrived a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rude awakening to our normally peaceful neighborhood," he said. "You 
read about this elsewhere, but so far we've had few problems. I would call it 
shocking." RON RUSSELL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; LAPD OFFICER 
PLEADS NO CONTEST TO BATTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer pleaded no contest Wednesday to a felony charge 
for an off-duty incident in which he allegedly rammed an Altadena man's truck 
with his car, then beat up the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Dahl, 49, entered his plea to battery with serious bodily injury.Because 
he has no prior criminal record, Dahl was sentenced under the misdemeanor 
section of the law to 12 days in jail, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Lewis. 
Dahl, who received credit for two days he spent behind bars after his arrest, 
was also ordered to pay $8,129 in restitution to Hang Ba Mai and to give up his 
right to possess a weapon for 10 years, the prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Dahl will probably be forced to resign from the police force, 
Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, the off-duty officer repeatedly rammed into Mai's 
truck at a stop sign on North Allen Avenue in Pasadena in October. When the 
drivers got out of their vehicles, Dahl grabbed Mai, 40, and punched him in the 
face before driving away, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone took down the license plate number of Dahl's car and police arrested 
him a short time later. Neither Dahl or Mai told officers the cause of their 
dispute, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl was charged with one felony count each of assault with a deadly weapon 
and making a terrorist threat and single misdemeanor counts of battery and 
hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
 But the complaint was amended before a preliminary hearing to include the 
battery charge to which he entered his no-contest plea, Lewis said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN WHO 
BILKED INVESTORS OF $30 MILLION GETS 18 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While a capacity crowd of his victims looked on, the former head of a defunct 
South Bay investment company who swindled hundreds of mostly elderly investors 
out of $30 million was sentenced Tuesday to 18 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was sentenced, Morris D. English Jr., 52, former head of the Rolling 
Hills Estates-based Wellington Group real estate investment firm, faced the 
courtroom audience and said: "I'm sorry for what you feel. . . . I'll never 
convince you that I never set out with the intent to defraud any of you." As 
English spoke, some members of the audience shook their heads and whispered, 
"No, no," and called him a liar. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month trial and a month of jury deliberations, English was 
convicted in March on 30 counts of mail fraud, securities fraud, money 
laundering, bankruptcy fraud and criminal contempt. Prosecutors had described 
his company, which was heavily promoted on radio programs, as a classic Ponzi 
scheme in which investors' money was used to pay off old investors and to 
support English's lavish personal lifestyle, including expensive homes, 
airplanes and cars for his son and his girlfriend. Prosecutors called it one of 
the biggest real estate investment scams in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said English's actions had caused one 
distraught elderly investor to commit suicide and many others to lose their 
homes and life savings. 
</P>
<P>
 English also was ordered to pay about $850,000 restitution, but prosecutors 
said it is unclear whether he will be able to pay it. His company's assets have 
been turned over to a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, and several civil 
suits in connection with the company are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal prison rules, English, who has been held without bail since his 
arrest last year, will have to serve at least 85% of his sentence.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; ARCO OFFERS 
$25,000 FOR CLUES ABOUT CLERK'S KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A reward of up to $25,000 was offered Wednesday for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the killer of a Long Beach convenience store clerk 
during a robbery attempt Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalo Garcia, 22, died at the scene of the 1:33 a.m. shooting at an Arco 
AM/PM mini-market at 200 W. Willow St., Arco spokeswoman Annie Reutinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Garcia, also known as Gonzalo Garcia Alvarez, was shot, the suspect 
tried to open the cash register but fled empty-handed, Reutinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as about 19 years old, 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 
weighing 130 to 160 pounds, Long Beach Detective Jorge Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia had worked at the store for two months. Anyone with information about 
the crime should call Cisneros at (310) 570-7244. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward was offered through Arco's Crime Deterrent Program which, since 
1978, has awarded more than $2 million, Reutinger said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON ; COUNCIL APPROVES APARTMENT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial apartment project for low-income tenants was approved by the 
City Council this week despite opposition from city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 for the project, with council members Julie Sa and 
Chris Norby dissenting.As part of the plan, the city Redevelopment Agency will 
loan the developers, KD Housing Partners and Kaufman & Broad Multi-Housing 
Group Inc., $1.6 million toward the $12-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 Norby said he voted against the nonprofit project because it will not have to 
pay Fullerton property taxes. He and Sa also objected to the $1.6-million loan, 
although both liked the project's design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a good deal for the city," Norby said. "I think somebody 
is going to make a great deal of money off it and . . . this is going to take 
the property permanently off the property tax rolls. The city will be denied 
about $17,000 per year." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, however, called it a "quality" project, saying, "You 
can't build a project today without some public-private participation." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael A. Costa, president of Kaufman & Broad, said construction of the 
project will begin in October and be finished in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen people who live near the vacant four-acre project site on the 
north side of Valencia Drive, west of Magnolia Avenue, said they want 
condominiums there instead of the 108-unit apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident, W. Snow Hume said crime would rise because "illegal aliens" 
would live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said the project would enhance the area, which is 
deteriorating and already crime-ridden. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they do not expect crime to increase unless the landlord 
does not make sure the property is maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa said managers will live on the property to make sure the complex is 
maintained and meets city requirements.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; MORE CITY JOBS LOST AS BUDGET IS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the fourth straight year, the City Council has adopted a budget that 
eliminates jobs as it grapples with a multimillion-dollar deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The $46.6-million budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year, approved by a 4-1 vote 
Tuesday, eliminates seven positions and leaves 24 others vacant. Over the past 
four years, the city has reduced its work force by 8%, City Manager George L. 
Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another reduction budget," Tindall said. "We're trying to make up for 
the loss in revenues by reducing our costs. We're living within our means." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 600 employees and 143,000 residents, one of the lowest ratios in 
the state, Tindall said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the job cuts are in the police or fire departments. Among the 
positions eliminated were a clerk, a city planner, an assistant city manager 
and a maintenance supervisor, Tindall said. The positions were vacant, and no 
one was laid off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget does not call for new taxes, but council members are considering 
increasing the fees for a variety of services, such as building permits and 
planning and code inspections. City officials estimate that the new fees would 
bring in $50,000 a year. Council members, however, delayed action on the 
proposal until their July 19 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Dinsen voted against adoption of the budget, saying it 
contains "taxes" disguised as annual fees for water services and street 
lighting. The fees, adopted in 1991, bring about $2 million a year to the city, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blame the city's continued financial difficulties on the poor 
economy, the increasing cost of complying with state and federal mandates 
regarding programs such as recycling and water treatment, and state fund 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Income from sales and property taxes for the coming fiscal year is estimated 
at $39.4 million, while expenses are estimated at $46.6 million, resulting in a 
$7.2-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional expenses for the November general election, maintenance and 
replacement of city equipment and upkeep of city buildings would increase the 
deficit to nearly $8 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of cuts, higher fees, money saved from deferred street repairs 
and shifts of money from other funds to the general fund would cover the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the city's expenses, $21.1 million, will be for police 
services. Fire services account for $9.7 million of the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the budget was drafted under the assumption that the state 
would not take property taxes from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fine, as long as nothing happens," Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater said. 
"There will be some pain if we get hit by the state."BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; NEW LIBRARY TO AFFECT HOURS AT 3 BRANCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Newport Beach prepares for the grand opening of its $8.2-million Central 
Library, officials announced that the smaller branch libraries of Corona del 
Mar, Balboa and Mariners now are closed on Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 The fewer hours help to offset a 7.5% cut in the city's library budget and the 
anticipated operating costs of the new, larger central library.The Central 
Library project was funded with city-issued bonds sold to cover construction 
costs and an endowment made up of private and corporate donations. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; SMOKING MEASURE GOES BACK ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city's on-again, off-again advisory measure on a sweeping smoking ban has 
been returned to the November ballot by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which would prohibit smoking in public buildings, including 
businesses and places of employment, had been removed last month in a move 
initiated by Councilman John M. Gullixson. The smoking ban's biggest proponent, 
Councilman Henry W. Wedaa, was not present at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson proposed an amendment requiring that restaurants set aside 70% of 
their tables for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wedaa first tried to persuade the council to increase the 
amendment's 70% figure to 100%. When that failed, he proposed putting the 
measure back on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the majority of this council needs a huge mandate from the people I would 
rather do that than pass this watered-down amendment," Wedaa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa's proposal was supported by Councilmen Mark Schwing and Daniel T. Welch. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the council voted 3 to 2 to put the measure on the ballot, the 
two sides began criticizing each other in regard to the estimated $10,000 cost 
to do so.  
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa and Schwing said the advisory measure was unnecessary because a 
city-sponsored survey of about 400 residents showed 70% favor banning smoking 
in public places in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gullixson said that before enacting such a sweeping ban, the council 
should hear from more residents than just the 400 who were surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The line between supporters and opponents of the ballot measure has become 
blurry as few council members have voted consistently each time the issue has 
been raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa and Schwing originally voted against an advisory measure. Last month, 
Schwing abstained from the vote to remove the measure from the ballot, and 
Tuesday Schwing and Wedaa voted in favor of returning it to the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson and Mayor Barbara Kiley supported the advisory measure in May, 
favored its removal in June and opposed its return this week. DANIELLE A.

 People wishing to run for three City Council seats in November can pick up 
nomination papers beginning July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The seats held by Mayor R. Craig Scott, Randal J. Bressette and L. Allan 
Songstad Jr. will be contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott has said he will run for reelection, while Bressette and Songstad have 
not yet announced their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members serve four-year terms and receive $300 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomination papers will be available from the city clerk's office, 25201 Paseo 
de Alicia, from July 18 through Aug. 12. The papers must be signed by 20 to 30 
registered Laguna Hills voters and turned in by 5 p.m. Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Mary A. Carlson suggests that prospective candidates set up an 
appointment to take out the nomination papers because the process generally 
takes about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates must file statements of economic interests at the time of filing 
nominating papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, candidates who wish may submit 200-word descriptions of their 
qualifications, which will be included in the November sample ballot. The cost 
for filing such a statement is $650. 
</P>
<P>
 If any incumbent fails to file nominating papers by Aug. 12, the deadline will 
be extended to Aug. 17 for other candidates. LYNN FRANEY

EPA TRIES TO FORCE COMPANY TO DISPOSE OF DDT; ENVIRONMENT: THE AGENCY DECLARES 
THAT MONTROSE CHEMICAL VIOLATED AN ORDER TO GET RID OF TAINTED SOIL. THE FIRM 
SAYS ITS ROLE IS UNPROVEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has declared operators of a 
long-closed South Bay chemical factory in violation of an order to dispose of 
DDT-laced soil dug from a nearby neighborhood, saying the company has declined 
to accept responsibility for the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said Wednesday that they may go to court to try to force 
Montrose Chemical Corp. to dispose of the DDT discovered in the ground behind 
two homes near Torrance this spring. Montrose once operated a major DDT factory 
less than half a mile from the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Montrose said the firm will not immediately comply with the 
order because it believes the federal government has failed to prove that the 
factory was responsible for the DDT contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must continue to disagree with the EPA's conclusions," said Karl S. Lytz 
of Latham & Watkins, the Los Angeles-based law firm representing Montrose. He 
did not, however, rule out the possibility that Montrose may eventually dispose 
of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, an EPA attorney said that unless the standoff is resolved in the 
next few days, the agency may go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA assistant regional counsel John Lyons said it is rare for a company at a 
Superfund site not to comply with an EPA order. The Montrose site is on the 
federal Superfund list of 1,200 of the nation's most hazardous toxic waste 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Montrose's concerns pose a quandary for federal officials, who must 
decide what to do with more than 1,000 tons of tainted soil now sitting in a 
Long Beach storage yard under an emergency permit that expires next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA on June 21 ordered Montrose to dispose of the soil, which officials 
describe as so toxic that it must be incinerated at an estimated cost of $2 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 That order culminated a federal investigation into the source of the chunks of 
DDT -- some as large as a foot across -- that were found mixed with fill soil 
behind two homes on West 204th Street in an unincorporated area east of 
Torrance. The government already has spent more than $1 million to remove the 
soil and to temporarily relocate 33 families, and it is studying whether to 
relocate families permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT is a suspected human carcinogen that can affect the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say they are convinced that the DDT chunks came from the 
now-demolished Montrose factory, where the pesticide was produced from 1947 to 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests of the excavated soil found DDT in such high concentrations that 
investigators concluded it is technical-grade DDT, and they report that 
Montrose was the only plant in California producing that grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil tests also turned up a second chemical, a waste product of the pesticide 
lindane, which was manufactured on the Montrose site from 1956 to 1963, 
according to the EPA. Investigators are still looking into how the DDT got 
buried in the yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose's attorney dismisses the soil tests as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, all evidence cited by EPA is entirely circumstantial," Lytz wrote in 
a four-page letter to the agency dated Tuesday. He lists other potential 
sources of DDT, such as a second pesticide plant nearby, spraying by residents 
and mosquito abatement districts and a nursery once located in the neighborhood 
that reportedly sold technical-grade DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA's Lyons counters that the second pesticide plant did not make DDT. In 
light of the large amounts of high-potency DDT found in the yards, he said, the 
assertion that it came from a small facility is "fanciful at best." 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose has asked that the soil remain in storage so that the firm can pursue 
its own investigation and study solutions. In fact, Lytz says the firm has not 
been granted permission to conduct its own surveys of the soil -- tests that 
the EPA says could cause logistical and safety problems at the storage 
facility.

JUDGE CHANGES PLEA IN CAR ACCIDENT CASE; COURTS: ALBERT J. GARCIA SWITCHES TO 
NO CONTEST WITH NO PROMISE OF LENIENCY. HE FACES UP TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON FOR 
HIT-AND-RUN CRASH THAT KILLED HIS PASSENGER. 
</P>

<P>
 A Compton Municipal Court judge unexpectedly pleaded no contest Wednesday to 
charges that he killed his female companion in a hit-and-run drunk-driving 
accident. He could face up to five years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert J. Garcia, a judge for eight years, entered the plea for his role in a 
Feb. 21 accident in Eagle Rock that killed Josie Smith, a 35-year-old mother of 
three who had told friends she hoped the judge would divorce his wife to marry 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, 46, had pleaded not guilty on March 15 but changed his plea Wednesday 
morning in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Latin said he was unsure why Garcia changed his 
mind because no plea bargain had been arranged. "It's an open plea with no 
promises or offers" of more lenient punishment, Latin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., Garcia's attorney, did not return phone calls seeking 
comment. Garcia will be sentenced Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's Mercedes-Benz went out of control and hit a post Feb. 21 after 
leaving the Ventura Freeway near Colorado Boulevard, witnesses to the accident 
said. Smith, who authorities say was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from 
the vehicle and died after landing on a concrete median. Garcia waited nearly 
four hours before surrendering to police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia won an uncontested election last month for a six-year term beginning in 
January, but the presiding judge of the Compton court, Jerry Johnson, said he 
expects a replacement to be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the state Constitution requires that Garcia be suspended. The 
California Commission on Judicial Performance will decide whether Garcia will 
be suspended without pay. The judge has been on paid leave since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank goodness it's not my call," said Johnson, who considers Garcia a 
friend. "I'm too close to it. . . . I really don't know what my reaction is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a loss for the judicial system -- his personal life aside, he was 
a good judge. You can't take that away from him," said Johnson, who said he 
feels for Smith and her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's sister Angie Montes said she is glad the case does not have to go to 
trial. "Now I'll remember her the way she was," said Montes, who co-managed a 
Highland Park restaurant with her sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a wonderful, happy-go-lucky person, loving, generous," Montes said. 
"This way, that stays clear."

STATE FILES CIVIL CHARGES AGAINST CHARITY GROUP; INVESTIGATION: VALLEY 
FUNDRAISERS IS ACCUSED OF DEFRAUDING THE PUBLIC. JUDGE FREEZES BANK ACCOUNTS 
AND BARS SOLICITING UNTIL HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alleging an "enormous" fraud, state officials have filed charges against a 
charitable fund-raising business, accusing it of illegally soliciting donations 
for charities that do not exist or that never received the money. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a judge froze the bank accounts of Valley Fundraisers and barred 
the firm from soliciting donations until a July 20 hearing on the state's 
charges, contained in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil complaint alleges that Valley Fundraisers and its president, Thomas 
Galambos, defrauded the public in a telemarketing operation that has reported 
raising $2.6 million over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In declarations filed with the complaint, Deputy Atty. Gen. James M. Cordi 
alleged that the Burbank-based firm failed to report donations that it received 
fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordi said Galambos has declined to turn over his financial records, invoking 
his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual procedure, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne issued 
the temporary restraining order without requiring notification of the 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking for the order, Cordi argued that Galambos may try to remove funds 
from his accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The state inquiry followed a Times investigation that disclosed that Valley 
Fundraisers cashed checks for charities that do not exist and real charities 
that it did not represent. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, one of 121 commercial fund-raising firms in California, is licensed 
by the attorney general's Registry of Charitable Trusts to solicit donations 
for three charities registered with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times found that checks made out to more than 30 names were deposited in 
the firm's bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos, in an interview, acknowledged that mistakes were made, but said he 
refunded the donors' money in every case that came to his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibits filed by the attorney general Wednesday included checks made out by 
four alleged victims to 31 different names. Cordi said that 21 of those are not 
registered with the state attorney general as charitable organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he said, the firm failed to report contributions on behalf of any 
organizations other than those it was licensed to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court may . . . infer that such donations were not given to any 
charitable organization," according to court papers. "If these solicitations 
prove to be typical of those conducted generally by Valley Fundraisers, it will 
have perpetrated an enormous pattern of fraud, indeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The civil complaint seeks fines under seven sections of the Government Code 
and Business and Professions Code. They include failure to report charitable 
contributions to the state, false and misleading advertising, unfair 
competition, violating a fiduciary trust to the public, and converting 
charitable funds to private use. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordi is seeking fines of $2,500 for each violation. He said each fraudulent 
check represents a separate violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by The Times' article, the city's Department of Social Services last 
month stripped Valley Fundraisers of its license to conduct charitable 
solicitations within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and the Los Angeles city attorney are continuing criminal 
investigations in the case.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY GIVEN $1,500 TOWARD PIER REPAIR 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown's one-man fund-raising campaign on behalf of the damaged 
Seal Beach Pier is beginning to gain momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 HealthNet recently agreed to give the city a check for $1,500 after Brown sent 
the California health-care provider a letter soliciting donations.It is the 
first corporate donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) called Brown after receiving his letter. She 
pledged to see if any federal grants or loans are available to help repair 
damage caused when a fire burned portions of the pier, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 21 fire caused about $350,000 damage. The damage is covered by 
insurance, but the city must pay a $100,000 deductible -- as it did in 1992 
when a similar fire struck the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to help pay the deductible, Brown has written letters to the 
heads of several major corporations explaining the city's financial problems 
and asked for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he was pleased with the way his campaign has gone so far. But he 
said he hopes HealthNet's donation is just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he expects to hear from several other corporations within the next 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other people considering us," he said. "I am hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that paying the insurance deductible will not prevent them 
from presenting a balanced budget later this summer. But they said the added 
expenses might force additional cuts in city programs. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; VIOLENCE, SIMPSON CASE FOCUS OF TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Irvine Valley College will meet Friday to talk about how the O.J. 
Simpson murder case has affected perceptions about domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence Against Women and the O.J. Simpson Case," a round-table discussion 
organized by the Re-Entry and Women's Center at the college, will be open to 
the public, said Lisa Angers, coordinator of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion will examine how the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman, as well as Nicole Simpson's experience with domestic 
violence, have drawn attention to a nationwide problem. Students will discuss 
the circumstances of the case, women's reactions to it and possible verdicts in 
the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope the talk will help people re-examine relationships between men 
and women and what drives people to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The free discussion will be at the Re-Entry and Women's Center, at Irvine 
Center Drive and Jeffrey Road, from 8:30 to 10 a.m. Call (714) 559-3430.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COUNCIL APPROVES HIKE IN TRASH FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a trash fee increase that will cost most 
residents about $1 more a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 6 to 1 to approve the increase at its Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Daniel H. Young, Lisa Mills, Thomas E. Lutz, Robert L. 
Richardson, Miguel A. Pulido Jr. and Pat McGuigan supported the increase. 
Councilman Ted R. Moreno opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is intended to cover the $550,000 cost of expanding the city's 
recycling program to the entire city, plus $30,000 to offset the cost of 
inflation. Retroactive to July 1, most residents' monthly bills will increase 
from $11.86 to $12.82, said Teri Cable, administrative services manager for the 
public works agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's contract with Great Western Reclamation calls for a fee increase 
once the final phase of the recycling program begins, regardless of whether the 
city passes on the added cost to the consumer. The council's decision to have 
residents pay for the cost makes the program self-supporting, Cable said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the recycling program, residents must keep newspapers separate from 
the trash and bag their yard and kitchen waste separately. The program is part 
of the city's plan for meeting state law designed to reduce the amount of trash 
taken to landfills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That law requires that cities reduce their trash output by 25% by 1995 and 50% 
by 2000. Fines for missing those targets can run as high as $10,000 a day.JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER SELLING PROPERTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District will have a public hearing tonight to 
determine whether to sell Virginia K. Boos Elementary School and a 10-acre 
strip of land next to the joint Finley-Johnson campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at district headquarters, 14121 Cedarwood Ave., at 7:30 
p.m., district spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's Property Advisory Committee has recommended that the board 
approve the sale of the two properties. The 41-year-old Boos campus, at 13890 
Hammon Place, was closed in June and is not expected to be useful to the 
district for decades because of declining enrollment. The strip behind 
Finley-Johnson is also rarely used, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended that the money from the sale of the properties be 
used to create an endowment fund. Interest generated by the fund would be used 
to pay for modernization and deferred maintenance projects.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS RECOGNIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A hospital, a school district and the firm that manages Leisure World have 
been honored by the South County Chamber of Commerce for their environmental 
and conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber annually selects South County companies with successful 
environmental programs in several critical areas, including transportation, air 
quality, water and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Those named this year are the Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, Professional 
Community Management and Saddleback Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills hospital retrofitted its electrical lighting, saved water by 
installing new shower heads in patient and employee quarters and designed 
landscaping and irrigation systems to maximize water use. 
</P>
<P>
 To help reduce air pollution, the hospital uses electric trams for 
transportation in its parking lot and runs a successful employee ride-share 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 18 months, Saddleback Memorial has also reduced its landfill trash 
by one-third through recycling of refuse ranging from printer cartridges to 
kitchen fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional Community Management, a Laguna Hills firm which manages the 
Leisure World retirement community, used innovative methods to motivate its 
employees to participate in the firm's environmental programs. Bimonthly 
drawings offered cash, gift certificates, days off with pay and preferred 
parking spots for employees who car-pooled to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified School District was honored for its recycling 
program, including the opening of a neighborhood recycling center on one 
campus. Recycling drives also raised money for toys for low-income children. 
The district also made ecology a required subject, instituting environmental 
studies at all grade levels.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; PANEL REJECTS PLAN FOR TEEN NIGHTCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a teen nightclub have been turned down by the Planning Commission, 
which feared the potential for crime and gang problems if the alcohol-free 
dance club was allowed to open. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappointed applicants say they will probably not appeal the 4-0 
decision. Commissioner Timothy Watson was absent from Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to come down hard on the commissioners because they have a tough 
job, but yes, we are very disappointed," club backer Kathy Petrasich said. "But 
it was worth the effort to try and find something for kids to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Shout West, the proposed dance club and billiard hall, would have taken over a 
vacant restaurant building in a shopping plaza on Marguerite Parkway near Avery 
Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrasich and Les Wilson, the other backer of the 600-person-capacity club, 
had proposed establishing an alcohol-free nightspot for youths 16 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 However, from the start, city officials expressed concerns about security, 
hours of operation, the possible mixing of juveniles with adults at the club 
and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing last month, Shout West promoters were given a list of 
potential problems to correct by Tuesday's meeting. Planners said they did not 
hear back from the applicants until the commission meeting was underway. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the project began to slip away, they said they were willing to change the 
hours and enhance the security plan," Commissioner Sherri Butterfield said. 
"But by then, I had lost some confidence in their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we are going to hear again that Mission Viejo hates teen-agers. But I 
think we protected the youth of Mission Viejo" by rejecting the nightclub 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrasich said she and Wilson felt it would be a waste of time to revamp their 
proposal because commissioners were clearly against the nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that their minds were made up," she said. "They were afraid of 
gangs and knifings and shootings. No matter what was said, we weren't going to 
get (project approval) anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 No members of the community stepped forward to support the proposal before the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little surprised in that," Petrasich said. "We contacted a lot of 
people who said they would come down to the meeting and speak" on behalf of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed that nobody showed," she said.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; BUDGET CUTS SPENDING BUT NOT CITY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave final approval this week to a $16.3-million budget for 
the next fiscal year that decreases spending while maintaining or expanding 
current services. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending is down 18% from last year's budget, primarily in the area of major 
park and street improvements due to the completion of the $3.3-million Sea 
Country Senior and Community Center, which opened June 25. 
</P>
<P>
 One of this year's main projects in that portion of the budget will be the 
creation of Colinas de Capistrano Park at a cost of $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Police services spending will increase by 1% in fiscal year 1994-1995, as the 
city pays $213,000 for two additional sheriff's deputies to patrol Laguna 
Niguel. Police Chief Joseph Davis said the two new deputies are needed because 
of population growth and increased commercial development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the budget, the council authorized spending $35,000 to implement 
a "Shop Laguna Niguel" marketing program along with the Laguna Niguel Chamber 
of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 Casey said the city expects property tax revenue to fall by $120,000, but 
sales tax revenue to rise by $200,000 thanks to the opening of several new 
restaurants and a Mervyn's department store. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also appropriated $200,000 to be used for planning studies on 
future uses of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, in conjunction with other 
South County cities. Any specific use of the money in that fund will have to be 
approved by the council. LYNN FRANEY

WITNESS JAILED IN SANTA ANA SLAYING IS FREED; COURTS: MAN WHO REFUSED TO 
TESTIFY BEFORE THE GRAND JURY IN THE DEATH OF A TEACHER'S AIDE IS RELEASED WHEN 
THE PANEL IS REPLACED BY NEW MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Santa Ana man jailed as a reluctant witness in a gang-related killing of a 
local teacher's aide has been released from custody after 13 months, a 
prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Azevedo, 21, was held in contempt of court for refusing to testify 
before the Orange County Grand Jury about the February, 1992, killing of Joel 
Davalos, who was gunned down at a back-yard birthday party in a tragic case of 
mistaken identify. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Azevedo's testimony is critical to the prosecution of 
suspects. One suspect remains at large, while another was freed because of 
insufficient evidence. A third suspect was killed in a separate gang shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner had no choice but to 
release Azevedo when the 1993-94 grand jury stepped down last week after its 
year of service, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark A. Sevigny said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors could bring Azevedo before the new grand jury in an effort to 
compel him to testify, but Azevedo has shown no willingness to talk even though 
he was given immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was let go," Sevigny said. "At this point, we could not proceed with the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 Davalos and his wife, Sylvia, both 21, were celebrating at a friend's birthday 
party when gunmen burst into the back yard of the friend's home, opening fire. 
Sylvia Davalos was critically wounded, but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect the victims were mistakenly believed to be rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The senseless attack outraged county residents -- and prosecution was 
troublesome from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they suspected that Azevedo drove the gunmen to the crime 
scene, but did not witness the shooting. Azevedo initially told Santa Ana 
police that he sat outside while gunfire erupted, but a judge ruled that his 
statements were inadmissible after Azevedo alleged he was coerced by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder charges were originally filed against Azevedo; Artemio Rios, 22; Luis 
Plascencia, 21, and Joseph Florencio Arvizu, 21, all reputed gang members or 
associates. Arvizu, who was never arrested in the killing, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were dropped against the three others because of insufficient 
evidence. They were refiled against Rios and Plascencia, but dropped again when 
Azevedo refused to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, Brenner took the rare step of jailing the witness until he 
agreed to testify before the grand jury against the remaining defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Frederick McBride had opposed the jailing of his client from 
the start, arguing that Azevedo was being unfairly punished. McBride could not 
be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1993, Rios was killed in a gang-related shooting. Sevigny said law 
enforcement officials have not given up hope of prosecuting the case and are 
still looking for any witnesses or other information that can assist them.

GIRL BURNED WHEN FIREWORKS IN HER PANTS POCKETS IGNITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old girl suffered minor burns Wednesday when fireworks in her pants 
pockets ignited as she sat down on them in a movie theater lobby, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster girl, who was not identified because of her age, was treated 
at the scene for burns to the back of one leg and taken to a local hospital for 
brief observation before being released, Westminster Fire Capt. Robert Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently she sat down and somehow they ignited," Martin said. "They started 
a small fire in her pants and caused first- and second-degree burns, which are 
fairly minor." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl told firefighters she was carrying the fireworks in her rear pants 
pocket at a movie theater at the Westminster Mall. Just before 5 p.m., the 
fireworks, known as "poppers" went off as the girl sat down, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal in California, the fireworks contain a small amount of gunpowder and 
make a cracking sound when slapped against a hard surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl and her friends extinguished the fire by the time Martin arrived to 
treat her, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't happen every day," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said fire prevention investigators were looking into the incident.

RESIDENTS ASSAIL REVELERS, POLICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH CITY 
COUNCIL HEARS VIEWS ABOUT CROWD CONTROL USED DOWNTOWN DURING THE FOURTH OF 
JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council got an earful about how the Police Department handled rowdy 
revelers during the Fourth of July weekend, with some residents praising the 
crowd-control efforts and others condemning police tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 260 arrests were made over the holiday weekend -- from Friday night 
to Monday night, Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said in his report to the 
council Tuesday evening. Nearly 100 arrests were made from noon Monday to early 
Tuesday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came up with a plan and carried out that plan," Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10:30 p.m. Monday, police reported revelers burning furniture in the 
streets and throwing firecrackers, bottles and rocks at officers and cars. But 
at the time, Lowenberg said, "We did not have a riot. At best, we had an 
unlawful assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the half a dozen residents who addressed the council criticized 
police for taking a strong-arm approach to breaking up the crowds -- clubbing 
bystanders, drenching revelers with water from a truck to disperse them from 
the area and confiscating unlicensed bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents praised the law enforcement tactics, which also included 
asking downtown businesses to close in an effort to clear the area of crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The council took no action after the public's comments.  
</P>
<P>
 Diane Easterling, co-chairwoman of the Downtown Residents' Assn., in 
addressing the rowdiness by some, said "Huntington Beach is no longer going to 
tolerate weekends from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Wolfe, also a co-chairwoman of the association, praised police. "The 
people down here don't want to take this garbage anymore, so we're going to 
work hard to make improvements. . . . We're going to look for future 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Others charged that police tactics agitated people and made matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Righeimer, 35, of Fountain Valley said he and a friend were having beer 
and pizza at the Huntington Beach Beer Co. at Main Street and Walnut Avenue and 
witnessed a water truck spray people on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the water truck came, it incited the whole thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Righeimer said he saw police chase people with batons and kick one man in the 
stomach who had fallen on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they think that's good police work, that's wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim King, 19, of Midway City said in an interview Wednesday that he was struck 
by an officer with a baton before the disturbance broke out, resulting in a cut 
to the left side of his face that required 15 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very angry," King said, adding he was hit twice with the baton and kicked 
in the buttocks. He said he suffered a mild concussion and a bruised tailbone. 
</P>
<P>
 King said he was walking north on Main Street and was leaving the area as the 
street was being sprayed with water. He contended that police did not issue any 
warning to clear the area and that he wasn't doing anything wrong to warrant 
being struck with a baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Allie Gonsowski, 17, of Huntington Beach said in an interview Wednesday that 
she was hit across the face by an officer with a baton and received serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonsowski said she suffered a fractured jaw and teeth were loosened -- one was 
knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't provoke them in any way. . . . I know the riot squad means 
business," said Gonsowski, who was downtown with a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 She said they decided to leave because they saw a truck spraying people with 
water. As they walked to her car, Gonsowski was struck by the officer, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost most of my respect for police now," she said. "I don't know what 
made them do this to me. How can you respect them when they did this to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said at the council meeting that the 
city will not condone excessive force by police officers, and if people believe 
they were unjustly treated, they should notify his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to tell us, and it has to be proven," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said he supports the police effort and believes that officers used 
necessary force to get the crowds under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson also supported the police.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer suggested that, in an effort to stave off problems next 
year, the council should examine adopting stiffer penalties for people who 
possess and set off firecrackers, urge neighboring cities to ban the sale of 
fireworks, and send letters to property owners and alert them about tenants who 
have loud parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Andriet, owner of Huntington Beach Beer Co., told council members that 
he agreed to shut down his business when disturbances broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything to assist the police was worth the sacrifice in a few extra income 
dollars," he said, adding that restaurant patrons left quickly and quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston Villalba, owner of Hurricane's Bar & Grill at Main Street and Walnut 
Avenue, said he also had no problem with closing his business. "Most of the 
people wanted to leave but were afraid to leave because police were outside 
with batons hitting people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Haddad, 30, who lives in Huntington Beach and was on his bicycle 
downtown Saturday morning, complained to the council that he was harassed by 
officers who he described as "unprofessional, demeaning and degrading." 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad said he was stopped by police for allegedly running a stop sign. "They 
were bent out on giving everybody tickets," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hoisington,owner of Team Bicycle downtown, charged that police 
unnecessarily confiscated bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was extremely unfair," Hoisington said. "Bicycles were taken from good 
people who had no reason to lose their bike. The great majority of bikes they 
took were not from troublemakers -- most of them were from good, upstanding 
residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said that about 250 bicycles were confiscated from riders who didn't 
have a city-required license. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoisington added that impounding bikes was a fruitless effort: "It did nothing 
to stop any violence. In fact, it may have instigated more violence. The police 
just made the Fourth of July a confrontation instead of a celebration."

LACK OF FUNDS, SPONSORSHIP PUT END TO HOLIDAY PARADE; PAGEANT: THE GROUP, WHICH 
INCLUDES THE TIMES, THAT STAGES THE DECADE-OLD CHRISTMAS EVENT IN SANTA ANA IS 
DISSOLVED. POOR ECONOMY IS CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a heavy financial burden and lack of sponsors, the board of directors 
that runs The Times Orange County Holiday Parade in Santa Ana has voted to 
dissolve the corporation that has staged the annual Christmas season pageant 
for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the economy the way it is, companies are looking harder and harder at 
budgets, and parade-type funding is the first thing to go," said Ruben Smith, 
the parade's board president. "It's been tough the last few years and we didn't 
want to end up in a situation with creditors not being paid." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, the event has been known as The Times Orange County 
Holiday Parade. The Times and Kaiser Permanente were the main sponsors, but 
dozens of other companies, such as Chrysler Corp., Ralphs, and Great Western 
Reclamation, have participated in promoting the parade since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lots of folks contributing, but those amounts were going down each 
year," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, which attracted about 80,000 people last year, cost about $500,000 
to operate each year. The Times provided $100,000 of those operating expenses, 
and Kaiser Permanente put up about $35,000. But other sponsors were hard to 
come by and the parade ran deficits the past few years, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In ending the parade, Smith said, the board has paid off all its debts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, parade organizers moved the event from downtown Santa Ana to the 
South Coast Plaza area in a bid to attract a larger crowd and sponsorship by 
merchants in the area. Last year, the board of directors altered the mission 
statement of the parade, making it a celebration of ethnic diversity throughout 
Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a grand tradition," Smith said. "Last year, we wanted to really unite 
the county, so we brought in various groups from all the different cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Santa Ana originally ran the parade -- called Toys on Parade -- 
back in 1983, and continued to be a major contributor to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sad for all of us involved with the parade and all those who have 
enjoyed it over the years, especially the children," Smith said. "But there 
comes a time when the financial burden is too great and shutting down is the 
only prudent thing to do."

JUDGE EXCLUDES TESTIMONY OF 4-YEAR-OLD; HEARING: THE CHILD WAS THE ONLY WITNESS 
TO AN ALLEGED BEATING OF HER TWIN BROTHER. HE SUFFERED SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So small that most courtroom observers could see only her blond curls in the 
box as she testified, the sole witness to an alleged beating that left her twin 
brother severely brain damaged squirmed Wednesday as a prosecutor tried to coax 
her into telling what she saw. She is 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Thivener sang into the microphone, asked for her mother and said, "I 
want to see Jason." She looked at pictures of Jason, her brother who is in a 
vegetative state -- perhaps permanently -- from his injuries. She occasionally 
glanced toward Fateheen Rahman, the man charged with attempted murder in the 
alleged beating. 
</P>
<P>
 But she seemed afraid. She wouldn't tell Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin 
D'Agostino what she, and she alone, had seen, despite the prosecutor's gentle 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's sleeping," Jessica said before trying to run from the witness stand. 
"Is Jason hurt?" D'Agostino prodded, and the child replied "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked how Jason was hurt, Jessica said, "I don't want to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Her reluctance left Van Nuys Municipal Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers little 
choice but to exclude the child's testimony. Nevertheless, following a daylong 
preliminary hearing, Silvers held Rahman -- who says Jason hurt himself by 
falling against a coffee table -- for trial on attempted murder and child 
endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, away from the courtroom and safe in the arms of her mother, Jessica 
again was asked what happened to Jason. "Fateheen," she said, grabbing a toy 
clown by the neck and hurling it forcefully to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Silvers ordered Rahman, a 22-year-old native of Bangladesh, held on $500,000 
bail. She also ordered him not to call or write the twins' mother, Tammi 
Thivener, 25, of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Thivener said she blames herself for leaving her 
children with Rahman because she was suddenly called in to work at the 
department store where he was a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 She had planned to marry him, she said, but "I don't have any feelings for him 
right now. I can't believe that someone so loving, so nice, could do something 
so horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedic Dennis Archie testified that Rahman told him that the children had 
been playing and that Jason stopped breathing when Jessica sat on him. Archie 
also testified that he saw Rahman "strike the baby with his fists, harder than 
you or I would." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Irene Frizzell testified that Jessica had earlier 
told her that Rahman had choked them. The child first demonstrated by putting 
her hands around the detective's neck, Frizzell testified. Later, she grabbed a 
Barbie doll by the neck and threw it to the floor, Frizzell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frizzell testified that the day after Jason was injured, when she interviewed 
Rahman in the Van Nuys jail, he "was crying and distraught." He told her then 
that on the day of the injury, he was tired and was trying to sleep on the 
couch, but the children were crying. He said he spanked them, and that made 
them cry more. The detective said he told her that he shook Jason, who broke 
free and accidentally banged his head on a marble coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his brain injury, Jason will probably spend the rest of his life 
"in a vegetative state," and his prognosis for recovery is "grim," testified 
Dr. Antonio Galvis, a pediatrician at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. The 
4-year-old underwent surgery for the second time Tuesday, so doctors could 
install a permanent shunt to drain from his skull the fluid that gathers there 
because of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Galvis, who was on duty at the hospital when Jason arrived by helicopter June 
12, said the boy's brain was swelling so quickly his life was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason was bruised on the left side of his head, neck, face and ear. Tiny blood 
vessels in his face had ruptured, indicating he'd been choked, Galvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned by defense attorney Richard S. Plotin, Galvis said he doubted Jason 
received his injuries by falling against a coffee table. He said the boy's 
injuries were the type he usually sees "only in the ones who fall from 
buildings or are in automobile accidents."  
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, Thivener said she holds her son for hours at the hospital. 
It's the only thing that seems to calm his whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he cannot respond to stimuli and is in a vegetative state, "He's 
lying there, his eyes are open, and he's crying," said Thivener. "I know he's 
in pain, that he feels everything, every poke," she said. "He needs a miracle. 
They said he'd die. For him to still be alive is a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Plotin said outside court that Rahman felt so remorseful that Jason was 
injured under his care that he wrote Jason a letter. "He expressed his remorse 
and said he was sorry. He said he loved Jason and hopes he gets better," the 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels devastated and ashamed," Plotin said. "He never intended any injury. 
This is a tragedy for everybody concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thivener: "Maybe he didn't mean to do it, but he still did it."

WILSON DROPS OPPOSITION TO PRICE-GOUGING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signaling a reversal of its earlier stance, the Wilson Administration has 
withdrawn opposition to a bill outlawing the type of widespread price gouging 
that surfaced following the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Consumer Affairs said last week the governor's office 
supported the department's opposition to a bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) limiting price increases to 10% for one month following a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a position criticized by consumer advocates, the department said 
businesses should be able to raise prices by 50% to recoup financial losses 
suffered in an earthquake, flood, fire, riot or other serious calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday -- in the wake of charges by the Consumers Union that the Wilson 
Administration was more interested in protecting businesses than consumers -- 
the Department of Consumer Affairs said it now supports the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In further examination of the bill, we've decided that the 10% is just fine," 
said Louis Bonsignore, department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that we all want to see passed," Bonsignore said. "We want 
a good strong anti-price gouging bill in the state of California. Quite 
frankly, it's just a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union spokeswoman Mariko Takayasu said: "They were wrong on this 
issue right from the beginning, and I'm glad they've come to their senses. It 
was bad public relations on their end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Katz bill was one of two price-gouging measures the Senate Judiciary 
Committee passed Tuesday night, sending them on to another committee for 
further scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The second bill, by Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles), 
gives added protection to homeowners approached by contractors who go 
door-to-door drumming up business. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonsignore said his department will be satisfied with two changes Katz has 
indicated he will make in his measure. First, the department seeks a reduction 
in the proposed penalties for price gouging from $10,000 to a range of $1,000 
to $10,000; second, the department seeks to eliminate a portion of the bill 
calling for the automatic license revocation of contractors who violate the 
proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gov. Pete Wilson's office sought to distance Wilson from the 
Department of Consumer Affairs stance on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no decisions made," said Sean Walsh, spokesman for Wilson. 
"Not until we see where the legislation ends up and the governor has had a 
chance to review it will a position be taken."

FUND-RAISING FIRM CHARGED IN FRAUD CASE; COURTS: JUDGE BARS BURBANK COMPANY 
FROM SOLICITING CHARITY DONATIONS UNTIL A JULY 20 HEARING ON THE STATE CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alleging "an enormous fraud," state officials have filed charges against a 
charitable fund-raising business, accusing it of illegally soliciting donations 
for charities that do not exist or which never received the money. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges that Valley 
Fundraisers and its president, Thomas Galambos, defrauded the public in a 
telemarketing operation that has reported raising $2.6 million over the past 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In declarations filed with the complaint, Deputy Atty. Gen. James M. Cordi 
alleged that the Burbank-based firm failed to report donations it received 
fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordi said Galambos has declined to turn over his financial records, invoking 
his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cordi's request, a judge on Wednesday froze the firm's bank accounts and 
barred it from soliciting charity donations until a July 20 hearing on the 
state's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual procedure, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne issued 
the temporary restraining order without requiring notification of the 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking for the order, Cordi argued Galambos may try to remove funds from 
his accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The state inquiry followed a Times investigation which disclosed that Valley 
Fundraisers cashed checks for charities that don't exist and real charities 
that it did not represent. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, one of 121 commercial fund-raising firms in California, is licensed 
by the Attorney General's Registry of Charitable Trusts to solicit donations 
for three IRS-registered charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times found checks made out to more than 30 different names had been 
deposited into Valley Fundraisers' bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos, in an interview, acknowledged that mistakes had been made, but said 
he corrected every one that came to his attention by refunding the donor's 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibits filed by the attorney general on Wednesday included checks made out 
by four alleged victims to 31 different names. Cordi said that 21 of those are 
not registered with the California attorney general as charitable 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, he said, the firm failed to report contributions on behalf of any 
organizations other than those it was licensed to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court may. . .infer that such donations were not given to any charitable 
organization," the statement said. "If these solicitations prove to be typical 
of those conducted generally by Valley Fundraisers, it will have perpetrated an 
enormous pattern of fraud, indeed." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the alleged victims, Frederick J. Schroeder, was quoted in Cordi's 
statement as saying the telephone solicitor told him that she was an unpaid 
volunteer calling on behalf of her sister who was a nurse at Childrens Cancer 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil complaint seeks fines under seven sections of the Government Code 
and Business and Professions Code. They include failure to report charitable 
contributions to the state, false and misleading advertising, unfair 
competition, violating a fiduciary trust to the public and converting 
charitable funds to private use. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordi is seeking fines of $2,500 for each violation. He said each fraudulent 
check represents a separate violation. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier actions prompted by The Times' article, the Los Angeles Social 
Service Department last month stripped Valley Fundraisers of its license to 
conduct charitable solicitations within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the state and the Los Angeles city attorney are continuing criminal 
investigations in the case.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CITIZEN GROUP WANTS AIRPORT NOISE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens advisory committee has decided to request a feasibility study on 
ways to reduce helicopter noise generated by Van Nuys Airport, including route 
changes, restrictions on hours of operation and minimum altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council Tuesday night 
generated fiery debate, with various factions painting dark scenarios of what 
would happen under measures they oppose.  
</P>
<P>
 One homeowner said his group may be forced to sue the council. A helicopter 
operator said he would fight hour restrictions "to the death," and a resident 
-- not to be outdone in hyperbole -- warned that competing interests could make 
the San Fernando Valley "like Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every community in this Valley is divided against other communities -- and 
the Valley loses," said former council member Wilford H. Ross. "We shouldn't 
think of ourselves as living in Encino, Valley Village, Studio City, Sherman 
Oaks or Van Nuys -- we live in the Valley. And if we don't understand that, 
we're like Yugoslavia."  
</P>
<P>
 The council itself was divided in voting to request the study, with six 
members casting yes votes, three abstaining and two opposing. 
</P>
<P>
 In adopting the motion, the council decided to ask the Los Angeles Board of 
Airport Commissioners to request the Federal Aviation Administration and the 
Los Angeles Department of Airports to determine the feasibility of six 
noise-reduction strategies.  
</P>
<P>
 The measures include routing helicopters over the Ventura Freeway, requiring 
helicopter pilots to increase their altitude south of the airport over the 
Sepulveda Basin and designating a radio frequency for helicopter communications 
at Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposals the council wants studied are the establishment of a minimum 
advisory altitude of 1,000 feet over the Santa Monica Mountains and Hollywood 
Hills, restrictions on choppers' hours of operation and the setting of minimum 
altitudes for police and fire helicopters when they are not engaged in patrol 
or emergency operations. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; RESIDENTS WANT 75-FOOT TOWER BUILT ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a letter of both praise and pleading, and Neil Fitzpatrick of AirTouch 
Cellular allowed himself a chuckle at the completeness of its irony. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sentence the writer expressed awe at the wonder of her cellular 
telephone -- and in the next sentence she asked AirTouch to please not place a 
cellular transmission tower in her Northridge neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was perfect," Fitzpatrick said of the letter. "People like the benefits 
but don't realize some of the things that go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the proposed 75-foot tower -- to be placed on land belonging to 
the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church, near the intersection of Balboa Boulevard 
and Plummer Street -- say it's less an issue of fickleness than concern for the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use all the modern conveniences (including a cellular phone), so I know 
that we need the utilities," said Goldie Weis, who lives less than a block away 
from the proposed site. But "we would like to keep this a residential 
neighborhood," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch says a tower is needed in the area to improve service and keep up 
with the boom of cellular phone users. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say there are plenty of other places to put it, including commercial 
sites outside their quaint neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis and neighbor Patty Perry have sent other residents letters encouraging 
them to oppose the tower -- the subject of both an upcoming Los Angeles 
Planning Commission hearing and an informational meeting at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said there is a "myriad of reasons" to be concerned about the proposal. 
Residents fear the tower would lower property values, as well as open the door 
to more commercial operations in the residential area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she added, "We don't know what the health risks are." 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phones can be operated on the move because their signal is picked up 
by one "cell" and passed to another as a dialing driver, for example, heads 
down the road. If the caller moves into an area without a cell, or with a cell 
loaded to capacity, the signal is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick said the tower proposed for the Northridge site, a 60-foot 
mono-pole with attached antennas that will extend to 75 feet, would not be a 
Gargantuan metallic eyesore, but more like a large light pole one might see at 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had a large gathering of people, you'd get more energy than you would 
from this," he said, noting that the human body produces a small electrical 
field. He added that many basement-run ham radios operate at higher power 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hear arguments on a conditional use permit for 
the tower July 25 at 1 p.m. at the Sherman Oaks Women's Club, 4808 Kester Ave. 
Officials from both the church and AirTouch Cellular will meet with residents 
Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the church, 9400 Balboa Blvd. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: AIR IS GETTING CLEANER, AQMD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're breathing a little easier this summer, it's no surprise to the folks 
at the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Southland's smog problems have not entirely blown over, the 
number of Stage One smog alerts -- when ozone reaches .20 parts per million and 
people are advised to avoid vigorous outdoor activity -- has steadily decreased 
during the last 10 to 15 years, said Joe Cassmassi, an AQMD senior 
meteorologist.  
</P>
<P>
 Stage Two alerts, when ozone reaches .35 p.p.m. and everyone is advised to 
avoid outdoor activity, have been virtually eliminated. The last Los Angeles 
Stage Two alert was in 1988. The last San Fernando Valley Stage Two alert was 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Basinwide, Cassmassi said, Stage One episodes have decreased by about four a 
year. If that trend continues, he said, Angelenos could witness the end of the 
Stage One alert by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an ongoing program of controls that has been in place for several 
decades now," Cassmassi said. "That combined with the turnover in the auto 
fleet toward cleaner cars has been responsible for the improvement we've seen 
to date." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, which saw no Stage One alerts in Reseda, Burbank, Lancaster and 
Downtown, was the cleanest year on record, Cassmassi said. The improvements 
were probably a result of trends in air quality combined with the El Nino 
weather pattern, which favors cleaner air. This year, without the help of El 
Nino, AQMD expects anywhere from 30 to 34 Stage One episodes over the course of 
the smog season, which runs from late May to mid-October. Stage One Smog 
Episodes Stage On smog alerts are steadily decreasing in the Los Angeles Basin. 
There has not been a Stage Two alert sinice 1980. The AQMD predicts an end to 
the Stage On alert by the end of the century if the trend continues. Note: 
Several communities had no alerts in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993. Source: South

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; JUDGE ALLOWS GROUP TO VIDEOTAPE LANDFILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens' group was given court approval Wednesday to videotape the Sunshine 
Canyon Landfill site to assess the destruction at a forest the group is 
fighting to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge granted the North Valley Coalition of Concerned Citizens a court order 
allowing its members to videotape and photograph the forested area north of 
Granada Hills, where an estimated 1,000 California live oak trees were cut down 
recently to prepare for the dump's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry du Soleil and another coalition member were kept from videotaping at the 
site Friday by employees of landfill operator Browning-Ferris Industries, du 
Soleil said. In response, the group sought a court order allowing members to 
enter and make a visual record, coalition attorney Rosemary Woodlock said. 
</P>
<P>
 A forester from the group and du Soleil, a professional filmmaker, are 
scheduled to visit the landfill with cameras Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Los Angeles Superior Court judge who made the ruling on the 
videotaping also halted the tree-cutting last week at the landfill, just four 
days after it began. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for a long-sought expansion of the landfill, crews immediately 
began leveling the trees after a Los Angeles County Regional Planning 
Commission panel gave approval to the plan June 23. The coalition quickly filed 
suit and Judge Diane Wayne issued a temporary injunction. The judge will decide 
Tuesday whether to leave that injunction in place or lift it and allow the 
deforestation to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Although BFI argued against allowing the group to videotape the site, BFI 
spokesman Arnie Berghoff said Wednesday's ruling was not a major setback for 
the landfill. ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BLOOD SUPPLY DROPS TO SERIOUS SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in less than a year, regional blood supplies have dipped 
to a critical low, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's looking very serious," said Cheryle Babbitt, who heads blood donation 
services for the organization's Southern California Region."Usually, there is a 
slump in the summer, but not this early. We are very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt said vacations and school holidays often make summer donations 
sluggish, but the existing blood supply is usually sufficient to handle the 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the region's supply never fully recovered from a serious nationwide 
shortage in January caused by harsh winter weather and a severe flu virus. At 
the same time last summer, Babbitt said, the Red Cross had about three days' 
worth of blood. The current supply is less than is needed for one day. 
</P>
<P>
 The desired supply for the most common blood type, 0-positive, is about 1,200 
units. Now, the Red Cross has only about 178 units of type O-positive on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross blood donation center in Van Nuys, which supplies 22 hospitals 
in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, usually has at least 275 units 
of blood in stock. On Wednesday, there were less than 60. 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in donating blood can call the Red Cross for the nearest 
donation site at (800) 974-2113. SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PTA VOLUNTEERS SAVE SCHOOLS $2.5 MILLION

<P>
 Volunteers who work with 17 parent-teacher associations affiliated with the 
Glendale Unified School District saved the district $2.5 million in its 1993-94 
fiscal year, according to a report released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials computed the savings using the number of volunteer hours -- about 
125,391 -- recorded by the associations for the 1993-94 school year multiplied 
by a $20 value Price Waterhouse gave each volunteer hour, said Glendale Council 
PTA President Susan Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, who drafted a report announcing the savings to the Board of Education, 
added that the number of hours volunteers donated to the district in 1993-94 
translates into 113 six-hour employees, or 63 full-time employees, who worked 
an average of 2,000 hours each. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers reflect the value of volunteers in terms of dollars not spent 
by the district to educate students," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first PTA council began sending volunteers into Glendale schools in 1910 
when the city was divided into several smaller districts, said district 
spokesman Vic Pallos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Council PTA, the governing body that oversees all 25 PTAs serving 
the district's 28 schools, started computing the value of volunteer hours in 
the 1992-93 school year, Pallos said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; NEW MAYOR AWAITS VIEWS OF 'CUSTOMERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Burbank Mayor Bill Wiggins heads City Hall in the same way he runs his 
metal-finishing company in Glendale: stressing the need to keep costs down and 
emphasizing a close working relationship with those around him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two months since he became mayor, Wiggins has developed a reputation as 
an accessible consensus-builder who is still learning the ropes but is trying 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, questionnaires he refers to as "customer service satisfaction" 
surveys will be mailed to Burbank's 93,000 residents in an effort to learn how 
well city government is performing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the results are in, the mayor hopes to hear firsthand about residents' 
concerns in five planned neighborhood summits similar to President Clinton's 
town hall meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think city government works well. I'd just like to bring the community and 
city government closer together," Wiggins, 45, said Wednesday from his City 
Hall office. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, the part-time job of mayor is rotated once a year among the 
council's five members. The city's chief administrative officer is paid as much 
as individual council members -- about $830 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 A political novice and father of two, Wiggins based his 1993 campaign for a 
council seat on the fact that he had no previous experience in local 
government. Two other newcomers, Dave Golonski and Susan Spanos, were also 
elected. There were no incumbents in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few months after last year's election, the three council 
members attended a series of weekly study sessions to acquaint themselves with 
the various city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins earns high marks from colleagues for his willingness to listen to 
their opinions before expressing his own during Tuesday night council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some say his lack of political background is a noticeable drawback. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins said he sees public service as an opportunity "to give a portion of my 
time back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never been involved with the city. I didn't know one department head. I 
didn't know the city manager," the Toluca Lake native acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take the time to go through the educational process of learning and 
using staff as a resource, I don't see a detriment to learning on the job. I 
think the biggest part of my job has to do with listening to other people."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; FOOD PROGRAMS OPEN AT 2 CHARTER SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest giant step away from the mammoth Los Angeles Unified School 
District, the San Fernando Valley's two charter schools will begin running 
their own breakfast and lunch programs today. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a year of unresolved bargaining with the school district, the 
Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in Pacoima and Fenton Avenue Charter School 
in Lake View Terrace announced last week that they would take over fiscal 
control and legal liability of their cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin the program, both year-round schools decorated their newly remodeled 
lunchrooms with balloons and posters and printed expanded menus. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials said the plan still hinges on clarification from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is new for us, new for the state and new for the feds," said district 
business manager David Koch. "We are trying to be as accommodating as possible, 
but there is a certain amount of prudence and precaution that is mandated in 
this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials want assurance from the federal government that the 
district will not be held responsible for the charter schools' actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter schools receive public funding, but are free from state and local 
education regulations to write their own rules. Most of the approximately three 
dozen charter schools operating in the state pay their districts for food 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 But officials at Vaughn and Fenton say they are entitled to run their own 
lunch and breakfast programs. Fenton Principal Joseph Lucente estimates the 
cost of running the program will be about $300,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 With their independence, both schools hope to reduce waste, increase eating 
time and boost student enthusiasm for meals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, students who were eligible for free lunches -- more than 90% at 
each school -- were given tickets at the beginning of the year that had to be 
presented at each meal. Hundreds of tickets were lost every week, slowing down 
food lines while administrators verified names. Now, both schools will serve 
free breakfast and lunch to every child, using a bar code system instead of 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, instead of having just two choices for entrees at lunch, children will 
have five. Breakfast used to be cold cereal. Now, it includes sausage biscuits, 
muffins and breakfast burritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators kept pizza, chicken nuggets and hamburgers as menu mainstays, 
but changed the layout of the lunchroom to encourage students to eat a variety 
of fruits and vegetables. SUSAN BYRNES

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; NEW REDEVELOPMENT ZONE IS EXAMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has taken its first official look at a plan to 
create a new redevelopment zone to give long-term help for businesses hit by 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The council gave preliminary approval to the plan to create the 57-acre 
redevelopment zone along the city's eastern border after a public hearing in 
which no one from the public spoke.A second public hearing will be held July 18 
before the council approves the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest W. Glover, head of GRC Redevelopment Consultants, the Diamond Bar firm 
hired by the city to conduct a study on the plan's feasibility, told the 
council that two town hall meetings have been held on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The area included in the proposed redevelopment zone is primarily commercial 
and industrial. During the 40-year life of the zone, the plan could generate 
"tens of millions" of dollars in funding for projects to enhance business in 
the area, Glover said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was drawn up to help the city's businesses affected by the earthquake 
that were not in existing redevelopment zones. The amount of money that would 
be raised through the zone is hard to estimate, Glover said, because of 
fluctuating property values. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a plan on how to spend an additional $900,000 in 
earthquake relief aid earmarked for businesses, homeowners and residents who 
had not received the help they needed elsewhere. ED BOND LOS ANGELES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; 2 MEN SHOT AFTER FOLLOWING VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On their way to a fast-food restaurant Monday, Greg Peterson spotted a carload 
of women on San Fernando Boulevard in Burbank and urged his buddy, John Mejia, 
to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 The two friends, riding in a Buick Regal sedan, trailed the white car onto the 
Golden State Freeway until the Burbank Boulevard exit.Peterson had hoped to 
exchange words with the women, Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
 What the men got instead were shots fired at them from the car that initially 
caught their eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, 21, of Burbank was hit in the leg as he got out of the Buick at a 
stoplight and jogged toward the women, Burbank police said. Mejia, 19, of Sun 
Valley was shot in the shoulder as he briefly stepped out of his sedan to help 
his friend. Both were taken to Thompson Memorial Hospital and released the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the long hair, but didn't see any faces," said Mejia, who is married 
and the father of a 1-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no reason to get shot. He was just trying to pick up girls and I got 
shot for just helping him pick up." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still searching for the white car, described as either a Honda or 
Hyundai, which fled west on Burbank Boulevard and apparently carried one or two 
men obscured from view by the women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they were shot," Burbank Police Detective Jose Duran said. 
"I'm thinking these people (in the white car) were being followed as they were 
getting off the freeway and it may have been they felt threatened." VIVIEN LOU

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; AMNESTY PROGRAM FOR PARKING TICKETS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That old parking ticket crumpled up under your passenger seat can now be paid 
at its original fine, without penalties, through a one-time amnesty program 
approved by the Glendale City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The program allows those who were cited on or before April 30 to pay for 
parking tickets, some of which have doubled or tripled, to the city for $25 
before Aug. 31 and $30 before Sept. 30.  
</P>
<P>
 If parking violators fail to answer the city's amnesty letter by Oct. 1, the 
tickets will return to the higher fines and penalties. Motorists will then 
answer to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires payment of 
overdue tickets before a driver can register a vehicle again. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief James Anthony recommended that the council initiate the amnesty 
program to clear up a backlog of unpaid tickets that occurred after the city 
took over collection of parking citations from the county 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the driver has ignored the original ticket and a subsequent 
notice warning the motorist to pay or face penalties that are added to the 
original fine and accrue over time. Parking citations are delinquent if they 
are not paid within 30 days of the date issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department issues between 70,000 and 110,000 parking tickets each 
year -- 20,000 to 30,000 of which are never paid by violators, representing a 
loss of almost $500,000 to the city in uncollected penalties, according to a 
report written by Police Lt. Ray Edey. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 30% of the parking tickets issued in Glendale in the last 18 months -- 
about 30,000 citations -- have not been paid, with most maturing to a fine of 
more than $60, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the unpaid citations are for meter violations that have an $18 
fine, parking in a no-parking zone, which carries a $30 fine, and parking for 
too long in a limited time zone, which has a base fine of $25, Edey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate the amnesty program will cost the city $4,100 in printing 
and postage fees. The city expects to collect anywhere from $50,000 to $400,000 
from those who take advantage of the one-time offer to pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 Overdue fines collected will go into the parking fund to be used to pay 
salaries for traffic engineers and to support programs that include parking lot 
maintenance. JENNIFER OLDHAM

MAN FACES MURDER CHARGE IN '93 SHOOTING DEATH; CRIME: ARREST WAS LARGELY RESULT 
OF INFORMATION GATHERED THROUGH REWARD AND EFFORTS OF VICTIM'S FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An Arleta man was charged Wednesday with the April, 1993, shooting death of a 
Chatsworth man originally believed to have been killed in an attempted 
carjacking that took place within two miles of a fatal carjacking carried out 
at about the same time, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Frias, 24, who had been sentenced to prison only last month for murder 
in another case, was booked on suspicion of murder Tuesday at the Van Nuys 
jail, said Detective Jim Rahm of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Thomas MacDowell, a 32-year-old aspiring filmmaker and a popular 
bartender at the L.A. Cabaret Comedy Club in Encino, was shot to death on April 
21, 1993, at about 3 a.m. while parking his car at his girlfriend's apartment 
near the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Hesby Street. After the 
shooting, MacDowell managed to drive another 100 feet into an alley, where 
police found his body about 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fired the fatal shots through the driver's side window of 
MacDowell's 1987 BMW in what was believed to be a carjacking attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently by coincidence, that same morning, William Edward Fliehmann, a road 
worker, was killed when he was thrown from a construction company truck by his 
assailants at the Victory Boulevard entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway. No 
arrest has ever been made in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Frias was accompanied by an unidentified accomplice during 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of speculation at the time, but we believe it was a robbery," 
Rahm said, disputing the notion that the incident was a carjacking. "I don't 
think the police ever said it was a carjacking, and we investigated it as a 
street robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County district attorney's office Wednesday filed one count of 
murder with special circumstances against Frias in the Van Nuys branch of the 
Los Angeles County Superior Court, said Shellie Samuels, a deputy district 
attorney handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels said the special circumstances -- the fact the killing was committed 
during the commission of another crime, and Frias' previous murder conviction 
-- may cause the district attorney's office to seek the death penalty in the 
case. On June 27, Frias was sentenced to 18 years to life for a murder 
committed in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Frias was built primarily with information provided by 
several people who contacted investigators hoping to collect a $25,000 reward 
offered by the Los Angeles City Council, Rahm said. 
</P>
<P>
 That reward was supplemented by a $5,000 offer made by MacDowell's friends, 
who held a press conference last April on the first anniversary of his death to 
renew interest in the case. Media coverage of that conference coupled with the 
reward money helped investigators solve the case, Rahm said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A newspaper article appeared April 28, 1994, and within about one week we got 
a phone call and met with the first person," he said. Several calls offering 
information about the crime were received, said Rahm. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family members said Frias' arrest is a relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked with my mom a little while ago, and she is non-reactive, laid-back 
person, and I can't tell you what it's like to hear her cry every time I talk 
with her," said John MacDowell, the dead man's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a day that goes by that I don't see my brother, and I will think 
about him every day for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fantastic about the whole thing," said Gil Sotelo, a friend who helped 
organize the news conference and the supplementary reward. "When someone who 
you know is murdered, it's a lot harder when you don't why or what exactly 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Frias and the accomplice may have followed MacDowell from the 
night club to his girlfriend's apartment building, where they attempted to rob 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators will not release details of what happened on the night of the 
killing, but a gold chain they believe belonged to MacDowell was found near the 
crime scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for a preliminary hearing for Frias, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was arrested for MacDowell's murder, Frias was convicted of 
second-degree murder in the June 28, 1993, death of Torrance Stephenson, a 
27-year-old Sun Valley man who had challenged Frias and other men who were 
gathered at Slavin Park in North Hollywood, Samuels said. Frias shot the 
unarmed man six times and claimed self-defense because he believed that 
Stephenson, a known gang member, was carrying a gun, Samuels said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MCKEON WILL TRY TO BLOCK ELSMERE CANYON DUMP 
PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: HIS BILL AIMS AT PROHIBITING A CRUCIAL LAND SWAP. BUT 
COMPANY OFFICIALS DOUBT IT WILL SUCCEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Environmentalists' fight against a proposed dump in nearby Elsmere Canyon 
reached new heights Wednesday when Congressman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa 
Clarita) said he would try to block the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Elsmere Canyon as a backdrop, McKeon held a press conference that was 
also attended by about 50 area residents. A local environmental group later 
stunned the crowd by releasing dozens of balloons, which can be harmful to 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the 190-million-ton landfill, proposed by BKK Corp., call for a 
complex swap of land now owned by the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But McKeon said he would introduce a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives 
next week prohibiting the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the proposal to use part of Angeles National Forest as a landfill 
"bad policy -- it sends the wrong message. It is not OK to destroy our 
environment and trash our national forest." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said his bill would prevent the U.S. secretary of agriculture from 
transferring any land within the Angeles National Forest out of federal 
ownership for use as a solid waste landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials oppose the dump, claiming it would harm the air and underground 
water supply in surrounding areas and reduce property values.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson welcomed McKeon's help. "Up until now it 
has been a local issue," he said. "This lifts it up to a level that's much more 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 However, those behind the landfill predict McKeon's bill will not stop the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it will impact the process at all," said Ron Gastelum, BKK 
chief administrative officer. "The U.S. Congress normally frowns on special 
interest legislation like this. And this is obviously aimed at Elsmere." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Gastelum said that this late in the current session, he doubted 
that Congress would get to McKeon's bill before next year. By then, Gastelum 
said BKK expects that the environmental review of the project will have been 
completed and the company will have addressed or dispelled many of the 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Save the Angeles Foundation, an environmental group, released the 
balloons over the canyon, a murmur passed through the crowd. Most 
environmentalists oppose balloon releases because the litter can be 
accidentally swallowed by animals causing them to choke to death. 
</P>
<P>
 But most activists here were unwilling to criticize one of their own for the 
mistake. McKeon's people also sounded startled about the release, but reluctant 
to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the overall message is that we care about the environment," said 
Armando Azarloza, a field deputy for McKeon. "There's a greater issue here, 
more than the balloons." 
</P>
<P>
 The most candid response came from Keefe Ferrandini president of the Save the 
Angeles Foundation, who organized the event and candidly admitted the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrandini said a small child approached her immediately after the balloons 
were let go, saying it wasn't a good idea to release them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned something today," admitted Ferrandini. "It is an example of how 
delicate the earth is and how easy it is to inadvertently threaten it."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CENTER STAGE; EXOTIC DANCE CLUB OPENS AMID 
COURT BATTLE WITH LANDLORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley area's only exotic dance club opened for lunch for 
the first time Wednesday, despite a legal battle with Newhall Land & Farming 
Co., its landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Junction: A Gentleman's Club had hoped to feature all-nude dancers. 
Newhall, however, obtained a court order last week that has forced women who 
work there to wear bikinis until the dispute with Newhall is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall, which owns the building at the intersection of Interstate 5 and 
California 126, hopes to keep Castaic Junction from ever offering nude dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 men wandered into the club's neon pink and green lounge during the 
noon hour, where a 22-year-old dancer performed onstage in a green thong bikini 
that left little to the imagination. Most lunchtime customers said they had 
heard about the nonalcoholic club and just came by to check it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably just have a couple of cranberry juices and be on my way," said 
Clark, a 41-year-old television engineer who -- like all of the other customers 
interviewed by The Times -- declined to give his last name. 
</P>
<P>
 Several customers came to the club by themselves. Some of them sat as close to 
the stage as possible, while others watched discreetly from the back, as they 
ate lunches ranging from a $3 order of onion rings to a $7.50 steak dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasmin, a young woman who works as a dancer and bartender at the club, said 
she answered a newspaper ad for the jobs and has no reservations about working 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I see this as a kind of art," she said. "I like doing it. I like 
showing off my body. I have a lot of confidence in my body." 
</P>
<P>
 Jasmin said she also runs a day-care center out of her Palmdale home. She said 
parents who drop their children off know about her "other" profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really don't think anything of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many customers said they would not return to the club unless all-nude 
dancing or alcohol is offered. A manager at the club said alcohol is prohibited 
with all-nude dancing, but that they will very likely be forced to serve 
alcohol to ensure survival if the restraining order is upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land has said it was not told by Castaic Junction owner Stuart Cadwell 
that he planned to offer exotic dancing when he leased the building. The 
company has also said the lease prohibits "lewd or offensive" entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadwell said he did not know there were any restrictions on the type of 
entertainment he could offer when he signed the lease. "I honestly didn't know 
what kind of entertainment we would offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land, said Wednesday the company 
also considers the club inappropriate for a "family oriented" community. In the 
past, the club's building has housed popular, family oriented eateries, 
including Castaic Landing and the Blue Moon Restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 Some local residents have said they oppose exotic dancing being offered in the 
area, and some Castaic Junction customers said they understand that concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice conservative valley . . . a bit removed from big city things," 
Clark said. "If someone opens (an exotic dance club) here, what's to stop the 
next person?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cadwell said he decided to offer exotic dancing about three weeks ago after 
considering other forms of entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 He said calls he has received from residents since the club opened on a 
part-time basis last week have been "overwhelmingly supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 Cadwell said he met with Newhall representatives Wednesday, but they failed to 
resolve their differences. A hearing on the restraining order is scheduled July 
15 in Van Nuys Superior Court. The club featured all-nude dancing when it 
opened Thursday night, but Newhall Land obtained the temporary restraining 
order the next day. The club was open evenings during the weekend before 
beginning daytime hours Wednesday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 WOMEN ARRESTED ON DRUG POSSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Lancaster women who authorities believe supplied methamphetamine to 
dealers in Thousand Oaks have been arrested on suspicion of possession of the 
drug for sale, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Cosby, 31, and Rosa Marie Rodriguez, 34, were arrested late Tuesday at a 
fast-food restaurant on San Fernando Road in Santa Clarita, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were arrested while attempting to deliver a pound of methamphetamine with 
an estimated street value of $73,000 to an undercover Ventura County sheriff's 
detective, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests followed a three-month investigation in which detectives traced 
drug sales from street dealers to the two women, who they suspect are wholesale 
suppliers, said Sgt. Gary Pentis of the Ventura County sheriff's East Valley 
narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses where the women lived in Lancaster, on Norberry and Cedar streets, 
were searched after the arrest, and evidence of drug dealing was found, 
including scales, a ledger, several ounces of methamphetamine and $6,300 in 
cash, Pentis said. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies aided the search. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were booked into Ventura County Jail but released late Wednesday on 
$20,000 bail each. Pentis said an investigation was continuing and more arrests 
are likely.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALGAE TREATMENT CLOSES RESERVOIR FOR 
RECREATION UNTIL NOON TODAY; WATER: COMPLAINTS ABOUT A STRANGE TASTE AND SMELL 
HAVE LED OFFICIALS TO TRY TO RID CASTAIC'S UPPER LAKE OF GEOSMIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State water officials will close Castaic Lake's main reservoir to the public 
until noon today while they treat the lake for algae that have given an 
unpleasant taste to the drinking water it provides to parts of Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopter crews will dump 16,000 pounds of copper sulfate into the lake in 
hopes of removing a musty taste and odor that some water customers have 
complained about. 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures and abundant nutrients in the water have spurred the growth 
of algae, known as geosmin, which aren't dangerous but produce the foul taste 
and smell. 
</P>
<P>
 Treating the lake isn't expected to solve that problem completely. But the 
goal is to kill as much of the algae as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, geosmin cannot be removed from water during the filtration 
process and Castaic Lake is too large -- and the algae too widespread -- to 
attempt to eradicate it in the reservoir," said Mark Beuhler, water quality 
director for the Metropolitan Water District.  
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir, or upper lake, was treated with copper sulfate in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The MWD and California Department of Water Resources requested the temporary 
lake closure. Officials from both agencies say the water is safe to drink even 
with the algae, even if it doesn't smell or taste very good. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of Southern California residents receive a portion of their 
drinking water from Castaic Lake. The Metropolitan Water District draws water 
from the Castaic reservoir and the Colorado River, in turn providing it to 27 
water agencies that include city, county and municipal water districts in Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the lake to the public for only a few hours will still have a 
"significant impact" on the 2,500 people who use the upper lake area daily for 
fishing, boating, water-skiing and jet-skiing, said Brian Roney, acting 
superintendent of the Castaic Lake Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Roney said three-fourths of those who use the lake normally come early in the 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 Lake officials balked at earlier MWD plans to shut down the reservoir last 
Friday, leading into the busy Fourth of July weekend, Roney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the water agencies are unsure if they will need to close 
the lake again soon for additional treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a natural phenomenon," said Roseanne Danyluk, public information 
officer for the Department of Water Resources. "I don't think it's something we 
can predict."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE TEEN-AGER FATALLY SHOT DURING DISPUTE 
OUTSIDE MALL; VIOLENCE: SECURITY AT ANTELOPE VALLEY COMPLEX HAS BEEN STEPPED UP 
IN THE WAKE OF THE ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 16-year-old Palmdale youth was fatally shot during a confrontation outside 
the busy Antelope Valley Mall, the only enclosed shopping center in the 
fast-growing area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Efrain Pablo Brito stepped out of a car at 7:45 p.m. Tuesday during an 
argument with youths in a second vehicle. When he approached the white compact, 
he was shot once in the upper torso by someone in the second car, Sheriff's 
Deputy Irma Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brito's friends drove him to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, where he died 
at 10:13 p.m. Local school officials said Brito was a 10th-grade student at 
Littlerock High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide investigators were searching Wednesday for the unidentified gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not known what the victim and the suspect were arguing about," Becerra 
said. "At this point, the case is not being investigated as gang-related. But 
it is believed that the victim and the suspect knew each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was not the first serious crime to occur at the Palmdale shopping 
center, which is also one of the high desert's most popular public gathering 
places. The mall has been the scene of several violent robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, a security guard exchanged shots with gunmen who took at least 
$700,000 worth of jewelry from a mall store. A month later, an armored car 
guard shot two men who tried to rob him while he was carrying a bag of money 
inside a mall department store. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday's incident in the north parking lot is believed to be the first 
fatal shooting ever to occur at the mall, which will be 4 years old in 
September. The center has five large department stores and 125 other 
restaurants and smaller shops. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, all mall merchants received a memo about the fatal 
shooting, and security patrols in the parking lots were stepped up, said Ruth 
Ann Moore, the mall's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Moore issued a public statement that characterized 
the slaying as "an isolated incident that could happen at any time and place in 
our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Denham of the sheriff's Antelope Valley Station agreed. "It is not a 
crime-ridden mall," he said. "It is a very family oriented atmosphere. People 
should not allow a single incident to keep them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting made some shoppers and merchants jittery, while others viewed the 
killing as a tragic aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me pretty nervous," said C. J. Gill, 26, a saleswoman at Gary's Tux 
Shop. "Usually, we feel pretty secure because the security office is right next 
door." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Lavigne, 28, a clerk at Kits Cameras, said she plans to exercise ever 
more caution than usual after working a late shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a safe place," she said of the mall. "'But when we walk out at 
night, we try to walk in a group." 
</P>
<P>
 Three young Palmdale residents who described themselves as "mall dwellers" 
said the mall was an unlikely location for violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have a bad reputation for violence," said Erik Will, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's ever messed with me here," added David Reyes, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel Morales, 18, agreed: "I've never gotten into any trouble here. I feel 
pretty secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey Hilliard, 18, a frequent mall visitor who brought along her 5-year-old 
sister Elizabeth on Tuesday, said she had never seen any mall crimes more 
serious than shoplifting. The shooting, she said, will not keep her from 
returning.

EPA TRIES TO FORCE COMPANY TO DISPOSE OF DDT; ENVIRONMENT: AGENCY DECLARES 
MONTROSE CHEMICAL CORP. IS IN VIOLATION OF ORDER TO GET RID OF TAINTED SOIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has declared operators of a 
long-closed South Bay chemical factory in violation of an order to dispose of 
DDT-laced soil dug from a nearby neighborhood, saying the company has declined 
to accept responsibility for the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said Wednesday that they may go to court to try to force 
Montrose Chemical Corp. to dispose of the DDT discovered in the ground behind 
two homes near Torrance this spring. Montrose once operated a major DDT factory 
less than half a mile from the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Montrose said the firm will not immediately comply with the 
order because it believes the federal government has failed to prove that the 
factory was responsible for the DDT contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must continue to disagree with the EPA's conclusions," said Karl S. Lytz 
of Latham & Watkins, the Los Angeles-based law firm representing Montrose. He 
did not, however, rule out the possibility that Montrose may eventually dispose 
of the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, an EPA attorney said that unless the standoff is resolved in the 
next few days, the agency may go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA assistant regional counsel John Lyons said it is rare for a company at a 
Superfund site not to comply with an EPA order. The Montrose site is on the 
federal Superfund list of 1,200 of the nation's most hazardous toxic waste 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Montrose's concerns pose a quandary for federal officials, who must 
decide what to do with more than 1,000 tons of tainted soil now sitting in a 
Long Beach storage yard under an emergency permit that expires next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA on June 21 ordered Montrose to dispose of the soil, which officials 
describe as so toxic that it must be incinerated at an estimated cost of $2 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 That order culminated a federal investigation into the source of the chunks of 
DDT -- some as large as a foot across -- that were found mixed with fill soil 
behind two homes on West 204th Street in an unincorporated area east of 
Torrance. The government already has spent more than $1 million to remove the 
soil and to temporarily relocate 33 families, and it is studying whether to 
relocate families permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT is a suspected human carcinogen that can affect the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say they are convinced that the DDT chunks came from the 
now-demolished Montrose factory, where the pesticide was produced from 1947 to 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests of the excavated soil found DDT in such high concentrations that 
investigators concluded it is technical-grade DDT, and they report that 
Montrose was the only plant in California producing that grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil tests also turned up a second chemical, a waste product of the pesticide 
lindane, which was manufactured on the Montrose site from 1956 to 1963, 
according to the EPA. Investigators are still looking into how the DDT got 
buried in the yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose's attorney dismisses the soil tests as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, all evidence cited by EPA is entirely circumstantial," Lytz wrote in 
a four-page letter to the agency dated Tuesday. He lists other potential 
sources of DDT, such as a second pesticide plant nearby, spraying by residents 
and mosquito abatement districts and a nursery once located in the neighborhood 
that reportedly sold technical-grade DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA's Lyons counters that the second pesticide plant did not make DDT. In 
light of the large amounts of high-potency DDT found in the yards, he said, the 
assertion that it came from a small facility is "fanciful at best." 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose has asked that the soil remain in storage so that the firm can pursue 
its own investigation and study solutions. In fact, Lytz says the firm has not 
been granted permission to conduct its own surveys of the soil -- tests that 
the EPA says could cause logistical and safety problems at the storage 
facility.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
$148.6-MILLION CONTRACT AWARDED IN PORT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Harbor Commission has awarded a $148.6-million contract 
for what it described as the largest dredging and landfill project in the 
nation, one that will create nearly a mile of new berths for the Port of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The awarding of contracts to a joint venture of Great Lakes Dredging & Dock 
Co. and Connolly-Pacific Co. was able to proceed after the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers approved permits for the dredging of three miles of new navigation 
channels.The corps also agreed to pay $60 million of the initial cost of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year dredging project will begin in August and create 4,200 jobs, 
according to port officials. It will also form a new, 265-acre land mass south 
of Pier 300 on Terminal Island that will be dubbed Pier 400.

TIMING IS EVERYTHING FOR PARKS; HE KNOWS A BIG SEASON COULD PUT HIM IN LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Duke basketball player Cherokee Parks listened closely as, one by one, the 
names were read off at the NBA draft last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal's Jason Kidd to the Dallas Mavericks, with the second pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's Grant Hill went third, to the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's Eric Montross to the Boston Celtics, with the ninth pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Parks be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marina High standout, Parks prepares for his senior season at Duke 
knowing he could be an NBA lottery pick next year. Or will he? 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: Parks is one of 16 college basketball players who began workouts Tuesday 
at UC Irvine in preparation for the Goodwill Games July 23-28 in St. 
Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: Of the 26 players on past U.S. Goodwill Games rosters, 25 have gone on 
to play in the NBA. The only one who hasn't is former Duke guard Tommy Amaker, 
who was selected in the third round by Seattle but went on to become an 
assistant coach at his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Those facts may weigh in Parks' favor, but for all his talent and skills, the 
6-foot-11 center could be far from a lock as a lottery pick. 
</P>
<P>
 A prep All-American, he struggled as a freshman at Duke and was the target of 
constant criticism from teammate Christian Laettner. 
</P>
<P>
 He improved over the next two seasons, playing on the gold-medal winning 
under-22 world championship team last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior last season, he averaged only 14.4 points and 8.4 rebounds as the 
Blue Devils reached the NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scouts have wondered if Parks will be quick or strong enough to make an 
impact in the NBA, and his size and skills have forced him to decide between 
playing center and power forward. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks has played in two of the last three NCAA title games and has held 
his own in a tough Atlantic Coast Conference. Time will tell if he's ready for 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times Staff Writer Mike Reilley, Parks reflects on 
his past, discusses the present and ponders his future at Duke . . . and 
beyond: THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you consider yourself an NBA lottery pick right now? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's a matter of me going out and asserting myself this year. Skill-wise I 
think I can be a high pick, maybe a late lottery pick. I'm not saying that with 
any cockiness. I'm just saying I wouldn't be a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski plans to play you more at power forward in your 
senior season. Is that the position you see yourself playing in the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I'm stuck between a four (power forward) and a five (center). I would have 
to put on weight to play center and I'm not comfortable yet playing power 
forward. It depends on what team would want to put in some time with me. I 
would definitely be a contributor there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Your draft status is going to depend a great deal on your senior year. What 
do you need to improve on to play at the NBA level? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I would like to get my rebounds and blocked shots up there. I'm trying to 
put a little weight back on. I played last season at 247 pounds, but I'm down 
to 230 right now and I feel a lot better at this weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does your weight have much of an impact on your game? 
</P>
<P>
 A. In my case, yes. I've tried and tried to add weight, but I don't have the 
frame for a big body. The 15 pounds I lost were just straight off the gut, all 
fat. I took three weeks off (before Goodwill Games practices) and figured I 
would fall flat when I came back. But I feel great. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year before the season started, I would just grub on every meal to put 
on weight. I would just throw stuff down my throat. All that weight bogged me 
down. The main thing now is to get in the weight room and get stronger and not 
worry about the weight. I'll still be able to bang inside, but I'm not going to 
be throwing bodies around in there. That's just not going to happen with me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. A year from now the NBA draft will have just ended. How do you think you 
would look in a Toronto Raptors uniform? 
</P>
<P>
 A. From the way Toronto fans treated the Blue Jays after they won, I would 
like to play there. They love their athletes there. And it would be great to 
play for a team in its inaugural year. You couldn't beat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Where would you like to play? The Clippers and Lakers will probably be 
lottery teams next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yeah, it would be ideal to play in California -- the Clippers, Lakers, 
Golden State, Sacramento. Toronto would be nice too. And so would New York. I 
have a lot of friends there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Past Duke teams have looked to Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley and Grant 
Hill for leadership. This year, you're the guy. How will you handle this new 
role? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I think I can do so much more next year than I have done in the last couple 
years. The main thing, and I talk to Coach K about this a lot, is that I'm 
always afraid that I'll do too much. I'm always wondering if it's a good shot 
to take at that time, instead of just going out there and playing. Coach K has 
never had a player he has had to get on about shooting the ball as much as he 
has me. He gives me the green light and tells me, 'Whenever you get the ball, 
shoot it.' 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like I'm lacking confidence in my skills, it's just timing, knowing 
when to do what. I've never been thrust into a position where I've been a 
force. Next season, I'm in that position. I have to step up. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do you want to be remembered at Duke? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I just want to keep up what we've done in the past. We would like to be ACC 
champs again. And we want another shot at the Final Four. I've played on two 
Final Four teams and one NCAA championship team. I want to play on another one. 
</P>
<P>
 And I have some personal goals. There are certain awards I still want to win 
in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Such as the John Wooden Award (as college basketball's top player)? 
</P>
<P>
 A. You said it. Not me. THE PRESENT 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Many draft analysts said the Dallas Mavericks made a mistake taking Jason 
Kidd instead of your college teammate, Grant Hill. If you were Dallas' general 
manager, what would you have done? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I don't know, but I think Dallas' Jimmy Jackson and Jamal Mashburn do some 
of the same things Grant does, so I think that's why (the Mavericks) went with 
Jason Kidd. 
</P>
<P>
 I definitely think Grant was the best player in this year's draft. By far. He 
has the best all-around game. I play against him every day, and he's so hard to 
stop. He has so many things in his game . . . it's so much more suited for the 
NBA than college. One-on-one, you can't stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Best in the draft? 
</P>
<P>
 A. You can't base Grant's year on his stats. He did so much more this year 
than he has been accustomed to doing. He grew a lot, and that helped him 
prepare for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to Detroit couldn't be a better situation for Grant. It's a team that 
needs some help, and he's excited about going there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Another Duke teammate, Antonio Lang, is headed to the Phoenix Suns. How do 
you think he will fit in with Charles Barkley? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Tony will do well there. He's the same as Grant, he knows his role. He'll 
go to the coach and say, 'What do you want?' and he'll do whatever the team 
needs him to. He has come a long way with his jump shot and he has developed 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You played against North Carolina center Eric Montross for three years. The 
Boston Celtics raised some eyebrows when they took him with the ninth pick. A 
good pick or a bad one? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I don't know the Celtics' exact situation with Robert Parish. From playing 
against Eric, I know he's tough and can bang inside, but he's not going to be 
the guy who's explosive in any category. He won't be your top scorer, rebounder 
or shot blocker. If Parish is leaving, they'll need a guy who can give them 15 
to 18 points and seven to 10 boards a game. So I don't know how Eric is going 
to fit in there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Speaking of players you know, there's an interesting story in Sacramento 
with Bobby Hurley's comeback from severe injuries he suffered in a car 
accident. Where were you when you heard Bobby was hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I was pulling an all-nighter, studying for a test. We caught it on CNN at 
about 2 or 3 in the morning. First thing I did was call Coach K and he told us 
they had taken Bobby to the hospital. It was a shock to all of us. Here's a guy 
we had played with for a couple years, and now he's suffered a career- or 
life-threatening injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no doubt in my mind he would try to come back and play ball. He 
was always one of those players who can run all day. Last time I talked to him, 
he said his body felt good, but it was hard to do a lot of conditioning because 
of the collapsed lungs from the accident. Once those heal up, there's no reason 
why he won't be back in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You'll be heading to St. Petersburg, Russia, soon for the Games. How's your 
Russian, and how will you handle the international style of play? 
</P>
<P>
 A. My Russian's not good at all. Actually, I took a Russian history class and 
a socialism and communism class. I kind of know what's going on over there. 
This should be an interesting trip. 
</P>
<P>
 And practicing with the top players in the country each day will improve my 
game. It's a different style of play overseas (international rules). That's the 
hardest thing -- adjusting to the wider lane, the ball can get tapped out of 
the cylinder and the players usually get away with an extra step or two. THE 
PAST 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Arkansas' Scotty Thurman is on the Goodwill Games team with you. He hit the 
big shot that beat Duke in the NCAA championship game last March; any painful 
memories? 
</P>
<P>
 A. When Scotty hit that shot (with the shot clock winding down), it was a 
great defensive exchange for us. We couldn't have played better defense, the 
pass to him was bobbled. It was a perfect shot with no time on the clock and 
Tony Lang about two inches away from blocking it. You can't get down on a shot 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Duke was scheduled to tour Australia in late spring, but Coach K canceled 
the trip because some of the players' grades weren't up to par. Do you agree 
with that decision? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We all wanted to go, but I saw it more as a vacation. I was going to summer 
school anyway, so I might be the wrong person to ask. It worked out better for 
me that we didn't go. It would have been a great experience. But I feel bad for 
the coaches, because they were the ones who set the trip up, then they were the 
ones who had to explain why we weren't going. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach K gives us a lot of academic freedom. We have to schedule our own 
classes and we don't have study halls. As players, we let the coaching staff 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Were you having any trouble with school? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No, I'm fine. After the fall semester, I'll only have one more class to 
take (for a history degree). I'll be cruising second semester. That's why I 
took summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What did you think of reports in late spring that Coach K was considering 
leaving Duke for the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I hadn't heard about it but my mom called me and asked, 'What's up with 
Coach K?' So I went to his house and talked to him about it. I just wanted to 
know what was going on, in case any of the other players had any questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He was really bogged down with it. He can't go anywhere in Durham without 
being mobbed anyway, but if he were to go out during that time period, he would 
have been swamped. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got there, he was sitting at a desk with a FAX machine and a pile of 
notes. Phone calls were coming in like crazy. He looked like a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 I went in there with an open mind. I knew he loved it in Durham, but I also 
understood that he had to look out for his best interests. Of course, I wanted 
him to stay because I want the other players here to have the chance to go 
through what I did here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What did Coach K say to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A. He told me his heart's in Durham and he wants to be at Duke more than 
anywhere else. I was glad he stayed.

JIM MURRAY: HIS DIGNITY AND STYLE ADD TO THE LEGEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know, in the press box sometimes, we old-timers used to have a bit of fun 
with the young guys on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Down on the field some hotshot outfielder would go streaking back after a line 
drive and make a last-minute leaping catch of it at the wall. We would look on, 
unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "DiMaggio would have been waiting for it," we'd tell the youngsters 
scornfully. "DiMaggio never had to leap for a ball in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 In the field, some eager young player would chase down a ground single and 
come up firing wildly. Only he would throw behind the runner, who would then 
help himself to an extra base. We would smirk. 
</P>
<P>
 "DiMaggio never threw to the wrong base in his life. Of course, that guy 
wouldn't have been running if he knew DiMag was out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Exaggerated? Not much. There was a large element of truth in the hyperbole. 
Joe DiMaggio played the game at least at a couple of levels higher than the 
rest of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of guys, all you had to see to know they were great was a stat sheet. 
DiMaggio, you had to see.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just numbers on a page -- although they were there, too -- it was a 
question of command, style, grace. Connie Mack, no less, once said he was the 
ultimate team player. That the Yankees won the pennant 10 times in the 13 years 
DiMaggio was with them attests to that.  
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees of his era were the personification of graceful elegance. Other 
teams were "the Gas House Gang," or "the Rollicking Redbirds," but the DiMag 
Yankees were all dignity. They beat you without getting their uniforms dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to the ballpark in three-piece suits and shined shoes, cut hair and 
clean shaven. Their image was that of a company of Swiss bankers, not 
terrorists. Joe DiMaggio never got in a brawl on or off the field.  
</P>
<P>
 In sports -- in all of entertainment -- there is a principle known as empathy. 
It has to do with the audience projecting itself into the performance of an 
athlete, dancer or singer. If what he does involves strain or effort, you 
experience it with him. Guys who balance plates thrive on it. You squirm, you 
strain, you hyperventilate. 
</P>
<P>
 But certain performers do what they do so effortlessly, you are unaware of 
struggle or strain. You are at ease. They are in control. So are you. Bing 
Crosby had that quality. It seemed so easy that every guy in the shower was 
sure he could sing like Bing. And Joe DiMaggio had that quality. He made it 
look easy.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe never got his hair mussed. His cap never fell off. He never lunged at a 
ball. In more than 600 plate appearances one year, he struck out only 13 times. 
People thought he was aloof. He was really shy. He once admitted that when he 
arrived in New York and a writer asked him for a quote, Joe didn't know what he 
was talking about. He thought maybe it was a soft drink.  
</P>
<P>
 I caught up with the great DiMaggio (as Hemingway's character, the ancient 
Cuban fisherman, keeps referring to him in "The Old Man and The Sea") the other 
day. He was in town to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 
prestigious Cedars-Sinai Sports Spectacular, a fund-raiser for the 
Genetics-Birth Center at the hospital, and a cause close to DiMaggio's heart 
because he has his own Joe DiMaggio Children's hospital in Hollywood, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows about the 56 straight games DiMaggio hit in back in 1941. Every 
fan knows that, when stopped for one night by spectacular fielding plays, he 
went on to hit safely in the next 16 games. So the record could have been 73. 
Everyone knows Joe hit in 61 straight games in the Pacific Coast League and 
that in his major league streak of 56 he had 91 hits, almost two a game; 15 
home runs, almost one every three games; drove in 55 runs, scored 56 and batted 
.408. It is the most brilliant burst of batting in baseball history.  
</P>
<P>
 But, what no one ever knew about the great DiMag is, he was the first major 
league ballplayer to have an agent.  
</P>
<P>
 His agent? Are you ready? A little drum roll, professor. Ty Cobb! 
</P>
<P>
 Right! That Ty Cobb. The Georgia Peach.  
</P>
<P>
 "He used to eat in our family restaurant at the wharf in San Francisco," Joe 
told me the other day. "So, he took an interest in me. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Yankees bought me from San Francisco (for $25,000), they offered me 
a $5,000 contract. Ty Cobb was outraged. (With the volcanic Cobb, this was not 
an unusual state of affairs.) He wrote to the Yankees' Ed Barrow and blistered 
him terribly. So Barrow sent back a $500 raise. Then, Ty sat down and wrote 
another letter. Oddly enough, he liked to write letters. Barrow came up with 
another $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "This went on for seven letters. Finally, Barrow wrote, 'This is all! Tell 
Cobb to stop writing letters!' 
</P>
<P>
 "But I ended up with $8,500. And Cobb ate for free in the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Another little-known fact of the DiMaggio legend is that, in 1939, when Joe 
won the American League batting title with a .381 average, he could have become 
one of the few hitters in baseball history to have hit .400. Should have, 
actually.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was hitting .412 with a little more than two weeks remaining in the 
season," he recalled. "Then, I had this terrible infection in my left eye. They 
injected it with Novocain. And (Manager Joe) McCarthy wouldn't take me out of 
the lineup. The eye was tearing up and painful. I couldn't really see the 
breaking ball. I lost 32 points on my batting average in two weeks. I shouldn't 
have been playing." 
</P>
<P>
 League rules used to provide that batting title eligibility was based on 
official at-bats in a season. It has since been changed to plate appearances, 
which include walks and sacrifices and times hit by pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in '39, the batting title was based on times at bat. Would Joe's .412 have 
qualified in 1939 if he had sat out the last two weeks as he should have? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He ended up with 462 official at-bats and would have easily made the 
obligatory 400, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 As gaudy as DiMaggio's actual numbers were -- and remember, he spent three 
seasons at the height of his career in the service during World War II -- they 
would have been even more glittering if one of the line smashes he hit in Game 
57 of the streak had fallen safely or if he had been able to go home and put on 
an eye patch in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 You shudder to think what agent Cobb could get for him today.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; TIME FOR SCORERS 
TO SCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agatha Christie would have loved this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In three weeks, the tournament has featured more twists and turns, more 
unexpected developments, more mysterious goings-on, than any World Cup in 
recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been surprises on and off the field, and tragedies, too. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The slaughter of innocent World Cup viewers in an Irish pub, a crime that 
prompted an editorial cartoonist in the Times of London to depict a gun-toting 
terrorist proudly holding aloft the World Cup trophy, its design altered to 
resemble a death's head rather than a globe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The still unexplained air crash that caused the deaths of Mexican World Cup 
fans traveling to Washington, D.C., to support their team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The murder in Medellin, Colombia, of Colombian World Cup player Andres 
Escobar, a crime whose roots have yet to be uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The failed drug test and subsequent banishment of Argentine star Diego 
Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 As disturbing as all of these developments have been, they have not managed to 
detract from what, to this point, has been a successful World Cup. By any 
measurement, the 1994 tournament must be considered the most incident-packed 
and gripping of any in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the initial skepticism of foreign journalists, the fans have flocked 
to the stadiums in record numbers, television ratings have been consistently 
higher than expected, and goals have been scored dramatically and, in some 
games, frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is still more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In this weekend's quarterfinals, the eight survivors of the original 24 teams 
are set to write four new chapters in the unfolding drama. On Saturday, Italy 
and Spain square off at Foxboro Stadium, then later in the day is potentially 
the finest game of the tournament, Brazil and the Netherlands at the Cotton 
Bowl in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, defending champion Germany takes on upstart Bulgaria at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., then Sweden and Romania meet at Stanford 
Stadium in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, they are an unlikely batch, these eight quarterfinalists. Only 
two of them, Italy, which finished third, and Germany, which won the trophy, 
were in the final eight four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria has advanced farther than ever before, although it can thank Mexico's 
inexplicable inability to make penalty kicks for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, deserving conqueror of scandal-plagued Argentina in the second round, 
gives Eastern Europe two quarterfinalists for the second consecutive 
tournament. In Italia '90, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia reached the final 
eight. Like Bulgaria, this is also the farthest Romania has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Sweden advanced this far was in 1958, when it staged the 
tournament and finished second to Brazil. The Brazilians themselves last 
reached the quarterfinals in Mexico in 1986, when they were ousted by France on 
penalty kicks in Guadalajara after one of the great World Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Also eliminated on penalty kicks in the 1986 quarterfinals was Spain, which 
fell to Belgium that year in its most successful recent performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the Netherlands, which has to look back to 1978, when it 
finished second to Argentina, for its best recent run at the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did these eight teams survive while the rest fell by the wayside? What 
common denominators are there that have kept them alive? Are there any 
weaknesses that would indicate they will not go much farther? 
</P>
<P>
 Goals take teams through tournaments. Teams that can't score can't win, so it 
is no surprise to see many of the world's best scorers still in the 
competition: Juergen Klinsmann and Rudi Voeller of Germany; Romario and Bebeto 
of Brazil; Dennis Bergkamp of the Netherlands; Gheorghe Hagi and Ilie 
Dumitrescu of Romania; Martin Dahlin of Sweden; Hristo Stoitchkov of Bulgaria 
and Roberto Baggio of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 But every one of them is going to run into a more difficult defense and a more 
dominating goalkeeper in the quarterfinals than they have faced so far, which 
should result in some fascinating duels. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the context of the matchups, are some clues to why some will succeed 
and others fail. SPAIN-ITALY 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish have reached this point by sheer hard work, by adopting a 
physically bruising approach at times and by not yet having had to play a truly 
difficult opponent in a game that mattered. South Korea, Bolivia and 
Switzerland were not true tests for Spain, which tied its other game, against 
Germany, by mutual consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta has been praised by Coach Javier Clemente, but 
the Italian forwards are likely to make him work a lot harder on Saturday to 
stay in Clemente's good graces. 
</P>
<P>
 Two goals against Nigeria on Tuesday might finally free Baggio from the 
shackles of expectation that were chained to him by the Italian media and fans. 
Now, if he has shaken off the nagging injury that has kept him from peak 
fitness, he and teammates Giuseppe Signori and Daniele Massaro will make life 
miserable for Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if the Italians are exhausted from their two-hour battle 
with the Nigerians, the Spanish, who have had the benefit of three days' extra 
rest, could shut them down and snatch a game winner on the counterattack, which 
is their forte. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy has lost to Ireland, beaten Norway, tied Mexico and beaten Nigeria while 
fighting injuries, red cards, poor officiating and the usual intense pressure 
from the Italian media. In other words, they are enduring their typical World 
Cup. BRAZIL-NETHERLANDS 
</P>
<P>
 No game in the tournament has been as eagerly anticipated as this one, which 
matches the two most technically gifted sides in the World Cup. If they play to 
their optimum level, it could be a game for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians have been both dominant and unconvincing, if such a mix is 
possible. Cameroon, Russia and the United States hardly constitute tough 
opposition, and when the Brazilians ran into the organized and disciplined 
Swedes, they managed only a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch have been equally unconvincing, albeit attractive. They move the 
ball in bewildering patterns, keeping control seemingly without effort while 
they try to create an opening. Bergkamp could have had several goals by now, 
had his shooting luck been better. Teammate Wim Jonk has provided added impetus 
from midfield. Ronald Koeman possesses the most dangerous free kick in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 But still there are questions about the Netherlands' vulnerability to the 
swift counterattack. Faced with the twin threats of Romario and Bebeto, it is 
likely that the Dutch will yield a goal or two, which means Bergkamp and 
company will have to come through at the other end.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch struggled to defeat Saudi Arabia and Morocco, lost to Belgium in a 
game they dominated offensively, then beat Ireland with some ease. Brazil will 
provide their toughest test to date. GERMANY-BULGARIA 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost impossible to envision the defending champion not being able to 
win this game, especially with Bulgaria having had to endure two hours of agony 
while keeping Mexico at bay before advancing on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov is in superb form, but the Germans have had three days' extra rest 
and the combination of Klinsmann and Voeller up front will torment the 
Bulgarian defense. If Bulgaria is to have a chance, it will have to shut down 
not only the two strikers but their principal supplier, Thomas Haessler, who is 
quietly enjoying an excellent tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgarian goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov thrust himself into the running for the 
Yashin Cup, awarded the tournament's top goalkeeper, with his penalty-saving 
performance against Mexico and could enhance his chances if he can hold the 
Germans scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't count on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans have tied Spain and defeated Bolivia, South Korea and Belgium en 
route to the quarterfinals and this test is no more difficult than any of 
those. Bulgaria, meanwhile, has beaten Greece and Argentina, lost to Nigeria 
and tied Mexico. SWEDEN-ROMANIA 
</P>
<P>
 One of the World Cup's most potent offenses meets what is undoubtedly its best 
midfield-defense combination. The Swedes are solid at the back, with 
midfielders Jonas Thern and Stefan Schwarz acting as fifth and sixth defenders 
in front of the back four. 
</P>
<P>
 On attack, Tomas Brolin provides the inspiration while Dahlin and Kennet 
Andersson finish off the chances created. The combination has resulted in 
victories over Russia and Saudi Arabia and ties with Cameroon and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, on the other hand, possesses the twin talents of Hagi and Dumitrescu, 
who read each other so well that their combination play is virtually flawless. 
Each can create or score goals and, if they fail, Florin Raducioiu returns from 
a one-game suspension to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania has had only one lapse, a loss to Switzerland, while defeating 
Colombia, the United States and Argentina. That last victory has raised spirits 
immensely and a place in the semifinals is quite possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Which teams will make the final four? That's a mystery only Agatha Christie 
could solve.

BURRELL ECLIPSES 100-METER MARK; TRACK AND FIELD: TIME OF 9.85 SECONDS AT SWISS 
MEET SURPASSES CARL LEWIS' RECORD OF 9.86. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leroy Burrell can only hope his latest world record in the 100 meters lasts 
longer than his previous one. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell regained the record he held for only 2 1/2 months in 1991 by blazing 
to victory in 9.85 seconds Wednesday at the Athletissima IAAF Grand Prix meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going to be fast and I was very confident," Burrell, 27, said. 
"I'm just happy to have broken the world record again." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Burrell lost his record to Carl Lewis, who shattered Burrell's 
previous mark of 9.90 with a 9.86 clocking at the World Championships in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, with Santa Monica Track Club teammate Lewis not competing 
because of a disagreement over an appearance fee, Burrell led a pack of three 
runners who broke 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those days when it all came together," Burrell said. "I 
still feel I can run faster and my goal is to be ranked No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson Ezinwa of Nigeria edged Dennis Mitchell for second as both were timed 
in 9.99. Burrell was aided by a wind of 1.2 meters per second on a warm, humid 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic and world champion Linford Christie also didn't compete because of a 
disagreement over appearance fees. Lewis reportedly asked for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl is probably just as happy as can be because we're good friends and we 
can work together," Burrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Burrell won 19 of 22 finals and was unbeaten in 1991 until Lewis took 
the world record. He was one of the medal favorites in the 1992 Barcelona 
Olympics but finished a disappointing fifth. Burrell also was a member of four 
world-record teams in the 400-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed to qualify for the U.S. 100-meter team in last year's World 
Championships, but then Lewis moved aside to let him compete as anchor in the 
400 relay. The American team won the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 100 race in Tokyo was one of the most exciting sprints ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis passed Burrell in the last five meters to avenge a loss two months 
earlier at the U.S. championships. Burrell was timed in 9.91 at Tokyo, a time 
that would have been a record, but Lewis finished ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meet, with a crowd of more than 13,000, boasted 15 Olympic 
champions and 20 world champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was marred when American 400 hurdler Kim Batton was hit in the 
face by a cushion thrown from the crowd. Batton, who had clocked the world's 
best time this season, lost her balance and finished well behind Britain's 
Sally Gunnell, the world champion, who was clocked in 54.06. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Streete-Thompson, 21, won the long jump with a leap of 27 feet 11 
inches. World record-holder Mike Powell was second at 27-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was jumping very well tonight but I was taking off too far behind the 
board," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed because people will think I'm not jumping well which is not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Maicel Malone clocked the world's fastest time this year in the women's 400, 
50.06. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McKoy, a Canadian who was given clearance by the International Amateur 
Athletics Federation on Wednesday to compete for Austria, won the 100 hurdles 
in 13.19, a fraction ahead of Greg Foster.

STRAWBERRY TO DEBUT AS GIANT; BASEBALL: EX-DODGER DECLARES HIMSELF READY; HE'LL 
BAT FIFTH, PLAY RIGHT FIELD AFTER STINT IN MINORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry will return to a major league lineup for the first time in 
more than a year today, when he plays right field and bats fifth for the San 
Francisco Giants against the Philadelphia Phillies at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, who recently completed a drug-abuse program at the Betty Ford 
Center in Rancho Mirage, was recalled by the Giants Wednesday, having played 
only three games in a rehabilitation assignment with their triple-A team at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry had surgery for a herniated disk in September of 1992, made his 
last major league appearance with the Dodgers on June 16 of last year, then 
missed the rest of the season while undergoing back therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared in only 75 games with the Dodgers in 1992 and '93 because of the 
back problem and entered the Betty Ford Center after going AWOL two days before 
the Dodgers opened the 1994 season. He signed with the Giants on June 19, after 
reaching a settlement with the Dodgers on the rest of his $20.5-million 
contract obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Giants officials had said Strawberry wouldn't join the big-league 
team until after the All-Star break. But Strawberry's quick start in Phoenix, 
and perhaps the fact that San Francisco trails badly in the National League 
West, appears to have speeded up the move before the Giants' final series 
before the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant General Manager Bob Quinn, however, said the quick recall had nothing to 
do with the Giants' offensive struggle -- they are last in the National League 
in team batting, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and hitting with 
runners in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put absolutely no pressure on Darryl," Quinn said. "That would be 
foolhardy. Our agreement was that he would establish his own time frame. He 
told us when he left for Phoenix that he would see us sooner rather than later 
because he was feeling so good. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has 11 years of experience. He knows better than anyone how he feels. He 
went through 10 or 11 days of rigorous training in the desert (after signing 
with the Giants), hitting an average of 180 balls a day. It isn't like he's had 
only the two or three games at Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry will hit behind Matt Williams and Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl wanted to come today (Wednesday)," Manager Dusty Baker said. "But we 
said, 'No, take another day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Baker said he worries that because Strawberry hasn't played in the majors 
for more than a year, he may be susceptible to injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry hit a home run in each of his first two games at Phoenix and went 
3-for-10, including an 0-for-3 night Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody to a man feels he's ready to go, but we still tried to convince him 
to take a couple more days and maybe join us on the weekend," Quinn said. 
"Darryl simply feels he's ready and would prefer not to wait. In fact, we made 
a reservation for him on an 8:50 flight that would have gotten him (to San 
Francisco) about 10:30 tomorrow morning, but he said he wanted to take the 
first flight at 6:15 so that he was sure to be on time. I think that's an 
indication of his attitude."  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry will receive the prorated $109,000 minimum and $7,000 per game. His 
brother, Michael, will live with him and travel with him as part of what Quinn 
called the "comfort zone we've tried to create for Darryl." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in San Francisco Saturday, Strawberry said he had 
consistently used drugs and alcohol for the last nine years and was "looking 
forward to walking on a baseball field for the first time with a clear mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants trail the Dodgers in the National League West by 9 1/2 games, but 
Quinn said, "We still have time, and I've got to think Darryl will provide a 
significant lift to our lineup if he can do what he's done in the past."

NEWSWIRE: COLISEUM ORDERS $4.8-MILLION SCOREBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coliseum has ordered a new matrix scoreboard and video board system 
costing $4.8 million to replace boards that had to be taken down as part of the 
stadium's $50-million earthquake repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Project director Don C. Webb told the Coliseum Commission Wednesday that the 
new boards, to be paid for by the federal and state governments because they 
are a consequence of the Northridge earthquake, will be an improvement over the 
former boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he hoped the boards, from Mitsubishi Products, America, would be in 
place in time for the first scheduled game at the repaired Coliseum between USC 
and Washington on Sept. 3. Eight days later, the Raiders are scheduled to play 
their home opener against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 In another matter, the Coliseum Commission, with no public discussion, voted 
unanimously to ratify a one-year contract under which the Raiders will play in 
the Coliseum this fall without any obligation to pay rent unless there is a 
later agreement between the team and the commission on further stadium and 
Exposition Park renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted unanimously to ban smoking in all open-seating Coliseum 
areas, restrooms and the upper concourse, and by a vote of 6-3 decided to ban 
it in the press areas as well. KENNETH REICH

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; SORE SHOULDER SHORTENS DREIFORT'S STINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort, making his third start for the double-A San Antonio Missions, 
came out of the game after three innings Wednesday night for precautionary 
reasons because of stiffness in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be evaluated on a day-to-day basis.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much unknown as to what the degree of seriousness is there, but we 
may know in as soon as one day," said Fred Claire, executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September in the instructional league, Dreifort's surgically-repaired 
knee, which was still rehabilitating, started acting up. To accommodate it, he 
changed his delivery, and soon after developed tendinitis in his elbow. At the 
time, his father, John, said Darren had not had tendinitis in his pitching arm 
before.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort was pitching well, having given up only two earned runs in 12 innings 
of three starts. Dreifort, who is slated to be the future closer for the 
Dodgers, was starting for the Missions in order to get more innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi, who left the clubhouse Tuesday without talking to reporters 
after hitting the game-winning home run in the 10th inning, had a good reason. 
His wife, Ada, was ill, and Mondesi said he was concerned about her. Mondesi 
said Wednesday that Ada is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger players met after batting practice and voted unanimously to grant power 
to the player's union in the upcoming negotiations involving a new basic 
agreement. The vote authorized the union to determine a strike date and to call 
a strike, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a beautiful year," said Brett Butler, referring to the Dodgers' 
first-place season. "But if it's the process that goes to the 11th hour or not, 
we will go with what it takes to get (an agreement) done." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said the players will in no way approve a salary cap, which is the 
point of contention. "Look at basketball, they are trying to get rid of it,' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza, who is the Dodgers' lone representative at the All-Star game, 
will be the team's player rep at a meeting Monday in Pittsburgh, where the game 
will be played on Tuesday. Most clubs have one player representative, but the 
Dodgers have done it by committee. While Butler and Orel Hershiser, among other 
veterans, have taken an active part, they have encouraged the participation of 
the younger players. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott pitched in a simulated game Thursday, throwing about 15 minutes. If 
he recovers well, he will start a rehabilitation assignment on Friday with the 
Bakersfield Dodgers that will probably include at least two outings before he 
will be evaluated. Gott underwent an appendectomy on June 9 that was 
complicated because his appendix burst. . . . Albuquerque's Greg Hansell was 
3-0 and a 2.30 ERA in June. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FREAK ACCIDENT RATTLES DISARCINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina took no chances Wednesday. Prompted by an 
accident Tuesday, he wore batting gloves, for the first time this season, in 
the game against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina's bat flew out of his hands in the ninth inning Tuesday and hit two 
young boys, one of whom spent the night in critical condition with a skull 
fracture. The boy was listed in serious condition on Wednesday, according to 
hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Schellekes, 8, of Gilmanton, N.H., spent the night in intensive care 
after going into shock, and also had a three-inch gash over his right eye. His 
cousin, Matthew O'Connor, 10, also suffered cuts and was held overnight for 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi and assistant Tim Mead visited the boys and 
their parents Wednesday, and Manager Marcel Lachemann called them. It was the 
first time either youngster had attended a major league game and they had moved 
to vacant seats closer to the field after the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty much a helpless feeling," DiSarcina said. "I let the bat slip 
out of my hands a couple of times, but nothing like that ever happened. . . . 
My dad went to security officials and got the names and addresses. I'm going to 
send some stuff to them when I get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Security officials said both teams sent over souvenirs. BOB NIGHTENGALE

WHEN TICKER CLICKS, INFORMATION ARRIVES IN HEARTBEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eighth floor of a renovated warehouse overlooking the Manhattan 
skyline, Peter Bavasi has seen the future and it is now -- a superhighway of 
instant sports information delivered over lanes that keep getting wider and 
wider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me show you this," says the former baseball executive, punching a few 
keys on his computer. In a moment, he has access to the latest sports news, 
from a pitching change at Dodger Stadium to the third inning score of the 
Macon-Savannah minor league game in the South Atlantic League. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want stats, lineups, team notes? Then all you have to do . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the beginning. In Toronto, a new pager gives fans an 
up-to-the-minute rundown on Blue Jay games. In Montreal, fans can choose 
various camera angles to follow the action of a Canadian hockey game on 
television. In other cities, they can open a window on the TV and watch 
statistics scroll by as players come to bat, or catch updated scores rolling 
past in a banner at the bottom of the screen. Then there are other on-line 
services that provide a full diet of instant and archival sports information. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of these breakthroughs is the new technology provided by 
computers and satellites -- and SportsTicker, a small, prosperous company that 
is the unanimous and usually uncredited source for most of the news, scores and 
statistics that fill our TV screens, newspapers and, perhaps too often, our 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 SportsTicker, a division of Dow Jones & Company, publisher of the Wall Street 
Journal, is the descendant of the old Western Union baseball ticker founded in 
1909. Until a decade ago, it relied on narrow tape that delivered scores and 
home runs and pitching changes at a leisurely pace, and in those days if you 
wanted to know the top 10 batters in, say, the double-A Eastern League, you 
waited about a week for the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember my dad going over to the old glass-domed ticker looking for a 
score," says SportsTicker president Bavasi of his father, Buzzie, former 
general manager of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. "There'd be reams of 
yellow tape on the floor, and invariably the thing would jam and no one knew 
how to change the tape until someone called for the public relations guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Now cut to the era of instant communications. Inning-by-inning and 
quarter-by-quarter scores pour into SportsTicker's eighth-floor newsroom from 
700 part-time correspondents who cover every professional and major college 
sports event in the country. In a flash, the data is digested by computers and 
shot back on satellite to hundreds of clients in North and South America and 
Japan. On an average day, the service generates 4 million characters, or the 
equivalent of 800,000 words, of news and statistics. The information crawls 
across sports-news display boards in hundreds of bars, casinos and airports. It 
automatically updates scoreboards in scores of stadiums. It appears on the 
screens of personal computers used by general managers and sportswriters. It 
floats by in a banner at the bottom of CNN's Headline News, is set in agate 
type by newspapers from coast to coast, forms the basis of United Press 
International's sports report and provides the grist for countless sports-talk 
shows on radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fun of the job is knowing that what we report appears everywhere, and I 
mean literally everywhere," says Managing Editor Joe Caricelli, former UPI 
executive sports editor. "Some nights we're covering hundreds of games in half 
a dozen sports and this place is like the old days at UPI, with people fighting 
for phones and tripping over chairs to get the stuff moving and out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Caricelli oversees a full-time staff of about 70, most of them sports nuts 
with a journalism degree or a couple of years' newspaper experience. To be 
hired, an applicant must be computer literate and pass a sports quiz. (Sample 
question: Name the 1991 NBA rookie of the year and the NHL record holder for 
most goals by a rookie.) One of Caricelli's former SportsTicker stringers, Jim 
Bowden, who used to cover Pittsburgh Pirate games, is now the general manager 
of the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, former president of the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians and 
one-time San Diego Padre general manager, credits CNN's coverage of the Persian 
Gulf war with giving SportsTicker's business a big boost. Suddenly, he says, 
everyone realized that instant communications were the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 SportsTicker's revenues increased nearly 15% last year, although Dow-Jones 
does not report what those revenues amounted to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has exploded," he says. "And every day someone is coming up with new 
applications." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi sends new sports software packages to his father in La Jolla to test 
and critique. The irony is that computer-whiz Buzzie Bavasi, 79, never mastered 
the typewriter during his 50 years in baseball and spent his career calling out 
to his secretary, "Edna, bring your pad in here, please, and take a letter."

 In the most severe penalty of World Cup '94, Brazilian defender Leonardo was 
suspended for four games Wednesday for elbowing Tab Ramos of the United States, 
who suffered a broken bone in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, Ramos, speaking for the first time since Monday's incident, 
said: "I thought I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 The disciplinary committee of FIFA, soccer's governing body, fined Leonardo 
about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also suspended two players ejected from second-round matches 
Tuesday -- Gianfranco Zola of Italy for two games and Emil Kremenliev of 
Bulgaria for one. Kremenliev's penalty was less severe because his red card was 
a combination of two yellows in the same match. Zola was punished for 
intentionally fouling a Nigerian defender although he did not cause any harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Also suspended for one match in the next CONCACAF tournament were Fernando 
Clavijo of the United States and Luis Garcia of Mexico, for accumulated yellow 
cards.  
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest penalty was levied against Leonardo, who threw a right elbow 
into the left side of Ramos' head as the two tangled for a ball near the 
sidelines in the first half of Brazil's 1-0 second-round victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo later apologized and said he did not intentionally hurt Ramos, who is 
expected to be sidelined for up to six months. Leonardo visited Ramos at the 
Stanford Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was saying he did not really mean to hit me in the head," Ramos said. "I 
know he's not a dirty player at all. I realized from watching the replay that 
it looks like a dirty play, and he did throw the elbow at me, but I don't think 
he ever thought he would hit me in the head with it. It was just kind of a 
movement to get me away from him because I was pulling his shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 But the disciplinary committee, which viewed the incident from all angles on a 
video, was unmoved by the motive. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, which plays Netherlands in the quarterfinals Saturday at the Cotton 
Bowl, can appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brazil fails to advance past the Netherlands, or loses in the semifinals, 
Leonardo's suspension would be completed in the next sanctioned South American 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, a 27-year-old midfielder from Hillside, N.J., was still reeling from 
the blow Wednesday, 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to keep my eyes open, because I thought I had to fight it to 
come back," he said. "I mean that's how bad it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos dropped to the field and lost consciousness for several seconds after 
being hit. Doctors said there was a small amount of bleeding around the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard this noise in my head that was like a train going through, and all I 
thought was like, 'Oh my God, I'm going to die right here,' " Ramos said. "It 
was really bad, and within 10 seconds I recovered a little bit, but I had a lot 
of pain in my head."

THIRD SUSPECT SURRENDERS IN ESCOBAR MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A third suspect in the shooting of soccer player Andres Escobar turned himself 
in Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Pedro Gallon Henao, brother of another suspect in the killing, 
surrendered to the prosecutor general's office in Medellin, Colombia's 
third-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar was shot to death in the parking lot of a restaurant in Medellin, 
apparently for accidentally scoring an own goal in Colombia's 2-1 loss to the 
United States. The third suspect was present during the slaying, police said, 
without giving further details. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect, Humberto Munoz, admitted to shooting Escobar, police said. Munoz 
was the driver for a second suspect, rancher Santiago Gallon Henao, whom 
authorities said bet heavily on the Colombian team and was upset at having 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were investigating whether the Gallon brothers are involved in drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 A third Gallon brother has been implicated in the laundering of drug money. 
</P>
<P>
 In another blow to Colombia's soccer establishment, the head of a major team 
resigned to protest the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't accept soccer as a stage for violence and uncontrolled passions 
instead of pleasure and exercise," Pedro Chang, general manager of the America 
club of Cali, said in his resignation letter, sent Tuesday.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; MAY, 16, COURTS STARDOM AS OUTSIDE HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike many coaches of team sports at the Olympic Festival, Craig Cummings 
does not give all his volleyball players equal court time.  
</P>
<P>
 That makes Misty May all the more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think about age when I put my players on the court," said Cummings, 
who coaches at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. "I put my best players out there to go 
out and do a job and Misty deserves to be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 May, an outside hitter, is the youngest player on any of the Festival 
volleyball teams, but she plays nearly every minute of every match. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year old who will be starting her senior year of high school, May was not 
planning to try out for the Festival. Like many of the best volleyball players 
her age, she was going to try out for the Junior Elite volleyball camp. 
</P>
<P>
 But her parents encouraged her to try out for the Festival team instead. They 
said it would be a good experience. 
</P>
<P>
 She made the team and now starts for Cummings on the West squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty good as far as confidence boosts go, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely. But it still hasn't hit me yet," May said. "My parents are 
encouraging me to do something every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Their confidence is well founded. 
</P>
<P>
 You can start with her dad's genes. Butch May was on the 1968 Olympic 
volleyball team that played in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Then take a look at her awards, which have college coaches drooling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Newport Harbor High in Newport Beach, she has been a three-time 
All-Southern Section player and was the Division I Southern Section player of 
the year last year by a vote of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The U.S. Volleyball Assn., the governing body of amateur volleyball, has 
named May to its All-American team the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She was a member of last year's junior national team and was named to the 
all-tournament team at the junior national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 -- She was named to Volleyball Monthly's All-American first team last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And when you consider that the Festival accepted participants 23 and under, 
you realize that May beat out quite a few collegiate players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched Misty play for a long time," Cummings said. "As a collegiate 
coach, you have to watch these things (tournaments), so I'm fully aware of what 
she can do. She's a great, accomplished player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if there's a group of people here who are going, 'Who's Misty 
May?' Well, I think quite a few people know who she is now." 
</P>
<P>
 As easy as it may seem, May says playing at this level is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot faster than club or high school," said May, who stands 5 feet 9. 
"It's a lot more competitive. It's hard being the shortest one out there. When 
I'm on the front row I don't know what to do with the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't know what to do? 
</P>
<P>
 In a volley against the East team, May had a dig by diving and sliding her 
hand under the ball just before it could hit the floor, saving a point, and 
when the East returned the ball, May teamed with Jennifer Jackson to block the 
spike for a side out.  
</P>
<P>
 May also has been up to the challenge of receiving most serves, and has passed 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when she doesn't know what to do, she has been getting a lot of advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," she said. "(Other players) tell me tips all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Berendt defeated South teammate Amanda Augustus of Palos Verdes, 6-3, 
6-3, for the bronze medal in women's tennis. . . . In the men's competition, 
the West's Mike Jessup, of Saratoga, Calif., won the gold by defeating the 
South's Jack Brasington of Miami, 7-6, (7-2), 6-4.

LOS ALAMITOS; CREAGER QUIETLY GOES ABOUT HIS BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 20 years that John Creager has been riding at Los Alamitos, everything 
around him has changed, with a few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Blane Schvaneveldt is still one of the top trainers, horses still turn left in 
the longer races and Creager still sits patiently on his mounts, holding them 
straight and letting them run. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been criticized for sitting too quietly during a race but, as the 
statistics show, he gets the job done. Recording victory No. 1,800 on a recent 
three-win night, Creager is the third-leading jockey of all-time at Los 
Alamitos. Only Danny Cardoza and Kenny Hart have won more races. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot tougher," Creager said of his early days at Los Alamitos. "There 
were no young riders. Charlie Smith, Jimmy Dreyer, Ronnie Banks and Danny 
Cardoza were all here. They were all established riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every good horse in America was here. This was the only track running at 
night. It was the big apple for quarter horse racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Creager, 43, began race riding in his home state of Utah. He came to Los 
Alamitos after leading a meeting at Centennial Racetrack in Denver and set the 
tone for his California career by winning with his first mount. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, each trainer only had 20 horses," he said. "And these maiden races 
for 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds, there was none of that. The racing secretary was 
the law. He had to approve your horses. If a horse couldn't win at 3, he'd make 
it go somewhere else to win before coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Creager rides an average of four horses a night. He wins 20% of the time and 
hits the board more than half the time. He rarely misses a morning at the track 
and spends a lot of time with the horses that need it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to take off a day when you have horses to take care of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Creager is the regular rider of Ah Sigh, winner of the Miss Kindergarten 
Futurity. Charles Bloomquist, who trains the undefeated filly, acknowledges 
that although it is important to try to win each race, sometimes a 2-year-old 
needs a little schooling.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times 2-year-olds run in a race and they get in trouble," Bloomquist 
said. "Although you always emphasize winning the race, the first one or two 
starts will determine how they run throughout the rest of their career. 
Sometimes they need to be taught a little out there. John will take care of 
your baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomquist added that Creager is one of the best for a horse that wants a 
rider to sit still, gather him up and let him run. 
</P>
<P>
 "John doesn't override horses," Bloomquist said. "Sometimes younger or more 
aggressive riders will override a horse. John thinks when he's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 A quiet man and a quiet rider, Creager has had 20 years to develop his style. 
He said it's not easy to sit still, that it takes confidence in the horse and 
patience. And, he adds, he learned from making mistakes as much as anything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good (mounts) will give you their all," he said. "If your horse is 
running all out and you start using the stick, what's he going to think? He'll 
think he's doing something wrong and he'll duck in or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Creager is rarely criticized these days for his mounts running off course. He 
may still hear complaints about other things, as all jockeys do, but he quietly 
goes about his business, the meeting's third-leading rider with 33 victories in 
165 races. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 After witnessing a near-disastrous first effort to simulcast a race from the 
new Sam Houston Race Park in Texas on Saturday night, bettors at Los Alamitos 
welcomed the second attempt with open wallets, out-wagering the fans in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Past performances for both simulcast races were handed out on a single green 
sheet because Sam Houston's scratch time was too late to make the Los Alamitos 
program. Adding to the problem, California bettors had only three minutes to 
bet the first simulcast after Los Alamitos' third race. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they could not watch the horses loading into the gate when the signal was 
interrupted, and there was a second interruption during the race. The tote 
board showed less than $20,000 bet here. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second simulcast race, the San Jacinto Stake for Texas-bred 2-year-old 
fillies, the timing was better and the signal uninterrupted. Fans at Los 
Alamitos and its satellite outlets wagered $67,426. At Sam Houston and its 
satellite outlets, the number was $62,489. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos is scheduled to take two races from Sam Houston Park each 
Thursday and Saturday through the conclusion of the Texas meeting, Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Los Alamitos moved its first post time from 6:45 to 3 p.m. so it 
could show the simulcast of the Rainbow Derby from Ruidoso Downs in Ruidoso, 
N.M. A Streak Of Cash won the race and local fans wagered $145,347. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt, whose runners scored a 1-2 finish in Friday's Los 
Alamitos Derby, has a chance of repeating the feat, although for much lower 
stakes. Sheza First Down, who at 35-1 upset stablemate Totally Illegal in the 
Grade I race, earned $56,280 of the $134,000 purse. Totally Illegal picked up 
$22,780. . . . The AQHA Wrangler Juvenile Challenge on Friday gives 
Schvaneveldt another 1-2 opportunity in a stakes race. He saddled the winners 
of both trials, Fluent and Touchdown Dancer, but the 350-yard race carries only 
a $7,500-added purse.

ALL-STAR FORCED TO ADJUST HIS GAME; FOOTBALL: FOUNTAIN VALLEY'S LEIMBACH GETS A 
TASTE OF DIFFERENT STYLES IN TRAINING CAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brandon Leimbach froze the linebacker with a quick move, ran past the safety 
and cut to his right to await the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Fountain Valley tight end was in the clear and eager to make the 
catch. Only one problem: It was a running play. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life when practicing for the 35th Orange County North-South All-Star 
football game. Leimbach and his South teammates hope to iron out the wrinkles 
before kickoff at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was a little confusing at first," Leimbach said. "We're running 
Huntington Beach's offense, which is a lot like (Fountain Valley's), but some 
of the calls are different. 
</P>
<P>
 "One call can make the whole thing change." 
</P>
<P>
 As Leimbach has learned. Judging by his past performances, though, Leimbach 
should be in sync by game time. 
</P>
<P>
 Leimbach (6 feet 4, 215 pounds) was a two-sport standout at Fountain Valley. 
As a senior, he was the Barons' second-leading receiver during the regular 
season with 28 receptions for 387 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 His blocking and receiving helped Fountain Valley reach the semifinals of the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs. The Barons lost, 42-21, to eventual 
champion Los Alamitos. Leimbach was selected second-team all-county by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Leimbach is skilled in basketball, too. 
</P>
<P>
 A nimble post player, Leimbach led Fountain Valley in scoring with a 17.4 
average last season. 
</P>
<P>
 His postseason performance also was a key, as the basketball team advanced to 
the quarterfinals of the Division I-AA playoffs. The Barons were defeated, 
50-48, by Long Beach Poly, which won the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Earning a football all-star selection, Leimbach said, capped his sensational 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been having a great time (in practice)," Leimbach said. "All of the guys 
are really nice and we've all been having a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're also trying our hardest to win. We're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Leimbach said things have come together nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we're kind of sick of practice," Leimbach said. "We all just wish 
the game would hurry up and come." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the game, Leimbach will head north for more practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He received a football scholarship to St. Mary's, and will leave Aug. 9 for 
the Division I-AA school in Moraga. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited," Leimbach said. "I have no clue about what I want to 
study yet, I know I just can't wait to get there." North vs. South 
</P>
<P>
 Records: North leads the series, 18-14-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $7. 
</P>
<P>
 North: A powerful offensive line and running back Chris Draft should provide a 
potent ground game. Draft, formerly of Valencia High, said he wants to put on a 
show. The Stanford-bound Draft was selected as The Times Orange County back of 
the year in 1993 after gaining 1,338 yards rushing with 24 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 South: Tony Gonzalez's presence provides a boost. One of the best all-around 
athletes in county history, Gonzalez, a tight end and linebacker, is a force. 
As a senior, Gonzalez led Huntington Beach in receiving (63 catches, 950 yards, 
14 touchdowns) and tackles (131). The Times' lineman of the year, he also was 
all-county in basketball. Gonzalez will play both sports at California. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the Game: Familiarity. Practice began June 22 for the North and one day 
later for the South, but many players from both sides have dropped out. The 
coaching staff that best handles the changes has the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Consensus: The North won, 14-3, last year. This time, the South will finish 
ahead.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; NOT EASY TO FATHOM THOUGH FUN TO WATCH; TEAM HANDBALL: 
COMBINING CHAOTIC ELEMENTS OF SEVERAL SPORTS, IT HAS SPECTATOR APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The really great thing about team handball is that few people understand the 
sport but most enjoy watching it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny Fercho used to be one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his brother were watching on television in 1984, when the Olympics were 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool game, they thought. Let's try it. 
</P>
<P>
 So they did -- right there in the family room of their Camarillo home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom and Dad weren't around, of course. They might have objected to the couch 
being one goal and the cupboard across the room being the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sister wasn't there, either. She might not have let them borrow her 
coveted plastic red ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, then teen-agers, played one-on-one, grappling on the floor until 
their knees burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great games," Fercho said. 
</P>
<P>
 And typical of a start to a handball-playing career. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically atypical. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Tim Flaherty's story: He was a football player at Moorpark College 
when he first heard of the sport. Somebody had posted a flyer on a school 
bulletin board and Flaherty had a friend who wanted to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Flaherty said he would tag along when his friend went to a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend was a no-show. Flaherty tried it anyway. "I got hooked right away," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for James Cox, who was looking for a sport in which he could "accomplish 
something on an elite level." He decided to try team handball after watching 
games at the 1991 Olympic Festival in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, a former water polo player at Buena High and Ventura College, now has 
witnessed handball in three Festivals -- the one in Los Angeles, and those he 
has participated in as a goalie the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fercho, Flaherty and Cox all helped the West team defeat the North, 19-14, 
Wednesday in the Olympic Festival bronze medal match in the Washington 
University Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hop and Mike Hurdle, two other local players, were among the West's top 
players until its final game. Hop, from Camarillo, and Hurdle, from Reseda, 
were sent home Tuesday by U.S. Team Handball Federation officials after a 
disciplinary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the situation said Hop, Hurdle and Darrell Hubbard, a backup 
goalie for the West, violated team rules during a late-night Fourth of July 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Hop, a member of the U.S. national team, scored 18 goals -- the second-highest 
total in the tournament -- through the West's first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 With Fercho playing the equivalent of a basketball point guard, the West led 
from start to finish by controlling the tempo of the game against a much-larger 
and more-physical North squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to move the ball from side to side quickly so we could get them 
moving and open some holes," Fercho said. "When we did, we got some good 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Good shots meaning the kind that go in. 
</P>
<P>
 Every shot, it seems, is violently contested, Defenders body-check and grope 
at any offensive player making a run at the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 When they are able, shooters must squeeze through thin seams in the defense to 
take off-balance shots. But if they manage to get one off at close range, the 
goalie must guard an area 6 1/2 feet high and almost 10 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 Informational brochures, a must for any first-time spectator, describe team 
handball as a combination of ice hockey without sticks, basketball with a few 
too many players and water polo on hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 All true. Just add a couple of dashes of soccer and rugby. 
</P>
<P>
 What it is, by all accounts, is organized chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, played on a rubber floor 59% larger than a basketball court, is 
contested in two 30-minute halves. Each team is allowed seven players on the 
floor, provided none have drawn a penalty for a particularly rough foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock runs even when the ball goes out of bounds. Time stops only for 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Players, some from only a few feet away, sling a projectile slightly smaller 
than a volleyball at speeds upward of 50 m.p.h. And a goalie's only pads are 
under his shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 For basketball fans, there are free throws, fast breaks, screens, steals, 
dribbles, traveling and charging. 
</P>
<P>
 For soccer fans, there are goals, throw-ins, goal-throws, yellow warning cards 
and red disqualification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fercho, 24, belongs to the 20-member U.S. national team. He already has been 
told he will be making a trip to St. Petersburg, Russia, later this month to 
take part in the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, 28, who has made significant strides as a goalie despite relatively 
little experience, still has "another level to go" before he is national team 
material, according to Coach Rod Oshita. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Flaherty, he has a reputation of having a good time playing sports he 
has never tried before. 
</P>
<P>
 Before playing quarterback for Moorpark College in 1982 and '83, Flaherty was 
studying religion, first at Our Lady Queen of Angels, a seminary high school in 
Mission Hills, then at St. John's seminary college in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 34 years old and just out here having a good time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, was a crowd of several hundred spectators -- even if they didn't 
truly understand what they were watching.

YOUTH BASEBALL MIMICS LIFE, AND IT'S ALL ABOUT DUPLICITY; JURISPRUDENCE: 
CHARGES FLY AFTER TOLUCA LAKE DROPS LITTLE LEAGUE FOR PONY BASEBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mud-slinging, shattered friendships and claims of deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 The next episode of Melrose Place? 
</P>
<P>
 No, just another day in the fight for the soul of Toluca Lake youth baseball, 
where a lawsuit has overshadowed games and two warring groups of parents 
believe they know what is best for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side are Toluca Little League supporters who objected when the league 
dropped its charter and created a new affiliation with Pony Baseball. They say 
the move was made simply to field better teams for postseason tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are the parents of Toluca Baseball, the newly formed Pony 
League. They say Little League by-laws are too restrictive, that they wanted 
more freedom to self-govern. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League Baseball, headquartered in Williamsport, Pa., and Toluca Little 
League filed suit against Toluca Baseball in Los Angeles Superior Court on June 
23, alleging that former Toluca Little League directors misappropriated cash 
and equipment valued at $50,000 to support the rival Pony League. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asks for actual and punitive damages in excess of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The general membership of Toluca Little League voted in December to drop its 
charter and create a Pony League for all age groups. Previously, Pony League 
was available only for youngsters 13 through 16 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League supporters objected to the Pony League assuming control over 
equipment and funds that had been the Little League's. 
</P>
<P>
 Little League by-laws stipulate that if a local charter is unable to function, 
funds and resources must be transferred to another Little League charter. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not happen after the break-up, according to Jim Ferguson, the 
attorney representing Toluca Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the money collected by Little League should be Little League's," he 
said. "It shouldn't be transferred over to another baseball league." 
</P>
<P>
 Toluca Baseball officials counter that the money was raised by volunteers who 
now support Pony Baseball. Equipment was routinely shared by the Little League 
and Pony League for the past five years, said Frank Miceli, president of Toluca 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been mixing it up for too many years now," Miceli said. "Everything got 
all jumbled up and nobody knew what was who's." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cash, Miceli believes it should benefit the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "My business doesn't sponsor Little League baseball," said Miceli, whose 
restaurant sponsors a Pony League team. "It sponsors the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Little League supporters claim that in December the membership was duped into 
voting to drop the charter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the membership was pretty apathetic," said Mike Hirsh, a former 
Toluca Little League director.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Toluca Baseball) buffaloed everybody, saying they just wanted to change the 
by-laws. They didn't say were changing from Little League to Pony League. They 
did it as underhanded as they could." 
</P>
<P>
 The motivation was for the league to become more competitive in postseason 
tournaments, Little League proponents claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people involved over the years have felt that we don't do as well 
in tournaments as we should have," said Diane Bryant, a past president and 
longtime volunteer of Toluca Little League.  
</P>
<P>
 "In effect, that's what Pony Leagues are for. You can stack a team in Pony 
League, but what happens to the other kids who play?" 
</P>
<P>
 Friendships have been torn apart because of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good friends that have been lost," Miceli said. "I 
wouldn't know what to say if I went to some of these people's houses and 
knocked on their door."

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ROUNDUP; CORNELL, JORDAN SELECTED TO NATIONAL SOFTBALL 
TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sheila Cornell and Barbara Jordan, both long-time standouts at the American 
Softball Assn. major division level, will be part of the 17-member U.S. 
national team that will play in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The team officially will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell, 32, from Burbank, and Jordan, 29, a former Cal State Northridge 
All-American, will compete as part of the U.S. team in St. John's, 
Newfoundland, from July 30 to Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 17-member squad, which also will be announced today, will play an 
exhibition series against China, July 22-23. Amy Chellevold, from Thousand 
Oaks, Jenny Dalton, from Glendale, and Karen Walker, from Woodland Hills have 
been selected to that team. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell, a first baseman who played at Taft High and starred at UCLA, is a 
nine-time ASA major-division All-American. Jordan, an outfielder, has been an 
All-American five times, after helping Cal State Northridge win two NCAA 
Division II national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chellevold, a first baseman, is a former Thousand Oaks High volleyball and 
softball star who plays for Arizona, as does Dalton, a second baseman who 
slugged a Southern Section record 28 home runs for Glendale High. Walker, a 
utility player, was an All-American at UCLA after earning All-City honors three 
times for El Camino Real High. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday at the Olympic Festival: 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Baer, opposite hitter for Northridge last volleyball season, had a 
match-high 26 kills to lead the East to a 15-6, 15-9, 15-8 decision over the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Piexoto, a Northridge teammate of Baer's, contributed 11 kills and four 
blocks. Tom Stillwell, a UCLA-bound middle blocker from Notre Dame High, had 
two blocks, one kill and a service ace for the South. 
</P>
<P>
 In other volleyball action, the West team dropped to 0-2 when the North 
rallied from a 14-9 deficit in the final game for an 11-15, 15-9, 10-15, 15-13, 
19-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hewitt, a former Chatsworth High and Northridge middle blocker, played 
well in a losing cause. Hewitt made 22 kills, hit at a .475 percentage and 
contributed a match-high eight blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Severns of Glendale and Doug Hughes of Moorpark contributed for the 
North. Severns, a 6-9 middle blocker who played at Pierce before transferring 
to Loyola Marymount, had eight kills, a service ace and a team-high five 
blocks. Hughes, who plays for UC Santa Barbara, added four kills. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's volleyball, Jennifer Johnson of Sherman Oaks had team-high totals 
of 14 kills and four blocks, but her South team still lost, 15-12, 15- 3, 
10-15, 15-5, to the East. 
</P>
<P>
 In diving, Nancy Janik of Simi Valley finished ninth in the three-meter 
springboard event. Janik accumulated 441.50 points. The winner, Veronica 
Ribot-Canales of Miami, had a score of 516.60.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: HANKS' DEATH ENDS GOLDEN ERA OF MIDGET RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The passing of Sam Hanks last week was more than the death of a great race 
driver. He was perhaps the last link to the golden era of midget auto racing in 
Southern California, a time before air conditioning or TV when watching midget 
racers at Gilmore Stadium was what many people did on warm summer nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore Stadium ran midget races on its quarter-mile oval from 1934 to 1950, 
but it was in the years before World War II, when Hanks, Bob Swanson, Bill 
Betteridge, Curly Mills and Pee Wee Distarce were names as familiar to 
Angelenos as Mike Piazza, Vlade Divac, Jim Everett and J.J. Stokes are today 
that racing flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Raiders or Kings here. The only Angels 
were in the Pacific Coast League. There was no Dodger Stadium, no Sports Arena, 
no Forum, no Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 USC and UCLA played football in the Coliseum. The Rose Bowl was used only on 
New Year's Day or for junior college football, and minor league baseball was 
played at Wrigley Field in what is now Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite place for sports action was the corner of Beverly and Fairfax, 
where Gilmore Stadium, Gilmore Field and the Pan-Pacific Auditorium filled the 
area now occupied by CBS Television City. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore Stadium was the site of annual postseason professional football games, 
in which the likes of Bronko Nagurski, Dutch Clark, Sammy Baugh and Mel Hein 
played against Southern California all-stars before Dan Reeves had brought the 
Rams to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Luisetti, Jackie Robinson, Lee Guttero and Ralph Vaughn played 
basketball, Sonja Henie skated and John Polich played hockey at the 
Pan-Pacific, where the Igloo Room was a favorite sports hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the "mighty midgets," as they were known in the '30s and '40s, that 
were headline news when they raced every Thursday night. In 1937, the year 
Hanks won the track championship, capacity crowds of 18,000 were on hand 
through the summer at Gilmore Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few years, it was possible to watch midget racing every night of the 
week -- at Atlantic Speedway in South Gate, Culver City, Huntington Beach, 
Loyola, Colton, San Bernardino, Balboa Stadium in San Diego, and on occasion, 
the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947, a midget-record 65,128 spectators were at the Coliseum when Hanks 
out-drove Duke Nalon, Duane Carter, Mack Hellings and Bob Pankratz in winning a 
250-mile race on a board track. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks started his career in 1935 at Gilmore Stadium and won 22 races there 
before WW II caused the track to close for four years. When it reopened in 
1946, Hanks was campaigning his midget racer and stock cars in the Midwest and 
East Coast, but he never forgot his roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning national championships in both the champ (Indy) cars and midgets, and 
winning the (Indianapolis) 500 in '57 were all highlights in my career, but the 
years I raced my own midget as car owner, driver and mechanic hold a special 
place in my heart," he said a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for the Alhambra Thin Man, who would have been 80 next 
Wednesday, will be held Saturday at noon in the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys 
at Sherman Way and Valjean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 ORANGE COUNTY FAIR -- Three nights of racing, all free with paid admission to 
the County Fair, are scheduled this weekend. Speedway motorcycles will run the 
Fair Derby in their usual spot on Friday night, three-quarter midgets of the 
United States Auto Club's western region will race on Saturday night. 
Motorcycles with sidecars and quad ATVs are on Sunday night's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- Sportsman drivers of NASCAR's Winston Racing Series will 
headline main events Saturday night at Saugus Speedway and Cajon Speedway in El 
Cajon. Dennis Wooldridge of Riverside is the Cajon sportsman leader with seven 
victories. . . . Street stocks and IMCA modifieds will race Friday night at 
Ventura Raceway. . . . Modified V-8s and legend cars will share the spotlight 
Saturday at Kern County Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Four U.S. riders will try to qualify for the World Speedway 
Final in semifinal rounds Sunday in Prague, the Czech Republic, and Bradford, 
England. Defending world champion Sam Ermolenko of Cypress, American Final 
winner Greg Hancock of Costa Mesa and Billy Hamill of Monrovia will ride in 
Prague. Josh Larsen of Balboa will be at Bradford. The finals are set Aug. 20 
in Vojens, Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRINT CARS -- The second half of the Sprint Car Racing Assn.'s first full 
season gets under way Saturday night at Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix. Rip 
Williams, with three victories, holds a two-point lead over four-time winner 
Ron Shuman. Mike Kirby, 1993 California Racing Assn. champion and the winner of 
the last SCRA race at Manzanita, is also entered. 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- Jerry Hauer, former director of the Indiana Emergency Management 
Agency, has been named by Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George to 
develop an organization to manage, direct and promote a new auto racing series 
beginning in 1996. Hauer, 42, will work closely with the United States Auto 
Club, which sanctions the Indianapolis 500. The series will be in competition 
with the current Indy car series sanctioned by Championship Auto Racing Teams, 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- Portions of Carroll Shelby's collection of racing cars and 
memorabilia will be included in the Newport Beach Classic & Collector Car 
Auction from 5 to 9 p.m. Friday at the Hyatt Newporter Hotel in Newport Beach. 
. . . Brian Tracy, former vice president of sales and development for the 
National Hot Rod Assn., has been named to direct the NHRA's new broadcasting 
department.

TACO BELL PUTS ITS ADVERTISING UP FOR REVIEW; RESTAURANTS: O.C.-BASED CHAIN 
CITES 'MORE COMPLEX' BUSINESS. COMPETING AGENCIES INCLUDE PRESENT ACCOUNT 
HOLDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Taco Bell Corp. has put its $150-million-a-year advertising account up for 
review and expects to make a final decision on hiring an agency by Labor Day, 
the company said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell opened the account to competing bids for the first time in about six 
years because "our business is much more complex today," Taco Bell President 
Kenneth T. Stevens said Wednesday in a prepared statement. "It's time to change 
the rules again and keep our competitors following our lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Foote, Cone & Belding, the San Francisco-based agency that now holds the Taco 
Bell account, is among four agencies invited to compete, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell shook up the fast-food industry with its pioneering value menu in 
1990. Its revolutionary bill of fare emphasized items that cost less than a 
dollar, prompting most competitors, including Anaheim-based Carl's Jr., to jump 
on the value bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are indications that Taco Bell's value menu is beginning to show its 
age. Executives at PepsiCo Inc., Taco Bell's parent company, said last month 
that the restaurant chain's sales increase has "moderated." 
</P>
<P>
 "While we've seen tremendous growth in our business in the last several years, 
we believe it's time to take a fresh approach with our advertising to maintain 
our competitive leadership profile," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Foote, Cone & Belding, agencies vying for the account are Dallas-based 
The Richards Group, Seattle-based Cole & Webber, and Bozell Jacobs Kenyon and 
Eckard, which has offices in Orange County and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell recently awarded Bozell a much smaller contract to handle 
advertising for its Hot 'n Now hamburger chain subsidiary. The value of that 
contract was estimated at $3 million to $5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "We short-listed these agencies based on their highly creative track record 
and retailing capability," Stevens said in the statement. "We're looking for 
business-driving, motivating advertising which is consistent with our brand 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell has 4,500 conventional fast-food restaurants and more than 15,000 
other locations, including kiosks, carts and school lunch programs.

HEAD OF FOX BROADCASTING IS RESIGNING; TV: LUCIE SALHANY, WHO HELPED LURE 
AFFILIATES AND THE NFL CONTRACT, IS SAID TO BE LEAVING BECAUSE OF CLASHES WITH 
RUPERT MURDOCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fox Broadcasting Co. Chairwoman Lucie Salhany, who helped guide the network to 
its groundbreaking National Football League contract and its historic raid on 
12 major network affiliates, is resigning, knowledgeable sources said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, which is expected to be made today, will end months of 
speculation that Salhany would step down after repeated clashes with Fox Inc. 
Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 Salhany, who left Paramount to become head of the upstart fourth network three 
years ago, declined comment when reached in New York: "I'm on the other line 
talking to my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the company said that, despite Fox's high-profile gains this 
year with football and the affiliates, which were acquired in a $500-million 
deal with New World Communications Group, Salhany has become increasingly 
unhappy under Murdoch's scrutiny. She was also said to be opposed to Carey's 
increasing involvement in her division. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, sources added that Salhany has come under pressure because 
of Fox's declining ratings this past season and the absence of a clear 
prime-time programming success under her regime. "Rupert's expectations were it 
was going to go up," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Salhany was tarred with last year's "The Chevy Chase Show" 
debacle. She was the biggest champion of the late-night talk program starring 
Chase, which lost millions of dollars for Fox when it was canceled after three 
months on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch was on vacation and could not be reached. A Fox spokesman declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Salhany, who was recruited by former Fox Chairman Barry Diller, was known as a 
brass-knuckles negotiator who liked to buck the system. For example, shortly 
after she joined Fox, she made the highly criticized decision to cancel the 
popular TV series "Anything but Love," even though ABC (for which Fox produced 
the show) wanted to keep it on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Salhany's argument was that the show would not make enough profit in 
syndication because it was only a moderate hit and that Fox could no longer 
afford to produce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox executives were still working on a management reorganization Wednesday. 
The fate of Fox Entertainment President Sandy Grushow, who works under Salhany 
as the network's chief programmer, could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 It was expected that Carey would be handed some of the responsibilities for 
running the network. In addition, former Fox Entertainment head Peter Chernin, 
who now oversees the studio's film division, may reassume some responsibilities 
for the network. 
</P>
<P>
 One name that keeps surfacing in connection with Fox's TV operations is that 
of Sam Chisholm, who now runs all foreign TV for Murdoch's News Corp. Although 
he is a trusted Murdoch manager (Chisholm is on the News Corp. board), sources 
said the appointment of the New Zealand-born Chisholm would raise troubling

BREWERS UNITE TO GO AFTER U.S. MARKET; MERGER: CANADA'S LABATT AND MEXICO'S 
FEMSA CERVEZA WILL COMBINE AMERICAN OPERATIONS IN A $510-MILLION DEAL. 
</P>

 Two prominent brewers, based in Canada and Mexico, said Wednesday they have 
agreed to merge their U.S. units and market each other's brands, joining forces 
to compete more effectively under free trade rules in the vast North American 
beer market. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the deal, John Labatt Ltd., Canada's second-largest beer company, 
will also acquire for $510 million a 22% stake in FEMSA Cerveza, Mexico's 
largest brewer. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which is seen as strengthening the Mexican and Canadian 
competitors of the U.S.-based giants, includes a three-year option for John 
Labatt to buy another 8% of FEMSA Cerveza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican firm, which holds 48% of the Mexican beer market, produces Tecate, 
Dos Equis, Superior and Carta Blanca brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Labatt, which has a 44% market share in Canada, makes Canada's best-selling 
beer, Labatt Blue, Labatt Ice and Labatt Genuine Draft. It also brews Budweiser 
and Carlsberg brands under license in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Labatt and FEMSA intend to distribute each other's brands in their own 
countries and will merge their U.S. operations into a specialty company to 
expand in the fast-growing and profitable U.S. market for imports, "micro 
brews," super-premium beers and domestic specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is expected to be completed by late September. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the U.S. brewers' marketing power and low prices, Mexican and 
Canadian beers were among the products feared to be at most risk under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, which gradually reduces tariffs on 
products exported within the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. brewers in the last year have formed strategic alliances with Mexican and 
Canadian firms, but the FEMSA-Labatt agreement would be the first between 
Mexican and Canadian companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, FEMSA rival Modelo Group, which makes Corona beer, sold a 17.7% 
interest in the company to Anheuser Busch for $477 million. Miller Brewing Co. 
signed a $273-million marketing agreement with Canada's Moulson Breweries. 
Miller's parent, Phillip Morris Co., also owns 7.9% of FEMSA, the corporate 
parent of FEMSA Cerveza. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining forces, Labatt President George Taylor said, Labatt and FEMSA 
"will create a powerful vehicle for maximum penetration of North American 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
 There is "an enormous cultural compatibility between Canadian and Mexican 
companies," said Violy McCausland of James D. Wolfensohn, the New York 
investment banker that advised Labatt. "Both are more informal and less 
corporate." 
</P>
<P>
 The companies are of similar size: FEMSA Cerveza had $1.3 billion in sales in 
its most recent fiscal year; Labatt had sales of $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture exemplifies the growing mutual interest between Mexican and 
Canadian companies. Earlier this year, the Canadian Embassy in Mexico sponsored 
that country's largest foreign trade show, with 426 companies represented, and 
plans to establish Canada's first foreign business center in the Mexican 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal also is another step in the restructuring of FEMSA. As one of 
Mexico's largest food conglomerates, it has been forming alliances with foreign 
companies in order to gain a more competitive position and reduce debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, FEMSA sold a 30% stake in its Coca-Cola subsidiary to the Coca-Cola 
Co. for $30 million, then raised another $177.4 million in an offering of 19% 
of the subsidiary's stock on U.S., Mexican and European markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has been considering a stock offering in the brewery 
subsidiary.

THE BUCK HOPS HERE; THE PUNCHY U.S. DOLLAR IS FLYING HIGH IN CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 While an American tourist in Paris these days might find the restaurant tab 
for le menu de degustation worse for the heart than a double dose of 
cholesterol, in this French-accented city just north of the U.S. border, the 
bill could tempt you to indulge in a second dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. dollar may be punchy in Europe and Japan, but it still packs its old 
wallop in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian dollar has hovered near 72 cents for about three months now, down 
four cents from the beginning of the year, six cents from a year ago and 11 
cents since mid-1989. Analysts here predict it will decline even more, perhaps 
matching the all-time low of 69.2 cents, struck in February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 While this may not be great for Canadian pride -- or interest rates -- it's 
not entirely bad for business here. Because the two economies are so closely 
tied -- nearly 80% of Canada's trade is with the United States -- the weakening 
Canadian dollar has created opportunities for Canadian exporters, U.S. 
companies that manufacture goods in Canada and the tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the U.S. dollar has been battered by the major currencies, it does 
much better against the Canadian dollar, and that's likely to continue," said 
Robert Palombi, an economist with MMS International, a Toronto consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other analysts project a continued downward trend for the Canadian 
dollar based on uncertainty surrounding an upcoming provincial election in 
Quebec -- the Parti Quebecois, dedicated to Quebec independence, is leading in 
the polls -- and Canada's high public debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada has been following the United States out of recession this year, and 
the newest government figures, reported last week, show that the Canadian 
economy grew by 0.3% in April, fueled largely by record exports, particularly 
of automobiles. While manufacturing and trade grew, retailing was off slightly, 
reflecting some nervousness about higher interest rates. The prime rate jumped 
to 8% from 5.5% between February and June. The gap between U.S. and Canada 
interest rates also has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Americans, however, the most noticeable effect of the widening 
currency exchange rate is to make Canada a much more attractive vacation 
destination. With the summer tourism season just getting underway in earnest in 
Canada, the buses are lining up outside the landmark Chateau Frontenac hotel 
here, and rivers of tourists flow through the narrow streets of the walled old 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly four years of recession, the tourism industry here looks forward 
to a surge of U.S. visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec innkeeper Valerie Andree Authier recently returned from a meeting with 
U.S. travel agents, where she emphasized the favorable exchange rate. Authier's 
inn, the 27-room La Pinsonniere, on the scenic Charlevoix coast of the St. 
Lawrence River east of Quebec City, is a member of the exclusive Relais & 
Chateaux group of resorts and restaurants, and doesn't exactly cater to 
bargain-hunters. Guests pay up to $180 a night U.S. ($250 Canadian) for a 
premium room, and more if gourmet meals are included. 
</P>
<P>
 But Authier's sales pitch is that La Pinsonniere is far more reasonable for 
American visitors than similar upscale inns just south of the border. She is 
careful to explain the exchange rate to American callers and says that even in 
this price bracket, "it certainly does have an impact . . . . You're always 
trying to take advantage of a better exchange rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope McCatty, owner of the 23-room Dutch Inn ($39.60 U.S. per night, $55 
Canadian) in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is on a similar campaign. She doesn't 
think enough is being done to promote Canada as a destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't advise the Americans enough that their dollars make Canada a good 
vacation," she said. "I always mention it when I talk to Americans on the 
phone, but we have to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 David Redekop, director of the Canadian Tourism Research Institute in Ottawa, 
said that in the first four months of 1994, trips of one night or more by 
Americans to Canada were up 5% over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a trend we expect to continue," Redekop said. "We expect a 5% to 6% 
increase this year; in April alone it was up 6.2%." 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's research shows that the exchange rate was a significant factor 
in the increase, he added. At the same time, Canadians are staying home; visits 
to the United States were down 10.6% through April. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hamilton, manager of communications for the Metropolitan Toronto 
Convention & Visitors Assn., said research on travel motivation shows that 
value is a secondary concern when selecting a vacation spot, but may play more 
heavily into a decision about how to spend money once a tourist arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't select a destination first and foremost because it's a bargain," 
he said. "It almost always is driven by having friends and family in the area 
or by things you want to do, such as go to museums. . . . Cost is not a primary 
motivator, but it's part of the equation." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the favorable exchange rate has a contributing, but secondary, 
effect on other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the automobile industry. "It's now an awful lot cheaper to build a car in 
Canada than the United States," said Robert Fairholm, chief economic forecaster 
for DRI Canada. "They pay their workers in low Canadian dollars and sell the 
cars in the United States for U.S. dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, nearly 2.24 million vehicles were manufactured in Canada, half of 
them for export, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc. of 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canada is the best spot in North America, if not the world, to manufacture 
vehicles," said Dennis DesRosiers, who heads the firm. But the principal reason 
it is less expensive to manufacture here, he said, is the lower cost of health 
care for employees. Canada guarantees care for all under a tax-paid system 
administered by federal and provincial governments. The exchange rate is "a 
significant bonus," DesRosiers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's provincial film boards also factor the exchange rate into their 
aggressive courting of Hollywood productions. Vancouver and Toronto are well 
established movie-making centers; Viacom recently announced it will produce 12 
to 15 films, at a cost of $50 million, in Toronto over the next 12 months for 
its Showtime cable network. And this summer, cameras are rolling on Stephen 
King's "Dolores Claiborne" and on "The Scarlet Letter," starring Demi Moore, in 
Nova Scotia, which until last year had never hosted a major movie shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Producers always look at the bottom line, so when you get a spread (in the 
exchange rate) like we've had lately, it certainly helps," said Helen Wickwire 
Foster of the Nova Scotia Film Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drooping Canadian dollar also means trouble for some businesses. 
Consider the Toronto Blue Jays. Baseball's two-time defending World Series 
champions pay their players (estimated payroll $40.5 million) and most other 
costs in U.S. dollars. But the bulk of their revenue is in Canadian dollars. 
So, every one-cent decline of the Canadian dollar costs the club about 
$850,000, according to Howard Starkman, director of public relations. Where the 
Dollar's Strong

Canada. The U.S. dollar in Canadian dollars, quarterly closes, except latest:

FED PANEL SIGNALS NO PLANS FOR RATE HIKE; POLICY: AFTER 2-DAY MEETING, 
GOVERNMENT SAYS ONLY THAT THERE IS 'NO FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT.' ANALYSTS WELCOME 
THE NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's key policy-setting panel concluded a two-day closed-door 
session Wednesday without signaling any immediate plans to raise interest rates 
again, calming jittery financial markets that feared another rate increase 
might be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed Open Market Committee, which sets the short-term interest rates that 
influence economic growth and inflation, adjourned its meeting at midday, and 
Fed spokesmen said only that "there will be no further announcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists and traders, citing indications that U.S. economic growth is 
slowing in several key sectors, said they do not expect the Fed to raise rates 
a fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts, though, speculated that the Fed might feel compelled to act to 
halt the dollar's continuing decline against the Japanese and German 
currencies. Higher interest on U.S. bonds and Treasury securities attract 
foreign investment and tend to strengthen the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell to new postwar lows against the Japanese yen Wednesday and 
dropped to its lowest level of the year against the German mark. It would have 
taken a massive move by the Fed to slow the decline, market watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank may still decide to raise rates in the next few days or 
weeks. However, the central bank has apparently adopted a wait-and-see attitude 
in anticipation of June unemployment numbers Friday and possible word of 
concerted international action on interest or exchange rates from the Group of 
Seven economic summit this weekend in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials did not want to be seen preempting the actions of government 
leaders at the G-7 meeting, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists also suggested that the Fed will want to see whether the slowdown 
in automobile sales and the June dip in home-building activity are merely 
temporary blips in a fast-growing economy or signs of an overall economic 
cooling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Open Market Committee is composed of Federal Reserve board members in 
Washington and Fed regional bank presidents. The panel next meets on Aug. 16. 
The Fed has increased the federal funds rate -- the interest banks charge one 
another for overnight loans -- four times this year, from 3% to 4.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent increase, on May 17, was accompanied by an increase in the 
discount rate -- the interest the Fed charges for direct loans to banks. That 
rate stands at 3.5%, up from 3%, where it had been for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The May discount rate increase prompted a rise to 7.25% in the prime lending 
rate for most big banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in recent congressional testimony 
defended the increases as necessary to keep the economy from overheating and 
sparking a surge in inflation. And although he left open his options for 
further increases, Greenspan indicated at that time that the central bank was 
likely to allow the effects of the four increases to work through the economy 
before the bank would move to raise rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is looking to me as good as I've seen an economy evolving in a balanced 
form in a very long period of time," Greenspan told the Senate Banking, Housing 
and Urban Affairs Committee in late May after the last rate increases. "The 
economy is moving at a fairly respectable pace . . . (and) could go on for 
quite a long period of time, provided that inflationary imbalances don't 
emerge." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts welcomed the news of Wednesday's inaction, saying that inflation 
remains under control and that higher interest rates would only punish 
businesses and consumers while doing little to bolster the dollar or stabilize 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to hear that they broke up and announced nothing," said Martin A. 
Regalia, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "The only 
(announcement) that could have come out of that meeting would be either 
moderately bad or very bad news. We have dodged the first bullet in the 
six-shooter."

 SEC, Industry Discuss Derivatives Guidelines: As Congress tries to craft rules 
to rein in the derivatives business, the Securities and Exchange Commission is 
discussing voluntary guidelines with six of the nation's largest derivatives 
dealers.The genesis of the talks is an April letter to the SEC from the 
Securities Industry Assn., Wall Street's main trade group. It proposes periodic 
reporting to the SEC or other regulators about derivatives risks; industry 
standards for investor protection; capital standards, and financial statement 
disclosure for derivatives. The SEC talks involve CS First Boston, Goldman 
Sachs & Co., Salomon Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., Lehman Brothers and Morgan 
Stanley & Co. None of the firms would comment on the discussions.

 Report Proposes Changes for World Bank, IMF: The Commission on the Future of 
the Bretton Woods Institutions, headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul 
A. Volcker, says in a study coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the 
International Monetary Fund and World Bank that the two institutions need basic 
changes. The report says countries should establish a formal system of 
coordination to help avoid roller-coaster trading in the currency markets. The 
World Bank, it says, should emphasize assistance for private sector development 
rather than loans to governments, and that the bank's lending should be limited 
to projects "the private sector cannot or will not do."

 Northrop Grumman Unit Pays $2.2-Million Settlement: The payment was made by 
Grumman Data Systems Corp. to settle allegations that a former GDS executive 
knowingly overcharged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 
installing a supercomputer in 1989, the Justice Department said. (GDS and its 
former parent, Grumman Corp., were bought two months ago by Los Angeles-based 
Northrop Corp., which is now called Northrop Grumman Corp.) The Justice 
Department said the total settlement was $3.3 million, and it noted that GDS 
had earlier repaid $1.1 million to NASA. The former executive, Howard 
Broderson, is awaiting federal trial on criminal fraud charges.

 Trucks Lead Rise in Vehicle Sales: Demand for vans, pickups and sport-utility 
vehicles helped drive total June vehicle sales up 7.3%, major auto makers 
reported.Light-truck sales were up nearly 11% for the month and 15% for the 
first half. Ford truck sales rose 10% over June, 1993, and are up 15% for the 
year. Chrysler's June truck sales were up 11.3%, and year-to-date deliveries 
rose nearly 18%. General Motors did not report sales figures because of a 
companywide two-week summer shutdown, but estimates put GM light-truck sales 
for June about 5% ahead of last year and up more than 12% for the year. Car 
sales overall for June were up about 5%, with Japanese firms reporting strong 
performances.

BONDS, STOCKS MIXED DESPITE FED RESTRAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks and bonds finished mixed for a second consecutive session, mostly 
unmoved by the Federal Reserve Board's decision not to raise short-term 
interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials rose 22.02 points to 3,674.50, but 
that was largely because of big moves in a few stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad market finished flat; the Standard & Poor's 500 index eased 0.24 
point to 446.13, and losing stocks narrowly outnumbered rising issues on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, short-term yields slid after the Fed ended its policy 
meeting without taking action. The yield on three-month Treasury bills dropped 
to 4.35% from 4.42% at Tuesday's auction. 
</P>
<P>
 But longer-term yields were mostly unchanged. The yield on the 30-year T-bond 
edged up to 7.59% from 7.58% Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they were surprised by the bond market's indifference to 
the Fed's apparent decision to keep monetary policy unchanged for the next six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the dollar began to slide in late June, Wall Street has feared that the 
Fed would feel compelled to raise short-term rates again, to defend the 
currency. Those fears have helped push the yield on the one-year T-bill, for 
example, to 5.42% now from 5.23% on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that most bond yields held steady on Wednesday, after the Fed ended 
its meeting, suggested to some analysts that the market remains wary about 
Friday's June employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 If the employment report is stronger than expected it could encourage the Fed 
to tighten credit for economic reasons, not to help the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the dollar rallied from a 14-month low against the German mark 
after a spokesman for French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said monetary 
issues would be a main topic at the Group of Seven summit this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended at 1.575 German marks in New York after dropping to 1.565 
marks, lowest since late-April 1993. But Wednesday's close still was lower than 
the 1.580 marks at Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also eased 98.85 Japanese yen, just below Tuesday's close of 98.90. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodity markets prices overall were lower again. Oil prices fell on 
profit-taking as the market appeared to downplay recent concerns about supply 
interruptions in Yemen and Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 August crude oil futures dropped 38 cents a barrel to $19.24 at the New York 
Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow got a lift as bargain-hunters bid Caterpillar up 2 3/4 to 104 1/2; 
Alcoa, up 1 1/8 to 77; International Paper, up 1 3/4 to 68 3/4, and Texaco, 
which gained 1 5/8 to 62 1/2 in reaction to Tuesday's report of new 
cost-cutting plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Dime Bancorp of New York tumbled 1 3/8 to 9 1/4 after 
agreeing to merge with Anchor Bancorp to create the nation's fourth-largest 
savings bank, with $20 billion in assets. Anchor fell 7/16 to 15 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors also continued to punish computer networker Wellfleet 
Communications, which on Tuesday agreed to buy SynOptics, another networker. 
Wellfleet shares slumped 7/8 to 19 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earnings reports and previews took a toll on the market. Amway Asia Pacific 
lost 7 1/4 to 26 7/8 after reporting lower quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications equipment maker Summa Four plunged 10 1/4 to 11 3/4 after 
saying quarterly earnings won't meet expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, brokerage Salomon fell 2 to 45 1/2 after previewing its second-quarter 
results, which will amount to a large loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo stocks ended with moderate losses. The Nikkei index closed off 
205.34 points at 20,629.03. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's DAX average ended up 3.01 points at 2,035.70, while London's 
FTSE-100 slid 18.3 points to 2,946.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slumped 168.27 points to 8,454.92, lowest since 
May 9.

DOLLAR HOLDING STRONG AGAINST MEXICO'S PESO; EXCHANGE: POLITICAL UNREST SOUTH 
OF THE BORDER AND RISING U.S. INTEREST RATES ARE FACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the dollar is tumbling in Europe and Japan, it is still formidable in 
Mexico, where it has gained 9% in value against the peso since December. 
</P>
<P>
 A dollar officially will now buy 3.39 new pesos, compared with 3.11 new pesos 
at the end of last year. The drop in the peso reflects the fact that money is 
leaving this country because of a combination of political and financial 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 1 uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and the March 23 
assassination of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio 
introduced an element of political instability that has undermined confidence 
in the Mexican economy. That uncertainty has been exacerbated by the closest 
presidential race the country has seen in 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, because Mexico relies heavily on U.S. investment in its stock and bond 
markets, it is vulnerable when interest rates rise in the United States, as 
they have this year. Higher interest rates north of the border tend to siphon 
off part of the money that would otherwise be used to buy Mexican stocks and 
debt instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Mexican inflation is officially about 8% a year, considerably 
higher than the U.S. inflation rate of about 3%. So foreigners need added 
incentive to invest in Mexican assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have attempted to stem the outflow of capital by raising domestic 
interest rates and offering investors dollar-denominated Mexican Treasury 
bills. The government also has used an unspecified portion of its international 
reserves to buy pesos for dollars, thus keeping the peso's slide from becoming 
too steep. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, because the government can't afford to drive interest rates too 
high in an already sluggish economy, or draw down international reserves too 
far, it has used those tools only to stem the peso's decline, not to arrest it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a balancing act," explained one government official. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides its international reserves, Mexico can draw on a $6 billion line of 
credit from the U.S. Treasury to defend the peso, if necessary. "While we have 
not used that line, it is extremely important psychologically," said a 
government official, who asked not to be named. "It is like a second reserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Peso devaluation is a sensitive issue in Mexico, especially in an election 
year. In 1976 and 1982, also election years, the government announced deep 
devaluations that wiped out the life savings of many Mexicans and left 
companies that had dollar debt on the verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are hopeful that allowing a moderate slide will relieve fears of a 
deeper devaluation, however. It could also boost tourism and exports and ease 
the country's trade deficit by making it cheaper to travel in Mexico or to buy 
Mexican goods.

N.J. BELL GETS COMMERCIAL VIDEO PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators granted the first phone company request for permission to 
deliver commercial video services to consumers Wednesday, but a backlog of 
similar requests await action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission cleared the way for New Jersey Bell to 
carry programs over its telephone network to 38,000 residents of Dover Township 
in northern New Jersey. The commission has approved a handful of phone company 
experiments with video services, but Wednesday's announcement was the first 
go-ahead for commercial service. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision raised hopes among other Bell operators that the FCC would step 
up its handling of their own applications. There are 21 other applications for 
commercial services still pending and FCC Chairman Reed Hundt recently promised 
to streamline the system for a quicker response. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey program, because it is commercial, could also help show whether 
Bell companies can make money offering cable-type services over their networks 
given the high additional cost per subscriber of upgrading networks to carry 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FCC rules adopted in 1992, local telephone companies are not allowed to 
offer programs to subscribers. Instead, they may charge a regulated fee to 
deliver programs put together by independent producers. The pro gram suppliers 
set the prices consumers will pay for individual programs or packages of 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure the telephone company does not subsidize its video operation with 
money from its regular phone customers, the FCC is requiring New Jersey Bell to 
itemize and separate video-related expenses from voice and data expenses. The 
information is to be reported to the commission on a regular basis, FCC 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Bell's first provider, FutureVision, plans to program 60 of 384 
channels on the phone company's system early next year, FutureVision President 
Bob Schena said in an interview Wednesday. Schena said his customers will pay 
"20% less than they currently pay for comparable video service."

 Ford Raises '95 Prices: The No. 2 U.S. auto maker said prices on some 1995 
models are being increased by an average 2.2%, or $419 per vehicle, over 1994 
versions.Prices for Ford's 1995 light-duty trucks will be announced later this 
summer. The company instituted a $200 price increase on 1994 models of its 
popular Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The increases are effective 
immediately, so dealers can take orders from customers ahead of the models' 
Sept. 29 public introduction. The increases affect all models except the 
Contour, Probe, Mercury Mystique and Lincoln Continental. Prices on those will 
be announced later, Ford said. Last week, industry leader GM said it would 
raise '95 model prices by an average 2.5%.

 Lockheed Offers to Cut Price of F-16s: The company's move underscores an 
aggressive new posture by defense contractors trying to survive amid dwindling 
Pentagon orders.Lockheed said its Ft. Worth, Tex., plant could build 12 to 24 
F-16 jet fighters a year starting in 1997 for $20 million per plane, which the 
company said represents a savings of $3 million per plane. The offer follows a 
decision by Congress to shut down the F-16 line. But Lockheed officials cited 
Air Force documents indicating that 100 new F-16s will be needed as 
replacements over the next decade. Lockheed already has orders for 540 F-16s 
for delivery to the Pentagon and eight foreign countries through 1999.

IRS SMACKS ITS LIPS, EYES BIGGER BITE OF RESTAURANT TIP INCOME; TAXES: PROGRAM 
OFFERS EMPLOYERS RELIEF FROM AUDITS WHEN EMPLOYEES REPORT HIGHER GRATUITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never one to pass up a good tip -- or even a measly one -- the IRS has 
launched a nationwide program to increase tax revenue from the gratuities of 
restaurant workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The voluntary Tip Rate and Education Program requires owners of participating 
businesses -- principally restaurants, bars and cocktail lounges -- to fill out 
a batch of new paperwork. Restaurant owners also would have to encourage their 
employees to sign up in order to make the plan work. 
</P>
<P>
 That has fueled opposition from the National Restaurant Assn. and most of its 
state affiliates, including the California Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem with it is that the IRS seems to be putting pressure on employers 
to force their workers to report higher tips," said Michael Rhodes, president 
of the association's Orange County chapter and owner of Frontier Restaurants, 
an Orange-based chain that operates the Knowl-Wood and Russell's Famous 
hamburger chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service says it is offering a pretty big carrot: 
restaurants with at least 75% employee participation are being promised relief 
from the agency's tip-income audits. 
</P>
<P>
 And employees who participate and report tips at or above the agreed-upon rate 
for their restaurant also would be exempted from tip audits, which can involve 
an IRS check of financial records as far back as 1988. Employees found to have 
underreported tip income are assessed for back taxes and, potentially, 
penalties; their employers are required to pay federal Social Security taxes on 
the unreported tip income. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit exemption might make some employees happy, but restaurant owners see 
it as a cudgel, not a carrot, Rhodes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts the restaurateur in the middle by pressuring us to force our 
employees to report more tip income" in return for relief from potentially 
costly tip audits, he said. "The employer should not be serving as tax 
collection agent." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes, whose 13 restaurants are mainly fast-food types in which tipping is 
rare, also complained that "carwashes, beauty shops and all the other places" 
where tips are a big part of employees' income are not included in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the National Restaurant Assn. has begun lobbying in Washington for 
congressional action to do away with the plan or to revise it to relieve 
employers of responsibility for employees' tip reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the food industry, those who deal directly with customers are now presumed 
by the IRS to make at least 8% of their income from tips. "If you don't report 
at least 8% you know they are coming after you," said Robby Robfogel, manager 
of the Crab Cooker in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the traditional restaurant tip is 15%, the IRS sees a big gap that 
it wants to close.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; HOTELS CATERING TO GUESTS WHO 
DON'T STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Efforts to trim corporate travel budgets have led more business travelers to 
try to avoid overnight stays whenever possible. But that has also left many 
with a problem: how to get business done without having a base of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 To address this need, more hotels and some restaurants have begun offering 
day-use rates for business travelers. And now that more hotel rooms have 
business amenities such as computer hookups, fax machines, multiple phone lines 
and work areas, rooms can serve as offices for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've definitely seen a shortening of the length of stays on business trips," 
said Robert Mandelbaum, director of research for San Francisco-based PKF 
Consulting, which specializes in the hospitality industry. Near airports, in 
particular, business travelers often fly in early for a day of meetings or 
interviews and fly out later that evening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to the Travel Industry Assn. in Washington,, the percentage 
of one-day business trips jumped from 8% in 1992 to 10% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Hotel & Motel Assn. doesn't keep figures on day use of rooms, but 
spokeswoman Maura Nelson said: "It doesn't surprise me that there is a need 
developing. It's another way of adapting to changing business travel budgets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And there is more than just cost-cutting driving the trend, said Rosalind 
Williams, executive director of the Newport Beach Convention and Visitors 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also time-saving," she said. Someone can fly in from the East Coast, 
rent a hotel room for a few hours' worth of interviews, then move to the next 
destination. You can get two cities out of the way in a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheaper air fares in short-haul markets and more frequent flights have made it 
possible to avoid overnight stays, corporate travel managers say. Day trips 
save about $200 a person by eliminating the cost of food, rental cars, gasoline 
and overnight lodging, one oil company travel manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel industry is hoping to capitalize on the frequency of one-day trips 
by offering day-use rates, or rentals of fax machines or computers, Mandelbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business people already use hotel lobbies as offices, Mandelbaum said, 
and hotel managers are recognizing that they can capture some of those business 
travel dollars by offering the itinerant office person a place to perch and

<P>
 "I know I've sometimes parked myself at a pay phone in a hotel lobby for an 
hour or more, to make calls when I'm traveling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena, for example, now gets an 
average of five requests a month for daytime business use of its rooms, said 
spokeswoman Landry Kimbrough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ritz-Carlton offers suites in private cottages for meetings of eight or 10 
people, or will rent rooms in the main hotel at a reduced rate for use during 
the day. The rates depend on the size of the room and number of people in the 
group, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Hilton & Towers, business travelers can rent a room for the 
day at 50% of the corporate room rate. Rooms in the Hilton Towers have access 
to a conference room, as well as business room amenities such as fax machines, 
desks and modems. At the Beverly Hilton, day guests also get complimentary use 
of a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Hyatt Regency hotels offer their half-price Business Plan rooms on 
a day-use basis, said Cheryl Phelps, Hyatt regional vice president. Each room 
has a large desk with a computer hookup and fax machine, and each Business Plan 
floor has a lounge equipped with a copier and printer available 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Peninsula Beverly Hills recently began offering corporate travelers a 
chance to work in a variety of locations, including semi-private tables in the 
back of the hotel's salon area, tables on the dining patio or private cabanas 
near the pool. There is no charge for working in the salon or dining area, but 
cabanas are $100 a day between 6:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel rents laptop computers for $50 a day, and will supply a phone or fax 
machine on request. Charges for the phone and fax depend on usage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of the major hotels in Newport Beach also offer reduced rates on rooms by 
day, said Williams of the convention bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting next month at Rox restaurant, next to the Beverly Prescott in Beverly 
Hills, business clients will be able to use a special room adjacent to the 
dining room until about 5 p.m. There will be no charge for "renting the table," 
said General Manager David Smith, and customers will be able to bill an account 
for phone calls or meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith got the idea for the corporate room while he was doing paperwork there 
himself one day. He noticed a line of out-of-town salespeople camped out at the 
pay phones, some for as long as three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the restaurant's customers are business travelers down for the day 
from the San Francisco Bay Area, he said. "I thought, wouldn't it be great to, 
essentially, be able to check into a table for the day."

 Norway is one of the globe's richest countries, with a per capita income last 
year of more than $25,000. However, economic growth last year was tepid due, in 
part, to the recession in Western Europe. Britain accounts for about 25% of 
Norway exports, followed by Germany with about 13%.

 U.S.-Japan Talks Unable to Reach Accord: The United States and Japan wrapped 
up trade talks in two of three areas without an agreement. Both sides were 
aiming to reach an agreement by the opening of the G-7 meeting of 
industrialized nations in Naples on Friday -- the first anniversary of this 
preliminary round of trade talks. The three areas -- opening up Japan's markets 
for insurance; for autos and auto parts, and getting the Japanese government to 
buy more American medical and telecommunications equipment -- are the heart of 
the framework talks.

 Cuban Crackdown Targets Suspected Profiteers: Cuban authorities are 
investigating hundreds of people suspected of getting rich illegally.The 
authorities are confiscating houses, cars and money as a precaution, state 
prosecutor Juan Escalona said. Escalona, quoted by the state news agency AIN, 
described a crackdown, on black marketeers among others, that began with the 
passing of a law in May providing for confiscation of goods and money from 
people profiting from Cuba's current severe economic crisis. Property may be 
returned later if suspects can prove they acquired them by legal means.

 German Unemployment Down, Marking Recession's End: Unemployment in eastern and 
western Germany fell in June, reflecting the end of the country's recession, 
the Federal Labor Office said.The unemployment rate, which is based on 
unadjusted data, slipped in the west to 8.0% from 8.1% in May. The eastern 
German jobless rate in June was 14.8% compared with 15.4% the previous month 
because of increased demand for labor, said Labor Office Vice President Klaus 
Leven. The statistics reflected increased demand for labor in east.

 China Passes Tough Real Estate Law: China has passed its first urban real 
estate management law, laying down tougher standards for real estate 
transactions to curb speculation, the official China Securities newspaper 
reported. The law, passed by China's parliament and effective on Jan. 1, 1995, 
says developers who fail to start construction within a year of the launch date 
agreed in their leasing contract to face a fine of as much as 20% of the 
leasing fee, the paper said. After two years without development, land-use 
rights can be withdrawn, the rules say.

U.S., FOREIGN NEW-CAR SALES REMAIN ROBUST; AUTOS: THE STRONG DEMAND IS EXPECTED 
INTO 1995. LOCAL IMPORTERS REPORT DRAMATIC SURGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The big auto makers of Detroit and Japan on Wednesday reported robust new-car 
sales in the United States for the first half of the year -- a trend that is 
expected to continue into 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 And while sales were strong for the giant car companies, sales figures have 
practically skyrocketed for the automotive importers based in Orange County, 
who make up the so-called second tier of Asian auto companies in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America -- with a 34% sales 
hike -- four members of the quintet reported that their combined six-month 
sales through June 30 were up 24% from the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding Kia Motors North America, which did not begin selling its 
Korean-built cars in the United States until February, the Orange County-based 
importers sold 394,653 cars and trucks in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a real roll this year," said Richard D. Recchia, chief operating 
officer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales. "This is the sixth consecutive month our 
sales have been above 1993 levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the overall sales gains by Japanese importers, Recchia said that 
"reports of the death of the Japanese auto makers in the U.S. because of the 
weak yen (which boosts the price of imports) were premature . . . people forgot 
that we all sell a lot of cars that are built here in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic auto makers -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- sold 5.74 million 
vehicles in the first half of the year, a 9.1% increase, and the major Japanese 
importers -- Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. and American Honda Motor Co., both in 
Torrance, and Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A., in Carson -- sold a total of 1.3 
million vehicles for an 11.3% hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Most European auto makers also were reporting significant sales increases, 
although their numbers are comparatively small.  
</P>
<P>
 Auto analysts expect total car, truck and minivan sales in the United States 
to hit 15.5 million this year, up from 14 million in 1993. The buying binge 
comes from pent-up demand as most of the nation recovers from the recession. 
Sales in Southern California, where the economy remains sluggish, also have 
begun picking up, but not at a pace that matches the national rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County importers, ranked in order of first-half sales, are: 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda Motor of America Inc., Irvine, 197,983, up 24%; Mitsubishi, 119,560, up 
34%; Hyundai Motor America Inc., Fountain Valley, 61,867, up 9%; and American 
Suzuki Motor Corp., Brea, 15,243, up 26%. Kia, also in Irvine, has sold 4,646 
cars since it began U.S. sales five months ago. The company won't be a 
nationwide distributor until late 1995 or early 1996. So far, Kia has 66 
dealerships in 11 states.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; J.M. PETERS PAYS $17.8 MILLION TO BUY 216 LOTS IN 
RANCHO SAN CLEMENTE

 J.M. Peters Co., the Newport Beach home builder, flush with cash from a 
$100-million junk bond sale in May, has acquired two major Southern California 
properties this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the company said it had purchased a 216-lot property in Rancho 
San Clemente, a master-planned community in the coastal hills above San 
Clemente.Peters bought the lots for $17.8 million in cash from Richland 
Interests of Texas. The fully finished lots range in size from 5,000 square 
feet to 6,000 square feet.  
</P>
<P>
 "A rapidly dwindling supply of finished lots in Orange County has already 
created a significant decrease in new-housing supply at precisely the moment 
that Orange County enters its post-recessionary period of recovery and 
increasing new-home demand," said Hadi Makarechian, chairman and chief 
executive officer of J.M. Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 The company on Tuesday announced that it had paid $26 million for 175 
estate-sized housing lots in Tarzana, where it plans to build homes ranging in 
size from 3,500 square feet to 5,000 square feet on lots ranging from 10,000 
square feet to 17,000 square feet.

TRADING CHIC EATS FOR FAMILY VALUES; RESTAURANTS: UPSCALE ZUNI GRILL WILL 
BECOME SADDLEROCK RANCH, OFFERING MEATLOAF AND A 'BUCKAROO'S MENU.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zuni Grill, Orange County restaurateur David Wilhelm's chic Southwestern-style 
eatery in Irvine, is being converted to a family-style restaurant featuring 
"home style" entrees, lower prices and a children's menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddlerock Ranch, to open Friday, will offers ribs, fried chicken, meatloaf 
and an all-you-can-eat salad bar. The "Buckaroo's Menu" for children will 
include a $2.95 entree complete with a Buckaroo sundae, crayons and a place mat 
to color. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuni Grill, by contrast, was known as an adult haven, with its comfortable bar 
and an adventurous menu that featured tamales, chilies, braised pork and 
elaborate desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zuni Grill opened in 1991, its publicist described the restaurant as a 
"creative blend of contemporary chic and Santa Fe sassy." Zuni's bill of fare 
delighted critics, but the eatery failed to attract families who are drawn by 
the heftier portions and lower prices delivered by competitors such as Claim 
Jumper, Olive Garden and Chevy's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zuni was out of its league in the family-oriented community of Irvine," said 
John Sharpe, corporate executive chef of Santa Ana-based West Coast Restaurant 
Ventures, which owns Zuni and several of Southern California's other 
better-known upscale restaurants, including Bistro 201 in Irvine, Diva in Costa 
Mesa and Topaz Cafe in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm and West Coast Restaurant Ventures parted company last year after 
disagreeing on the future direction of the chain's restaurants, most of which 
Wilhelm played a key role in opening. Last year, Wilhelm signed on as a 
consultant with Taco Bell in Irvine, which wants to expand its presence in the 
casual dining niche. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuni, which is in the Crossroads shopping center in Irvine along with Target 
and Mervyn's department stores, "is a good concept," Sharpe said. "It's just in 
the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant industry analysts said that West Coast Restaurant Ventures' 
decision to close Zuni is in keeping with the growing trend toward family-style 
dining at restaurants that are perceived as offering better value.  
</P>
<P>
 "As we gradually come out of the recession, consumers who are tired of being 
locked in their homes are coming out, but they want values and more 
entertaining dining," said Janet Lowder, a restaurant industry analyst in 
Rancho Palos Verdes.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles restaurateur Wolfgang Puck took aim at value-conscious diners last 
fall when he opened a 150-seat restaurant at South Coast Plaza that features 
lower-cost entrees than his signature restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to see a grapefruit vinaigrette anymore," Sharpe said. 
"They want food that's readily recognizable." 
</P>
<P>
 "When David (Wilhelm) was still with West Coast, we had an upscale image of 
the (customer) in the $1,000 suit," he said. "But times have changed, and 
that's definitely not the image that we're trying to present with Saddlerock 
Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast Restaurant Ventures, best known for one-of-a-kind restaurants, 
hopes to open as many as 10 Saddlerock Ranch restaurants by 1997, Sharpe said. 
The second location, in Ventura County, is scheduled to open by early next 
year.

INSURANCE DISPUTE PUTTING PRESSURE ON PATIENTS; HEALTH: TEXAS FIRM NEEDS THEIR 
HELP COLLECTING $5 MILLION OWED TO GARDEN GROVE CLINIC GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Texas company is threatening to hold an estimated 18,000 Orange County 
residents hostage in a battle with a Garden Grove medical clinic group over 
records it needs to collect $5 million in insurance bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Secured Asset Management Corp., purchased the bills last year 
from the clinics' bankrupt former owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics had advertised that they would accept whatever patients' insurers 
would pay and would not bill individuals for the insurance deductibles or 
co-payments -- effectively discounting their bills so patients would have no 
out-of-pocket expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics, which operated as Lehman Medical Group and then Harvard Family 
Medical, went bankrupt last year and Secured Asset Management, a Dallas 
company, bought uncollected medical bills -- called accounts receivable -- from 
the bankruptcy estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Secured has written to 2,000 former clinic patients asking that they 
authorize the clinics' new owner to release their medical records to Secured so 
it can provide their insurance companies with the medical data they demand to 
validate the clinics' bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to do so will leave us with no alternative but to hold you totally 
responsible," the letters state. The letters, sent by a collection agency on 
behalf of Secured Asset Management, ask the patients to comply within 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The four clinics now are owned by a physician group and operate as Your Family 
Medical Group. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Christopher Mallick, Secured Asset Management's president, said Wednesday 
that despite its tone, the aim of the letter was not to intimidate the patients 
but to appeal for their help in obtaining the documents from Your Family 
Medical Group. He said the company had agreed to provide access to the medical 
records when Secured purchased the bills but has since refused to forward any 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Olsen, the clinic group's administrator, declined to comment except to 
say that the company would have no problem releasing the documents to patients 
at their request. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Lehman/Harvard patient, Gordon Tornberg of Garden Grove, is concerned 
that if he authorizes Your Family Medical Group to release his records, he or 
his insurance company might be forced to pay for services that were 
fraudulently billed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Dr. Kent Walter Lehman, founder of the clinics, chose not to contest 
charges of insurance fraud filed against him by the state medical board. He 
gave up his medical license and the clinics were acquired by Harvard Family 
Medical, which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallick says that the patients are not his target. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer to bill the insurance companies and collect a fair profit down the 
road. . . . I don't care to chase patients for bills they don't believe they 
owe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that if other efforts fail, he may try to collect 
from patients who did not have written agreements waiving their financial 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that Secured Asset will attempt to collect co-payments from 
patients who are insured by Medicare or HMOs, which require patients to make 
co-payments.

 To Commute or Not Commute? Rudy Svrcek , vice president of sales and marketing 
at the Irvine Co., thinks he has an answer to that question. Svrcek said 
bargain-priced new homes in a faraway commuter community may actually cost more 
than a comparable home closer to work.A recent "Homebuyer Comparison Summary" 
conducted by the Irvine Co., which sells homes located close to work centers, 
said that a new home costing $200,000 in a community close to the owner's work 
might actually be cheaper in the long run than a new $165,000 home in a 
commuter community of more than 50 miles away round trip. The monthly payment 
after taxes and commute costs on the nearby house would be $1,377.26 and a 
commuting home would be $1,399.25, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're saving just a little, but you avoid a long commute, which is a very 
valuable thing and lets you spend more time with your family," Svrcek said.

 State Housing Grants: Gayle Wilson, wife of Gov. Pete Wilson, trekked to 
Rancho Santa Margarita on Monday and offered $5.6 million in state grants to 
California communities that prove they can streamline construction regulations 
by waiving building fees and speeding up the construction permit process. 
</P>
<P>
 Unveiled last year, the state program, called BEGIN -- for Building Equity and 
Growth in Neighborhoods -- has given 12 California communities $4.7 million in 
special housing grants.The money will be used to assist first-time, low-income 
buyers with up to $20,000 in down payments.  
</P>
<P>
 Though none of the cities that have received grants are in Orange County, 
Wilson came here to announce the additional funding. Awards will be made in 
September. The state Department of Housing and Community Development sponsors 
the program.

MTI TECHNOLOGY STOCK SKIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MTI Technology Corp. learned Wednesday just how rough Wall Street can be. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which went public in April, announced that its revenue for its 
fiscal first quarter will be 10% to 15% below analysts' projections.Then it 
watched its stock plummet almost 39% to close at $4 a share, down $2.50 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The maker of high-performance computer storage devises attributed the 
lower-than-expected revenue to increased competition from Digital Equipment 
Corp. MTI said it will release results for the quarter -- which ended July 2 -- 
by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In its initial public stock offering, 15-year-old MTI raised more than $30 
million for itself and $15.3 million for several key investors. For its fiscal 
year ended April 2, the company earned $2.9 million on revenue of $123.5 
million.

 Community Psychiatric Centers: The Laguna Hills psychiatric and long-term 
critical care services company reported a profit of $2.4 million, or 6 cents a 
share, for its latest quarter. That was down 31% from earnings of $3.5 million, 
or 8 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.The company attributed 
the earnings decline to increased start-up costs incurred by its Transitional 
Hospitals Corp. subsidiary, which now operates 12 long-term critical care 
facilities, compared to three facilities a year ago. Revenue for the company's 
second quarter, which ended May 31, rose 26% to $108.4 million from $85.8 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of its fiscal year, the company recorded a profit of $3 
million, or 7 cents a share. That contrasted with a loss of $34.4 million, or 
80 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier, which includes a 
restructuring charge of almost $55 million. Six-month revenue was up 18% to 
$201.3 million from $170.8 million.

 DVI Inc.: The company said Wednesday that it has sold $75.7 million worth of 
securities backed by loans and leases that it had made on sophisticated medical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, which netted the company $75.6 million, marked the first 
public offering from the company of its equipment financing receivables. 
Irvine-based DVI previously sold three pools of loans and leases privately. 
</P>
<P>
 All but $3 million worth of the securities offered received top ratings -- AAA 
-- from the major rating agencies, Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Duff & 
Phelps. The remaining amount was rated BBB, which is still considered an 
investment-grade security. 
</P>
<P>
 DVI will use the proceeds to issue more loans on such medical equipment as 
magnetic resonance imaging machines.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ABBEY HEALTHCARE CHALLENGES SUIT ALLEGING WRONGFUL 
TERMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Challenging a wrongful termination lawsuit brought by its former president, 
Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. said Wednesday it has filed several counterclaims 
against Victor Chaltiel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa-based provider of home health-care services said it is seeking 
"substantial monetary relief" for certain representations Chaltiel allegedly 
made before he joined Abbey late last year. Chaltiel became Abbey's president 
and chief executive officer after Abbey bought Total Pharmaceuticals, where 
Chaltiel had been president and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Abbey said Chaltiel had resigned. Chaltiel sued Abbey shortly 
afterward for more than $6 million for allegedly using "heavy-handed, bad-faith 
tactics" to eliminate Chaltiel's employment contract. The case is now pending 
before the American Arbitration Assn. in Los Angeles.

SWEAT & SIMPLE; PEOPLE ARE WORKING OUT IN WHATEVER THEY SEE FIT: THEY'RE 
PUMPING UP IN RELAXED STYLES AND BASIC COLORS. AND ONLY MUSCLES GET SHOWN OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1980s, a fashion show mentality muscled its way onto the fitness scene. 
Gyms were filled with men and women who looked like they spent as much time on 
their wardrobes as they did lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they were just going to sweat, exercise buffs made sure they had on 
the latest fitness togs with splashy prints and electric colors. Everything 
they wore matched, from their headbands to their socks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a sobering recession, then a President who jogs around in T-shirts 
and shorts that look left over from his days at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 Now people pump iron in relaxed workout clothes that don't look quite so 
put-together. 
</P>
<P>
 They've gone back to the basics. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, navy and sweat-shirt gray have replaced loud colors. Simple shorts, 
tank tops and T-shirts, worn in loose layers, make up the low-key fitness look 
of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, no one's going to the gym looking like a slob. Fitness-minded 
people still like to show off their bodies, but they're doing so in quieter 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You still get people who want to be decked out, but over the last year people 
are more relaxed," says Jamey Bender, manager of the boutique at the Sports 
Club/Irvine. "It's not quite so much of a fashion show." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sports Club, members no longer parade around in outfits that show off 
every tendon. Things are much looser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the grunge look," Bender says. "We're seeing lots of sweat shirts 
wrapped around waists and over-size tanks thrown over leotards. Everything's 
real comfortable. It's not so structured." 
</P>
<P>
 The look starts with the basics, such as the women's collection of bike 
shorts, tank-style and V-neck leotards and bra tops by City Lights at the 
Sports Club. The pieces come in a subtle floral print or muted solids, 
including black, gray, cream, dark blueberry and sea-foam green (about $20 to 
$28). 
</P>
<P>
 The grunge influence is seen in leotards by Mossimo that have the look of 
plaid flannel but are made of Supplex, a breathable, color-fast fabric similar 
to Lycra and cotton ($47), at the Sports Club. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also nothing fancy about the men's simple cotton tank tops ($15) and 
nylon shorts ($18 to $26) in traditional shades of black, gray, blue and white. 
The only prints for guys are the dark tropical and floral patterns seen on 
volley shorts ($35), also at the Sports Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh hues and wild prints have all but vanished from the floor of Body Issue, 
an aerobic/fitness apparel store in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Florals are out," says Cassie Piasecki, owner of Body Issue. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite choice of many of her customers is a simple camisole leotard in 
neutrals such as white, cream, beige and black ($33). The influence of Donna 
Karan's pared-down style is everywhere. Dance France's mock turtleneck leotard 
($36) in black accentuates the shoulders much like a similar Karan gown worn by 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The leotards are plain, but for interest designers have added fun back 
treatments like crisscross straps and keyhole cutouts as well as halter and 
mock turtle silhouettes. Maxi Modo designed one leotard with a crisscross back 
resembling the stripes on the British flag ($41), available in navy or red. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitness fanatics want to look as if they just threw on an old tank top and 
shorts instead of carefully coordinating an outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder that a hot item for men is a faded pigment-dyed tank top that 
looks like it's been worn over and over, says Cammie Doder, merchandising and 
marketing director of Club Sportswear in Irvine that manufactures men's 
sportswear and active wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (faded tanks) give the effect of making the guys look like they work out 
all the time," Doder says. 
</P>
<P>
 The tanks come in red, blue, green, black and yellow. Club Sportswear is 
carried at Nordstrom, Bullock's, Beach Access in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, 
the Balboa Beach Co. on Balboa Island and Chick's Sporting Goods in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Classic elastic waist shorts in such solid colors as black, navy, red and teal 
are also strong, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men and women like to wear their baggy shorts over tight-fitting and 
longer-legged support shorts. Champion's Power Liners in black, white and gray 
($23 at Sports Club/Irvine) have become a staple for guys, Bender says. So are 
Calvin Klein's athletic shorts for both men and women (about $20). 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago you wouldn't let your underwear show," Bender says. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the layered look, women are letting the straps of their sports bras 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 By Kimberly introduced a line of sports bras that feature pretty lace and 
floral print straps as well as flattering underwire support ($30 to $35), at 
Sports Club/Irvine). 
</P>
<P>
 "Most sport bras are plain and unattractive. Women really like to have nice 
bras, even when they're working out," says designer Kimberly Mattson. "I wanted 
to design something that doesn't flatten you the way most sports bras do." 
</P>
<P>
 The line is also carried at Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and the Broadway. Mattson 
will introduce a complete body-wear line in September, with leotards and tops 
that also give women a lift.

WITH THEIR BEST FEET FORWARD; THEY ARE 3 SHOEMAKERS INTERESTED IN MAKING A 
BETTER SHOE -- AND PASSIONATE ABOUT BUILDING A BETTER WORLD; PAUL FIREMAN, 
REEBOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their common professional calling consists of cushioning the human foot's 
contact with the ground. They are cobblers, shoe magnates who might well be 
content to lace up their hefty profits and let others fret about mankind's 
moral bunions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Fireman, Bruce Katz and Sheri Poe are three shoemakers with soul. 
Beyond their chosen line of endeavor they share little but the geography of New 
England. Yet in each of these footwear manufacturers, entrepreneurial acumen 
has fueled an equal appetite for social activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Their causes are varied. Fireman, chief executive officer of Reebok 
International Ltd., has taken on human rights as his personal and corporate 
mission. Katz, co-founder of Rockport Shoes, sold out of the shoe biz and used 
the money to leap into the arena of community change via on-line communication. 
Poe, founder of Ryka Inc., is a rape survivor and has dedicated herself to the 
goal of ending violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman -- only partially in jest -- offered regional similarities as a 
possible explanation for their high level of social consciousness. "Maybe it's 
something in the water," he said. "And if it is, we should spread it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are these shoemakers' stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a dozen or so years ago, Paul Fireman is entirely comfortable admitting, 
he wouldn't have recognized social responsibility if it had come calling at his 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never heard of it," said the 50-year-old Fireman, who was raised in a 
family of shoe manufacturers in the gritty hamlet of Brockton, Mass. "I didn't 
even know the words." 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman, who today continues to fight a middle-aged bulge despite a serious 
golf habit and frequent trips to the company gym, knew only that "I wanted to 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Reebok, after all, was going gangbusters; Fireman had acquired an 
athletic shoe business just when health-obsessed Americans began insisting on 
entire wardrobes of high-priced, sport-specific footwear. In 1981, Reebok 
recorded $1.5 million in sales. Five years later, the figure had grown to $916 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Fireman, meteoric profits were not inconsistent with an altruistic 
company spirit. "From Day One," he said, "I didn't want this to look like, 
taste like or smell like an American corporation of the '50s, '60s or '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a onetime shoe salesman, not some senescent social protester. Even so, 
"I had grown to hate the mainstream world, with all the compromises you had to 
make just to show up at the front door. I thought Reebok should operate 
slightly differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Well aware of the boss's philosophy, Reebok's ad agency approached Fireman in 
1986 with a proposal to sponsor an international rock music tour for Amnesty 
International. "It seemed like a good idea," Fireman decided, even if $10 
million was a lot of money for a few concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did Fireman realize when he agreed to sponsor Amnesty's Human Rights 
Now World Concert Tour -- featuring such celebrities as Bruce Springsteen, 
Peter Gabriel and Sting -- that a funny thing would happen on the way to the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got bit by the bug," Fireman said in a 1992 speech at the Columbia 
University Business School. "Amnesty opened our eyes, and we became passionate 
about human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling was not initially mutual from the human rights community. "They 
were skeptical to the extreme," Fireman said. "They kept us in abeyance" -- a 
polite understatement, Fireman conceded. "We were suits. They held in disdain 
the business community as a whole. In their minds, we were businessmen who did 
all the wrong things." 
</P>
<P>
 Better, Fireman was gently informed, to stick to the traditional "side-door" 
route of quietly pouring money into existing foundations. No thanks, Fireman 
said. In 1988, he initiated the annual Reebok Human Rights Awards, offering 
no-strings-attached grants of $25,000 to people 30 or younger who were making 
"significant contributions to the cause of human rights -- often against great 
odds." The Rev. Carl Washington of Los Angeles was a 1993 winner, recognized 
for his leadership in curbing violence after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman -- often with one of his Human Rights Award board members, former 
President Jimmy Carter, by his side -- was more than just the guy who handed 
out the checks. He was also the CEO who made sure that human rights production 
standards were in place at 40 Reebok-affiliated facilities around the world, 
and who made sure that "business decisions were made inclusive of human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly traded Reebok's profits were flat in 1993, and some hard-eyed 
corporate analysts and executives wondered about this father of three -- 
married to the same wife since forever -- who didn't look a bit like Ben or 
Jerry yet still preached a do-gooder doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it good business?" Fireman asked. "I don't know if it sells any more 
shoes, but I don't think that's our intention." Fireman is entirely aware that 
he might just as well have opted for a more benign cause than the social ills 
of East Timor, Kurdistan, Mozambique and even these United States. But he is 
adamant that "we didn't do this to become powerful. We did it to do some good. 
We did it to change the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, he said, "It feels better. What the heck?"

POETRY IN MOTION: PAPER SHIFTS COVERAGE TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN M.H. BRAITMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines. -- Thomas 
Babington Macaulay 
</P>
<P>
 Following old Macaulay's dictum, today's poetry is either in steep decline as 
we boldly move onto the superhighway of One Wired World or poetry is fine and 
it's society that has sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, there is a publication dedicated to tuning in the universe of 
poetry as it rises -- or falls -- against the larger canvas of the modern 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 20 years, the nonprofit monthly newspaper Poetry Flash has 
reported on trends and offered a forum for poets, a constituency bitterly 
fragmented by style, philosophy or simply loudness. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Poetry Flash -- a.k.a. the Flash -- has included rock 'n' roll poets 
along with professors and scholars. It has even included poets who have never 
set pen to paper, raucous poets of the microphone whose main intention might be 
to rile an audience or draw a sympathetic tear for a miserable life. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after years of focusing on Northern California from its home base in the 
Bay Area, the Flash is grappling with the Goliath that is Los Angeles. The 
paper has begun the prodigious task of including L.A.'s wild poetry scene in 
its regular coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Editor and Publisher Joyce Jenkins is uniquely suited to navigating the shouts 
and whispers of modern poetry. A poet herself, Jenkins strongly believes in the 
power of poetry to literally change the world. Or, at least, to change people 
who can change the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetry and literature . . . carry messages about our culture that we need to 
hear," she says from her small office in an industrial area of Berkeley. 
"Besides my own poetry, my life has been to try and help different kinds of 
poets talk to each other, to know other kinds of poetry exist, so we don't keep 
reinventing the aesthetic wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude has not gone unnoticed. The acknowledgment of her role reached a 
peak during May's meeting of the American Booksellers Assn. in Los Angeles. 
Jenkins was awarded the Before Columbus Foundation's American Book Award for 
Editor/Publisher. Assembled in her honor were many of the poets Poetry Flash 
has helped over the years, including Ishmael Reed, David Meltzer, Wanda Coleman 
and Luis Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of what drives Jenkins is her passion to communicate each new development 
to poets everywhere. With the problems all poets have in being published and 
garnering even the most meager support, it's important to have a vehicle that 
can be trusted for news, information and constructive criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowledge leads to, if not respect, at least improvement of the situation for 
all of us," she says. 
</P>
<P>

 I died and went to Hell & it was nothing like L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Kowit 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1972 as a free one-sheet calendar of readings in San Francisco and 
Berkeley, Poetry Flash helped promote the burgeoning small-press scene. The 
'70s and '80s were heady days for writers as grants flowed to arts groups. It 
was (relatively) easy for anybody to get published. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by an editor to join the small staff in 1978, Jenkins brought along her 
poet's sensibility and experience as organizer of an international poetry 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming publisher in 1980, Jenkins has seen Poetry Flash grow to 32 
pages, and its role greatly expand. It now focuses on poetry events throughout 
California, Arizona and New Mexico, with a circulation topping 19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Its greatest challenge, though, is certainly the one Poetry Flash is tackling 
now: Reporting on the fragmented, decentralized Los Angeles poetry landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several months the Flash has increased its L.A. listings and 
news until nearly half its calendar is devoted to Southern California. Due to 
L.A.'s sprawling nature, however, there's often the feeling that the area is a 
black hole that swallows up any attempt to bring coherence. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. poet Carol Muske likens the poets here not to a community, but "to a 
collection of isolated beliefs, each belief vehement in its view of poetry." 
She admits that there isn't much discussion going on between these often 
feuding believers, who display animosity and suspicion about their own 
particular poetry turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Bloods and Crips," Muske says. "At least we don't have poetry 
drive-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry Flash, already distributing several thousand free copies to Los Angeles 
bookstores, coffeehouses and colleges, hopes to bring these factions together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poetry Flash may prove to be a sort of detente, a rapprochement, that may 
allow poets to talk with each other," Muske says. "At least they'll know what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 This is just the beginning for Poetry Flash in Los Angeles, however. The paper 
has quickly eclipsed the efforts of now-defunct Out Loud magazine, its 
predecessor in compiling local poetry events. 
</P>
<P>
 Poet Richard Beban, who hosts readings at Midnight Special bookstore in Santa 
Monica, was once associated with Out Loud. He predicts that Poetry Flash may 
succeed where local publications have failed "because it probably has fewer 
indigenous enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 In Beban's view, two things give the Flash the edge: attitude and editor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's serious about poetry, and poetry as literature, as something that is 
culturally alive." And Jenkins "treats poetry as news. She's like a real 
journalist. That's rare to find these days." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to announce its intentions, two of the three cover stories in the latest 
issue are about L.A. writers -- a review of Peter Levitt's "Bright Root, Dark 
Root" and an obituary of Charles Bukowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flash also is sponsoring a reading series at Arundel Books on Beverly 
Boulevard. Although there are numerous other reading series all over L.A., 
Jenkins says that "the wonderful thing about the Arundel Books series is that 
they're mixing mainstream poets with local poets and emerging poets, and 
they're putting them in a local bookstore where people can hear them, where 
people can get to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really admirable. And for L.A., that's new." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Listen, what are you reading this for?  
</P>
<P>
 Haven't you got bills to pay,  
</P>
<P>
 a movie you've been wanting to see,  
</P>
<P>
 a woman to love or a wife to ignore.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm here because it's raining,  
</P>
<P>
 and poets write poems when it rains --  
</P>
<P>
 -- Jack Grapes 
</P>
<P>
 The Flash has also covered the peculiarly Los Angeles phenomenon of "stand-up 
poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up readings tread the borderlines between theater, performance art, 
comedy and, of course, poetry. Jenkins calls it "a kind of direct, usually 
personal, experience-based, narrative, rock 'em, sock 'em, maverick kind of 
poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up poetry, however, is only the latest permutation of the spoken-word 
movement, an ongoing evolution of solo performers who may be poets -- like Anne 
Waldman and Jack Foley -- or storytellers -- like Spaulding Gray and Josh 
Kornbluth -- or actors -- like Anna Devere Smith and Charles Dean. Not 
surprisingly, modern spoken word took hold in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' New Alliance Records started out with punk but, when musicians 
such as Exene Cervenka and Henry Rollins returned to their first love of poetry 
and writing, the label became a major proponent of spoken word on record and 
CD. 
</P>
<P>
 New Alliance has achieved visibility with such writers as Wanda Coleman, Holly 
Prado, Pleasant Gehman and Steve Abee. Spoken-word impresario Harvey Kubernik, 
who produces the poetry recordings for New Alliance, has praise for Poetry 
Flash's efforts in Southern California, if simply because they're now paying 
attention to literary activity below what he calls the "Mason-Dixon Line." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you lived south of area code 408, you didn't even send them a press 
release," he says about Poetry Flash's Northern California orientation up until 
the past year. "But there have been some real steps taken, and I've seen the 
epicenter move down even to San Diego and Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Kubernik also sees the value in Poetry Flash's outreach to a younger 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the paper is reaching people who are having their first exposure to 
poetry -- 15-, 16-, 18-year-olds, kids in college -- and they're not recoiling 
from poetry!" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite years of neglect from Establishment funding sources, Poetry Flash has 
managed to survive on sporadic donations and a few loyal advertisers. Now, at 
last, Jenkins sees the public's interest in poetry hitting a new peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like the anti-literacy malaise of our country is coming from the 
top down," she says, "and the regenerative literary energy that may save us is 
coming from the bottom up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately this energy has been stimulated -- literally -- by the "java house" 
explosion. As the rage for coffee cafes continues, an almost bohemian literary 
affectation flourishes in its wake. For every long-established reading series 
at a cafe or bookstore, there are dozens of new places for poets to read, and 
most are coffee galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 All these new venues have flooded Poetry Flash's calendar and pumped up the 
need for more coverage. Fortunately, the paper has just received a $15,000 
grant from the Lannan Foundation to help distribution and promotion efforts in 
Los Angeles. And, for the first time, Poetry Flash has received funding from 
the National Endowment for the Arts, which will help stabilize its finances as 
it expands. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins' earnest, total devotion comes across as genuine, even inspirational. 
In accepting the award from the Before Columbus Foundation, she eloquently 
spoke of Poetry Flash's ultimate goal: 
</P>
<P>
 "To heal -- and to meet the needs of poets and writers, cultivating a climate 
that allows for and encourages the transformative power of art, of the word, of 
poetry."

WITH THEIR BEST FEET FORWARD; THEY ARE 3 SHOEMAKERS INTERESTED IN MAKING A 
BETTER SHOE -- AND PASSIONATE ABOUT BUILDING A BETTER WORLD; SHERI POE, RYKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their common professional calling consists of cushioning the human foot's 
contact with the ground. They are cobblers, shoe magnates who might well be 
content to lace up their hefty profits and let others fret about mankind's 
moral bunions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Fireman, Bruce Katz and Sheri Poe are three shoemakers with soul. 
Beyond their chosen line of endeavor they share little but the geography of New 
England. Yet in each of these footwear manufacturers, entrepreneurial acumen 
has fueled an equal appetite for social activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Their causes are varied. Fireman, chief executive officer of Reebok 
International Ltd., has taken on human rights as his personal and corporate 
mission. Katz, co-founder of Rockport Shoes, sold out of the shoe biz and used 
the money to leap into the arena of community change via on-line communication. 
Poe, founder of Ryka Inc., is a rape survivor and has dedicated herself to the 
goal of ending violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireman -- only partially in jest -- offered regional similarities as a 
possible explanation for their high level of social consciousness. "Maybe it's 
something in the water," he said. "And if it is, we should spread it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are these shoemakers' stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the death of Nicole Brown Simpson, Sheri Poe was galled that even 
for a moment, Simpson's abuse by her husband might have been seen as a private 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the crux," Poe said, fuming behind a desk in Norwood, Mass., that is 
adorned with equal numbers of family pictures and athletic shoes. "Society has 
bought into this ridiculous idea that domestic abuse is a private issue. And 
it's not. It's a public concern." 
</P>
<P>
 You'll pardon Poe if, looking disarmingly slender for a woman who gave birth 
to her fourth child five months ago, she leaps onto her soapbox from time to 
time. As the CEO of Ryka Inc., which Poe describes as "the only athletic shoe 
company exclusively devoted to the women's market," she has been known to 
remind unsuspecting rival executives, mostly male, that this country boasts 
about three times as many animal shelters as women's shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 She spews out facts and figures confidently -- and accurately: Every 15 
seconds in this country, a woman is beaten; domestic violence is the leading 
cause of injury to women between 15 and 44, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 She comes by her knowledge and passion honestly -- if also unfortunately. 
Hitchhiking to work 22 years ago, a naive 19-year-old freshman at Southern 
Illinois University, Poe was raped at gunpoint. She tried to press charges but 
was made to think that it was her fault because she had been hitchhiking. 
Besides, she said, her attacker had friends in the police department. There was 
no chance, they told her, of a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe "coped" with her shame and anger by becoming bulimic. She said exercise 
finally helped her regain her self-esteem. Plagued by an aching back and 
perpetually sore knees, Poe blamed the shoes she wore during a decade or more 
of heavy-impact aerobic exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 If the right product didn't exist, Poe reasoned, she would just have to invent 
it -- and in 1987 she and her first husband, a marketing executive, started 
Ryka, named for her then-mother-in-law. A female investment banker, who 
conveniently happened to also be an exercise fanatic, raised money through 
public stock offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, the Ryka pitch was unusual -- because to Poe, tending to 
"total well-being" for women meant accompanying each pair of shoes with an 800 
telephone number offering 24-hour support and information for female victims of 
violence. She also urges retailers to pass out safety booklets published by her 
Ryka ROSE (for Regain One's Self-Esteem) Foundation, which funds treatment, 
education and prevention programs to help end violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 When Poe's marriage broke up, she kept the company -- as well as the ROSE 
Foundation, to which she has pledged 7% of her annual pretax profits. To date, 
Ryka's shaky performance has meant that the promise has not put huge dents in 
Poe's pockets. Since going public in 1988, Ryka has yet to record a full year 
of profitability. But Poe, a former "pink bag lady" for Mary Kay cosmetics, 
calls herself a "gut-sense entrepreneur" who projects brighter days for her 
company as well as her foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, critics accuse Poe of talking a good game when it comes to crimes 
against women. Some have sniped that Poe has stooped to the cellar of "cause 
marketing," turning into a professional rape victim who exploits her own 
experience in hopes of bigger sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah," she scoffed. "I've heard that, and I say, obviously you've 
never been close to anyone who is a survivor. Because if you think it's a 
picnic to discuss this, you're wrong. I'd have to be a real masochist to relive 
that kind of pain, just to benefit this company." 
</P>
<P>
 Poe met her second husband, a biochemist who is the father of her two youngest 
children, while scuba diving. With so many kids, her home exudes a kind of 
pleasant chaos, she said. Often she welcomes the escape to the relative 
tranquillity of an office, where most of her employees are female, and where 
many come to work attired in workout clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said she will not give up the cause she has pegged as her own. "I have a 
commitment to bring forward the issue of violence against women, and I'm going 
to do that till the day I die."  
</P>
<P>
 She smiled, perhaps ruefully. "Which is good, because it's probably going to 
take that long."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The vividly colored sketches posted in Nasrin Ansari's studio belie her words: 
"I'm not an artist," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this studio, near the Lido Marina Village in Newport Beach, attention 
goes not to the generic figures, but to the elaborately detailed outfits in 
which they are clothed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tear sheets from fashion magazines hang on wires she's stretched along a 
marked-up wall. The markings were placed to look like an abstract clothing 
pattern, complete with notation and dart lines. A drafting table serves as her 
work station; nearby a cabinet on wheels stores her pens, ink bottles and other 
art tools. 
</P>
<P>
 On shelves in the minimalist foyer sit bolts of fabrics: beaded laces, silk 
brocades and crinkled crepes. Beyond the narrow area is an open-air patio where 
Ansari meets with her clients and, to the right, a workroom filled with 
seamstress tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari, 42, says her dedication to fashion is more as an art form than just 
making clothes. Even when she talks about her favorite designer, Valentino, she 
refers to his art. "Few designers now value their work, the quality. Not even 
the house of Chanel is concerned with the art of fashion anymore," she laments. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari's talent is revealed in what cannot be seen. Darts on a lace bodice are 
snipped and hand-sewn for a seamless effect. A blouse is lined in such a way 
that the rough edges are out of sight; it can almost be worn inside out. Beaded 
details and buttonholes are usually hand-stitched. A sleeve can take three days 
to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couture demands exacting stitches. I'm trying to give people quality," says 
Ansari, her accent laced with traces of Farsi, Turkish and French, all of which 
she speaks fluently, in addition to English.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can make much more money by rushing, but for me quality is everything. I'd 
rather lose an order and the money, than sacrifice the quality of other 
orders," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 To Ansari, quality control means spending as much time with her clients as 
necessary. First appointments are spent finding out exactly what they want; at 
the next meeting Ansari offers up anywhere from 10 to 20 sketches for an 
outfit, along with fabric suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabric, more than design, can make or break the overall effect, she says. 
"When I feel fabric," says Ansari, "I can tell if (an outfit is) going to come 
out perfectly. I think good work has to go with good fabric." 
</P>
<P>
 She says almost two decades spent working in Paris allowed her to build 
relationships with the same fabric manufacturers that supply signature 
materials for Versace, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy and Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty fabrics can cost as much as $200 to $500 per yard; the lining alone 
can cost $35 per yard. A beaded fastener can cost $65. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari's signature special-order pieces can run anywhere from $300 to $1,800, 
depending on the fabric and details. An evening gown can cost $1,600 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients have brought back bolts from their travels to Paris or Milan. Or they 
have gone with Ansari to her sources to shop for the right yardage. She 
welcomes any involvement that makes her clients more comfortable with their 
orders -- even if it takes three hours for a fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more important for me to be the favorite (designer) in their closet," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari attributes her appreciation for the finer aspects of fashion to the 
years she spent living in Paris. Her parents, impressed by her talent, moved 
the family from Iran to France when she was 14 and immediately enrolled her in 
design school. Three years later, she entered the Jeoffrin Byrs International 
Fashion School, where she studied for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French are not obsessed with designer labels. Quality is more important 
to them than the name," says Ansari. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon graduation from Byrs, she went to work as a pattern maker for Cote 
D'Azur, a women's day-wear label based in Southern France. Then in 1982 she and 
her children immigrated to California and she was hired to start a women's wear 
division for Dansha, a menswear label in Los Angeles. When the company moved to 
Taiwan three years later, she turned to free-lance work, designing fabric 
prints and ready-to-wear collections for St. Tropez in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Business is very (good), so why not start doing this for myself.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 She moved the family to Laguna Niguel in 1989 and cultivated a clientele from 
her in-house studio -- which included the living room frequently doubling as a 
showroom. She also began contributing fashion articles to a county-based 
Iranian language newspaper, Payam-e Ashena. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, Ansari learned about the county's concept of fashion and 
haute couture. She found society mavens craving clothes that were as well made 
as their price tag implied.  
</P>
<P>
 Says Ansari: "Everyone complains about what's out there: the fit, the quality, 
the conformity. They don't want to all look the same. If you're spending 
$10,000 on a dress, you want to look unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari opened her Newport Beach studio in June, 1993, and hired two 
assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes that by fall, 1995, she will have transformed the foyer into a 
mini-boutique filled with her first ready-to-wear collection. Eventually she 
wants to open a string of signature boutiques, but says she will not get into 
mass production. "I prefer to test my designs personally to maintain the 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers often ask why she doesn't leave Orange County for New York. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the weather and her teen-age children. But Ansari also believes she 
can make a name from California. "Richard Tyler did it" in Los Angeles, she 
says. "New York doesn't need one more designer. People need me here."

 More than 30 million Americans will punch the clock from home at least once 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 That number has been growing 7% a year for the last three years, but only 
recently have companies delivered pieces that satisfy the discriminating 
home-office worker. The huge furniture makers say the special needs of these 
employees have made it a difficult birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Herman Miller for the Home opened a retail store on Beverly 
Boulevard in Los Angeles. The company, known for its sleek Eames and Noguchi 
furniture lines, is now carrying the new TD collection of home-office pieces 
that includes tables, desks, L-shaped returns, bookcases and storage units. 
</P>
<P>
 Steelcase, a powerhouse in the wholesale office furniture business, recently 
introduced a home-office line called Turnstone. And several smaller companies 
are turning their attention from the offices of the boardroom to the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, home-office workers had to make do with metal filing cabinets 
and stacks of bright plastic bins stacked on the kitchen table. And those who 
tried to make modular pod furnishings fit in with their French Provincial motif 
had a nightmare in their living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people tried to take a desk from work and fit it in their homes and it 
stuck out like a sore thumb," says Ken Tameling, spokesman for the Turnstone 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale was wrong, the finishes too industrial, the storage space 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home-office furniture has to be smaller and lighter, and it has to blend in," 
Tameling says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because few people have an extra room they can transform into an office, the 
furniture makers had to come up with designs that do double duty, going from 
nose-to-the-grindstone workstation to decorative showpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Frezza, an Italian manufacturer with a slick line of home-office furnishings 
called Cassamania, offers odd-shaped tables that cluster into a large dining 
table by night and break apart into three desks by day -- for less than $500. 
The company's all-purpose shelf system might hold the computer as well as the 
family library and collectibles. A single wall unit is less than $500; a 
double, less than $750. Cassamania is available through Menzie International in 
L.A.'s Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Storage Systems does a like-minded bookcase/wall unit that has 
either a flip-down desktop (about $2,499) or a fold-down conference-size table 
(about $3,499). The murphy bed-like desks are made to order and come in a 
variety of finishes. The units are custom-made by California Closet Co., which 
has five area locations. 
</P>
<P>
 For those with more traditional taste, Kimball Furniture has created a line 
called Harmony Woods that includes wall units equipped to house computer 
monitors, printers, file drawers and keyboards. A double-pedestal desk with 
eight drawers -- in cherry ($2,500) or oak ($2,375) -- also has a pull-out 
shelf for a keyboard; both styles can be ordered from Eddie Gold Furniture in 
Los Angeles or Frank's Furniture in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the home-office worker wants a compact, inconspicuous workstation, 
furniture designers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disguising the home-office environment is as much of a consideration as the 
design of the product itself," says Ray Kennedy of Herman Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who leave their workplace desks looking like a landfill, for 
example, tend to keep things neater at home. "They want papers off their work 
tops so they can close up shop. This demands different kinds of storage," 
Tameling says. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides offering compact storage systems, the new lines pay more attention to 
wire management (an industry term for containing the mess of 
computer/telephone/printer/fax cables that hang like errant pasta behind 
desks). Now, these tangles can be channeled into orderly, invisible submission. 
</P>
<P>
 As the selection of home-office furnishings has broadened, so has the price 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubbermaid, the maker of snap-top leftover containers, has developed through 
its MicroComputer Accessories subsidiary a home-office desk of blow-molded 
plastic priced at $229. The SnapEase computer desk comes unassembled but, says 
a company representative, "It's easier to put together than most toys." It can 
be paired with hutch, $89.95, and printer cart, $59.95. All three are available 
at Dozar Office Furnishings in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turnstone line includes a $99 open storage cabinet and a $259 
contemporary-style, computer-friendly desk in mahogany or cherry finish. 
Steelcase outlets and some Office Depot stores carry Turnstone, or items can be 
ordered via catalogue, (800) 887-6786. On the high end, the Herman Miller 
designs top out at $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-priced piece of home-office equipment is the ergonomically 
correct, posture-perfect, sit-up-straight, use-the-armrests and 
don't-let-your-wrists-slouch-when-you-type chair. They have yet to be 
domesticated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheila Weiss, manager of Dozar Office Furnishings, says some local 
companies are working on home versions. "Chairplace is making ergonomic chairs 
with upholstered backs instead of the plastic shell backs. And some other 
companies are trying wood caps on the base so you don't see the gray or black 
plastic pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
 The price of an ergonomically correct chair can be quite an eye-opener. "A 
decent chair will cost $150. A really good executive style is priced closer to 
$400," Weiss says.

 The slogan on Skyler Thomas' chest says it all: "I Can't Even Think Straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Since early 1990, when he conceived a line of T-shirts with such in-your-face 
commentary as "Nobody Knows I'm Gay," "What a Difference a Gay Makes" and 
"Closets Are for Clothes," the 30-year-old humorist has been out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
 In four years, the Culver City company he calls Don't Panic has evolved into a 
thriving $2.5-million business that includes a wholesale operation, a 
mail-order catalogue ((800) 45-PANIC) and five retail (West Hollywood, New 
York, Miami Beach, San Francisco and Provincetown, Pa.) stores, not including 
one that opened last month in the Soho district of London. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many gay men and lesbians quickly embraced Thomas' ideology and began 
wearing his Ts as a symbol of unity and pride, others -- straight and gay -- 
balked at the blatant messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are certainly on the borderline of being obnoxious," Thomas concedes. 
"Even some gay people aren't sure if they like them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those critics argue that advertising one's sexual orientation in a 
world riddled with gay bashing is dangerous. Thomas agrees that "people have to 
be wise about what they wear and where they wear it," but he also believes his 
clothing can help defuse gay stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a certain number of people out there who are just homophobic by 
default," he says. "They've never had to decide how to deal with homosexuals 
because they haven't had anybody who was outwardly gay in their life. When 
those people see someone wearing one of my shirts, a lot of them just laugh (at 
the messages) and see that the person wearing it is not necessarily a freak. 
And in that moment the barriers are dissipated." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Thomas says it was never his intention to become a voice in the gay 
rights movement. More entrepreneur than activist, he hit upon the idea of doing 
T-shirts purely as a money-making scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up with some gay themes because the L.A. Gay Pride Festival was coming 
up, and I thought I might get a booth," he recalls. After persuading a friend 
to loan him $6,000 for equipment, which he installed in the spare bedroom of 
his West Hollywood apartment, Thomas went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I printed up 75 T-shirts, thinking that was either going to be too many or 
not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He was back at his used printing press the same morning. "When I got home, I 
went through my closet and printed everything that was clean," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
 By weekend's end, he had sold 500 shirts and had recouped most of his 
investment. "It was really wild. People were going into stores asking if they 
had the 'Nobody Knows I'm Gay' shirts, and by the end of the festival the whole 
country knew about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Liza Minnelli was an early fan. Working on a difficult show in New York, the 
frazzled entertainer asked Thomas to print her a T-shirt that read "Don't 
Panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas ultimately took those words as his company name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of the gay pride festivities, stores with large gay followings 
began phoning in their orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skyler revolutionized the whole T-shirt thing," says Dennis Dashing, a buyer 
for Drake's on Melrose Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. "He put comedy behind 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas also managed to get some of his unisex shirts into such chain stores as 
Merry-Go-Round and Macy's Herald Square in New York. In fact, those and other 
similar stores account for 40% of the company's retail orders. 
</P>
<P>
 As the business has grown, so has its product mix. A glass Christmas tree 
ornament with an AIDS awareness ribbon dangling inside is a bestseller; a 
portion of the proceeds from its sales (nearly $200,000 to date) goes to 
Americans for AIDS Research (AmFAR). Other Don't Panic items include everything 
from OUTch! watches and "Bad Hair Day" baseball caps to coffee mugs, key 
chains, wallets, tote bags, beach towels, jewelry, temporary tattoos and metal 
AIDS awareness ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 But 80% of the sales still come from Ts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a generation of gay people who grew up with no outlets and no one to talk 
to about their gayness, the shirts have become a kind of identity thing," says 
Thomas, who has moved out of his apartment and into a rental house in West 
Hollywood. "They're a symbol of being part of something bigger than ourselves. 
They tell us it's OK to be gay. And that feels good." Skyler Thomas, a Man With 
a Message 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of slogans from Skyler's message-bearing T's.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN KIDNAPING OF LOCAL REALTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man suspected of kidnaping and sexually assaulting a Val Verde real estate 
agent was arrested early Wednesday morning at a topless-dancing club in Ogden, 
Utah, when he allegedly displayed a handgun to one of the dancers, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, is accused of abducting Paula Harrington, 26, at 
gunpoint on June 29 by posing as a prospective home buyer. Harrington was found 
three days later tied to a bed in a motel in Gila Bend, Ariz., a small town 68 
miles southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials believe Shue raped and robbed several other women at 
gunpoint across the United States, with the most recent incident occurring June 
23 in Medford, Ore., according to an affidavit by FBI Special Agent William 
Ayers. In each incident, the victim's credit and automatic teller cards were 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden police officers arrested Shue at about 2 a.m. Wednesday at the Ladies of 
Lace club, said Jack Callahan, a spokesman for the FBI's Phoenix office. Shue 
did not resist. 
</P>
<P>
 He "was displaying a pistol to one of the dancers, who reported it to her 
manager, who in turn called the police," Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue did not point the small-caliber handgun at the dancer, said Capt. Marlin 
Ball of the Ogden Police Department. "It was more or less, 'Look what I've 
got,' " Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe with her husband, Chris, said she 
was relieved when police officials called her husband Wednesday to report the 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue "knew where I lived and he knew where I worked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, who has used numerous aliases since becoming a fugitive, was arrested 
under a false name, Ball added. Ogden police found identification with his true 
name while booking him into custody. A computer check revealed federal warrants 
for fraud and unlawful flight in a Wyoming, Mich., case in which he is 
suspected in the abduction of a woman and unauthorized use of her credit card 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue appeared in federal court in Salt Lake City Wednesday afternoon on the 
Michigan charges, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul Warner. Shue will likely be 
formally charged with the Harrington kidnaping Thursday when a warrant arrives 
from the FBI in Los Angeles, and will be arraigned Friday, Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was held in Salt Lake County Jail without bail while federal officials 
determine what other criminal charges may be sought against him, Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue came to the real estate office where Harrington and other employees were 
working at about 2 p.m. last Wednesday and asked to look at homes in Val Verde, 
a community several miles northwest of Santa Clarita. Harrington said she felt 
no fear as she accompanied Shue in his Jeep to five homes in the area. She was 
tied up at gunpoint at the last house. 
</P>
<P>
 A co-worker became suspicious about 2 1/2 hours later when Harrington did not 
return, drove to the area and found a Jeep similar to Shue's outside the house 
where Harrington was apparently kidnaped. The co-worker noted the license 
number and went to a neighbor's house to call police, but the Jeep was gone 
when she returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, family and friends conducted a massive search of the area the next 
morning for Harrington, but the search was called off when investigators 
discovered she had made a $300 withdrawal from an automatic teller machine in 
Hacienda Heights several hours after she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness told officials he saw a man take a woman resembling Harrington from 
the back seat of a Jeep Cherokee and force her to walk to the ATM. Another 
attempt to withdraw money using Harrington's credit card was made last Thursday 
at an ATM in El Centro, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found at about 10:30 a.m. Friday at the El Coronado motel in 
Gila Bend when her cries for help were heard by a maid. At about the same time, 
a man called Harrington's office and told a co-worker where she could be 
located. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington identified Shue as her kidnaper Saturday through mug shots shown to 
her by police officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said she and her husband had put off having children so they could 
focus on their careers, but the kidnaping has persuaded them to start a family 
and spend less time at work. 
</P>
<P>
 She admits rebuilding her life won't be easy -- thoughts about her ordeal 
haunt her -- but said she will seek therapy and do whatever else it takes to 
persevere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to let him destroy my life," she said. "I have a lot to live 
for. God gave me a second chance."

COLORADO BLAZE TRAPS, KILLS 13 FIREFIGHTERS; INFERNO: THREE FEDERAL 'SMOKE 
JUMPERS' REMAIN MISSING; THREE OTHERS ARE INJURED NEAR GLENWOOD SPRINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 Trapped by a surging wall of flames, 13 federal firefighters were killed and 
three others were missing late Wednesday while battling a swift-moving forest 
fire near Glenwood Springs, about 180 miles west of here, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze also injured three firefighters among the team of 50 "smoke 
jumpers," a crew of specially trained U.S. Bureau of Land Management 
firefighters who were airlifted to the fire lines on Storm King Mountain 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Wednesday night, more than 60 homes had been evacuated as the fire 
spread eastward, engulfing more than 2,000 acres and threatening the town of 
6,000 people, Garfield County officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, sparked by lightning on July 3 in a grove of trees, burned slowly 
until it was fanned by hot, dry winds gusting to more than 30 m.p.h. Wednesday 
afternoon. What had been a relatively small blaze, fought only by hand crews, 
suddenly turned on the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield County Undersheriff Levy Burris said the firefighters were killed 
when flames crested a steep ridge and "just exploded over their positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Burris said the firefighters who died were all killed at an elevation of about 
7,000 feet. He said the terrain left them with no place to run to escape the 
fire. Kathy Voth, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Land Management said the 
smoke jumpers -- all of them specially trained to parachute into a hot fire 
area and clear brush with shovels and chain saws -- had been given fireproof 
blankets to shield them in the event of a flare-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This situation is extremely hard on everybody," Burris said, adding that this 
was the worst fire in terms of fatalities in recent memory in the Western Slope 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got mental health and counseling services available," he said. "A lot 
of the guys here knew these crews -- they've worked different fires together." 
</P>
<P>
 The injured firefighters were taken to Valley View Hospital in Glenwood 
Springs, where one man remain in guarded condition with second-degree burns on 
his back, arms and hands. Another firefighter in her 20s was admitted for 
treatment of smoke inhalation. The third firefighter was released after 
treatment for minor burns on his back, a hospital nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A special BLM emergency recovery team was airlifted into the mountainous 
burned region late Wednesday to search for the missing, Burris said. Meanwhile, 
more than 100 firefighters from agencies throughout the Western Slope region 
battled the wind-whipped flames, which had swept through a six-mile canyon area 
just north of Interstate 70 at an estimated 100 feet per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the evacuees, an emergency shelter was opened at the Glenwood 
Springs Middle School, but most people were choosing instead to stay with 
relatives or at local hotels and motels that had opened their doors to those 
forced out of their homes by the flames, said Greg Allen, who works for the 
Aspen Skiing Co. and volunteered to run the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Johnson, a retired forester, stood in the driveway of his home and 
watched the flames on the ridge less than half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff is dynamite with all that dry resin in it," he said of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners used garden hoses and shovels to keep back the fire as crews 
hosed down trees and ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said smoke was so heavy from the blaze that it could be seen 40 miles to 
the south in Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tragic situation," Allen said. "Everyone is kind of numb. We 
can't believe this has happened. We've had so many fires in the area that all 
the fighters were working them and there was no manpower left for this one." 
</P>
<P>
 County sheriff's officials said they had been unable to commandeer aircraft to 
drop chemical retardant or water on the blaze until Wednesday because of the 
much larger fires that were raging throughout Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the terrain devastated in the Glenwood Springs fire is inaccessible by 
land, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once control was established over forest fires in neighboring Paonia, about 30 
miles west of Aspen, additional fire crews, slurry bombers, helicopters and 
other aircraft were sent to the Glenwood area, sheriff's communications 
supervisor Joanne Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt canceled a trip to Idaho and planned to go to 
Glenwood Springs today, said Jennifer Jones, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of 
Land Management at the agency's headquarters in Boise, Ida.

ARAFAT, RABIN VOW TO EXPAND PLO AUTONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, pleased with progress in 
establishing Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip, agreed Wednesday to 
expand the autonomy, step by step, throughout the West Bank and end the Israeli 
occupation there. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat decided in 
talks here to transfer responsibility for a range of government services, 
including education, health and welfare, to the new Palestinian Authority. But 
they acknowledged that difficult issues will have to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fresh impulse was given to peace by Israelis and Palestinians," Arafat told 
reporters after the two leaders met for the first time since May. "The meeting 
was positive, fruitful. . . . We agreed on some major issues, and some other 
issues will require more discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 The issues include some of the most difficult the two sides will face in 
reaching a full Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement: their borders; the 
long-term presence of Israeli forces and settlements on the West Bank; and the 
future of Jerusalem, claimed by both as their capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin urged commitment and caution. "We are entering one of the more decisive 
stages on the way to reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians," he 
said. "This is the stage where we end our dreaming. The time has come now to 
roll up our sleeves." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who heads the new Palestinian Authority, promised to hold "free, 
honest and democratic elections as quickly as possible" in expanding 
Palestinian self-government. But he did not confirm mid-October as the target 
date for the vote, which will be the Palestinians' first national election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's discussions between Israeli and Palestinian officials were 
described by both as broad and strategic, an effort to set the agenda for the 
next phase in the peace effort and to fix a timetable for the new measures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two sides also dealt with very specific, very sensitive issues, 
including: the release, requested by Arafat, of the imprisoned leader of the 
militant Islamic group Hamas; freedom for more than 5,000 other Palestinian 
prisoners still held by Israel; and enlargement of the Jericho district in the 
West Bank as part of the autonomous area. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Rabin, speaking separately after an initial two hours of talks, 
said they had created three committees to discuss unresolved issues on autonomy 
for Gaza and Jericho, the transfer of civilian administration to the 
Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank, and convening a conference with 
Egypt and Jordan on Palestinian refugees from the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said that even expansion of the 
Palestinian Authority's powers was complicated because it raised the question 
of who would enforce its decisions in areas still under Israeli military 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both sides appeared encouraged by the successful transfer of the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho district to the Palestinians and Arafat's establishment 
this week of the first Palestinian government. 
</P>
<P>
 "A creative spirit has nourished and inspired this process, and it has led to 
opening the door of genuine peace to one of the most complex conflicts of this 
century," Arafat said, speaking at a U.N. ceremony honoring him, Rabin and 
Peres with the UNESCO peace prize for their breakthrough agreement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry A. Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state and head of the UNESCO 
prize jury, handed out awards worth almost $50,000 for each winner. Kissinger, 
who avoided talks with Arafat during his Middle East diplomacy in the 1970s, 
shook the PLO leader's hands as the crowd cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat again appealed for economic assistance to the new Palestinian 
Authority. Wealthy nations should "assume their moral, political and material 
responsibilities," or "the peace process, however noble and important it may 
be, will be liable to collapse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 French President Francois Mitterrand, who met with Arafat and Rabin, said 
later that it would be tragic if financial problems thwart the peace process. 
He said he would press, at this weekend's summit of leaders of the seven 
leading industrialized nations, for the release of more of the $2.4 billion 
that has been promised for Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, speaking in Hebrew with Israelis as his primary audience, recounted the 
deaths of three of four sons of a prominent Israeli family, followed by their 
parents' deaths. Replying to right-wing critics at home, he addressed the 
surviving son -- and through him all families who have suffered through the 
long Arab-Israeli conflict -- declaring: "For you, for our children and their 
children, we are moving toward peace. . . . That is our vow to you."

MAN HELD IN SLAYINGS OF WIFE, MOTHER-IN-LAW; VIOLENCE: NEIGHBOR ATTEMPTING 
RESCUE IN BURNING ANAHEIM HOME SAYS HE SAW BODIES, SUSPECT WASHING KNIFE.

 Octavio Garcia said he heard the shouting three doors away Wednesday morning, 
then the smoke alarm and a woman's screams for help. When he plunged into his 
neighbor's smoking house, he said, he stumbled onto a horrifying scene -- two 
women apparently dead of stab wounds, a flaming lawn mower in the living room 
and a man calmly washing his hands and a knife at the kitchen sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't say nothing to me," said Garcia, who told the same version of 
events to authorities. "I kept asking him: 'What did you do? What did you do?"' 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities later arrested 32-year-old Tuan Ngoc Le on suspicion of stabbing 
to death his estranged wife and his mother-in-law following an argument that 
neighbors said was the latest in a family that feuded noisily but otherwise 
remained apart from those sharing Hearth Lane, a cozy cul-de-sac in an 
unincorporated section of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Le lived in Santa Ana, but neighbors said he regularly visited the 
single-story home occupied by his wife, their three children and members of her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's sister-in-law was hospitalized after suffering smoke inhalation 
and burns on her feet, apparently from one of the fires encountered by Garcia 
and firefighters, who arrived minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Le turned himself over to deputies shortly after Garcia arrived and was being 
questioned Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He was being held on suspicion of killing both women. Investigators were also 
exploring whether Le set the fires and said arson charges might be added later. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain women were identified as Loi Thanh Phan , 30, Le's wife, and Sao Thi 
Nguyen, 69, his mother-in-law. The injured sister-in-law, identified as 
46-year-old Lien Thi Phan, was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department said the dead women had 
suffered numerous stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive for the attack was still unclear, although neighbors said they had 
heard loud arguments from the house before. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always heard arguments, but you never expected anything like this," said 
22-year-old Eli Figueroa, who lived four doors away. "They had arguments. 
That's it, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they heard arguing from the home shortly after 9 a.m., then saw 
children and Lien Thi Phan run from the house as smoke began seeping from its 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little kids came out. They were crying. They were crying real bad," 
Garcia said. When he ran inside, Garcia said, he found a body on the living 
room floor and the lawn mower burning a few feet away. He said he saw Le 
washing what appeared to be a steak knife in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said that Garcia recounted the same 
version of events to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he pulled the woman's bloodied body out and went back inside, to 
discover the badly stabbed body of Loi Thanh Phan, partially clothed in a rear 
bedroom. He said he also pulled her body to the front of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters also described finding food burning on the stove and patches of 
flaming carpet inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident shook up a normally placid enclave where neighbors watch after 
one other's children and newcomers make the rounds to introduce themselves. 
Even the street's name -- Hearth Lane -- bespeaks its homey quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of place where you don't lock your doors and you trust your 
neighbors," said Kim Earles, who moved to the street a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Le and his family had remained virtual strangers to neighbors since moving 
in three to four years ago, residents said. Speaking Vietnamese on a street 
where most speak English and Spanish, the family kept to itself and made few 
connections with other residents there. 
</P>
<P>
 The children played with others on the street and an elderly relative was 
often seen riding his bicycle, but even the closest neighbors never learned the 
names of the family living in the well-tended home at the end of Hearth Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always seemed happy. They always seemed happy when they were outside 
washing the car or watering" the yard, said Georgann Bryden, who lives two 
doors away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the neighbors also recalled disputes that echoed into the street, though 
they could not understand the words spoken. Garcia said that on Wednesday 
morning, he heard the crash of objects during an argument, followed by the 
smoke alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters, called originally to respond to a blaze, were warned en route 
that the situation might be something worse, said Daniel W. Shell, a 
firefighter with the Orange County Fire Department. Deputies had guns drawn 
when the first firefighters showed up, reporting two victims dead and a third 
needing care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very chaotic," said Shell, who was in the first crew to arrive. "One 
minute we're setting up to fight a fire and the next we're bringing out victims 
of a heinous crime."

HIROHITO'S BROTHER ASSAILED JAPAN'S WW II 'AGGRESSION'; ASIA: LATE EMPEROR'S 
SIBLING CONFIRMS A BOLD 1944 SPEECH TO TROOPS CONDEMNING MILITARY POLICY, 
ATROCITIES IN CHINA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a 1944 speech in Nanking, China, Prince Mikasa -- the late Emperor 
Hirohito's youngest brother -- condemned the Japanese military's "policy of 
aggression" toward the Chinese and cruelties such as using prisoners for 
bayonet practice, a Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun, the prince, now 78, 
detailed the extent of military atrocities against the Chinese and confirmed 
that he had condemned the aggression in a speech delivered to some Japanese 
soldiers in China during World War II. Copies of his statements were later 
quashed and destroyed by military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A single remaining copy was recently discovered in the library of Parliament 
by a Kobe University professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince told the Yomiuri that he wrote and delivered his speech "out of a 
desperate desire to bring the war to a close" after a one-year assignment as 
staff officer with Japanese expeditionary forces in the eastern Chinese city of 
Nanking (now known as Nanjing). 
</P>
<P>
 In an assignment that shocked and revolted him, he said he discovered that 
military officers used Chinese prisoners of war for bayonet practice to instill 
"guts" in Japanese soldiers; they gassed and shot them en masse after tying 
them to posts. "It was truly a horrible scene that can only be termed a 
massacre," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also disclosed in his newspaper interview that military officials tried to 
poison members of the League of Nations' Lytton Commission, assigned to 
investigate Japan's seizure of Manchuria in 1931, by lacing fruit with cholera 
germs; the investigators did not develop the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince, then 27 years old, said he denounced the military near the end of 
the war for acting against what he believed was the emperor's strong desire for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But military authorities regarded his remarks as "dangerous" and destroyed 
copies. Since criticism of the military then was regarded as treason, such 
outspoken denunciations would have been impossible for anyone but a member of 
the imperial family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mikasa speech is the first open criticism of the military by an imperial 
family member and "is of tremendous historical significance as evidence of the 
imperial family's basic opposition to the military even in the midst of war," 
Yomiuri reported. The military has long sought to legitimize its wartime 
behavior as done in the name of the emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks are certain to trigger controversy in a nation that remains 
divided on the nature of its war deeds and responsibility almost half a century 
after its defeat in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 During their recent travels across the United States, Emperor Akihito and his 
wife sought to sidestep the issue; the current emperor has expressed "deep 
sorrow" for the "severe suffering" that the Japanese inflicted upon the Chinese 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two months ago, new Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano told a national 
newspaper that the "Rape of Nanking," in which the Japanese military raped, 
robbed and murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese in 1937, was "a 
fabrication." Then-Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who emphasized that his 
government was continuing its predecessor's view about Japan's wartime 
wrongdoing, reprimanded and dismissed Nagano for his remarks, which he 
retracted. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Education Ministry officials have long ordered textbook 
publishers to whitewash such controversial incidents as Japan's germ warfare 
experiments in Manchuria and the "Rape of Nanking." 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, those who challenge the right-wing version of history are often 
threatened or harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 After Morihiro Hosokawa denounced the war as a "mistaken war . . . a war of 
aggression" while prime minister of the newly formed coalition government last 
year, a rightist tried to assassinate him in May. And when the mayor of 
Nagasaki suggested after Emperor Hirohito's death in 1989 that the late emperor 
bore some guilt for World War II, a right-wing fanatic shot and nearly killed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as right-wing scholars and sympathizers continue trying to justify 
Japan's wartime acts as attempts to escape Western colonization and unite Asia 
in economic prosperity, the prince sharply attacked that assertion in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Japan's 1940 creation of a puppet government in Nanking, the 
former Chinese capital, the prince wrote: "It cannot be said that Japan created 
that government out of a true wish to benefit China or to help the Chinese 
people form a unified state. Instead, it should be viewed as a kind of 
makeshift trick prompted by a desire to cover up Japan's policy of aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the debate over the Nanking massacre missed the point by focusing 
on the number of victims (the Chinese say that about 300,000 people were 
killed; Japanese scholars who acknowledge the massacre occurred say the number 
of victims was far smaller). 
</P>
<P>
 "If you kill prisoners in an atrocious manner, that is a massacre," he said, 
adding that there was no doubt Japanese soldiers committed such barbarous acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince, however, said he never specifically told his brother, Hirohito, 
about his report. Instead, he shared his China experience with him in "bits and 
pieces."

COLUMN ONE; NAPLES PUTS ON ITS BEST FACE; ALTHOUGH THE ITALIAN PORT WALLOWS IN 
CORRUPTION, CRIME AND DECAY, CLINTON AND OTHER G-7 LEADERS WILL BE OFFERED A 
SANITIZED VIEW OF A CITY THAT IS TRYING TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT.

<P>
 The question being tested here under the volcano is whether, beginning with 
one world-important and summer-scorched weekend in July, it is possible to hew 
order from the chaos called Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 Will President Clinton, who arrives Friday, find a historic and beautiful city 
that is belatedly recovering its health and pride? Or will he and leaders from 
the six other richest nations see hastily applied makeup caking an urban corpse 
as the setting for their Group of Seven meeting this weekend? 
</P>
<P>
 Reform Naples! O sole mio. What a giggle. Easier to stay the tide. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't laugh too hard. Overdue change is afoot in Italy's messiest 
metropolis. Reforms are being launched, and some serious people are taking them 
seriously: "I have begun to stop for red lights," said Tullio Pironti, the 
city's last remaining book publisher. "I used to feel stupid if I stopped, 
because nobody else did." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this sudden modernization will outlast a limelit international 
gathering is the real question. Though the Italian government, the Secret 
Service and Neapolitans themselves will make sure Clinton sees no trace of it, 
there is an everlasting seamy side of Naples: When I exclaimed at a 
white-bearded body in blue jeans lying in the gutter, my cab driver scarcely 
braked, explaining, "No, he's not dead, that's Alfonso, who's quite comfortable 
there. He's a habitue. Alfonso drinks and drinks. I think he drinks to forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Oblivion and disorder, thy name is Napoli. 
</P>
<P>
 Little moves under the broiling sun except hands jammed on horns. Motorbikes 
weave on sidewalks around pedestrians, pickpockets, con men, preteen apprentice 
hoods called scugnizzi . Vendors hawk African gewgaws, Miami Dolphin hats, 
smuggled cigarettes and pirated copies of X-rated movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Naples' throbbing streets are home to a nasty branch of organized crime called 
the Camorra, and support some of Europe's highest official unemployment and 
worst civic services. Naples is a noisy, noxious, insufferable and dangerous 
city that often seems more of the Third World than the First. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Neapolitans agree that their city is ungovernable and unlivable, but 78% tell 
pollsters they'd never leave. Naples is a madhouse in which nothing ever works; 
a stress-and- Angst factory in which suicide is almost unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a slums 'n' squalor, palaces 'n' princes southern port, with world-class 
architecture and museums. That kid on the corner may steal your watch while 
your park bench neighbor is reading Pliny the Elder in Latin. And how can 
anybody stay angry at a city in which one sips cappuccino while watching clouds 
play atop the Vesuvius volcano on the far side of a fairy-tale bay? 
</P>
<P>
 Naples may even seem quite magical from Bill Clinton's sanitized view of it in 
the (Enrico) Caruso Suite of the Hotel Vesuvio at the heart of a newly coiffed 
city core, where the G-7 participants will live and meet for three days 
beginning Friday. Christened the "red zone" and closed to traffic, it will 
perhaps be the most protected place on Earth until Sunday night. Even residents 
on foot need a special pass to get into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The security and the fresh paint are symptomatic: What a difference a year can 
make! Last summer, Naples touched bottom, befouled and overwhelmed by 
corruption and decay. Uncollected garbage festered, few traffic lights worked, 
potholes swallowed roads, the water was brown, the city government wasn't 
paying its bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis marked the local climax of a national scandal in which political 
parties, organized crime and big business were belatedly caught conspiring to 
get rich at public expense. Lire flowed into Naples by the billions: Special 
funds for a 1974 cholera epidemic, a 1980 earthquake and the 1990 World Cup 
came in a torrent. Many repairs and projects were started: a sports palace, 
schools, a new Justice Ministry building. Hardly anything was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the pyramids. The question was not when a project would be 
finished but how long it could be kept alive to eat money," newspaperman Vito 
Faenza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Change began Aug. 6, when Prefect Umberto Improta, the Italian government's 
senior representative in Naples, dissolved the feuding, corrupt and inept city 
government to remedy what he deemed a lack of public order. 
</P>
<P>
 Improta, formerly police chief in Milan and Rome, does not take kindly to 
civic malfeasance. Over the past two years, he has dissolved 16 local 
governments in the region around Naples for having links to the Camorra and 40 
others for administrative paralysis. In Naples, Improta named administrators to 
run the bankrupt city until elections could be held in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, though, then-Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, himself an 
interim technocrat, amazingly asked Improta if Naples could possibly host the 
annual meeting of the world's seven largest economic powers plus their newfound 
Russian ally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said yes, if certain things were done first," Improta, 61, said in an 
interview. The central and regional governments dutifully anted up about $35 
million for infrastructure preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 When the mayoral elections came, Naples, like most other large Italian cities, 
turned to the left in protest against corrupt Establishment parties. Antonio 
Bassolino, 47, a longtime apparatchik of the former Italian Communist Party who 
now leads its social democratic successor, defeated right-winger Alessandra 
Mussolini, granddaughter of the former dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 Naples' new mayor cut his political teeth on fierce partisan politics. But 
Bassolino has proved an unabashed Naples booster, reaching across party lines 
in search of renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been critical of him, but as mayor, Bassolino has certainly overcome his 
combative past. He has appointed a good team of people, and he understands that 
restoration cannot be done by government alone," said Cesare De Seta, a 
Neapolitan author and history of architecture professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Improta, the crusty ex-cop turned administrator, and Bassolino, the 
rookie reformer-mayor, are proving an effective odd couple. 
</P>
<P>
 They have begun stitching the southern metropolis of 1.2 million people back 
together: Public works contracts are now let on a fixed-price basis in a blind 
draw of competing companies -- a revolution in the Italian context. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work is being finished in record time and at great savings -- 55% to 60% 
cheaper than in the past," Bassolino said in an interview. "Everybody is 
interested in making the city look good. For G-7, Naples wants to prove itself 
to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Repaving of the main bay-side road, a civic priority for decades, is finished. 
The Piazza del Plebiscito and the Via San Carlo have been redone and antiqued 
to restore them to the way they looked in the early 19th Century, when Naples, 
home of a ruling Spanish king, stood with Paris and London in the front rank of 
European capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17th-Century Royal Palace, where the G-7 leaders will meet in the 
tapestry-draped Hercules room, has had its face lifted along with a number of 
major thoroughfares and buildings including City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is recovering. There's a new spirit of collaboration. We must show 
that the government keeps its promises. To combat decay, antipathy and 
indifference is the best way to fight crime," Improta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cops are giving traffic tickets; trucks are towing illegally parked cars. 
Bassolino has reopened half a dozen parks. Improta has overseen the 
refurbishing of 280 schools. This month, Naples Police Chief Ciro Lomastro 
astonished and outraged 160 phantom city workers who collect pay for jobs they 
never go to -- a hallowed Naples scam. He had them arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Naples patriot Jean Noel Schifano, director of the French Institute that 
teaches French language and culture, sees marked improvement in the life of a 
city he loves and has written about extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 There is poverty aplenty, but some appearances are misleading: Swiss patients 
come for eye operations at one Naples clinic, Schifano says. Tens of thousands 
of nominally unemployed, in fact work hard in businesses and industries that do 
not officially exist -- and therefore pay no taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are getting better. You can take a Sunday morning walk by the sea and 
smell the sea. Ten years ago, people were afraid to go out at night. Now there 
is night life again. We are going in the right direction. This is how Naples 
used to be," Schifano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong, says 78-year-old philosopher and social commentator Luigi Campagnone, a 
lifelong Naples resident: "I never go out anymore because I cannot bear to see 
Naples. It's unlivable. 
</P>
<P>
 "People go into raptures about the music, sky, sun, sea, sand. Lies, all lies. 
I define Naples as a collective infection. Two weeks after G-7 it will be 
exactly the same mess as before," said Campagnone over coffee at his home 
recently. "I was here during the Naples uprising in the war, when kids leaped 
bravely on German tanks and some got killed. Three days later, the Americans 
came, and these same kids were selling their sisters and mothers to new 
soldiers. It's a stupid, diabolical city." 
</P>
<P>
 In context, says Neapolitan sociologist Domenico De Masi, Naples is no 
stranger to big international gatherings -- or the fact that little lasting 
good usually survives them. The Roman emperor Tiberius held ancient-world 
versions of G-7s on the island of Capri off the Naples coast, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greeks, Romans, Renaissance princes, 16th- and 17th-Century kings have always 
met here -- it's an excuse for a party," De Masi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are less skeptical. Surveying clean streets blessedly free of cars one 
morning this week, Fulvio Milone, a longtime newspaper correspondent based in 
Naples, says nobody expects the G-7 overhaul to be the opening salvo in a 
social revolution. "Rather," he said, "it could be a trampoline toward 
renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassolino and Improta recognize that they are sailing against the wind of both 
history and expectation, but they are not discouraged. "We will change the 
cultural and civic image of the city," Bassolino promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Improta, whose security forces have been nearly doubled to about 11,000 for 
G-7, says crime rates have fallen dramatically in the past two years, 50% in 
some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 One works project that is finished is the big, new Secondigliano prison in the 
northern reaches of the city. Its denizens include not only former political 
grandees snared by corruption investigations, but also Camorra bosses corralled 
by better police work and more vigorous judicial prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go, but I think we have turned the corner," said 
Improta. 
</P>
<P>
 From their different perspectives, Bassolino and Improta both point to what 
appears to be a changing perception about the role of government in Naples: 
Some grudging respect appears to be growing among a people who have 
historically mocked and undermined authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Bassolino is trying to say that Neapolitans have their dignity and 
can take on formal commitments," sociologist De Masi said. "There are those 
magic moments in which a group of people becomes open to change. . . . 
Bassolino seems to offer some hope -- a little brake in a fatal descent." 
</P>
<P>
 Neapolitan jewels long obscured by urban blight are beginning to reassert 
themselves. On Sunday now, cars are banned on some seaside roads, and 
Neapolitans gather along them to promenade. A private volunteer group arranged 
to open about 200 often-closed churches, museums, monuments and archeological 
sites one weekend this spring. They drew nearly 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, inspecting the city's often-shut archeological museum -- one of the 
world's best -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi noted that he himself 
had never been there before. 
</P>
<P>
 Naples will never be Florence. But it will always be Naples, a vibrant and 
gritty port whose people long ago learned that survival, tolerance and 
hospitality are three of life's great virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingers crossed, the reforming mayor of a reawakening city quietly tells 
visitors that, in recent months, Italian and foreign tourists have begun to 
return to Naples for the first time in many years.

 Management at Kiyoshi Iida's workplace has urged workers to make the most of 
the office's new computer network, including using their personal computers to 
communicate with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few problems, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boss has been saying that, with the introduction of a local area network 
in the office, we should all use the system," Iida said. "But I tried to send a 
message to him through the electronic mail, and I found out he was not 
connected."

 Iida's experience is significant because of who he is: director of the 
Technology Development Division of Japan's Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications (MPT). This puts him at the very heart of a Japanese effort 
to catch up with the United States in building and using an advanced 
telecommunications infrastructure. Yet Iida is surrounded by evidence of 
Japan's lagging position in such key areas as computer networking and cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, MPT officials have publicly acknowledged that Japan has 
fallen far behind the United States in areas of information technology destined 
to be of vital economic importance in the 21st Century. Prodded into action 
partly by enthusiastic U.S. talk of building an "information superhighway," the 
ministry has begun pushing a plan to build an advanced new telecommunications 
network that would be capable of virtually unlimited transmissions of video, 
audio and text throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many details of the MPT proposal remain to be worked out. But the goal is 
clear: to leapfrog past the United States, in effect building a full-fledged 
information superhighway -- not just a narrow access ramp -- right up to the 
door of every home and office in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The past half-century proves that Japan can play catch-up very well. Time 
after time, government and industry have, acting in concert, performed 
brilliantly in carrying out a strategy to dominate certain industrial sectors. 
For example, Japan came from behind to overtake the United States in color 
televisions, automobiles and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 Success in this case, however, will not be easy. Huge costs are one factor. 
Regulatory and cultural obstacles are others. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also has become entangled in tough trade negotiations between Japan 
and the United States. U.S. officials say they are determined that American 
companies will have fair opportunities to bid for contracts. But Tokyo has not 
yet given the guarantees that Washington is seeking. The sums of money at stake 
are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the MPT-backed plan, the Japanese government would provide interest-free 
loans to help finance construction, by 2010, of a nationwide telecommunications 
network that would use highly sophisticated optical fibers not only for the 
main trunk lines, but also to provide the final connections to users. It is 
this use of optical fibers for direct links to individual homes that would make 
the completed system the most advanced in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The preoccupation with fiber in the home is to make sure the whole country is 
pulling together," explained G. Russell Pipe, an American telecommunications 
specialist with Virginia-based TDRS Inc., who was recently in Tokyo for a 
Japan-U.S. information infrastructure symposium. "The Japanese are kind of 
perfectionist. They want a common base. They want to be ahead, as a country. . 
. . If Japan could get its whole act together, they would be ahead of everybody 
else. That's seemingly what they're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Optical fiber cables are in many ways an ideal technology for 
telecommunications. A single strand of optical fiber, thinner than a human 
hair, can carry as much information as 16,000 copper wires. The main drawback 
is the expense of manufacture and installation. 
</P>
<P>
 MPT estimates the cost of the 15-year construction project at $320 billion to 
$515 billion, depending on the network's level of sophistication, with an 
additional $408 billion required if the cable is to be laid underground rather 
than strung from poles. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiber optics plan was officially recommended in late May by the 
Telecommunications Council, an influential advisory board reporting to the 
ministry. Under the proposal, which has the active support of MPT officials, 
much of the cost would be covered by interest-free government loans, but 
private companies would also invest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of private firms and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), 
the primarily government-owned company that currently provides many core 
telecommunications services, would handle the construction. NTT is already 
using its own funds to expand its optical-fiber trunk lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains uncertain, however, whether the powerful bureaucrats at the 
Ministry of Finance will support such massive government expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 If the money is made available, Japan's top-down approach to creating a new 
telecommunications infrastructure could offer some important advantages over 
the United States' patchwork approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The American vision is less costly, at least in the short run. Americans 
foresee a system of high-capacity trunk connections with such means as 
optical-fiber cable as the "superhighway." Less expensive technology, such as 
existing telephone and cable television lines, would provide "on-ramp" access 
for homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 While America's effort to encourage competition among cable and phone 
companies will spur innovation, it will also lead to a plethora of incompatible 
systems that must later be knit together at substantial cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on open competition among a variety of providers should help hold 
down charges to consumers, but it also means America could end up with two 
high-capacity broad-band wires to some homes and none to others, widening the 
gap between haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality could also vary from region to region as it does today with cable. 
There will be a tendency to save money in some areas by making do with 
low-capacity copper wires that are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Japan's system will be designed with a single standard to work 
together as well in video as it does today for telephone service. As a 
government-backed project, the system will reach every corner of the country, 
providing a basic utility much like electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Since high-capacity fiber would go right up to each home, all regular network 
television programs could be offered over the system, freeing up broadcast 
bands for other uses. By linking every home in the country with high-capacity 
lines, this kind of network could also provide an almost ideal environment for 
the growth of multimedia services, in which data, video and audio materials can 
be provided to users on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 This is important to international trade, in part because unless Japanese 
electronics and computer firms can engage in domestic multimedia business at 
the technological cutting edge, they are likely always to be a step or two 
behind international competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is currently considered far ahead of Japan in its 
information infrastructure because Americans enjoy much greater access to cable 
television, wider use of personal computers and much more linkage of personal 
computers in networks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, 52% of personal computers are connected to local 
networks such as office E-mail systems and databases, while the comparable 
figure in Japan is only 8.6%, Iida said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported last year that only 
270 computer databases existed in Japan, compared with 6,300 in the United 
States. The Japanese had 28,000 passwords, a rough measure of the total number 
of database users, compared to 2.3 million passwords in use by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese citizens are far behind Americans in obtaining access to the 
Internet, the world's most important computer network, which links smaller 
networks to provide tremendous access to databases and E-mail service. 
</P>
<P>
 Language is a significant barrier because use of the Internet requires 
advanced knowledge of English. The typical Japanese college graduate has 
studied English for 10 years but hasn't really mastered it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet simply poses too great a challenge for most Japanese, said Yoshio 
Utsumi, director general of MPT's international affairs department. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go through the manual very carefully," he said. "If you push one 
wrong key, you're not connected. Then when you reach the Internet, the first 
word you see is 'Log in' in English." 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to find access to Internet databases, he added, many Japanese are 
figuratively "blinded" by English instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are serious language-related problems even when Japanese is used 
for computer-network communications within Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The language uses thousands of ideographic characters adopted from Chinese 
that simply cannot be typed on a keyboard as easily as Roman letters. Software 
has been developed to make this process easier, but mastering this skill is 
still far more of a challenge than learning to type English. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result, typing is still seen here as a clerical task, rather than 
an essential skill for all managers. In most Japanese offices, it is only the 
less powerful people who might have computers or word processors on their 
desks. 
</P>
<P>
 Handwritten memos continue to play a much greater role in Japanese business 
than they do in the United States. With facsimile machines now ubiquitous, many 
Japanese managers see little incentive for use of computer messages. Sending a 
handwritten fax seems much quicker and easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's rigid workplace social hierarchy is another factor inhibiting use of 
computer networks for in-company communication. A boss might feel socially 
comfortable sending computer messages to subordinates, Utsumi said, but there 
would be much greater hesitation by a subordinate about sending ideas or 
requests to a boss by computer. In Japanese society, such matters call for a 
face-to-face conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 The layout of crowded Japanese offices also facilitates direct contact. Most 
employees work in large rooms, with dozens, or even hundreds of desks squeezed 
into all available space. Middle-level managers usually work elbow to elbow 
with their subordinates, rather than in offices of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Left on its own, Japan would not necessarily develop sophisticated networks of 
computer communications, Utsumi said. But globalization of the world's economy 
is leaving it no choice. Japan must not only build a better network at home, 
but also make greater use of international networks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally tend to believe we should create our own Japanese system with 
the Japanese language," Utsumi explained. "But after all, Japanese is a 
minority language. English is spoken by a lot more people. So we have to use 
that system, however inefficient it might be. We are destined -- doomed -- to 
be part of that system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Telecommunications Council, in recommending massive investment in optical 
fiber, predicted that doing so would open the door to growth of a huge new 
sector of Japan's economy. Building the network would provide the environment 
for growth of a $1.2-trillion annual multimedia market and employment of 2.4 
million workers, it predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal may border on the grandiose, the time frame may prove overly 
ambitious and the obstacles are considerable. But Washington is treating 
Japan's optical-fiber network project as an extremely important business 
opportunity for U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're studying this plan in detail," a U.S. trade official said, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. "We would expect procurements under the plan that's 
been announced by MPT, a good size of those procurements, to be covered under 
the agreement that we're negotiating now."

CLINTON BACKS LATVIA ON EXIT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton pledged Wednesday to push Russia to remove the last of its 
troops from the Baltics "in a deliberate and firm way," while also warning that 
the rights of the Russian minority in this region must be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening an eight-day European trip with the first visit of an American 
President to this portion of the former Soviet empire, Clinton met with the 
presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. He declared to a surging, 
flag-waving crowd gathered at the city's historic Freedom Monument that "the 
chain that binds our nations is unbreakable." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who is headed for a three-day summit of officials from the leading 
industrial nations in Naples, Italy, later went to Warsaw to meet with Polish 
President Lech Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
 In Warsaw, Clinton pledged to increase international help for Poland's poor 
and jobless. He found Walesa, who has been a sharp critic of American plans to 
delay Polish entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in a more 
conciliatory mood than he had been during Clinton's last European visit in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he talked of the American commitment to Baltic independence, Clinton 
also pointedly urged Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians to observe the rights 
of the Russian minority whose treatment remains the key sticking point in the 
Baltics' disentanglement from their former Russian masters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I appeal to you to summon what my nation's greatest healer, Abraham 
Lincoln, called the 'better angels of our nature' -- to never deny to others 
the justice and equality you fought so hard for and earned for yourselves," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 His Baltic stop represented an acknowledgment of the new political maturity 
and rising economic prospects of the three nations, which won their 
independence just three years ago. The trip also was designed to underscore the 
President's work to re-integrate post-Cold War Europe -- a project that has 
become one of his more praised initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton was compelled to carefully balance his praise for what the Baltic 
states have accomplished with his urging that they observe the rights of their 
large Russian minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has sought pledges of fair treatment for 
the Russian minority in return for final withdrawal of about 4,500 troops from 
Latvia and 2,500 from Estonia. The last troops in Latvia are scheduled to 
depart by Aug. 31. But negotiations continue on departure of Russian troops 
from Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The delicacy of the subject was apparent even from the crowd reaction to 
Clinton's speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Madly waving hundreds of tiny American and Latvian flags, the audience at 
Riga's Freedom Monument roared as Clinton pledged: "We will rejoice with you 
when the last of the foreign troops vanish from your homelands." But there was 
little reaction when Clinton went on to his accompanying point that "freedom 
without tolerance is freedom unfulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The President raised the issue of final troop withdrawal in a telephone call 
Tuesday to Yeltsin, and he pledged Wednesday that he would carry a message from 
Estonian President Lennart Meri to Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 But later Wednesday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who was traveling 
with Clinton, said that, while the parties were "quite close" in negotiations, 
"there are still significant gaps." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the visit, American officials announced they will put up $10 
million in next year's budget for Central European peacekeeping efforts, 
including the Baltic peacekeeping battalion, which is being assembled in the 
region. The United States has agreed to increase from $2 million to $4 million 
the amount it will spend to help dismantle a Soviet radar station in Latvia, 
which has been another obstacle to Riga's good relations with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltic residents, who have long sought American support, were clearly dazzled 
by Clinton's visit. On a stunning summer day, Latvians lined up along the 
motorcade route well in advance to watch Clinton's arrival. At the city's 
largest department store, Centrs, shoppers and clerks gathered around a display 
of Western European televisions and beamed as they watched Clinton being 
greeted by President Guntis Ulmanis. 
</P>
<P>
 Many elderly Latvians appeared at the Freedom Monument ceremony. Latvians were 
honored to have "such a big man visit such a tiny country," said Vita Liberte, 
a first-year law student at the University of Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was clearly delighted as Clinton at one point cried out, "Briviba! 
Vabadus! Laisve!" -- the word Freedom! in the three Baltic languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday, Clinton met with Walesa over the negotiating table and at 
dinner for sessions that lasted into the night. Although American officials had 
braced for more complaints from Walesa, they found his rhetoric toned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked of his concern about any Russian threat to Poland's security, Walesa 
said: "I would say that, today, my apprehensions amount to 40% and my hopes to 
60%." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's visit comes at a time when the strains of economic reform have 
increased cries for the old ways in Poland and helped put leftist parties, 
including former Communists, in the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say they went to Warsaw intending to deal with the new power 
structure and to find ways for the United States to alleviate Poland's ills. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other initiatives, U.S. officials propose a "transplantation of 
know-how" to help speed economic reform -- without large, new aid expenditures. 
U.S. officials plan to teach ways to train the jobless, for example, and help 
set up a system of mortgage-backed housing.

DEBATE INTENSE ON SIMPSON EVIDENCE; CRUCIAL RULING DUE; COURT: THE DEFENSE 
ARGUES THAT ENTRY ONTO THE ESTATE WAS ILLEGAL. PROSECUTOR SAYS THE POLICE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN PILLORIED IF THEY HAD FAILED TO ACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors and lawyers for O.J. Simpson squared off Wednesday in a dramatic, 
high-stakes legal battle over evidence seized from the celebrity's home, with 
one side defending the actions of the police and the other accusing them of 
illegally entering Simpson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell said she would rule on the matter this 
morning. Her ruling is likely to play a crucial role in how the case unfolds, 
as a number of important pieces of evidence hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the witnesses who testified Wednesday was Simpson's 25-year-old 
daughter, Arnelle Simpson, who smiled and winked at her father after she left 
the stand and passed the table where he was sitting. In her testimony, she said 
she was sleeping at her father's estate in Brentwood when police jumped over a 
fence before dawn on June 13 -- providing the grist for the spirited 
constitutional debate on the legality of the officers' subsequent search. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Gerald F. Uelmen argued that when police officers jumped the 
fence, they violated Simpson's constitutional right to be secure in his home. 
Uelmen alleged that police then manufactured an excuse for that entry by 
pretending that they believed that more victims might be inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen, a former law school dean and ex-federal prosecutor, belittled the 
primary piece of evidence that officers cited to justify their decision to jump 
the wall and enter Simpson's estate -- a small bloodstain found on the door of 
a Ford Bronco parked on the street. That stain, which Uelmen called a "speck," 
was "just as consistent with a dripping taco or a driver with a hangnail as 
with any circumstances of murder, suicide or bleeding victims on the premises," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark countered by saying that the officers had just 
arrived from the scene where the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman had been discovered lying in pools of their own blood. With that scene 
fresh in their minds, she argued, the officers would have been negligent had 
they not entered a home when they had reason to believe that there could be 
other victims either dead or injured -- a fear that they said they developed 
after seeing the blood on the car and several other suspicious signs outside 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the officers failed to act, she said, they would have been rightly 
pilloried. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have said they were derelict," said Clark, pacing in front of the 
lectern in a courtroom where the nation's attention has been focused for the 
past week. "We would have said they were incompetent. . . . Instead, they did 
fulfill their duties." 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of Wednesday's arguments reflected the magnitude of the stakes 
in the debate over how police came upon evidence at the Simpson estate, using 
it to help obtain a search warrant a few hours later. Among the disputed pieces 
of evidence are a bloodstained glove, bloodstains on Simpson's driveway and 
more bloodstains found on the athlete's Ford Bronco, parked outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have indicated that they hope to introduce that evidence during 
the preliminary hearing. Other evidence seized at the home includes stains 
found in Simpson's upstairs bedroom and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those items were not debated Wednesday, they too could be lost to 
prosecutors if Judge Kennedy-Powell finds that the initial entry into Simpson's 
home violated the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the 
rights of all citizens to be safe and secure in their homes and prevents 
unlawful searches by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In his closing statement on the search issue, Uelmen stressed the importance 
of the 4th Amendment as a brake on police conduct, and, in an unusual 
acknowledgment of the intense public interest in the Simpson case, he urged the 
judge not to be swayed by people outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know and Your Honor knows that the pundits and the cynics who are following 
this case suggest that this case is too high profile a case for a motion to 
suppress to be granted," Uelmen said. "We do not share that cynicism. I think 
it's important for us to bear in mind that what is at issue here is the 
application of an exclusionary rule whose purpose is to teach. What better 
vehicle do we have to teach the lesson that the 4th Amendment is alive and well 
in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Where Uelmen's argument was rich in history and in the vitality of the 4th 
Amendment, Clark's was deeply rooted in the practicalities of police work. 
Clark, who never refers in court to Simpson by name but only as "the 
defendant," argued that detectives were faced with difficult choices and had to 
act quickly to preserve human life. 
</P>
<P>
 Their primary motivation when they jumped the wall, she said, was not to 
gather evidence but to protect residents of Simpson's home from the grisly fate 
that had befallen Nicole Simpson and Goldman just two miles away. Although 
officers did spot evidence after entering the grounds, all that evidence was in 
sight and thus legally admissible, she argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark commended the eloquence and passion of Uelmen's presentation, but she 
accused him of overstating the officers' actions when they entered Simpson's 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "He attempts to depict in very graphic terms the search or the activities that 
were conducted at the location of 360 Rockingham as though a Sherman tank were 
being driven through the back yard and being plowed in through the doors," 
Clark said. "In fact, nothing could be further from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts watching the hearing praised the lawyers for both sides and 
agreed that the stakes are enormously high. Loyola Law School professor and 
former federal prosecutor Samuel H. Pillsbury said he expects an appeal from 
whichever side loses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost the kind of question you use for a law school exam because there 
is a good deal to argue on both sides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Terrell, a longtime civil rights lawyer who often files suppression 
motions related to alleged police misconduct, described the two arguments as 
"the professor versus the litigator." 
</P>
<P>
 "The professor cited constitutional case law," Terrell said. "I thought that 
Clark may have been the more aggressive in her presentation, but the substance 
of Uelmen's comments were more persuasive. A judge is not going to be swayed by 
flair or dramatics." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Terrell believed that the prosecution would win the right to 
introduce the disputed evidence because of current legal trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Harland W. Braun, who defended one of the officers accused of beating 
Rodney G. King, praised Uelmen's presentation but also predicted that 
prosecutors will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers did basically what we would expect," he said. "If they come to 
my house and find blood on the door, I'd want them to knock down the door. . . 
. It's really stretching it to say these guys acted illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Although motions to suppress evidence are rarely granted, Simpson's lawyers 
have waged an intense effort, and the issue dominated court sessions Tuesday 
and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting back, prosecutors filed a 25-page document opposing the motion and 
called two police officers to the stand to explain their actions on the morning 
of June 13. It was about 5 a.m. that day when detectives said they arrived at 
Simpson's house to tell him of the slayings and to have him take care of his 
two children, who were left motherless when Nicole Simpson was killed outside 
her condominium as they slept inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Mark Fuhrman from the LAPD's West Los Angeles Division was the first 
to testify on the issue of the search, repeatedly stressing that the officers 
were genuinely concerned about the safety of the home's occupants and the 
possibility that the killer could be in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman, who found the glove, said the four detectives who let themselves onto 
Simpson's estate after failing to raise anyone inside were confronted with 
frightening uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Fuhrman said, he was forced to explore a long, dark walkway with 
a small flashlight and no bulletproof vest. When he came upon the glove, he 
said, "my heart started pounding. I realized what I had found. . . . I was kind 
of taken aback by the whole event. We didn't go up there for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's testimony was echoed by that of Detective Philip L. Vannatter, one 
of two lead investigators in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter, a craggy-faced homicide detective with more than 200 cases under 
his belt, spent much of his time on the stand in a testy faceoff with Robert L. 
Shapiro, the well-known lawyer who has represented numerous celebrities and 
heads Simpson's high-profile team of attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro wasted no time attacking the detective, opening his questioning of 
Vannatter by immediately challenging the way in which the LAPD has handled its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will show that improper procedures were followed from the very beginning 
of this investigation," Shapiro said, "that times, dates and records of events 
that should be recorded are not recorded. . . . And quite frankly, Your Honor, 
this will go to the credibility of Detective Vannatter." 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, Shapiro questioned nearly every detail of the detective's 
account, focusing on his decision to send a colleague over a wall and onto 
Simpson's property without a search warrant -- a decision that Vannatter said 
he made after discovering what appeared to be blood on a car belonging to 
Simpson and fearing that more victims might be inside the athlete's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter, who works as a homicide specialist in the department's 
robbery-homicide division, initially was questioned by Clark, and he calmly 
explained his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from her, the detective stressed over and over that 
investigators did not go to Simpson's house in search of a suspect but rather 
because they wanted to notify him of his ex-wife's death and advise him that 
his children were at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after getting no answer from a gate intercom and seeing such things as 
what they believed was blood on Simpson's Ford Bronco did Vannatter say that he 
made a decision to go onto Simpson's estate without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned that something had occurred there, whether I had a second 
murder scene, whether I had someone injured, whether I had someone that was 
stalking Mr. Simpson and his wife," Vannatter said. "Whatever, I had become 
concerned that someone could be hurt or injured in that location." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro attacked Vannatter's account, suggesting that investigators 
actually went to Simpson's home because they believed he had committed the 
murders and that they only now are claiming to have had other motives to 
justify their decision to enter the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also accused Vannatter of lying when he drafted a search warrant later 
used to conduct a search of the house and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, both the veteran detective and the high-profile lawyer grew 
short-tempered, resorting to sarcasm and sniping. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vannatter said detectives were concerned that no one was coming to the 
door in part because they had been told that Simpson had a live-in maid, 
Shapiro asked: "Does a full-time, live-in maid to you mean seven days a week, 
24 hours a day?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, sir," Vannatter responded. "I've never had a maid." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday, however, Simpson's daughter cast doubt on Vannatter's 
insistence that police were concerned with the maid's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking softly and glancing occasionally at her father, Arnelle Simpson said 
police had awakened her about 5:30 a.m. and had solicited her help in locating 
her father. Although she testified that officers asked about the maid, she said 
they seemed more preoccupied with locating her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wednesday was devoted to the issue of the police search, prosecutors 
also revealed a few new nuggets in their case that are sure to figure in the 
days ahead, as the closely watched preliminary hearing continues and the judge 
weighs whether there is enough evidence to order Simpson to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday, prosecutors announced that they will seek to introduce during 
the preliminary hearing blood droplets from Simpson's driveway, a pair of 
bloodstained gloves, bloodstains on his car, and blood recovered from the scene 
of the crime. Those pieces of physical evidence in many ways form the backbone 
of the prosecution case, meshing with witness accounts of Simpson's whereabouts 
in an effort to show that he was at the scene of the slayings, which occurred 
June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Vannatter disclosed that a string of blood spots leading away from the murder 
scene ran along the left side of bloody footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 That last, seemingly small, detail could prove important because Simpson's 
lawyer has said the athlete has at least two cuts on his left hand -- as well 
as a number of scratches that Shapiro described as "paper cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with coroner's findings that suggest a fierce struggle at the scene, 
investigators believe that Simpson suffered most of those injuries in a battle 
with Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's attorneys contend that at least one of the cuts was suffered in 
Chicago, when they say Simpson smashed a glass into a counter upon learning 
that his ex-wife had been murdered. 
</P>
<P>

EVERYONE'S A PRIVATE EYE IN THE ULTIMATE WHODUNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember that this is a nation where many people believe that their own 
government is sheltering UFO wreckage, and that anyone could have shot JFK, and 
probably did. 
</P>
<P>
 For such people, and for millions more -- levelheaded people suddenly 
transfixed by the spectacle -- the O.J. Simpson case is bread and meat, a 
transcontinental whodunit in which they can't peek ahead to the ending for the 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first hours, by phone and fax and modem, the theorizing began. 
</P>
<P>
 Armchair sleuths have inundated the Los Angeles Police Department -- more than 
a thousand calls a day at first, from virtually every area code -- and the 
district attorney's office and news media offices with "what abouts" and "what 
ifs." 
</P>
<P>
 The well-meaning, the helpful, the prescient, the psychic and a few cranks 
weigh in. It was scissors, it was a dirk, a dagger. Have you looked for the 
knife at Nicole's grave site? In the dishwasher? Are you sure the dog's OK? My 
father's bridge partner's son-in-law's colleague knows. . . . O.J. was a 
"football passer," wrote a Kentucky woman -- wrongly -- so the knife "might be 
high up" in the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The case takes root and flourishes in office lunchrooms and dinner parties and 
holiday barbecues where Topic A is the high-stakes, real-life version of the 
old board game Clue -- Col. Mustard in the drawing room with the candlestick. 
Every day, with every new bit of testimony, the scenario is retooled: "He 
couldn't have done it because . . . " "He had to have done it because . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Even self-absorbed Washington, D.C., has a sardonic Beltway take on this: that 
O.J. had an ironclad six-hour alibi for the night of the murder -- he was 
waiting for a cup of coffee at Denny's. It's a twist on a complaint by black 
Secret Service agents who said they were ignored at a Denny's restaurant for 
nearly an hour while their white colleagues were served quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rippling beneath it all are widely rumored if rather complex, and sometimes 
far-fetched, scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. was framed. Colombian drug dealers did it. It was the Ku Klux Klan. It 
was the Mafia. It was, in all seriousness, a werewolf. All of them speak to the 
desperate wish in so many quarters that please, let it not be this man who 
could have done that thing. 
</P>
<P>
 For viewers on a first-name basis with the principals -- O.J., Nicole -- "he's 
almost like a member of the family," says Chaytor Mason, associate professor 
emeritus of human factors psychology at USC. "A lot of people, too, have 
fantasies about being rich," says Mason, and "when an idol falls like that, 
this is terrifying, and (people) spend a lot of time thinking about it. And to 
protect him and their own fantasies, they come up with a lot of theories." 
</P>
<P>
 Some webs of imagined guilt are so elaborate and even reckless, reaching so 
far beyond the principal players, dead and living, that it would be libelous 
even to lay them out in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the kibitzing, the theorizing racing ahead of evidence, the living-room 
counterpoint to the plodding, methodical course of law? 
</P>
<P>
 Playing shamus isn't new -- people wove tales for years about the 
disappearance of Judge Crater, and still tell them about Elvis. The rumored 
Jack the Ripper suspects ranged from the heir presumptive to the British throne 
to "the Jews" to a law student. 
</P>
<P>
 But the electronic virtuality of this case makes it more intense -- and more 
like a TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, says Mason, the fictional crimes in books, TV and movies, "about all 
the murders where the obvious is not true." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Murder, She Wrote,' 'Quincy' -- you never expect that the obvious at the 
beginning is what you wind up with at the end. To hell with the butler, he 
never did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we've been exposed to the idea that the obvious is never true, so you jump 
to the alternate solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the McMartin child abuse case has the district attorney's office 
been so flooded with calls, many from the East Coast. While court is in 
session, the phones are pretty silent, except for press calls. During the 
breaks and after adjournment for the day, the phones light up again. (One 
entrepreneur called the office, wanting to buy the evidence after the case is 
over because "I think I can make a lot of money.") Calls are kept confidential 
and passed along to the right hands if they are relevant, and "most are really 
concerned. They want to help us," says Sandi Gibbons, information officer for 
the district attorney's office. "We like those kinds of calls. Nobody's 
infallible." 
</P>
<P>
 Any L.A. veteran is mindful that a little boy found the gun used in one of the 
murders at Sharon Tate's house, and it took a TV news crew, following 
testimony, to find the bloody clothing the Manson family had discarded on a 
hillside after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually the calls are prefaced apologetically by, "Probably you guys have 
already thought about this, but . . . " Sometimes, people have dreamed about 
the case, and then it's, "Please don't think I'm crazy, but I want to help . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 If they can't reach the district attorney, people call the press: 
</P>
<P>
 * A letter cited "Psycho" and "Jagged Edge" and "Sugarland Express," an early 
Spielberg film about a slow police-car chase of a suspect. "If the Simpson 
story plays like a Hollywood movie, this is because it probably was a Hollywood 
movie and O.J. Simpson saw it and planned the murders from it." 
</P>
<P>
 * A caller said, "Just rent 'The Fugitive' (a film about a man wrongly accused 
of murder) and you'll realize the great similarities." 
</P>
<P>
 * An Atlanta bank employee passed along a girlfriend's husband's theory that 
Nicole Simpson was killed with a "bow-tie" cut, characteristic of Colombian 
drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The werewolf of recent movie fame killed them. As the rumor goes, the movie 
was filmed at the Bradbury Building, near where Simpson allegedly bought the 
knife. It explains the jagged wounds, the hairs left behind, and why the dog 
wailed -- he saw a wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Many theories have come from the concerns of the African American community. 
Part of the reason for such alternative theories, Mason said, is concern "about 
the police, some earned, some not." The real agenda, as expressed by a Pomona 
man, is to "keep the black man down." A Los Angeles Times poll of city 
residents 10 days ago found 74% of blacks to be sympathetic toward Simpson, 
compared to 38% of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminding readers of the confusion in the years after President Kennedy's 
assassination, an article from an Orange County publication called "The Black 
Orange," about the African American community, offered three scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 One, that Simpson "is the victim of a horrible con game" of too much 
incriminating evidence. "Sorry, I think O.J. had too much to lose . . . it just 
doesn't make sense. He couldn't be that stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Another: "A powerful, wealthy and unscrupulous person who hates O.J. for some 
reason" decides to "get him back in a way that is worse than killing him" and 
sends "goons" to kill his ex-wife and link the crime to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 And the third, that the incentive for a setup was a distraction. "Maybe you 
want to get some awful bill passed with no fanfare. What better opportunity . . 
. (than when) the public's attention is totally distracted?"

COMPUTER PROJECT LIMITS PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stunned by the failure of a $44-million Department of Motor Vehicles computer 
project, the Legislature is determined to put the brakes on the proliferation 
of high-tech systems throughout state government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of bipartisan actions, legislators inserted into Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposed state budget scores of amendments designed to avert a repeat 
of the DMV fiasco. Enactment of the budget is expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The precautionary moves also reflected an expanding belief among legislators 
that state government is speeding dangerously toward the information 
superhighway without adequate expertise, supervision and controls. 
</P>
<P>
 One critic, Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), has warned that the 
DMV failure may be the tip of a "multibillion-dollar iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief thrust of the budget amendments is the requirement that experts be 
hired from outside government to give advice and make recommendations on 
automated technology decisions that normally are made by bureaucrats. But 
instead of allowing each government department to hire its own experts -- a 
practice that critics say can skew objectivity -- the departments would choose 
outside consultants hired by the Bureau of State Audits, an investigative 
agency that reports to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had not been for the DMV fiasco, you wouldn't see all the concern that 
you're seeing now," said a highly placed legislative source. "The DMV thing was 
kind of an icebreaker. It sensitized the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the amendments offered this week, legislative budget negotiators took 
the unusual step of ordering the Bureau of State Audits to hire an independent 
computer consultant to evaluate further DMV plans for upgrading its obsolete 
databases before more expenditures are authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget writers also refused to provide another $7.5 million sought by the DMV 
to salvage remnants of its failed system and invest in what many lawmakers 
regarded as an uncertain new course. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, legislative fiscal committees proposed that the audits 
bureau thoroughly investigate the management responsibilities of the powerful 
state Office of Information Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The office is charged with overseeing and monitoring the state's expanding 
$1-billion-a-year computer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff of watchdog Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill recently roasted the 
agency for alleged lack of leadership. The criticism included failure to 
develop a statewide operating plan, approval of incompatible systems and the 
collection of redundant data in separate computer operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has resulted in major problems, lost opportunities and a significantly 
costlier application of computer technology without commensurate benefits," 
Hill charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, legislative budget conferees ordered the audits bureau to hire an 
outside computer expert to carefully monitor development of an ambitious 
$800-million automated information system for the administration of health and 
welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still in its infancy, the 12-year project eventually is to connect 
all counties in the state, including populous Los Angeles County, which is 
pursuing its own $100-million system. But the statewide project already has 
raised questions about whether its contracts will be open to competitive 
bidding by vendors and whether other systems may be more effective and 
economical. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative budget negotiators want to avoid a repeat of the DMV scandal, 
in which major contracts were awarded without open competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is to ensure that two or three years from now, the statewide 
welfare tracking system doesn't look like the DMV fiasco," said a legislative 
expert who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last seven years, the DMV sought to upgrade its antiquated 1960s 
drivers license and vehicle registration databases. But for a variety of 
reasons, ranging from allegedly unrealistic expectations to bureaucrats being 
misled by computer industry hype, the $44-million project encountered major 
hurdles and was abandoned late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some lawmakers were suspicious, the magnitude of the trouble went 
mostly undetected until the legislative analyst's staff sounded the alarm in 
February.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The friendly betting on California's gubernatorial race is that Gov. Pete 
Wilson will win narrowly. But there are increasing numbers of political 
insiders willing to wager he's headed for a runaway. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the direct opposite of last July, when Treasurer Kathleen Brown was the 
consensus front-runner and some were thinking landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 One seasoned strategist for Democratic legislative candidates recently summed 
up the new attitude: "Do I think Brown can pull it out?" he asked, repeating my 
question. "Come on! We're just hoping she doesn't crash and burn." His fear was 
that she'd take other Democrats down with her. 
</P>
<P>
 It's indisputable, based on polls, that Wilson -- the self-proclaimed 
"Comeback Kid" -- has been outrunning Brown and now has overtaken her. There 
hasn't been any independent polling since May, but recent private surveys by 
both candidates found the Republican governor in front -- by five points in 
Brown's poll and nine in Wilson's. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, The Times Poll had Wilson trailing Brown by 22 points in March, 
1993, by 15 points last October and by 10 points in May. The Field Poll had 
relatively similar figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on cloud nine," says Wilson's veteran campaign manager, George Gorton. 
"We've got the issues, the lead, more money than she does and a (projected) low 
turnout that favors Republicans. That begins to limit the number of things that 
can change things around." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the best of the situation, Brown campaign manager Clinton Reilly 
insists: "We like our position. The last six months have been open season on 
Kathleen, like she's the incumbent. As it becomes apparent she's the underdog, 
there'll be more focus on Wilson and he'll have to stand on his record." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, he adds, "let them think we're a bunch of country bumpkins." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fascinating paradox that the man with the worst first-term job ratings 
of any California governor since modern polling began now is the front-runner 
for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's new poll shows Wilson with a job rating of only 34% positive to 65% 
negative. Her job rating as treasurer also is negative, but a close 38%-43%, 
with 19% unsure. 
</P>
<P>
 With negatives like Wilson's -- in an era of anti-incumbency -- you'd think 
Brown would be cruising to victory. So why isn't she? 
</P>
<P>
 For one, the last year has been a good one for Wilson both in terms of 
governing and campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second straight summer he has managed to avoid a repeat of 1992's 
disastrous budget gridlock. Last year, he also worked closely with the 
Legislature to enact pro-business legislation aimed at stimulating the state's 
economy. And this year, he has managed to get Southern California's freeways up 
and running ahead of schedule after the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, he has run a smart, focused race. The governor has finessed the 
public's concerns to his advantage, concentrating on the volatile issues of 
crime and illegal immigration, where his views seem more in sync with the 
voters than are Brown's. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's subliminal message: You don't have to like me to agree with me and 
vote for me.  
</P>
<P>
 "People have seen me struggling with some success, making a major effort on 
issues they think are very important," Wilson says. "Kathleen hasn't done much 
or said much. You can't just make a speech to Town Hall and list 33 points and 
expect people to be bowled over." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also has twice as much money in the bank -- nearly $5 million to 
Brown's roughly $2.4 million. And he has an operating field organization, 
something Brown still doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To win, her strategists realize, Brown must do two things: Run an effective, 
old-fashioned "throw the bum out" campaign and establish herself as a credible 
alternative to the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Her private polling points to Wilson's weaknesses: Pluralities of voters think 
he hasn't accomplished much and is out of touch with people. They blame him at 
least somewhat for the bad economy, declining schools, the budget mess and 
rising taxes -- and believe a second term merely would be more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's biggest problem -- the main reason she isn't cruising -- is that 
voters just aren't comfortable with her. Part of the reason may be family 
baggage, especially her brother Jerry's "moonbeam" image. It also probably 
didn't help that she emphasized her father's opposition to the death penalty in 
trying to explain her own. 
</P>
<P>
 More crucial, however, is that she still hasn't defined herself. She hasn't 
articulated for swing voters why she should be governor. 
</P>
<P>
 There's this nagging suspicion that she hasn't thought it through. Fortunately 
for Brown, she has another four months to convince voters that she has.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; FEINSTEIN BLASTS RIVAL ON HIS HOME TURF; 
SENATOR TELLS SANTA BARBARA VOTERS SHE REPRESENTED THEM WHEN HUFFINGTON LET 
THEM DOWN. THE CANDIDATES RENEW THEIR DEBATE OVER THE PROPRIETY OF HELP SHE 
GAVE RAYTHEON.

<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein showed up in her Republican challenger's hometown 
Wednesday to spotlight Rep. Michael Huffington's local problems and underscore 
their sharply different views of government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic incumbent, who has found herself in a tight race for 
reelection, charged that Huffington has done such a poor job representing his 
district that she has twice had to step in and help. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein toured one company Wednesday that she has featured in a campaign 
commercial where she claims to have saved about 250 jobs by helping open a 
foreign market that Huffington declined to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that I've produced for this district and he hasn't," Feinstein 
said. "California business needs to know that it is supported. . . . I'm going 
to fight for my state. And I am going to help in any way I personally can, 
anyone who asks, if it's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has criticized Feinstein's corporate advocacy in Washington, 
especially on behalf of the Santa Barbara division of Raytheon, saying it 
proves she is a lobbyist for powerful special interests who expect pay-backs 
for their political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara lawmaker also has broadcast a television commercial 
attacking Feinstein's action for Raytheon, revealing a sharp contrast in the 
way the two lawmakers view their roles in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says his pro-business approach is to keep government out of the 
marketplace by reducing regulations and taxes. He has declined to solicit 
endorsements or take political action committee contributions, saying he can 
remain independent of individual interests or companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and I are different," Huffington said in a telephone interview Wednesday 
from his Los Angeles apartment where he is recuperating from eye surgery 
Sunday. "I have no problem with a company getting a fair hearing in Washington. 
What I don't think is appropriate is for one company to come in like Raytheon 
and ask their representative to change the laws so they can sell a product."

 Raytheon asked Huffington and then Feinstein last year for help in getting 
permission from the Clinton Administration to sell high-tech weapons systems to 
Taiwan. Feinstein wrote letters on behalf of Raytheon and other companies 
seeking access to the Taiwan market. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Huffington, Feinstein said it is appropriate for companies to 
have a relationship with their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was mayor, I would send a member of my staff to get a permit for a 
company if they wanted to come to San Francisco," Feinstein said. "I want to be 
that same kind of senator." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein also countered that Huffington is being hypocritical in attacking 
her corporate advocacy because he essentially is financing his campaign with 
earnings from his family's petroleum company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all comes from one source -- oil," Feinstein said. "If Michael Huffington 
made $50,000 a year, his campaign would be a joke based on his record. . . . 
But because he can fuel his own campaign with millions and millions of oil 
dollars, he can make accusations." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington rejected Feinstein's charge that his money is tainted by a special 
interest. And he clarified that most of his family earnings came from natural 
gas, not oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The two campaigns have been locked in an expensive television battle since 
early June, when a series of polls indicated that the race had become 
surprisingly close. Feinstein's appearance Wednesday marked one of the few 
times recently that she has personally carried her campaign message in public. 
</P>
<P>
 At a luncheon for about 200 supporters, Feinstein said she has been a valuable 
advocate for the state on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where no 
Californian had served for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last fiscal year, she said, non-defense appropriations for California 
were up 27% -- about $1.6 billion more than the state previously received. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe if I could get on that committee, I could help," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein also came to Santa Barbara to highlight an embarrassment for 
Huffington, who lost his home county in the June 7 Republican primary to GOP 
challenger William E. Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington sparked controversy in the county last fall when he announced that 
he would abandon his House seat for a Senate campaign less than a year after 
being elected. He also made enemies in the area during a bitter Republican 
primary for the House in which Huffington spent more than $5 million of his own 
money to unseat a veteran incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, the man on the street thinks Huffington has abandoned his 
district," said Rusty Fairly, a Santa Barbara city councilman who attended the 
Feinstein lunch and once worked for Huffington's congressional office. "The 
wounds have not been healed. These people feel as strongly as ever."

SINGLE-PAYER BENEFIT PLAN'S FOES GEAR UP; INSURANCE: BUSINESS GROUPS FIRE THE 
FIRST SALVOS IN THEIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE STATE HEALTH CARE INITIATIVE. THEIR 
FINANCIAL CLAIMS ARE DISPUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they are prepared to spend as much as is needed to defeat the so-called 
single-payer health insurance initiative, business groups began their campaign 
Wednesday by contending that the measure would create huge deficits, cost the 
state jobs and disrupt the health system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, the proposition promises a Cadillac. Unfortunately, it can only 
afford a Yugo," said Richard C. Carlson, an economist working for opponents of 
the measure. Carlson called the initiative an enormous gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the longtime government budget analyst at a news conference were the 
heads of the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Taxpayers' 
Assn., organizations that represent more than 7,000 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Using strong terms, the business leaders cast the initiative -- put on the 
November ballot by labor unions, senior citizens groups, health activists and 
others -- as "socialized medicine," bad for business and one of the worst 
ballot measures for corporate California in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, if the measure passes, it would disburse $150 billion a year in 
health benefits, making it the fourth-largest health system in the world, 
behind those of Germany, Japan and France, according to the critics. It would 
also create the largest government entitlement program ever put together by a 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The business coalition released a financial analysis written by Carlson that 
argues that the health system would pay out $100 billion in benefits its first 
year, but that the payout would rapidly expand and produce a $48-billion 
deficit by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the claim, supporters of the measure came out with a study of 
their own. It contends that the measure would produce a $4-billion surplus in 
1996, the first year of implementation, and save Californians $55 billion in 
health care costs within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our figures paint quite a different picture than theirs. We believe the plan 
is adequately funded," said Paul Milne, spokesman for the initiative campaign, 
called Californians for Health Security. "Among the things they leave out are 
the costs we are paying now for bloated insurance company administration, 
bureaucracy, marketing and profits that consume an enormous portion of the 
health insurance premium dollars that are paid for by individuals and 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which has not yet been given a ballot number by the secretary of 
state's office, would require hefty increases in business and personal taxes. 
As a trade-off, it would free individuals and employers from paying for health 
insurance premiums or out-of-pocket health expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, patterned after the system now used in Canada, money from 
personal and payroll tax increases, about $46 billion annually, would go into a 
pool. The pool would be augmented by $60 billion in federal, state and other 
public money that now goes into programs such as Medicare and Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors and hospitals would be paid directly by a new state agency set up to 
pay claims submitted by the providers. The agency would be headed by a health 
commissioner who would be elected to a four-year term in a statewide vote. The 
system gets its name because the state would act as the "single payer" of 
medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would provide all Californians, regardless of income or health 
status, with the same health insurance card. It would guarantee them a package 
of health benefits that both critics and supporters say would be comparable to 
the best private insurance plans. The plan would operate much like a private 
plan today, allowing individuals to choose their own physicians and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief beneficiaries of the plan would be the estimated 6 million Californians 
who currently do not have public or private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the big losers would be health insurance companies. Now the middlemen 
between patients and health providers, they would be replaced by the new state 
health insurance agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk West, president of the state Chamber of Commerce, said the opposition 
campaign will be greatly helped if President Clinton and Congress enact a 
national health reform plan before the November election. Supporters then would 
no longer be able to charge that elected leaders are not doing anything to 
solve problems in the health care delivery system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 West said the opponents have not yet decided how much money will go into the 
campaign against the initiative. West said private polls will be conducted with 
voters and once the opponents determine the level of support for the initiative 
they will decide how much money to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no division of opinion among large and small employers on this 
issue," he said. "We will do what we need to do to defeat it."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; THE JURY SYSTEM IS ALSO ON TRIAL AMID THE SPECTACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day before the opening of O.J. Simpson's preliminary hearing, I had a long 
talk with Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 The D.A. isn't playing a visible role in the daily courtroom drama and has 
kept away from TV after a flurry of controversial early appearances. In fact, 
Garcetti told me he wouldn't discuss the Simpson prosecution. But I couldn't 
forget it -- and I doubt he could either -- as we explored the main topic of 
our conversation, the vagaries of jurors. For it is jurors who, if there is a 
trial, will determine Simpson's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is also likely to influence Garcetti's own future. The last two 
D.A.s, Robert Philibosian and Ira Reiner, were defeated when prosecutors fell 
short of public expectations in big cases. Having overwhelmed Reiner in the 
1992 election, Garcetti knows how such failures can become major campaign 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been especially true in the two decades when crime has become a 
dominant issue in California politics. In this state's highly charged 
atmosphere, when public attention is fixed on crime, the outcome of courtroom 
proceedings has often resulted in major changes in the law, as well as making 
or breaking political careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people never gave the California State Supreme Court a second thought 
until Rose Elizabeth Bird became chief justice and presided over the 
overturning of 64 of 68 death sentences brought before her court. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to the recall of Bird and two other liberal justices, Joseph R. 
Grodin and Cruz Reynoso. UC Hastings College of Law Prof. Evan Lee, whom I 
spoke to after my conversation with Garcetti, said "the rising tide of anger" 
that kicked the justices off the bench also helped build voter support for 
Proposition 115, a 1990 measure that greatly strengthened the hand of the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sort of anger prompted voters to approve another pro-prosecution 
measure, the Victims Bill of Rights, several years before. And remember when a 
San Francisco jury convicted Dan White of manslaughter, rather than 
first-degree murder, for killing Mayor George Moscone? White used the "Twinkie 
defense," claiming his addiction to junk food worsened his depression. This 
defense, called diminished capacity, was quickly limited by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of perceptions that crime is getting worse and criminal 
defendants are being treated more leniently," Lee told me. "Whether that is 
true is questionable, but the perception is there. Perceptions are all that 
matter in a democracy. That is our system. People vote on the basis of 
perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I talked to Garcetti about juries, I thought he might be tapping into a 
similar perception, that juries have gone awry, especially in high-profile 
cases. You could understand why he might feel that way. The Menendez brothers' 
first murder trials ended in hung juries. And the jury that heard the trial of 
the men accused of beating trucker Reginald Denny returned verdicts much 
lighter than those sought by prosecutors. The D.A.'s office wins most of the 
time, but these high-profile cases add up to big losses in the minds of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we really getting a representative cross-section of our community?" 
Garcetti asked. "When I hear from CEOs that they are cutting back on the amount 
of time they will pay their employees to serve on juries or to eliminate it 
entirely, it is very frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "So who are the people who are willing to come forward?" he asked. "Are they 
people who are bright, and who want to participate and give something to the 
community, do what is right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps (some) have a particular cause. . . . Do you have jurors in 
high-profile cases who say: 'Here is a chance for my day in the sun? I know I 
will be interviewed, I will be on national television when this is over.' Do 
you have people who are coming in with personal or political agendas, who will 
find it impossible to accept the obligations and responsibilities as a juror to 
truly put aside their personal feelings and biases and accept the law, accept 
those responsibilities that are placed on them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti also wondered about the spin of these trials, how the opinions of 
jurors and potential jurors are shaped by the news and talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pervasiveness of the media is a factor that has been dramatically 
underestimated," he said. "In terms of the radio talk shows and your TV talk 
shows like 'Oprah,' you have all these rationalizations or excuses as to why we 
should be forgiven for every wrong act, criminal act or not. We have been 
willing to accept to a large degree that any particular conduct can be excused 
and that we . . . are not responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if he thought that was the case in the Menendez trials. "Without a 
doubt," he said. "We have the very difficult burden of trying to convince each 
juror there is such a thing as individual responsibility. Are we getting jurors 
who are influenced by some of those shows?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti had some solutions. He is trying to persuade corporate executives to 
free employees for long jury service. Garcetti is also working with the judges 
to make their instructions to the jurors easier to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 His most controversial suggestion is to study whether California should adopt 
less-than-unanimous jury verdicts in all criminal cases, except the penalty 
phase of death penalty cases. Several states have adopted the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Local judges have told Garcetti they don't like the idea. Garcetti himself 
once opposed it. "I won't say outright I'm in favor, but I am more inclined 
than I was. It's something we should explore." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the idea takes off could depend on the outcome of the Simpson case. 
That's why it is more than just another tragedy turned into a tabloid 
spectacle.

WEDNESDAY'S WITNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is a summary of Wednesday's testimony in the O.J. Simpson preliminary 
hearing: 
</P>
<P>
 * Detective Mark Fuhrman, one of the first detectives assigned to the case. In 
his second day on the stand, Fuhrman said investigators did not know what to 
expect when they arrived at O.J. Simpson's Brentwood house and that he was 
startled to find a glove matching one found at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * Detective Philip L. Vannatter, one of two lead investigators on the case. 
Testified that he and three other detectives went to Simpson's house to notify 
him of the killings but once there, grew concerned that there might be trouble 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brian (Kato) Kaelin, guest house tenant of Simpson. Also testifying for the 
second time, Kaelin said officers did not express any concern to him about 
other possible victims at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arnelle Simpson, O.J. Simpson's 25-year-old daughter. Said she had been 
awakened by police officers about 5:30 a.m. and that, to her, they appeared to 
be there to find her father. She said she called her father's assistant to help 
track him down. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cathy Randa, Simpson's longtime administrative assistant. Testified that she 
got a call from a "hysterical" Arnelle Simpson about 5:45 a.m. and that she 
then spoke to police, telling them that Simpson was in Chicago and giving them 
the number of his hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dennis Fung, a criminalist employed by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
Said he tested red stains at Simpson's home and found that they appeared to be 
blood. He added, however, that the tests he did at the scene were only 
preliminary and not conclusive.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; COWLINGS KEEPS LOW PROFILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Al (A.C.) Cowlings, who led police on a nationally televised 60-mile chase 
with friend O.J. Simpson, has appeared only infrequently in public since then. 
A week after the chase, he attended a banquet for the adult film industry and 
was photographed dancing.Reporters outside Men's Central Jail have not seen 
Cowlings visit Simpson. Cowlings is due in court July 15 to learn if 
prosecutors will press charges regarding the chase. VOICES 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned that something had occurred there, whether I had a second 
murder scene . . . whether I had someone that was stalking Mr. Simpson and his 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
 "My adrenaline was pumping. I realized it was very close in description and 
color to the glove found at the crime scene."

EXCERPTS OF ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BY ATTORNEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Excerpts from the argument of defense attorney Gerald F. Uelmen that 
evidence seized at Simpson's estate without a search warrant was illegally 
obtained and should not be admitted at trial: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Honor, I think that a good starting point for this motion is with the 4th 
Amendment itself because, essentially, that's what this motion is all about. 
It's about the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I think what we're confronting here is police officers who have the 4th 
Amendment backwards, who believe in conducting the search first and then 
obtaining a warrant. . . . (But under the law that applies to police searches 
of private homes), the exception for emergencies or exigent circumstances is a 
very, very limited one. It is limited to situations in which there is an 
imminent threat, and the kind of entry it permits is limited by the threat that 
is presented. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Here we have officers coming to these premises at 5 o'clock in the morning, at 
least six hours after the murders that they were investigating had occurred, a 
distance of two miles away from the scene of those murders. The victim, one of 
the victims of those murders, had been identified at 1 o'clock that morning, 
and it appears that most of the delay from 1 o'clock until 5 o'clock in the 
morning was consumed simply in deciding what detectives were going to 
investigate this homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 We are told that four detectives -- the four detectives who were most 
responsible for investigating the circumstances of this homicide -- all 
converged on the residence of Mr. Simpson simply for the purpose of informing 
him of the tragedy that had taken place at the Bundy location -- a purpose that 
could just as easily have been accomplished by the placing of a telephone call. 
The officers claimed no exigency, no emergency until they discovered what Your 
Honor has seen as a one-eighth- to one-quarter-inch dried speck of substance on 
the door of an automobile, which could not even be confirmed as being blood 
after scientific investigation -- a stain which was just as consistent with a 
dripping taco or a driver with hangnail as with any circumstances of murder, 
suicide or bleeding victims on the premises. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Even if we concede -- and we do not concede, but even if we did concede -- 
that there were exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless entry to the 
premises, again, the scope of their activity on those premises is limited by 
that exigency. . . . (And) their mission, essentially, was accomplished prior 
to 6 o'clock in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 They had accomplished the notification of Mr. Simpson. They had made 
arrangements for the well-being of the children that were the subject of 
concern. They had ascertained or located no other victims or no reports of any 
other problems. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I think everything that happened from then on can only be described as 
investigative activity: the gathering of evidence of a crime, the precise 
activity that the 4th Amendment commands officers (to) obtain probable cause 
and a warrant before they engage in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again we heard the detectives say, "Well, we didn't know what we 
had. We didn't know what had happened on these premises." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we know what they didn't have -- they didn't have a search warrant. And 
if we were to carve out an exception to the 4th Amendment for detectives who 
don't know what they have, in effect, we would turn the 4th Amendment on its 
head, and we would say, "The less you know, the more you can search."

EXCERPTS OF ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BY ATTORNEYS

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Excerpts from the summation of Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, who defends 
the actions of police at O.J. Simpson's Brentwood estate prior to their 
obtaining a search warrant: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the point when the officers leave for 360 Rockingham, . . . what is in 
their minds is what they've just seen at 875 South Bundy. They've seen a bloody 
crime scene with bloody shoe prints leaving from the crime scene and blood 
drops alongside to the left of them. . . . And that tells them that someone 
left the scene bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they've seen a brown leather glove at the feet of one of the 
victims. They know that children, small ones, have been taken away from the 
scene and placed in police custody because they don't know where to place those 
children. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They also know of the celebrity status of the victim's husband, the children's 
father, who lives close by. So close by that he's the most logical person to go 
to. You want to get to someone quickly who can take care of those children. As 
quickly as you can. The celebrity status of the victim, of the victim's 
husband, is important because we know about . . . stalkers. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that these things are in an officer's mind and reasonably so, because 
he has to be considering everything -- every possibility that may occur. If he 
fails to take into account every possibility, then we justifiably are upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't you think of that, officer? Why didn't you protect these people? 
That's your job." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 With all of that in mind, the officers go to 360 Rockingham and attempt to 
raise someone inside the house. They ring the intercom repeatedly and get no 
answer -- yet there are lights on. There are lights on downstairs, there's a 
light on upstairs. There are cars in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 They contact Westec (a security firm) and find out that a maid should be there 
full time. And at a property of that size, it's probably not unreasonable to 
think that someone should be there full time looking over it. And yet they 
don't reach anyone. Then they finally get the house phone and they call that 
phone number. And there's no answer, once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now their concern has to mount. These are human beings, these detectives, and 
they know all of the concerns are still pressing on them. No answer to the 
intercom, no answer to the house phone, and there's lights on and there's cars 
in the driveway. They have to be concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a detective has indicated, "I see the car in front of the house. It seems 
to be parked kind of hastily. And I see what I think is a spot of blood on the 
door handle." 
</P>
<P>
 They've come from a bloody crime scene where someone was left bleeding. They 
get to this location, they see a spot of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Your Honor, I don't care if it's a spot of blood as big as a dime or as big as 
a quarter, it's unusual to find blood on an otherwise clean car. 
</P>
<P>
 And a car that's parked hastily. One that belongs to Mr. Simpson, . . . whose 
ex-wife has just been found dead in a bloody mess two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 It is absolutely incumbent upon them to do something at that point to assure 
themselves that the people inside that house are safe and secure -- that there 
is not something horribly amiss, because they've just come from a scene so gory 
that nothing could be more amiss than that. 
</P>
<P>
 And the connection directly to the household of Mr. Simpson is absolutely 
clear, and if they were to stand outside and think about leaving -- think about 
waiting until Mr. Simpson came home while someone may have lain dying, bleeding 
in that location -- we would justifiably be upset. 
</P>
<P>
 We would justifiably call them derelict in their duty. . . . We would have 
said that they were incompetent. We would have said nothing good about the 
manner in which they fulfilled their duties, because they would not have been 
fulfilling their duties.

QUIET, METHODICAL, UELMEN GETS JOB OF LAYING MINES; ATTORNEYS: PROFESSOR IS NOT 
KNOWN FOR FLAIR, BUT HIS GRASP OF ARCANE LEGAL ISSUES GIVES THE DEFENSE SKILLS 
IT NEEDS. 
</P>

 Long before he was tapped to help defend O.J. Simpson, Gerald Uelmen was a law 
professor at Loyola University law school. Long before Kathleen Kennedy-Powell 
became the Municipal Court judge assigned to the preliminary hearing for 
Simpson, she was a law student at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 And who was her professor in criminal law and criminal procedure? None other 
than Gerald F. Uelmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the tables are turned: The professor is asking his former student to rule 
that a bloody glove and blood spatters found at Simpson's Brentwood estate 
cannot be introduced as evidence because they were seized during a search that 
the defense contends was illegal. The judge will make her ruling today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uelmen taught her everything she knows about search and seizure," said Loyola 
law professor Stan Goldman, another ex-student of Uelmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Their connection, known to the prosecution, is not as ironic as it would seem, 
given that Uelmen has spent most of his legal career teaching and running law 
schools, not trying cases in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship is one of many twists in a case that has transfixed the 
public since the bloody bodies of Simpson's ex-wife and her friend were 
discovered June 13 at her Brentwood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Uelmen, who stepped down last month as dean of the Santa Clara University 
law school, has moved onto center stage in the hearing, cross-examining 
witnesses in the defense's attempt to keep out evidence found during the search 
of Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the polished Robert L. Shapiro, who is Simpson's lead defense 
attorney, the white-haired, bespectacled lawyer with the hearing aid looks the 
part of a frumpy, avuncular professor more accustomed to perusing lawbooks than 
commanding the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "His job as second chair to Shapiro is to lay the mines in the minefield and 
make the prosecutor walk over them," said Gigi Gordon, a Santa Monica attorney 
who specializes in death penalty cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Shapiro, a celebrity lawyer who aggressively grilled police witnesses 
Wednesday, Uelmen questioned them matter-of-factly, making his points without 
flair or drama in a style that some detractors maintain revealed his lack of 
significant trial experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he earned the nickname "the Cobra" many years ago when he worked in the 
U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, prosecuting organized crime and 
gambling. His colleagues said they called him that because he was so deft at 
inflicting wounds on his unsuspecting opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who now say he is just a paper guy underestimate his skill as a trial 
lawyer," said Los Angeles defense lawyer Stephen D. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Uelmen's strength lies largely outside the courtroom. He is known for 
his firm grasp of arcane legal issues and appellate decisions -- just the sort 
of skills that the defense needs to suppress evidence seized at Simpson's 
estate shortly after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen, 53, normally spends much of his time tracking the decisions of the 
California Supreme Court, some of whose conservative justices hate his 
often-critical commentary on their rulings and tend to disparage him privately 
as an ideologue. Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, according to an appellate lawyer, 
once angrily chastised Uelmen at a party for his relentless criticism of the 
high court -- particularly of failing to protect the rights of criminal 
defendants and of being too favorable to business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But Uelmen, who aspires to a seat on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, is 
generally regarded as open-minded and flexible on criminal issues, except on 
the death penalty, which he strongly opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is quite liberal, Uelmen blasted the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 
1991 for "the dumbest decision of the year" after that court reversed the death 
sentence of a convicted murderer solely because the prosecutor had quoted the 
Bible in his closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is that jurors are intelligent enough to give the Bible the weight 
it deserves, and lawyers should be free to address jurors as though they are 
intelligent human beings," he wrote. " . . . All too often, the dithering 
nincompoops in today's courtrooms are the lawyers and the judges." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Brown said he was surprised that Shapiro, 
after selecting Uelmen for the defense team, also brought on board another 
constitutional scholar -- celebrated Harvard University law professor Alan M. 
Dershowitz, who has represented such famous clients as Claus von Bulow and was 
glamorized in a recent movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uelmen is better," Brown contended. "He probably knows California law better 
than any individual I know of." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Simpson case, Uelmen, like Shapiro at times, gets his share of 
negative reviews. A prosecutor who has gone up against the professor called him 
"pedestrian at best" and, in the courtroom, "pedantic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know how to spell boring?" the prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense lawyer praised Uelmen, but also noted that his lack of trial 
experience showed when he asked a detective if the Police Department always 
sent four police officers to notify a crime victim's family of a death. Instead 
of giving the detective the chance to provide a plausible explanation for the 
presence of four officers, the attorney said, he should have reserved the point 
for arguments before the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 But other lawyers praised Uelmen's methodical cross-examination of the 
detective as solid if not flashy. They said he was carefully making points to 
show that the police entered Simpson's estate not because they felt they had an 
emergency but because they already considered him a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be Clarence Darrow to put in a motion to suppress," Brown 
said. " . . . What he has to do is make certain points, and that is exactly 
what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco attorney Ephraim Margolin noted that Uelmen also may be trying 
to solicit as much information as possible from the witnesses to prevent the 
defense from being ambushed by prosecution testimony during a future trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen has known Shapiro for many years. The former dean said in a previous 
interview that they became acquainted through Loyola, where Shapiro also 
studied, and through California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a statewide 
association of criminal defense lawyers that Uelmen once headed. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lawyers worked together to defend Christian Brando, who eventually 
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the slaying of his half-sister's 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen, a devoted Catholic, lives in Santa Clara County with his wife, Martha, 
a family law attorney. They have three grown children: two daughters -- one of 
whom is also a lawyer -- who belong to a Roman Catholic lay religious order, 
and a son who is a musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen grew up in Los Angeles, attending Mt. Carmel High, a parochial school 
in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife described him as a workaholic. The Simpson case has consumed him, she 
said, and "he is loving it." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are jokes about him having been cloned," she said, because he is so 
prolific in his writing and his work. Uelmen has written several books, 
including one about legal humor and another about drug abuse law, and many law 
review articles. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen graduated from Georgetown University of School of Law in 1965. He 
represented indigent clients in criminal cases in Washington before joining the 
U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. Between his teaching assignments, he has 
represented defendants in criminal proceedings, usually on appeals and 
sometimes without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be a visiting scholar and instructor at Stanford University before he 
returns to Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 During his closing argument on the suppression motion Wednesday, Uelmen 
sounded as though he might be talking to a classroom full of law students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cynics suggest that this is too high-profile a case to suppress 
evidence," he said, adding that he could think of "no better vehicle" to teach 
the lessons of the 4th Amendment than to suppress the fruits of the search of 
Simpson's estate.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; RULING EXPECTED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell said she will rule today on whether evidence 
found in the search of O.J. Simpson's estate can legally be used in court. 
Under state and federal law, police can enter a home without a warrant if they: 
</P>
<P>
 - Are in hot pursuit of a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 - Believe evidence will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 - Believe someone is in jeopardy. COVERING THE CASE 
</P>

 As many as 80 media representatives are swarming daily to the two press rooms 
on the 11th floor of the Criminal Courts Building. Two small color TVs are 
provided for the print media; one shows the courtroom and the other monitors 
the hallway outside where witnesses wait. An adjoining press room is primarily

RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSES NATIONS OF FINE WORDS, FOUL DEEDS; REPORT: MANY 
GOVERNMENTS ARE HYPOCRITICAL, SOME ABUSE ACTIVISTS, AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL STUDY 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a depressing report scheduled for release today on the state of human 
rights around the globe, Amnesty International accused most of the world's 
governments of pledging support for human rights with lofty rhetoric, then 
abusing human rights in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Many victims, in fact, are human rights activists who are struggling against 
terrible odds to tell the truth about the woeful state of human rights in their 
countries, the report said. "Governments that victimize human rights activists 
almost invariably have a great deal to hide," Amnesty International said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of hypocrisy, the report cited South Korea, which arrested one 
of its most prominent human rights advocates last year, just a few weeks after 
the South Korean foreign minister told the U.N. World Conference on Human 
Rights in Vienna: "I am happy to report to you that human rights have finally 
come of age in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of official talk about human rights in 1993," Amnesty 
International said. "The noise reached a crescendo . . . when government 
representatives met at the . . . conference. . . . But even as they were making 
worthy declarations . . activists were being threatened, imprisoned, tortured 
and gunned down." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, issued annually, chronicled and assessed events in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amnesty International, a private worldwide group of volunteers devoted to 
protecting political prisoners and other human rights victims, added a 
supplement to update the problems in several countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up the situation around the globe in 1993, Amnesty International 
reported more than 10,000 people -- half of them in Africa -- in 61 countries 
were executed by government forces without a trial or other judicial hearing. 
More than 700 people, 200 in Iraq alone, in 27 countries "disappeared" after 
government forces took them away. Almost 4,000 prisoners were subjected to 
torture, rape and other ill treatment in 112 countries, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, more than 600 people died of torture in 49 countries, more than 100,000 
were imprisoned without charges or trial in 58 countries, and almost 2,000 
prisoners, 70% of them in China, were executed in 33 countries, including 38 in 
the United States. The organization is unconditionally opposed to the death 
penalty, which it considers "a gross violation of human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 In a country-by-country rundown, Amnesty International found continuation of 
grave human rights violations in China, numerous killings of civilians in 
Turkey by both government forces and Kurdish rebels, and continued use of 
executions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other findings:  
</P>
<P>
 * Haiti -- The military and its armed civilian auxiliaries have carried out 
violations "with complete impunity." A member of FRAPH -- one of the 
auxiliaries -- shot 17-year-old Saurel Guerrier through the heart in January 
"because he was suspected of being connected with a children's home established 
by (deposed President Jean-Bertrand) Aristide." 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International said that more than 200 evident executions by the 
military and its allies between January and May of this year are under 
investigation. It also reported a surge in political rapes of "women believed 
to support President Aristide's return and female relatives and friends of his 
supporters." The victims included pregnant women and children as young as 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico -- After the seizure of several municipalities in Chiapas by the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army in January, the report said, "the Mexican 
army arbitrarily arrested hundreds of Mexican citizens and denied them due 
process. While in custody, they were ill-treated and subjected to various forms 
of torture." 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty International said 400 Mexican troops entered the village of Morelia 
on Jan. 7, forcing everyone into the streets and smashing the heads of some of 
the men. Three villagers were tortured for five hours and then taken away. 
Their bodies were found several weeks later. Fourteen other villagers 
"disappeared" with the troops, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rwanda -- Amnesty International accepted U.N. and press estimates of more 
than 200,000 dead since the massacres erupted in early April. "Some reliable 
estimates put the number as high as half a million," the organization said. "In 
addition to the vast killings, numerous other human rights violations have been 
committed."

U.S. WARNS HAITIAN JUNTA TO LEAVE BY YEAR'S END; CARIBBEAN: KEY ADMINISTRATION 
AIDE SPECIFIES SURPRISINGLY DISTANT DATE, SAYS INVASION IS ONE OPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Groping for a message that would impress Haiti's military leaders without 
frightening Congress and the American public, the Clinton Administration warned 
Wednesday that unless the Caribbean nation's rulers step aside before the 
year's end, the United States will force them out, possibly by an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect the military regime to be there six months from now," said 
William H. Gray III, President Clinton's special envoy to Haiti. If the 
military rulers don't take the hint, he added, "there are other options that 
are open and . . . the military option is just one of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's comments, as he made the rounds of morning television programs, added a 
specific -- and surprisingly distant -- target date for restoring democracy to 
Haiti. A day earlier, Gray had said only that an invasion is not "imminent," 
which he said meant it is not "going to happen in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on ABC television, Gray said the Administration believes economic 
sanctions and diplomatic pressure will force Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian 
strongman, and his associates out of Haiti without U.S. military action. Other 
officials said an invasion could come much sooner than the year's end, if it 
becomes clear that peaceful methods will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Administration announced an abrupt change in its refugee 
policy, effectively denying political asylum in the United States to any 
Haitians who attempt to flee by boat. At the same time, the U.S. government 
vowed to redouble its efforts to topple the oppressive Cedras government to 
allow Haitians to remain at home safely. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Gray sought to balance the message, making it tough enough to 
force Cedras and his backers to take it seriously without setting off invasion 
jitters in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs that he was in trouble on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 News agency reports from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, said the 
military was disdainful of the latest U.S. maneuver. But on Capitol Hill, 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) complained that the Administration was 
preparing "an invasion in search of a rationale." 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know if a political solution is possible in Haiti because the 
Clinton Administration refuses to explore possible solutions," Dole said. "The 
Administration has chosen the unfortunate course of beating the war drums, 
continuing to search for a public reason to invade Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest shift in Administration policy was driven by a surge of Haitian 
refugees hoping to win asylum in the United States. Under the new procedure, 
Haitians picked up at sea will be eligible for havens in Panama and other 
countries but will not be admitted to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials were still arguing with each other -- and with 
the United Nations and refugee-aid groups -- over exactly what the new policy 
means. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether all Haitians who flee the island nation in boats will be 
granted "safe haven" in Panama, or must pass U.S. screening before being 
admitted to the new refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Under international law, a refugee can obtain political asylum only if the 
host country determines that the individual has a "well-founded fear of 
persecution" at home. But the rules on "safe haven" are far looser: Anyone who 
feels threatened enough at home to escape is welcome and there is no provision 
for judging whether the fear is well-founded or not. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the Administration is concerned, however, some form of screening may 
be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a difference of opinion within the Administration and within the 
refugee community on that," a U.S. official said. "We haven't come to closure 
on it. The choices range from (requiring) simply an affirmative 'I want to go 
to Panama,' to having screening where people would have to say at least: 'I 
have some sort of fear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials worry that, without some form of screening, the 
new refuges will quickly be overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said the Coast Guard picked up 
about 2,900 Haitians in 46 boats Tuesday, bringing the total number of Haitians 
picked up since June 15 to almost 14,000. Coast Guard officials said the flow 
on Wednesday was undiminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Robinson, executive director of the organization TransAfrica, which 
has monitored the situation in Haiti, said the Administration has no 
alternative to military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of July, at the current rate of refugee outflows from Haiti, we 
will have reached the 10,000 capacity in Panama," he said.

AMERICAN ALBUM: ALASKANS SPEAK OUT TO SAVE DYING LANGUAGES; AFTER YEARS OF 
SUPPRESSION, MANY HAVE ABANDONED THEIR NATIVE TONGUES. NOW SOME SEEK A RENEWAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Nora Dauenhauer was a young girl nearly half a century ago, she made the 
mistake one day of speaking in her native tongue. As a Tlingit Indian, she had 
been warned by her teachers not to use the language that had served her people 
in southeast Alaska for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 When she slipped, retribution was quick and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "They washed my mouth out with soap," she said as she discussed the social 
attitudes that have doomed her language. 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment from educators and her peers was so severe that, when her own 
children were growing up, she hesitated to speak with them in Tlingit. Many 
years later, she concluded that she had made a mistake, and she dedicated her 
life to teaching others to speak the guttural sounds that make up the Tlingit 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 But she knows now she is probably too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the 20 native languages that once flourished across Alaska are 
viable today. Tlingit is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for a language to survive, it has to remain a spoken phenomenon," 
said Nora's husband, Richard, a linguist. They work together as part of a 
cultural heritage program sponsored by Sealaska Corp., one of 13 regional 
native corporations established by the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to preserve as much of the Tlingit language as possible. They 
are compiling dictionaries and storybooks in Tlingit and other dying languages 
in Alaska, but they know they are fighting almost impossible odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a record of it," said Richard Dauenhauer. "But that doesn't 
keep the language alive." 
</P>
<P>
 What killed it, he said, is three generations of suppression that turned the 
Tlingits against their own language. Schoolchildren who spoke "native," he 
said, were treated as ignorant barbarians. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were backward if you spoke Tlingit," Nora Dauenhauer said. As a result, 
there is not a single woman of childbearing age who speaks Tlingit today, so no 
children are being taught the language in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dauenhauers are struggling to educate public school teachers to encourage 
rather than harass children who want to learn their own language. Tlingit is a 
difficult language, with two dozen to three dozen sounds that do not exist in 
English, and there is no obvious reason why children should try. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no marketplace," Richard Dauenhauer said. To learn it, he said, has 
to be "a spiritual kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nora Dauenhauer said it is more than worth the effort, and she sees some 
encouraging signs in the few children she knows who want to learn it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a trend toward feeling good about yourself just by being Tlingit," 
she said. "Before, we wanted to be just like you. But that doesn't work for us, 
because we are Tlingits." 
</P>
<P>
 When she speaks Tlingit, she said, "I have a feeling that this is me, this is 
what I'm about." 
</P>
<P>
 For coming generations, she says, that experience will almost certainly be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the five Eskimo languages -- and none of the 15 Indian languages 
-- survive in Alaska. Both are forms of Yupik. Siberian Yupik is still spoken 
on St. Lawrence Island, a desolate chunk of rock that is closer to Russia than 
the coast of Alaska and is so remote that the native language has not been 
destroyed by competition with English. And the western part of the state near 
Bethel has enough isolated villages that Yupik has survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Krauss of the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of 
Alaska in Fairbanks has worked for more than three decades to help save the two 
surviving Eskimo languages, but he has encountered the same difficulties cited 
by the Dauenhauers. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy among government agencies, public schools and most missionaries, 
"was to make schoolchildren speak nothing but English and forget their 
barbarous jargon," Krauss said. When he first joined the staff of the 
university in 1960, Krauss took a deep interest in the dying languages and 
vowed to try to turn the tide. 
</P>
<P>
 Krauss and others established an "underground" network to encourage the 
preservation of the languages, translating stories into native tongues and 
sending copies to the Alaskan bush. They emerged from the underground in the 
late 1960s with the passage of the Federal Bilingual Education Act, which 
permitted readings in languages other than English in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, aimed mainly at Latinos, also meant Yupik Eskimos had finally 
achieved the "human right" to use their own language. 
</P>
<P>
 But he fears that may have been too little, and too late. Yupik is fading even 
in the remote villages as more youngsters lean toward English. 
</P>
<P>
 "In three-quarters of the Yupik villages, the children are no longer learning 
their own language," Krauss said, adding that "if Yupik dies out in Alaska, 
it's gone," because it is not spoken anywhere else.

ROSTENKOWSKI STRATEGY IS LIKELY TO DELAY TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense lawyers for Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) told a federal judge 
Wednesday that they will mount a legal attack on his 17-count corruption 
indictment on constitutional grounds, a maneuver likely to delay the start of 
his trial until after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. Atty. Dan K. Webb, the chief defense attorney, said he will file 
legal arguments within 30 days, claiming that the charges violate 
Rostenkowski's protections under the speech and debate clause of the 
Constitution, which shields members of Congress from being prosecuted for 
conduct related to legislative activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Webb and a new co-counsel, R. Kenneth Mundy, insisted that they want 
the case resolved expeditiously, Webb told reporters: "We're not going to be 
stampeded and see a defendant denied his constitutional rights. This issue must 
be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mundy, making his first appearance in the case, is one of the capital's 
best-known lawyers. He helped former Washington Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. 
defeat the most serious charges against him in his 1990 trial on drug and 
perjury charges, and he is renowned for his ability to relate to District of 
Columbia juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he selected Mundy as his Washington-based associate based on "a 
thorough search" for the best trial lawyer available. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson told 
prosecutors and defense lawyers that "we've got to move forward" to get 
Rostenkowski to trial on fraud and embezzlement charges. But she established a 
schedule for legal briefs by both sides that authorities said makes it 
virtually impossible for Rostenkowski to be tried before the November 
elections, when the powerful Chicago lawmaker is seeking a 19th consecutive 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson gave Webb until Aug. 5 to file his first challenge to the indictment, 
after which the government will have until Sept. 2 to respond. Oral arguments 
on the motions are likely to take place in September, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that issue is resolved, Webb said, he will ask the judge to review secret 
grand jury proceedings to determine if they were flawed by presentation of 
evidence he considers to be in violation of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb contends that only Congress -- and not the executive branch -- can 
determine whether Rostenkowski's expenditures were for legislative purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's indictment by a federal grand jury here on May 31 alleged that 
he misappropriated more than $640,000 in federal funds in a series of schemes, 
including the hiring of "ghost employees" who gave him kickbacks, conversion of 
House post office funds to his personal use and the expenditure of official 
funds on gifts for friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski vehemently denied the charges after rejecting a plea agreement 
that his previous lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, sought to negotiate for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has remained a member of Congress, Rostenkowski was forced to step 
down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, one of several panels 
considering the Clinton Administration's health care reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreement of both sides, Rostenkowski was not present at Wednesday's court 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If Johnson should rule against Webb, he would have the right to appeal to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals -- and wait for its ruling -- before any trial.

 A senior Cambodian official and the chief of police in charge of Phnom Penh 
were arrested in connection with a failed coup last weekend. Army 
reinforcements and armored personnel carriers were sent to patrol the city as 
fears of a second coup attempt swept the government. Officials, fearing 
assassination by leaders of the attempted coup still at large, stayed away from 
their offices and homes.

 France said that its creation of a haven for refugees in western Rwanda is a 
success but added that it might have to keep its troops there beyond a 
self-imposed July 31 deadline. France launched its operation in Rwanda with a 
view to turning over the mission to U.N. troops by the end of July. But only a 
very few countries have volunteered to contribute military units, and a lack of 
money and equipment has slowed their arrival.

FAA URGED TO SPEED UP WIND RADAR PLANS; AVIATION: IN WAKE OF CHARLOTTE CRASH, 
AIRPORT OPERATORS SAY NEW TECHNOLOGY IS CRUCIAL. LAND ACQUISITION FIGHTS HAVE 
DELAYED THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As investigators try to determine the cause of Saturday's plane crash in 
Charlotte, N.C., several airport operators called on the Federal Aviation 
Administration to pick up the pace on its plans to install advanced radar 
systems specially designed to detect dangerous wind conditions such as those 
that may have doomed USAir Flight 1016. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte-Douglas International Airport is 38th on the FAA's list of 47 
airfields to receive the system, known as terminal Doppler weather radar, which 
would provide air traffic controllers with a clearer picture of approaching 
thunderstorms and would measure changes in wind velocity. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress authorized the agency to buy and install the $2.5-million units six 
years ago. Ten of them have been built, but none of them are fully on line. 
Charlotte's radar is expected to be in commission in June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA did not include any Southern California airports on the list because 
the area is not as prone to thunderstorms as other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the FAA is responsive, but it takes too long with almost everything 
that it does," said Charlotte airport manager Jerry Orr. "The acquisition 
process is fairly long and drawn out, and this is no exception." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, after analyzing cockpit voice recorders and other data, are 
still trying to piece together what drove the jet, which was trying to abort 
its first landing attempt when it crashed, into the ground. But they point to 
wind shear, sudden downdrafts that can deprive planes of airspeed, as a likely 
culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing weather measurement technology, such as Charlotte's low-level wind 
shear alert system, is badly in need of replacement, several aviation experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic low-level system, composed of six sensors placed around the airport, 
measures wind speed. But it cannot identify areas in the sky where aircraft are 
most likely to encounter microbursts, the most dangerous form of wind shear, 
and does not provide tower controllers with a graphic picture of inclement 
weather systems. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior FAA official said the program to acquire the more sophisticated 
system has been delayed nationwide because the agency has encountered problems 
in buying land needed to install the radar systems, including at the Charlotte 
airport. Each unit is built into a 100-foot tower and sits on an acre of land 
eight to 12 miles from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Landowners have haggled over prices. Environmentalists have objected. Citizens 
have complained about the possible dangers of radar beams in their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Early delays prompted the FAA to roll back the deadline for installing the new 
system nationwide to mid-1996. It originally had been slated for completion 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesmen refused to comment on whether Saturday's crash would accelerate 
installation of the radar systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has already canceled or scaled back several components of its 
$7-billion program to modernize the nation's air traffic control system, 
including the Advanced Automation System, a computer network designed to help 
control towers keep better track of aircraft. But the $373-million Doppler 
radar system has not run into obstacles so far. Congress awarded the agency $25 
million for the units in this year's budget, an increase over the $5.8 million 
appropriated last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Several airport operators said that the disaster in Charlotte highlights the 
need to keep up with technological advancements. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the technology emerges, it ought to be pursued," said Tom Kinton, director 
of aviation for Boston's Logan Airport. "It's something we would definitely 
push for and have pushed for."

TWIN INFANTS ALLEGEDLY KIDNAPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Two 8-month-old babies were allegedly abducted Wednesday night during a 
carjacking in Downtown Los Angeles after their father -- a San Jose man on his 
way to Texas -- pulled over to put some packages into the trunk of his vehicle, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The twin infants -- a boy and a girl -- were apparently kidnaped about 6:30 
p.m. near Olive Street and Washington Boulevard, at the southern end of 
Downtown, said Officer Don Cox of the Los Angeles Police Department. The 
carjackers, Cox said, pulled a gun on the father, demanded the keys to his 
black 1990 Ford Mustang and told him to "hand it over or we will kill the 
babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said the father, Alexander Maldini -- who told police he was a widower 
whose wife died in childbirth -- was heading home from San Jose with his 
children, Sarah and Uzziel, strapped into their car seats when they pulled off 
the freeway at the Grand Avenue off-ramp to get gas. 
</P>
<P>
 After Maldini filled the tank, Cox said, he told police he became confused and 
lost his way back to the freeway. Cox said the father pulled over in front of a 
McDonald's restaurant near Olive and Washington and began transferring some 
packages from the interior of the car to the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maldini stood behind the car with its open trunk, two men pulled up in a 
1985-89 red Honda Civic with primer on the fender and hood, the father told 
police. He said that when he resisted, the gunmen threatened to hurt the 
children so he handed over the keys, Cox related. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men then sped off in the Honda while the other fled with the 
infants in Maldini's car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Clay Farrell of the Newton Division said the father's story -- 
related to them in a "very calm, very passive" manner -- was difficult to 
corroborate. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, Maldini could not recall his full license plate number 
and could not say whether the plates on the Mustang were from California or 
Texas. Also, Farrell said, the father could not offer proof of his identity 
because, he said, the carjackers had stolen his wallet. Authorities also could 
not immediately reach relatives whose names Maldini gave them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, as night fell, police launched a manhunt for the carjackers, 
described as Latino men in their late 20s, Cox said. Both wore white T-shirts, 
he added, and one wore black jeans while the other wore blue jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The babies were described as having light brown hair and were wearing white 
pajamas. Sarah was wearing earrings; Uzziel has a half-inch birthmark on his 
left knee, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldini's car, a Mustang 5.0, has tinted windows, a World Cup sticker on the 
right rear bumper and a partial plate number of 1PVM, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox speculated that the carjackers may be thinking: " 'I'm taking this car -- 
do I want to get stuck with two 8-month-old kids?' Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you have to reason that they might drop them off somewhere."

SILICONE RAISES SUMO HOPEFUL TO NEW HEIGHTS

 To gain the minimum height requirement to be a sumo wrestler, a Japanese 
teen-ager had 6 inches of silicone implanted under his scalp. Takeji Harada, 
16, who failed six previous eligibility tests, finally made it to 5 feet 8 
inches in June, thanks to the huge bulge on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan Sumo Assn. said Wednesday that, because of health fears, it will no 
longer accept aspiring wrestlers who artificially boost their height with 
silicone implants.

GAY FILM FEST DIRECTOR MOVING ON; MOVIES: AFTER PRESENTING MORE THAN 1,400 
FILMS AND VIDEOS TO AN AUDIENCE OF MORE THAN 210,000, LARRY HORNE LOOKS BACK ON 
12 YEARS WITH THE ANNUAL EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the 12th edition of the Los Angeles International Gay & Lesbian Film & 
Video Festival opens tonight at the Directors Guild, its founder-director Larry 
Horne will be stepping down to become a producer.  
</P>
<P>
 At 37, Horne can look back at having presented more than 1,400 films and 
videos to an audience of more than 210,000 during the festival's 12-year 
history. In 1982, there were 29 films presented from seven countries; this 
year, there will be 242 offerings from 29 countries. The box-office take has 
grown from $6,780 to last year's $105,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been personally a highly gratifying activity -- my passion," said Horne 
in an interview at his Beverly Boulevard office last week. "My driving force 
has been in having an impact upon people's lives, and I've been almost maniacal 
about it. But now I'm ready to move on, to try for even more access on a 
different level." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan Rumpf, of Arts Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides technical 
assistance to nonprofit arts organizations, will succeed Horne on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Horne will be able to devote all his energies to launching, with a group 
of friends, Out Entertainment Group, an independent production and distribution 
company that will develop gay- and lesbian-themed material for video and cable 
as well as the big screen. It has already optioned for filming James Baker's 
"Tim and Pete," which Horne enthusiastically describes as "a gay 'Thelma & 
Louise' -- smart, sassy and mid-'90s." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Horne said he has witnessed a tremendous change in attitude over the years 
toward the festival, both on the part of distributors and the public. "I went 
through a long period of constantly defining what we were, a festival featuring 
mainly independent productions and foreign films," he said. "We were such an 
unknown quantity, people would actually ask if a gay and lesbian film festival 
was devoted to pornography!" 
</P>
<P>
 Horne used to complain loudly about the difficulty of getting distributors to 
contribute gay- and lesbian-themed products for the festival. But now, he said, 
"films have been easier to get in the last couple of years." Four or five years 
ago, when the festival requested "Waiting for the Moon," the Gertrude 
Stein-Alice B. Toklas movie, Horne says, "we got an outright no" from the 
film's distributor, Skouras Pictures. "We didn't get 'My Own Private Idaho' or 
'The Crying Game,' but I got pretty far with 'Philadelphia,' (however) it went 
to the APLA for a benefit premiere. We now get nicer 'no's,' not just bull."  
</P>
<P>
 There could scarcely be a better indication of the festival's coming of age 
than its landing of this year's Cannes Film Festival sensation from Australia, 
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," a giddy, hilarious yet 
poignant comedy about the experiences of three drag performers traveling across 
Australia's rugged outback in a gaudily decorated bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The film has a real "La Cage aux Folles" crossover potential, and according to 
Horne was "easy to get." Gramercy, the film's distributor, told Horne "it 
wanted it in the festival." 
</P>
<P>
 "Once distributors feared that their gay-themed films would be pigeonholed by 
being in the festival, but now some of our films, the non-threatening ones, 
attract some straights," Horne said. "There's no way of measuring this, but I 
do know last year straights came to see 'Grief' and 'The Living End,' 
especially." 
</P>
<P>
 Horne was a UCLA graduate student in film history when he and a classmate, 
John Ramirez, now a professor of film at Cal State Los Angeles, returned from 
San Francisco's 1981 gay and lesbian festival, thinking it was time L.A. had 
its own event. 
</P>
<P>
 With another classmate, Claire Aguilar, now KCET's manager of broadcast 
programming, they approached UCLA Film and Television Archive director Robert 
Rosen and head film programmer Geoffrey Gilmore, who offered immediate support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The late Gary Essert, co-founder of Filmex and later the American 
Cinematheque, lent crucial help, and the late Vito Russo, gay activist and 
pioneering historian on the representation of gays and lesbians in films, 
appeared at the first festival and provided early moral support.  
</P>
<P>
 In its initial three years the festival was held at UCLA, moving on to the 
Four Star Theater in 1985 and finally to the Directors Guild in 1988. "We made 
a lot of noise to have Christopher Street West -- which presents the Gay Pride 
Parade and Festival every year -- support us, and a group we formed in 1985 
under their auspices got almost $20,000," Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to do it again because we broke even instead of making a 
profit. So in 1986 we formed a nonprofit organization, Bob Rosen signed on to 
the board and lined up other directors for us." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1989, Horne -- who had worked at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, at 
KCET (as a special programs director) and at the AFI's Preservation Center -- 
was able to work full time for the festival. Horne said he was grateful to Four 
Star proprietor Louis Federici for his modest rental fees but feels the 
festival didn't come into its own until ending up at the Directors Guild. "It 
was in 1988 that the festival really took off," Horne said. "We had a larger 
impact, bigger audiences and growing awareness of our existence. People feel 
secure in coming to the DGA and more than ever people are interested in 
discovering what gay culture is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 * The 12th annual Los Angeles International Gay & Lesbian Film & Video 
Festival continues at the Directors Guild of America, 7920 Sunset Blvd., 
Hollywood, through July 17. Information: (213) 466-1767.

DRAI'S RESTAURANT: PARLEZ-VOUS LE SHOW BIZ?; INDUSTRY: HOLLYWOOD POWERBROKERS 
FLOCK TO VICTOR DRAI'S WEST HOLLYWOOD RESTAURANT. BUT IS IT FOR THE FORMER 
PRODUCER'S SOUTHERN FRANCE-STYLE FOOD? 
</P>

<P>
 "Do you know who I am?" asks Victor Drai in his signature French accent as he 
pulls up a chair at his trendy West Hollywood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the engaging owner of Drai's is no stranger to controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first opened the doors last summer, he angered some of Hollywood's 
powerbrokers by turning them away from his packed restaurant if they called 
late expecting reservations. He showed the door to former Spago maitre d' 
Bernard Erpicum after accusing him of table-hopping with customers and asking 
them to invest in a new restaurant. He refused a table to the publisher of a 
Beverly Hills weekly and later found Drai's listed as "out" in the 
publication's "In and Out" column. 
</P>
<P>
 Drai, who for years has forged key relationships in Hollywood both as a movie 
producer ("The Woman in Red," "Weekend at Bernies") and as an escort of 
beautiful actresses, is now in a role some believe he was destined to play. The 
tall, bespectacled Parisian runs Drai's on North La Cienega Boulevard -- the 
site of the once popular L'Ermitage restaurant -- which has now become one of 
the town's hot dining spots. Like Monday night at Mortons, Friday lunch at 
Drai's attracts a crowd of high-powered studio executives, agents and 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular patrons include Barbra Streisand, Denzel Washington, Quincy Jones and 
Paramount Pictures chief Sherry Lansing. ICM's powerful agent Ed Limato has a 
regular table tucked in a sun-drenched corner. "The reason I give him that 
table," Drai confides, "is because he is a smoker and I have to put him next to 
a window." 
</P>
<P>
 Limato is one of Drai's 30 investors, who also include producers Freddie 
Fields (former head of MGM) and David Begelman (one-time Columbia Pictures 
topper), as well as recently departed CBS network chief Jeff Sagansky and 
Robert Shapiro, the high-profile attorney defending O. J. Simpson on murder 
charges.

<P>
 Fields, who regularly dines at the restaurant with his business associates, 
says one of Drai's main attractions to Hollywood types is they could dine with 
some privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they like," explained the producer. "No one is going to walk up 
and ask for their autograph." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Wednesday night, actor Kirk Douglas and motion picture association 
czar Jack Valenti and their party are sitting at one table, while another 
former MGM studio boss, Alan Ladd Jr., is cater-corner with his party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try the vegetarian ravioli," Valenti tells a visitor, quipping. "It is as if 
you are in Rome!" 
</P>
<P>
 The cuisine at Drai's, however, is that of Southern France. Nothing laden with 
heavy sauces and butter. "When you are French, you never eat sauces all day 
long," Drai observes. "You can't do it!" 
</P>
<P>
 While black-vested waiters lend stateliness to the ambience, Drai's is not a 
restaurant where formalities are always observed. One recent Friday afternoon, 
as his actress wife, Loryn Locklin, sat at a table with a stroller by her side, 
Drai greeted guests while proudly holding his 8-month-old son, Dustin George. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the baby, Drai said, that prompted him to get into the restaurant 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I was in the movie business," explained Drai, who even after two decades 
in America still speaks with a distinct accent and still struggles with his 
English. "Then, my wife got pregnant and I wanted to go away (to make a movie). 
I wait 46 years to have a baby. I decided not to go away. I woke up one morning 
and I said, 'I want to open a restaurant.' And my wife says, 'What do you mean 
you want to open a restaurant?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing he needed some financial partners to launch his new venture, Drai 
thumbed through his Rolodex and within 90 minutes had several commitments in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "And four months later, we opened," said Drai, noting that "we were very 
quickly packed. I turned down hundreds of people and the biggest people in this 
business. They were calling me at home. I said, 'You call like anybody else and 
make a reservation.' And they were never used to that in this town. Especially 
what they call the royalty in this town. . . . They didn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to those closest to him, Drai was not always that cocky, but in fact 
was shy and somewhat intimidated by the town when he arrived speaking little 
English in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 His entree into Hollywood was actress Jacqueline Bisset, whom he dated for 
seven years beginning in the mid-'70s. "I knew the whole (film) industry 
through her," Drai said. "So, when we (broke) up, I decided to go into the 
movie business."  
</P>
<P>
 Drai was often seen at night spots around town with beautiful stars, but 
insists he was "not like the typical gigolo" as some assumed him to be in those 
days. "I didn't look that good," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 He later married and divorced actress Kelly LeBrock. Seven years ago he met 
his current wife at a Valentine's party. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Locklin applied her creative talents to help decorate Drai's, which 
is a series of three main dining rooms with a front lounge and adjoining 
enclosed garden whose walls are painted with tropical palms and leopards. The 
color scheme is soft gold and rich woods. French impressionist reproductions 
and some modern originals adorn the walls. Drai jokes that if he could afford 
real French impressionists, he wouldn't be in the restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
 Locklin said she chose kentia palms to decorate the restaurant because 
"they're very sexy." Expressing herself by slowly waving her hands, she adds, 
"The whole shape, the movement, they make kind of a warm feeling. Food and sex 
are very closely related." 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . She's from the Valley," Drai interjects with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to becoming a restaurateur, Drai worked in real estate, refurbishing 
"fixer-uppers" in Bel-Air and Beverly Hills and selling multimillion-dollar 
properties. He saw his fortunes rise and fall with the volatile Southern 
California real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 As for running one of Hollywood's hottest restaurants today, the easygoing 
Drai observes: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to Hollywood, there were three restaurants and that was it. 
People were making parties at their own houses, but not anymore. Now, you have 
more restaurants, more places to go. It's easy. They come. They eat. They go 
home."

GETTY HIRES ARCHITECTS FOR RENOVATION OF MALIBU FACILITY; ART: A BOSTON-BASED 
FIRM WILL OVERSEE THE CONVERSION OF THE 20-YEAR-OLD ROMAN-STYLE VILLA INTO A 
MUSEUM AND STUDY CENTER FOR CLASSICAL ANTIQUITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The J. Paul Getty Trust has hired the Boston-based firm of Machado and 
Silvetti Associates Inc. as master planners for the renovation of the 
Roman-style villa in Malibu that has housed the Getty Museum since 1974. The 
project will convert the facility into a museum and study center for classical 
antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will begin in 1997, after the opening of the Getty Center, a 
sprawling complex that is currently rising on a Brentwood hilltop overlooking 
the San Diego Freeway. The center will include a new museum for all of the 
Getty's collections except Greek and Roman antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 A mission statement for the villa calls for a building and environment that 
will "promote a broader understanding of, and critical appreciation for, 
classical antiquity and other cultures in relation to it." Devoting the Malibu 
villa to antiquities will allow the museum to display much more than the 10% of 
its ancient treasures that can be accommodated under current conditions, press 
officer Lori Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The renovated villa will be more than a public museum, according to Getty 
Trust President Harold M. Williams. It will also serve as a site where the 
trust's other programs can pool their talents and work on projects related to 
antiquity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado and Silvetti was selected from a group of 20 companies that expressed 
interest in the project. A search committee, consisting of Getty officials and 
prominent architectural figures, narrowed the field to six finalists who were 
asked to develop sketchbooks of their ideas for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti are both 52-year-old natives of Argentina 
who teach at Harvard University Graduate School of Design. They did graduate 
studies at UC Berkeley and have practiced architecture and urban design in the 
United States for the past 20 years. Their current projects include a 
monumental gateway on the Hudson River at New York's Battery Park and a master 
plan for Princeton University's campus.

A MOST REVEALING DAVID BYRNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What happens when rock's sartorial Renaissance man gets buck naked? 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there's a tremendous feeling of newfound freedom, as David Byrne 
demonstrated Tuesday at the Coach House. Long rock's disinterested observer in 
the button-down collar, Byrne achieved that feeling several times in his new 
guise as an artist working in the emotionally exposed first person. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there also were a number of times when he came across like nothing so 
much as a man in search of a bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the freed-up man won out in Byrne's nearly two-hour set, part of a 
Southland swing that was scheduled to play the Wilshire Ebell Theatre on 
Wednesday and that brings him back to the Coach House for a sold-out show on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Having jettisoned the Latin big bands that laid the foundation for his 
previous two solo albums, Byrne fronted a quartet that was as forceful as you'd 
expect a rock foursome to be. Yet the band -- drummer Todd Turkisher, bassist 
Paul Socolow and Mauro Refosco on mallet instruments and percussion -- was 
every bit as versatile as you'd expect of one backing the former Talking Heads 
front man, whose career has wended its way from nerdy new wave to muscular funk 
to Afro-pop to salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 He played all but two of the dozen songs off his new "David Byrne" album, 
songs in which he strives to achieve closer contact with the listener through 
lyrics largely stripped of the wry detachment that define his earlier work. 
(One he skipped, ironically, was the album-closing "Buck Naked.") But simply 
being closer isn't always better. 
</P>
<P>
 Naked can mean exposed, and in many instances Byrne reveals himself with 
almost painful honesty, as he did when he sang: "I need someone to cover me 
with kisses when I'm alone and scared" in "Lilies of the Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Naked can also mean just plain bare, and that's how some of the album's 
truisms sound, like this one from "Back in the Box": "The sun shines on the 
evil / The sun shines on the good / It doesn't favor righteousness / Although 
you wish it would." 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrical straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but 
it's not always the most interesting route. It's the difference between Randy 
Newman saying straight out: "Wasn't slavery a horrible injustice?" versus 
capturing a slave trader's mind-set in "Sail Away" when he wrote "Climb aboard, 
little wog / Sail away with me." 
</P>
<P>
 As Byrne quite honestly fessed up in "Angels" -- played in the logical spot, 
right after its rhythmic and structural twin, "Once in a Lifetime" -- "I can 
barely touch my own self / How could I touch someone else?" At least he 
realizes he's still a considerable distance from the kind of total soul-baring 
of John Lennon's first two post-Beatles albums, Neil Young's "Tonight's the 
Night" or Lou Reed's "Magic + Loss." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What helped Byrne most in concert were the moments when he expanded upon the 
album's arrangements and transcended the carefully thought-out quality that 
still pervades his music. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Crash," he engaged in some Young-like blasts from his electric guitar 
that gave wordless voice to the feelings of pain and powerlessness in the face 
of death referred to in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed to carry over when he dipped into the Talking Heads songbook; it 
was with renewed vigor that he tackled such cornerstone numbers as "Psycho 
Killer," "Once in a Lifetime," "Don't Worry About the Government" and an 
especially cathartic show-closing rendition of "Life During Wartime." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter built to a staggering climax, striking a chord of musical, physical 
and spiritual abandon that once would have seemed light years beyond Byrne's 
artfully self-conscious grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Juxtaposed with Byrne's new in-the-altogether approach, the Heads material 
proved that even a nouveau nudist can enjoy throwing on a favorite old suit 
once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Byrne plays Friday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Sold out. (714) 496-8930.

THEATER REVIEW; ROMANCE, REASON LOCK HORNS IN DELIGHTFUL 'FOLLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1944, near the end of World War II, America was looking forward to building 
a brave new world. Few people noticed that a good chunk of the tacky old one 
wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two worlds are the roots of Lanford Wilson's "Talley's Folly," at the 
Vanguard Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Friedman, a Jewish accountant from St. Louis, wants to be part of that 
new world and take with him the love of his life, Sally Talley. He was on 
vacation the previous year when he met and dated Sally. She admits she went 
along because he was "exotic." When Matt returns a year later, on the Fourth of 
July, he finds himself fighting her family's prejudice, dodging her brother's 
shotgun and battling Sally's indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt is not a man to take no for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, he promises the audience that he will accomplish his purpose 
in 97 minutes, beginning the moment Sally wanders down to the ornate Victorian 
gingerbread boathouse her grandfather built, dubbed by town folk as "Talley's 
Folly." 
</P>
<P>
 When she shows up, their conversation turns into an elaborate chess game, as 
ornate and riddled with linguistic gingerbread as the Folly itself. It is 
funny, warm, sparkling with verbal fireworks as bright as those about to go off 
across the lake, poetic in its insights into the underpinnings of human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sally is as definite in her refusal to marry Matt as he is in their union's 
inevitability. Jill Cary Martin's Sally is strong, from the settler stock that 
built a civilization on the Western prairies. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's proud, in spite of the fact that her inability to bear children 
destroyed her engagement to the bubba scion of the town's other important 
family. Martin displays all this, along with a subtle touch of the Dixie doxy 
she might become if she doesn't accept Matt. It's an incisive and affectionate 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the play always belongs to Matt, with his naive approach to romance, his 
wise sense of purpose and an understanding of the human comedy that balances 
his dark memories of a childhood and youth spent dodging the Fascist terror all 
across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 And this production belongs to Michael Keith Allen's portrait of Matt, alive 
and vital, and fully realized in every detail, from his nervous habit of 
hitching up his suspendered pants to his feigned clumsiness, from his 
indestructible optimism to his puppy-like eagerness, all encompassed by immense 
charm for which Sally's denials are no match. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Ketter's boathouse setting fills the Vanguard's limited space but looks 
grander than it is, and it is beautifully lit in Adrian Michael Dickey's 
design. The actors move about it as though it really was at lake shore, and 
imagination fills in the hillside leading up to the Tally manor house and the 
smell of summer grass on a midsummer evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Gunkel's staging is as varied and interesting as the tones of the 
performances, and his direction of the emotional slips and slides between this 
Midwestern Kate and her funny, exotic Petruchio is flawless. 
</P>
<P>

SERIAL ACTOR; AFTER MULTIPLE PRODUCTIONS OF 'SLEUTH,' ROBERT MANDAN'S CAREER IS 
PRACTICALLY A CRIME WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor Robert Mandan is on his way to putting a lock on the role of Andrew Wyke 
in Anthony Shaffer's unique thriller "Sleuth." At least in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandan opens in his third production of the play tonight in Fullerton and will 
be repeating the performance this fall in Lancaster, at Pepperdine University, 
in Palos Verdes and in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then," says Mandan, "there's a production down near San Diego." Speaking 
of his previous outings in the part, he laughs and adds, "I thought that would 
be the end of it; then this production came up. It may never end. I think I 
have an annuity." 
</P>
<P>
 In this Fullerton Civic Light Opera outdoor staging for the Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center's Theatre on the Green series, Mandan is appearing as the 
cuckolded Wyke opposite Randy Gianetti as the encroaching lover Milo Timdle. 
The play is not so much a whodunit as it is a which-one- will- do-it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer has created what may be the ultimate theatrical puzzle in "Sleuth," as 
the two men swirl around each other in a zany, comic dance of death. They are 
roles an actor can sink his teeth into. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the runs of the play Mandan has been in and is scheduled for are fairly 
short, but put together they might approach his four-year run as Chester Tate 
in television's "Soap" or his 15-month stint as the producer in the Broadway 
production of "Applause" with Lauren Bacall in 1970.  
</P>
<P>
 Mandan isn't, however, worried about that actor's bane: getting stale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of keeping it fresh," he said. "It's a matter of keeping it 
vital. Shows don't usually get stale for an actor until after six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the joy of "Sleuth" is the continuous piling up of surprises for the 
characters, and the audience, as the action flies past. Keeping the sense of 
surprise vital isn't a problem for Mandan either. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've been really well-trained as an actor, familiarity allows you to be 
even more surprised, because you can stay in the moment, and you're not having 
to think ahead about what's coming next," he said. "It's part of an actor's 
training to be able to play something as though it's happening for the first 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 His longest run was in "Applause." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you really have to look for things to make it fresh. But you have to be 
careful. You can bring new things to the role, and then you distort the role 
beyond recognition and beyond its purpose in the play. You can get pretty 
burned out by that time, and you need to get away and take a fresh look at 
things -- a new start." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a while before Andrew Wyke will require freshening up for Mandan. 
The play's frantic pace doesn't leave time for burnout. And this time he's 
playing against a new actor -- Gianetti -- and working with a new director, 
James Luisi. 
</P>
<P>
 Luisi, who is familiar to television viewers as Lt. Chapman in TV's "The 
Rockford Files," is directing "Sleuth" for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great challenge," Luisi said, "to keep it moving and keep it 
interesting, and keep the audience in their seats." 
</P>
<P>
 Luisi said it's no problem making it all seem like new. Besides the new 
co-star, new director and new set, he said, "There's always a new twist coming 
up in the staging. This production will have a completely different shape." 
</P>
<P>
 As an actor, Luisi said, he sees things differently from some directors, 
because he wants to be up there himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage for Luisi as "Sleuth" director is that he has a Lt. Chapman, 
detective-type mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love detective novels. I love to solve things," he said. "That's why this 
is a challenge, to come up with things I've read or seen and incorporate them 
into this production. Yeah, I'm having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton Civic Light Opera's production of "Sleuth" opens today at the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center, 1201 W. Malvern Ave., Fullerton. Performances 
continue through July 30 on Tuesdays (show only) and Wednesdays through Sundays 
(includes catered dinner at 7 p.m.). Curtain: 8:15 p.m. $21 to $31. (714)

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NO PUNS? NO GIMMICKS? WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just who does Emmylou Harris think she's fooling claiming to be a country 
singer? 
</P>
<P>
 Does she sing cloying tunes in which the hooks are all based on puns or 
cliches? Does she take every opportunity to flaunt her country-ness, like 
Travis "I drive a pickup truck, I really do!" Tritt? Does she take pains to 
deliver the same numbing medley-o'-hits-with-canned-patter show after show? 
</P>
<P>
 No, no and no. Instead, Harris seems to think she can keep coasting by on 
talent and integrity. Country radio has finally gotten wise to Harris: Her 
music is nowhere to be found on the airwaves or on the charts. But the audience 
at the late show Tuesday at the Crazy Horse Steak House still treated Harris 
and her Nash Ramblers band as if they were the very heart of country music. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Harris' voice conveyed every nuance of ache or joy the songs 
potentially held. Harris doesn't write much, though the splendid, revealing 
"Sweetheart of the Rodeo" she performed from her autobiographical 1985 "The 
Ballad of Sally Rose" suggested she certainly should. Most often she sings the 
words of others, and a song couldn't ask for a better friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris rarely plays what one might expect, drawing neither from her hits nor 
her most recent work overmuch. Instead, Tuesday's show was predictable only in 
its unpredictability, as she explored some of the byways of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 There's always some disappointment in not hearing some of the tunes she 
inhabits so definitively -- such as Rodney Crowell's "I Don't Have to Crawl" or 
her rendition of Eddy Arnold's "You Don't Know Me" from last year's "Cowgirl's 
Prayer" album -- but that's more than compensated by the lesser-known gems 
brought to light. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's show opened with a propulsive version of "Mystery Train," in which 
Dobro player Al Perkins' sliding guitar lines stretched out like a railroad 
track for Harris' driving vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 She followed with Steve Earle's "Guitar Town" and Delbert McClinton's "Two 
More Bottles of Wine," the latter song, she pointed out, promoting a curative 
she hasn't had much direct experience with. She and the band, Harris noted, had 
spent their wild Fourth of July watching the Dodgers lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago Harris put her acclaimed, long-running Hot Band (alumni include 
Ricky Skaggs, Crowell, Vince Gill, James Burton and Albert Lee) out to pasture. 
She'd been having throat problems that she'd attributed in part to having to 
sing over an electric band, and opted to go acoustic.  
</P>
<P>
 The band she assembled in its place is a marvel, featuring Perkins (who 
doubles on banjo), former New Grass Revival mainstay Sam Bush on mandolin and 
fiddle, drummer Larry Atamanuik, bassist Mark Winchester and 25-year-old Jon 
Randall Stewart on guitar and high vocal harmonies (Harris' bands are still a 
springboard for talent: Stewart's debut solo album for RCA comes out in 
August). 
</P>
<P>
 One might have thought that Harris, by going acoustic, would be limiting the 
range of her material. Rather, on such numbers as Crowell's "I Ain't Living 
Long Like This," the band showed it could rock furiously, while on softer 
numbers such as "Pancho and Lefty," "Beneath Still Waters" and the "gospel 
waltz" "Green Pastures," the group left an uncluttered landscape for Harris' 
vocals to soar over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As much evident pleasure as Harris puts into her singing, she seemed happiest 
Tuesday when she sat partially obscured on the drum riser watching her band 
members stretch out on the instrumental "Lee Highway," in which they passed off 
solos that flew fast, inventive and funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Every chance allowed, Harris and the band cut up as if they were out for 
recess. But then they were able to turn around and do a chilling rendition of 
David Olney's "Jerusalem Tomorrow." Harris' typically brook-pure voice took on 
a serpentine tone as she recited the tale of a huckster faith healer who runs 
into the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her heart-rending vocal ache was back in place for Lucinda Williams' "Crescent 
City," a song that never defines the singer's sad situation but, instead, 
outlines it through yearning for the forgiving, good times of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 On songs such as that and her hair-raising version of Buck Owens' "Together 
Again" (quite possibly the saddest-sounding happy song ever composed), Harris' 
voice expresses the intensity of human emotion, finding that solitary place 
where feelings lie unadorned. And you know that can't be country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emmylou Harris & the Nash Ramblers return on Monday to the Crazy Horse Steak 
House, 1580 Brookhollow Drive, Santa Ana. Limited seating remains for both the 
7 and 10 p.m. shows. $33.50. (714) 549-1512.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; DISCOUNT STORE ACCEPTS $450,000 TO RELOCATE

 A downtown retailer has agreed to accept $450,000 from the Redevelopment 
Agency to vacate its Pine Avenue store to make room for kitchenware sellers 
Crate and Barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based 99 Only Stores agreed to move its Denco outlet at 240 Pine 
Ave., said Susan Shick, the city's community development director. The 
agreement is key to downtown revitalization because Crate and Barrel will lure 
other retailers as well as customers, Shick said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gold, real estate director for 99 Only Stores, said his company has not 
selected a new Denco location. 
</P>
<P>
 Crate and Barrel, which is based in Chicago, will begin construction on its 
9,500-square-foot store July 18. It is expected to open Oct. 1. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; JUDGE RULES COUNCIL VIOLATED BROWN ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that five members of the City Council 
violated the state's open meeting law last summer when they each signed a 
letter opposing a homeless shelter without discussing it in public. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, also known as the Brown Act, forbids a majority of an elected 
governing body to meet or take action without first notifying the public. Five 
of the city's nine council members -- Evan Anderson Braude, Les Robbins, Doris 
Topsy-Elvord, Ray Grabinski and Jeffrey A. Kellogg -- violated the law when 
they signed a letter to federal officials that was never discussed in an open 
meeting, Superior Court Judge Dion Morrow decided last week. 
</P>
<P>
 City Attorney John R. Calhoun said he disagrees with the court's decision, but 
does not know if the city will appeal. He plans to discuss the ruling with 
council members within the next few weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter that sparked the case was sent to the federal Department of Health 
and Human Services. In it, council members expressed their opposition to a 
proposal to turn the Navy's Cabrillo Housing development into transitional 
houses for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was prepared by one of Braude's aides and circulated to other 
council members for support and signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the July 27, 1993, letter was sent, a coalition of homeless people 
and advocates, the Homeless Organizing Committee, discovered its existence and 
complained that they should have had an opportunity to comment. In October a 
suit was filed by the Legal Aid Foundation of Long Beach on behalf of the 
homeless committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Morrow decided in favor of the homeless committee, but has yet to render 
a judgment against the city. Dennis Rockway, an attorney with Legal Aid, said 
his organization will ask for an injunction directing the City Council never to 
violate the Brown Act. Rockway also will ask the city to pay all legal fees 
associated with the case. Those fees have not yet been tabulated, but will 
"probably be in the thousands of dollars," Rockway said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is absurd," Calhoun said. "Take this to its logical 
conclusion and you'll see that council members couldn't even sign a birthday 
card without breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockway, however, lauded the court's decision, saying the written opinion of 
five council members carries weight and should have been discussed in an open 
meeting. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; NEW CITY BUDGET ADDS 38 POLICE OFFICERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a campaign season in which most local politicians called for more 
police, the City Council came through with funding in the new city budget to 
hire 38 additional officers and 26 civilian staffers in the police department 
in the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved a $287.3-million spending plan that provides 
more money for the Police and Fire departments, but reduces spending in most of 
the city's other departments.The general fund budget is lower than the 
$294.8-million budget for the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parks, Recreation and Marine Department faces the largest cut: $1.8 
million. The city also plans to save money by closing the main library on 
Sundays throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget includes increases in various utility rates that will cost the 
average household $3.12 a month. EMILY ADAMS

COUNCIL ACTS TO IMPROVE VOTE COUNTS; ELECTIONS: SOME PROCEDURAL CHANGES ARE 
BEING WEIGHED IN THE WAKE OF A RECOUNT THAT REVERSED THE OUTCOME OF A LONG 
BEACH RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Long Beach City Council is taking steps to improve ballot counting in city 
elections in the wake of a controversial council race in which the initial 
outcome was reversed after the city clerk's office discovered several uncounted 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council directed its legislative committee to consider several 
possible improvements, such as allowing the clerk's office more time to count 
absentee votes and examine questionable ballots. Some council members also 
suggested that automatic recounts be granted in close races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, elections are not perfect," said Councilman Thomas J. Clark, who 
introduced the measure. "But we need to do everything we can to make them 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also declared contractor Mike Donelon a winner by two votes over 
Tonia Reyes Uranga, who had held a 29-vote lead on election night June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote counting for the District 7 council seat was widely criticized by 
civic leaders and some council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, the former president of the Long Beach Children's Museum, saw her 
election night lead shrink after some absentee ballots were added. Donelon then 
called for a recount, and emerged with a one-vote lead after the clerk's office 
counted several ballots that had been left out of the original tally.  
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge then blocked the council from certifying the results of 
the recount until Uranga had a chance to review several other ballots that had 
been rejected for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the rejected ballots, officials decided Friday that eight of 
them also should have been counted. Donelon gained an extra vote when those 
ballots were included, outpolling Uranga, 2,936 to 2,934. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga has said she may challenge the results in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're reviewing the materials now, making sure all the votes match up with 
registered voters," she said. "Once that's done, I'll decide how to proceed." 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga's attorney, Fredric D. Woocher, said he may ask a judge to invalidate 
the seven ballots that were added during the recount. Donelon received six of 
those votes, giving him a one-vote lead. The ballots were added to the vote 
after the City Council had initially declared Uranga the winner.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely potential for a challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said vote tampering would have been impossible because the ballot 
boxes were sealed on election night and placed in a locked storage room. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's council meeting, City Clerk Shelba Powell called the error "a 
very unfortunate event that damaged the reputation of our department and caused 
unnecessary stress to the candidates." She added: "I am responsible for the 
situation because I insisted the absentee ballots be counted on election 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County elections, Powell said, many absentee ballots are not 
counted until the day after the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that the council's legislative committee consider delaying the 
deadline for certifying elections to allow her staff more time to review 
questionable and absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell also suggested that the examination of rejected provisional ballots 
should be part of any future recount. Donelon had not asked that the rejected 
ballots be checked, so Uranga was forced to obtain a court order to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more time to audit . . . for controls, checks and balances," Powell 
said. "I want to ensure the public that the integrity of our election process 
is intact." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also could order an automatic recount when an election is close, 
said Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal said he was concerned that Donelon had to pay more than $3,000 for 
the recount. Although Donelon's money was refunded after he was found to have 
won, Lowenthal said that not all candidates might have the funds to spend up 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials, the election night error probably occurred around 2 
a.m. when a clerk was feeding the final absentee ballots into a machine. The 
clerk apparently handed some ballots to another clerk to expedite the counting, 
and in the switch, a short stack of ballots was apparently not fed into the 
machine, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the next station, who matched the total votes cast with the total 
counted, did not catch the mistake.

LONG BEACH JAZZ CLUB UP FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly eight years of hosting jazz greats such as Les McCann, Art Blakey 
and the Jazz Messengers, Birdland West owner Al Williams is putting his Long 
Beach nightclub up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Williams filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal 
Bankruptcy Act to reorganize his debt. Then last month, Williams said, he 
decided to sell the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said his club, like many local businesses, is a victim of a bad 
economy. Recently, ticket sales have dropped and the cost of booking well-known 
bands has risen. Despite the drop in sales, Williams said he has declined to 
lower ticket prices, which average about $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see enough people to hire the acts I wanted to hire," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a 51-year-old drummer, said he is also finding the task of running 
the club too demanding. He said he wants to focus on playing with his own band, 
the Jazz Society, once the sale is complete. He declined to discuss possible 
buyers, but said he hopes to find one who will maintain the club's jazz 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdland West is one of the few clubs in the Los Angeles area to offer jazz 
exclusively. Others include the Catalina Bar & Grill in Hollywood and The 
Strand in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When he opened Birdland West in 1986, Williams said he was banking on Long 
Beach's central location to draw jazz lovers from Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. The club has drawn a crowd from outside the city as well as a 
faithful following of local customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That place was like 'Cheers' before the economy got bad," Long Beach 
Councilman Ray Grabinski said, referring to the popular television-show bar 
with a loyal local clientele. "Before Al opened up Birdland, downtown didn't 
have many events at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Jones, director of Downtown Long Beach Associates, a group of downtown 
merchants, said his group and city officials are helping Williams find a buyer 
who will keep the club open.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams ran the Jazz Safari club near the Queen Mary for 10 years.

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA; PARENTS MAY BE BILLED FOR SCHOOL VANDALISM 
</P>

<P>
 Norwalk-La Mirada school officials, fed up with hefty costs of cleaning up 
after vandals, want to start sending the bills to parents of students caught 
spraying graffiti or inflicting other damage on school property. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board tentatively decided last week to bill parents for damages to 
help recover thousands of dollars spent to repair classroom damage caused by 
vandals, school board President Rudy Bermudez said.The board is scheduled to 
adopt the vandalism policy July 18, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts have already turned to parents to make up the difference. Two 
years ago, the Downey Unified School District adopted a similar policy under a 
state law that gives schools the authority to charge up to $10,000 in repair 
bills to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under their policy, Downey administrators can bill parents for damages after a 
student is expelled or suspended for vandalism, said Stanley Hanstad, director 
of pupil services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanstad said most parents agree to pay for damages, but administrators also 
have the authority to sue parents who refuse. Student transcripts, diplomas and 
other records can be withheld until a parent pays the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Downey school system collected $20,000 from parents, about half 
of the damage traced to students, Hanstad said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

 Norwalk-La Mirada school officials are planning to include three more 
elementary schools in September in a voluntary, permanent program for students 
to wear uniforms. Such a program was established at Edmonson elementary school 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The three additional schools named by the district are Chavez, Sanchez and 
Morrison. Parents of students at these schools overwhelmingly support the 
wearing of uniforms, Deputy Supt. Ginger Shattuck said.  
</P>
<P>
 At Edmonson, about 70% of the 700 students wore uniforms at first, and about 
85% by the end of the year, Shattuck said. Students who chose not to 
participate were allowed to wear regular clothes to school, as long as they did 
not violate a district policy banning gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual schools are allowed to choose their own colors, Shattuck said. Most 
parents support some combination of navy blue, white or dark plaids, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to establish a uniform dress code at the remaining 12 elementary 
schools in the district is at the discretion of each individual school, 
Shattuck said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; SALES OF IMITATION AUTO SECURITY DEVICES BARRED

 Three area companies were barred last week from selling copies of "The Club" 
vehicle anti-theft devices that officials believe were imported from China and 
sold at cut-rate prices alongside the more expensive originals.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon in Los Angeles issued an injunction 
against Emerson International Trading Inc. and TDC Tool Distribution Co., both 
of Paramount, and Golden Multi-International Inc. of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson International apparently received a crate of imitation anti-theft 
devices as part of a larger shipment of goods from China, and distributed the 
devices to TDC Tool and Golden, according to court papers.  
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Philadelphia-based Winner International, which manufactures 
"The Club," said the replicas were designed to look exactly like the original 
product -- including the use of similar graphics and colors. The copies did not 
have a name printed on the package, attorney Frank Gooch said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is our contention that these were made intentionally to deceive somebody 
into thinking he or she was buying the real thing," Gooch said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gooch said Winner International is also seeking to have all of the copies 
confiscated, and will seek damages from each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 TDC owner Sonny Khanna said he will stop selling the imitation devices. "I 
never knew that I wasn't supposed (to sell them)," Khanna said. "I went to a 
swap meet and saw them being sold there, so I figured it was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 David Wong, a Golden Multi-International employee, said his company has also 
stopped selling the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Long Nguyen, who represented Emerson International Trading, Inc., did 
not return phone calls. JILL GOTTESMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAKEWOOD; HOME DEPOT SCHEDULED TO OPEN STORE AT MALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Home Depot, the home-improvement chain that closed a North Long Beach store in 
May, plans to open a store next year on the former site of a Bullock's store at 
the Lakewood Center Mall, officials announced recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta-based chain is planning to build a 130,000-square-foot warehouse 
store and garden shop, said officials of Santa Monica-based Macerich Company, 
which owns the mall property. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition of the old Bullock's store began June 1. Construction of the Home 
Depot store could begin in November. The new store is scheduled to open in late 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan F. Shick, Long Beach's director of community development, said Home 
Depot decided to move from the Bixby Knolls Shopping Center because the center 
could not accommodate the store's planned expansion. A Vons supermarket is 
slated to move into the building in a few months and should offset the loss of 
tax revenue, Shick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why you didn't hear many groans from the city," Shick said. 
"Obviously, we would have loved to have kept Home Depot, but this is a perfect 
transition." 
</P>
<P>
 George Murchison, the chairman of Long Beach Community Partnership, an 
advisory group that explores ways to improve the city's business climate, said 
Home Depot's decision shows "a retention process is not in place, at least not 
in the area of retail. We don't like to lose any businesses to other 
communities," he added. JOHN POPE

 A former kindergarten teacher at Montara Street Elementary School was 
convicted last week of possession of a handgun on campus and making terrorist 
threats to teachers who turned him in. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-day trial in Norwalk Superior Court, the jury took just 80 
minutes on June 27 to reach guilty verdicts on four felony counts against 
Raymond Jett Jr., 36, who was arrested Feb. 24 for having a handgun under the 
driver's seat of his car in the school's faculty parking lot.He posted bail and 
was rearrested a day later for allegedly threatening to "end the careers" of 
several teachers at the school whom he suspected of turning him in.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bizarre case," said Marc Merrick, the deputy district attorney who 
argued the case. "And a serious crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick said that Jett "admitted having the gun on campus and admitted being 
on bail while he made the phone (threat)." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick said that Jett has a permit for the gun found in his car, and 
authorities are trying to locate permits for the weapons found at his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett's attorney, Robert McDaniel, said he will decide whether to appeal the 
case after a sentencing hearing July 18. Jett faces up to 10 years in prison.

FOR DECADES, SEX HAS BEEN SOLD ON THE SEEDY MOTEL STRIP OF PACIFIC COAST 
HIGHWAY IN LONG BEACH. POLICE AND OTHER EXPERTS DOUBT THAT PROSTITUTION CAN 
EVER BE STAMPED OUT THERE. BUT NOW ONE ORGANIZED NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP IS . . . .; 
JUST SAYING NO

 Sauntering across the dirty sidewalk, the woman with the short skirt and 
purple spike-heeled pumps approached a waiting car. She leaned into the open 
window, shifting her weight from one foot to the other, her skirt twitching 
toward the traffic on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 She slipped into the passenger seat, apparently unaware of the glaring 
disapproval of two people watching a few feet away. They made her take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Andrews marched up to the car and wrote down the license number on her 
clipboard while Dan Cangro went to the driver's side. "Did you know most 
hookers around Long Beach have AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cangro exaggerated, his remark had the desired effect. The woman in 
the purple heels got out of the car and flounced away. Cangro smiled with 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 One more streetwalker and a potential customer had been notified that they 
will no longer be accepted as an inevitable piece of the Long Beach terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, prostitutes have been working along this busy 13-block corridor 
of Pacific Coast Highway. It is an area marked by dilapidated motels, fast-food 
joints and small, dark bars on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 Streets bear signs of their commerce. Condoms sprout like weeds from gutters 
and cracks in the sidewalk. Nearby residents are confronted with open sex acts 
being performed in cars parked a few feet from their front doors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the live-and-let-live attitude of most residents is on its way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have organized themselves, staging anti-prostitution marches and 
setting up citizen foot patrols to confront the hookers. They've met with a 
range of public officials, from police officers on the beat to City Council 
members and state politicians, to lobby for more patrols and new laws against 
the shadowy commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in special investigations for 15 years," said Lt. Richard Jones of 
the police department's vice unit, "and I don't think I've ever seen a bigger 
groundswell against prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews and Cangro, who live near the highway, have been two of the most 
active agents of that groundswell, enlisting members of their Wrigley 
Neighborhood Assn. The Wrigley area includes the stretch of Pacific Coast 
Highway between the Los Angeles River and Atlantic Avenue that is considered 
the city's most open prostitution market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the association show up in court en masse during the arraignment of 
prostitutes and customers to serve notice that they want harsh sentences. The 
neatly dressed citizens wear homemade buttons with the words "hookers, johns" 
crossed out by the international "no" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood association, which has 205 members, has pressured state 
legislators to include the city in a trial program, patterned after drug 
forfeiture laws, that allows authorities to seize cars owned by the 
prostitutes' clients in certain circumstances. The group met with City 
Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord, who then suggested the city put up signs along 
major streets warning that soliciting sex for cash is a crime. The association 
helped persuade The Long Beach Press-Telegram to begin publishing names of 
convicted johns. The group also has suggested the city paint all PCH curbs in 
the area red to keep customers from stopping -- a suggestion that police and 
staff said was not feasible for such a busy commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the association's prostitution abatement committee, led by Andrews 
and Cangro, will try just about anything to rid the highway of hookers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to drive them all out of this neighborhood," said Andrews, 51, office 
manager for a moving and storage organization. "I am not going to let them 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say they have little hope, however, that these 
tactics will actually rid the highway area of hookers. The practice is too 
entrenched, police and prosecutors say. Prostitutes and their customers keep 
returning to the area, knowing they can find one another in front of the 
highway's dilapidated motels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were picking up prostitutes on PCH when I was here (as a deputy 
prosecutor) in 1960," said City Prosecutor John A. Vander Lans. "It hasn't 
really changed." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what would work to rid the area of hookers, Vander Lans says: 
"Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted by such official pessimism, the Wrigley team patrols Pacific Coast 
Highway about one weekend evening a month, looking for hookers to chase off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 They call their program "Adopt-a-Hooker," a helpful-sounding title that masks 
a strategy of systematic harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The group spots a woman believed to be a prostitute, then follows her. If a 
car stops for her, they take pictures of the car, write down the license number 
and, if possible, confront the driver. Both the woman and potential customer 
are told they will be turned in to police. 
</P>
<P>
 While there have been occasional ugly confrontations, members of the patrol 
say they don't fear these women and their customers. Most streetwalkers, Cangro 
says, are easily intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Topsy-Elvord attributes residents' growing intolerance to the fact that fewer 
johns have money for hotel rooms, which means sex occurs more often in cars, in 
plain view. Others say residents are simply more aware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we were just accepting it as part of the landscape," said Raymond Carl, 
whose furniture store has dominated a block of Pacific Coast Highway since 
1933. "But folks are getting to the end of their rope." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carl says he is tired of beginning and ending his workday picking up condoms 
and drug paraphernalia in his parking lot. He sees hollow-eyed women addicts 
stumbling across his property. They attract drug dealers, gang members and 
petty thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Scott Robertson of the police vice squad estimates that 90% of the women 
working Long Beach streets are addicted to heroin or crack cocaine. Most of the 
women who are arrested have hypodermic track marks and open sores, indicative 
of crack cocaine smokers, Robertson said. Most freely admit to their habits.  
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, about 5% of all those convicted of prostitution test positive 
for HIV, according to Court Commissioner George Pugsley, who handles 
prostitution arraignments. Convicted hookers and johns must submit to a 
confidential HIV test as part of their sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Robertson's vice squad patrol the highway in unmarked cars three or 
four nights a week, arresting prostitutes. About once a month, female officers 
pose as hookers and arrest suspected johns. In 1993, there were 1,587 
prostitution-related arrests in Long Beach, up from 808 in 1991, the first year 
that police kept separate statistics on such arrests. Although police don't 
compile lists of arrests by neighborhood, they believe that the majority of 
these apprehensions were made along the notorious stretch of Pacific Coast 
Highway that the Wrigley Neighborhood Assn. is focusing on. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the women Robertson arrests spend less than two weeks in jail, he 
said. They go back to the streets and he arrests them again. Even with the big 
jump in prostitution arrests, his team never runs out of hookers and johns to 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been fighting this a long time and I'm not sure anything helps," 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Cangro, Andrews and other members of the Wrigley association believe they 
can wipe out prostitution with police assistance, tougher new laws and their 
"Adopt-A-Hooker" patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday evening, nine association members, clutching clipboards 
and cameras, gathered at Andrews' home before marching grimly along her quiet, 
tree-lined street to the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 As they walk, Cangro has a few last words of advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, remember, don't get too close. I've had a hooker pull a gun on me," said 
Cangro, 47, a superintendent in the county's water pollution control plant. 
This was said mostly for the benefit of two new patrol members, George and 
Patricia Busby, who looked nervous underneath their matching black and gold 
National Rifle Assn. caps. 
</P>
<P>
 No one carries a weapon. Even after a woman pointed a gun at Cangro's head 
last year, he said, he feels pretty safe. He persuaded the woman to put the gun 
down and walk away. He didn't bother reporting the incident to police, Cangro 
said, because he didn't feel he was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have warned Cangro that he might not always be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to encourage them to go out and do that because there is a risk," 
Roberston said. "But, God bless 'em, they're enthusiastic. So I tell them if 
they're going to do that, go out in a large group. Stick together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On this evening, the first prostitute the group confronts is not intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 They first caught sight of the woman in a short black skirt and tank top 
embracing a man in an alley beside the El Capitan Motel. The group stopped, and 
someone snapped a few pictures. The woman came charging toward the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you doing?" she yelled. "You're taking pictures of prostitutes, 
aren't you? Well, you're also taking pictures of a college graduate," she said, 
referring to herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wrigley association patrol simply looked at her. The woman, who gave her 
name as Lu-Lu May Dubonnette, was steamed. "They're a bunch of hypocrites. They 
come down this street and they think they're better than us," Dubonnette said.  
</P>
<P>
 An admitted prostitute, Dubonnette has a room at the El Capitan. Police and 
neighbors say it's one of about half a dozen motels along the highway that 
harbor prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see this property gone, razed to the ground," Andrews said, 
pointing at the El Capitan. "The owner won't change and I want it gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Patel, 27, who manages the motel with his wife, said Dubonnette can stay 
as long as she doesn't bring customers to her room. "She needs to live 
somewhere," added Patel's wife, who refused to give her name. "She isn't 
breaking the law here, we make sure of that. Why should we kick her out?" 
</P>
<P>
 The motel's owner, Naginbhai Govindbhai Patel (no relation to the managers), 
wasn't available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two hours, the group confronted four other women. Unlike Dubonnette, 
they all hurried away. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the citizen patrol would turn over their photos and notes to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't use their photos as evidence, but every once in awhile we can 
identify a pimp who's hanging around," Robertson said. "Every little bit helps. 
And besides, if I'm a prospective john and someone takes a picture, I'm going 
to get out of there and never come back." 
</P>
<P>
 What Robertson and his team would really like, he said, are harsher sentences 
for prostitution-related crimes. At least then, they say, the hookers would be 
off the streets longer between arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the sentence for a first-time offender -- hooker or customer -- is 
usually 10 days in jail, plus up to $800 in fines and penalties. A third-time 
offender can be sentenced between 90 days and one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 When the jails are overcrowded, as they are so often in Los Angeles County, 
hookers and johns are usually the first offenders set free, largely due to the 
perception that prostitution is a victimless crime, vice officers complain.  
</P>
<P>
 Police have been given other tools by the state Legislature, but officers 
complain that the new laws rarely help.  
</P>
<P>
 A "red-light district" law allows police to shut down motels catering to 
hookers. But that law requires at least six months of investigations and 
paperwork to prove that owners and managers knowingly allow prostitution, 
Robertson said. His team simply doesn't have the time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wrigley group is hopeful that seizing the johns' cars will work. A new 
law, passed by state lawmakers last year, allowed San Diego County and the city 
of Oakland to begin a five-year pilot program where the courts could take the 
vehicle of a customer who had been caught in his car, twice in the same year, 
with a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with the Wrigley group this year, state Assemblywoman Juanita M. 
McDonald (D-Carson) introduced a bill including Long Beach and Signal Hill in 
the program. The bill is in a Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the local vice squad has little hope this law would help. The problem is, 
johns are rarely caught in their cars, Robertson said. Most often, they are 
arrested by undercover female officers in motel rooms. Also, the law states 
that a convicted john's car can't be seized if it's his family's only car. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program went into effect Jan. 1 in San Diego, but no car has been 
seized, police there said. Oakland police haven't even bothered to begin the 
project.  
</P>
<P>
 "The law is unenforceable," said Sgt. Michael Martin of Oakland's police vice 
squad. As for Councilwoman Topsy-Elvord's idea to put up road signs warning 
against prostitution, which was warmly received by other council members, the 
suggestion was dropped after businesses along PCH complained that it would make 
the area look bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want me to get rid of it," Topsy-Elvord said, "but they don't want to be 
identified as being in a prostitution zone. But it's obvious they are -- 
prostitutes are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't gotten worse, really, it's become seedier. And everybody has to 
look at it. It's just sad."

BACKGROUND HELPED CALLAHAN SHARPEN HIS SKILLS FOR BLADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Callahan thought his hockey career was over. 
</P>
<P>
 When he moved from Toronto to Southern California six years ago, Callahan 
packed his skates and stick away. The way he figured, the Los Angeles Kings had 
a better chance of reaching the Stanley Cup final than he did of finding a 
place to play competitive hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, the Kings with star Wayne Gretzky have a Stanley Cup final 
appearance under their belts. And Callahan, a Santa Fe Springs resident, is the 
leading goal scorer for Los Angeles' professional roller hockey team, the 
Blades. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about your L.A. stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan is not terrorizing goaltenders on a pair of ice hockey skates, but 
his prowess on a pair of in-line skates has put him on the cutting edge of a 
new sport. He has scored 11 goals and has seven assists for the Blades, which 
are 6-3 and in third place in Roller Hockey International's Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "My strength is putting the puck in the net," said Callahan, a 6-foot, 
210-pound forward. "That's what the team looks for me to do, and that's what I 
try to get done." 
</P>
<P>
 Roller Hockey International is in its second year. The league has 20 
franchises in the United States and four in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades, which play home games at the Forum, will play a 22-game schedule 
this season, 16 against division opponents Anaheim, San Jose, San Diego, 
Oakland and Las Vegas. The top four teams from each of the league's four 
divisions qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team's roster has 12 skaters and two goaltenders. Players in the league 
earn a minimum of $6,000 for the season. They can make as much $20,000 for 
winning the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of concrete or synthetic roller-hockey rinks vary, but they are 
roughly equivalent to an ice hockey rink. Many of the rules are the same, but 
there are some differences. In ice hockey, for example, there are three lines 
marking the ice to dictate off-sides and other violations. In roller hockey 
there is only a center line. Ice hockey is played five-on-five with a 
goaltender for each team. Roller hockey is played four-on-four with a 
goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
 "With only four guys out there, there is a lot of room to maneuver on 
offense," Callahan said. "And if you lose your man on defense, you're in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan, who owns a credit consulting firm in Burbank, has had no trouble 
adjusting to hockey on wheels since joining the Blades for its inaugural season 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been playing ice hockey since he was 5, and ascended through various 
organized leagues in Canada until a knee injury ended his dream of playing in 
the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 After marrying and settling in Southern California, Callahan hooked up with 
the California Hawks, a semi-pro ice hockey team based in Anaheim that competes 
in the Pacific Southwest Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he was invited to join the Blades for its inaugural season, and 
scored 17 goals in 11 games. In May, he traveled to Japan with an RHI all-star 
team. He scored two goals and had an assist during an exhibition before 7,000 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys just have an instinct to find the net," Blades goaltender Brad 
Sholl said. "With Mike, no matter what he does or where he goes, he manages to 
get a goal a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Blades advanced to the semifinals of the playoffs before the 
team was eliminated by Anaheim. The league has doubled in size this season, but 
Callahan said the Blades, which play Sunday at home against San Diego, are 
capable of winning the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the players in the RHI, Callahan is thrilled to be a pioneer in 
what he predicts will become an increasingly popular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, no one knew what to expect, but the sport is catching on," 
Callahan said. "When I first moved here, you'd never see kids out on the street 
playing hockey. Now, you see them all over the place on (in-line skates) with 
hockey sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gretzky, the Kings and the (Anaheim) Mighty Ducks have a lot to do with 
that," Callahan said. "And hopefully, the Blades can help take it to another 
level."

 Prop. 13 -- Sunday's editorial on the gubernatorial race mistakenly stated 
that Prop. 13 could be repealed by a two-thirds vote of the people. In fact, 
Prop. 13 could be repealed by a simple majority by either initiative or 
referendum. But a referendum first would require a two-thirds vote of both
