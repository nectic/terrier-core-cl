THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; THE LADIES' SALESMAN; TEDDY EDWARDS KNOWS HOW TO 
MAKE A WOMAN HAPPY

 Calling Teddy Edwards a salesman is practically indecent. Even his actual 
title, sales associate, is inadequate. Fine ladies' dresser is closer to the 
mark. Attire adviser, at least. Haute couture courtier . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Teddy, as everyone calls him, has been many things in his 60 years. A tyke in 
the British West Indies, where he was born. Teen-ager in New York City. U.S. 
Army soldier in Japan and Korea in the '50s. Actor in the '60s in Paris and 
Rome, with bit parts in Fellini's "Satyricon" and "Catch-22." Restaurateur and 
boutique owner in London in the '70s. Sonia Rykiel specialist at Bullocks 
Wilshire from 1984 until its tragic closure last year, when he assumed the same 
post at parent company I. Magnin in Beverly Hills. (He settled in California 
for the weather.) 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Edwards' domain is a place where women routinely drop $10,000 to 
$20,000 for protective coloration, where Chandon Brut Cuvee and San Pellegrino 
are poured in the shoe department (in monogrammed I. Magnin Champagne glasses), 
where the salespeople are better coiffed than most people in human history, 
where at least one severely underdressed visitor was greeted with a steely 
stare and a hollow, interrogative "have you been helped?", where statements 
like "this is too beige -- it almost looks cream ! are practically Muzak, where 
fine ladies' skirts, dresses, jackets hang in lithe, elegant rows, awaiting 
fine ladies to inhabit them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm looking at a lady, I'm looking at her as a piece of art," Edwards 
effused. "I love it when I finish dressing a lady and the result is that she 
looks wonderful . . . You can bring out something that she hasn't seen. There's 
nothing better than that! That's the reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are shy about dressing and don't have a lot of nerve, and 
often those are just the people that can look fabulous!" 
</P>
<P>
 He sat easily in an I. Magnin office two floors above raucous Wilshire 
Boulevard, impeccable in faintly striped charcoal Oxford suit, tie with muted 
colors just bordering on flair, tasseled loafers, red rhinestone AIDS pin. In 
all, no more presentable than a newly minted coin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually an actor, and it's all theatrics with me," he said -- no, 
projected -- in a carefully modulated, smoky timbre. "And I love theatrics. I 
think that's part of my success, that I pull people into my theater. It's more 
than just selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't misunderstand the remark about theatrics; Edwards does not imply 
insincerity. His job merely allows him to indulge his sense of the dramatic; 
his designated I. Magnin "area" is his stage. Besides, he will tell you, acting 
is organic to dressing well: "Yes, oh, it's certainly connected. And women 
certainly are the prize actresses. Especially today's women that have invaded 
the corporate world. I have a lot of those kind of ladies and certainly clothes 
are going to help them a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is more than just selling, with this man. Sales are almost 
anticlimactic; the perfunctory necessity done at the end of fashion consulting. 
Edwards's long-established reputation is that he genuinely has the beauty of 
his clients at heart -- not what's inside their Gucci bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teddy isn't there to sell you something," flatly declared longtime client 
Sheila Tepper, noted arts patron and producer of KKGO-FM's "Backstage 
California." "Teddy's there so you have something that's right for you, that 
you love, that's right on your body, that looks good to him, and that you're 
comfortable in. I don't know anybody else that does that. He has an unerring 
eye, and his friendship is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Stack, wife of actor Robert and no stranger to high fashion shopping, 
echoed Tepper. "First of all, I don't like to be sold. Teddy doesn't sell you, 
he just kind of shows you, which I appreciate . . . I think he can especially 
help a lady who -- and I'm not referring to myself -- there are some women who 
can spend money on clothes, and they don't know what kind of shoes to put with 
it. You know? Which is really kind of sad. Which is why they need people like 
Teddy." 
</P>
<P>
 This ladies' gentleman -- whose zest and appearance belong to a man 20 years 
younger -- has more than 300 regular clients, about 75 of whom are "active." 
(He will divulge no names.) Yes, he keeps files on their tastes -- largely in 
his head -- but is not necessarily bound by patrons' stated parameters. Like 
any good actor, he improvises: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I have lots of ladies who just so rarely come in, I just continually 
pick things for them," he said, ignoring a hissing glass of San Pellegrino at 
his side. "Often they're busy ladies and can't really come in for the trunk 
shows and what-not. I go to the trunk shows often, and I'll say, 'Oh that would 
be great for so-and-so' -- and I UPS it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had one of my customers tell me that her husband said, 'Oh, I wish I had 
a guy that could do that for me, because it's like Christmas!' When UPS shows 
up, a lot of them say, 'I don't know what it is, but if Teddy sent it, it must 
be something fun . It's like someone sending them presents." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the recipients generally buy these "presents." And they generally 
take Edwards's raiment recommendations, no matter how seemingly foreign or 
outlandish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies, I think, often do not see themselves as others see them. I was 
showing a lady a Donna Karan Oriental dress, and she was saying, 'Oh, Teddy, 
you don't think i could do that .' She was a writer. I said, 'Certainly!' A 
photograph of the dress showed a lot of leg. By the time I got her into the 
dress, she bought two -- the white and the black. She didn't think she could 
wear them, but I could see that she could. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case, a man does a good job. Another woman might also have said, 'Oh, 
no. I wouldn't do that.' Whereas if a man tells them to do that, they might 
take a chance because he is a man. Although in the long run, I think a lot of 
women dress for other women." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards's taste, say some clients, tends toward the conservative, but is 
seldom predictable, and always marked by a bit of panache or surprise. Edwards 
will tell you he simply seeks to illuminate an aspect of character that a 
client might not notice. Consider the story of The Lady and the Shawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a patron, and I had this wonderful shawl that I said she absolutely 
had to have. She really wasn't that interested, but in the end she bought it. 
And she went to Venice (Italy). She was sitting in a famous bar -- and three 
ladies approached her and said, 'My God, I love that shawl you're wearing!' So 
she sent me a post card saying 'Here's that shawl I didn't want to buy, and 
three ladies wanted to buy it!' From that day on, she said, 'You tell me if 
there's anything great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So just exactly how did this soldier-turned-actor-turned-restaurateur finally 
turn to fashion? With a good deal of admitted drive, self-confidence, and . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "When I thought about going into clothing, my first thought was, "Well I don't 
know much about it,' " he said. "My business partner said 'Yes, but you know a 
lot about people. And I love the public! And I think whether you're being a 
restaurateur or selling clothes, it's all quite similar. Because you're dealing 
with the public. I think if you're going to be an actor, you do like the 
public. I like (working as a sales associate) better than acting, because there 
is a one-on-one basis as opposed to acting, where you never meet the people." 
</P>
<P>
 What of the "infrequent" client he would rather not meet? The cranky and 
irate? The petulant? Edwards merely quiets down. "I'm usually a person who 
loves ranting and raving," he laughed. "But when I see something like that, I 
immediately clam up." 
</P>
<P>
 To his surprise, the job also calls for discretion of a type he employed while 
running a restaurant. "I found out very early in the restaurant business to 
think twice before you say anything, because a guy can come in one day with his 
girlfriend and another day with his wife. So I learned in the clothing business 
to listen, but not say too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Should one happen to, to use Edwards's term, "pop by" his spot at I. Magnin 
these days and not find him in, it's probably because lately he has been 
visiting other branches as a roving ambassador for Sonia Rykiel. It's a 
responsibility very much to his liking. And yes, this sexagenarian still has an 
aspiration or two up his expertly tailored sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought of myself as a fashion host on television," says Teddy 
Edwards, with an air of confidence that seemed to ensure its becoming a 
reality.

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; 'LIKE WOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's cover model, Larissa Bondarenko, knew she wanted to be a model from 
the time she was a child in the Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. Then it 
happened, just like in the fairy tales: A Moscow photographer sent photos of 
Bondarenko to the Elite modeling agency in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the Polaroids you could just tell . . . her lips, her nose, 
everything's perfect," said Elite president Valerie Trott. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bondarenko, who is nearly 6 feet tall, traveled to New York. She was just 
18.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't speak a word of English. There was no one to speak Russian. So I 
guess you learn a language when you have no choice," she says. "But I was very 
happy, very happy, because I was the one girl that had a chance to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't till the young model hit Los Angeles, though, that her star began to 
shine. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I received her (portfolio), I just thought, well, whatever," recalls 
Capucine Castets, director of print for the modeling agency Elite L.A. "But 
when I saw in her person it was like, wow. Larissa did some test shots and 
right away it just clicked. Now, everyone in town wants her." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone includes Paul Marciano, discoverer of natural beauties, who will use 
Bondarenko for an upcoming Guess ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 She'll also be featured in a special about models later this month on VH-1, 
and she leaves this week for Tahiti and a shoot with Australian Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Larissa got that millions of other wanna-be models don't?  
</P>
<P>
 "She is a great natural beauty, very statuesque," said Castets. "And then 
there's an innocence about her being Russian." She's not jaded? "Not yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The only surprise Bondarenko said she has encountered is the business of 
modeling itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do a job, the people -- the photographer, the makeup person, the 
stylist -- they already know what they want to see. I wanted to see myself as I 
saw myself."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; YOU KNOW THE TYPE. . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there a Southern California Look? 
</P>
<P>
 People from other parts of the country might say it's the surfer dude. 
</P>
<P>
 But a closer look at the local fashion traffic turns up as many indigenous 
styles as categories of vegetarians: the party girl, the hippie / homeboy, the 
Ivy league agent, the rock star wife, the serious young actress . . ..  
</P>
<P>
 Stereotypes, perhaps. But eat lunch at the slick Maple Drive restaurant in 
Beverly Hills, and get a lesson in power dressing, agent style. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd better look fast, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to say that today's meat-eating agent won't be tomorrow's tofu-loving 
hippie? 
</P>
<P>
 1) Party Girl 
</P>
<P>
 Shops Joss, Theodore, BCIG; would be lost without Azzedine Alaia black net 
bodysuit, Versace high-heeled sandals, Prada thigh-high boots; still uses hair 
spray; wasn't aware miniskirts had ever gone out of style; has practiced 7-step 
lipstick process (foundation, pencil, lipstick, blot, loose powder, reapply, 
reblot) since age 12. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Serious Young Actress 
</P>
<P>
 Has the skin of a 14-year-old; doesn't bother with mascara; grew up reading 
Genet; believable in parts like art-student-by-day / hooker-by-night; wears 
Emporio Armani, Richard Tyler, Calvin Klein -- clutter-free clothes that let 
her soul shine through. Would be lost without Donna Karan mock-turtleneck 
bodysuit. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Rock Star Wife/Girlfriend 
</P>
<P>
 Has a home Pilates system; looks stunning in jeans and skimpy white T; looks 
stunning in body-baring evening gown (see Mrs. Sting); shops Shauna Stein, 
Agnes B, Les Habitudes,; dresses offspring like mini-rockers in Fred Segal kids 
clothes; if from Texas, is borderline trashy (see Jerry Hall). 
</P>
<P>
 4) Ivy League Agent 
</P>
<P>
 Keeps personal and work life separate; places own calls; steers clients -- 
sometimes kicking and screaming -- toward high-quality projects; has found 
Barneys New York in Beverly Hills and will never look back; puffs on his 
favorite cigar out on the store's terrace after a fitting in the Tower. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Hippie Homeboy 
</P>
<P>
 Lovers, not fighters; think Jimi Hendrix, the Veldt, Giovanni Salah, Lenny 
Kravitz; long sideburns, wide belts, love beads, psychedelic pants; shops 
Melrose -- especially The Wasteland and X Collection; owner of extensive beret 
collection.

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE HEADLINES; THE 
LANDLORD; DONALD TRONSTEIN, RODEO DRIVE RENT COLLECTOR: "BACK IN THE '70S, YOU 
COULD BORROW MONEY FROM BANKS WITH IDEAS." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KISSEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Tronstein collects rent from some of the biggest names in fashion. 
Giorgio Armani, Fred Joaillier, Bruno Magli and Polo / Ralph Lauren occupy his 
various Rodeo Drive properties. 
</P>
<P>
 But he flinches at being called one of the most powerful landlords in Beverly 
Hills. "There are larger developers here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Few, however, have had Tronstein's impact. The son of a fur manufacturer, 
Tronstein has been a lightning rod on Rodeo almost from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the '70s, you could borrow money from banks with ideas," he says. 
That's how, in 1976, he acquired the funds to turn an empty gas station on the 
corner of Rodeo and Brighton Way into the future site of Fred Joaillier 
jewelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been a salesman, then a manager at Coldwell Banker when it was located 
in the Beverly Hilton hotel," he says. Tronstein helped arrange the sale of 
what was then Elizabeth Arden to Neiman Marcus, "so I knew they had to move and 
were looking for a sight." He persuaded Arden, and later Gump's, to take up 
residence in his newly opened building. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the recession hit, causing both leases to crumble. Fortunately for 
Tronstein, Fred Joaillier came along a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, he could have gone broke. But Tronstein hung on to what was 
then the most expensive retail space on the block. "We were asking $4 a square 
foot, which was unheard of at the time," he says. After Fred took up residence, 
it wasn't difficult to sway Vidal Sassoon and Bally shoes. The profits bought 
Tronstein a second Rodeo property, which now houses Frette linens, Bruno Magli 
and the Custom Shirt shop.  
</P>
<P>
 Tronstein's latest challenge is persuading the world that the influx of 
moderately priced stores like Guess, Cole-Haan, Bernini Sport and Benetton 
enhance rather than hinder the street's cache. Not only do such venues 
"humanize" and "localize" the street, he says, but they attract diverse 
shoppers. Rodeo Drive is now the third-largest tourist attraction in the state, 
behind Disneyland and Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think mixing the entertainment factor, such as the Guess tepees for 
dressing rooms, with the elegance and style of the couture shops is a very 
powerful combination," says Tronstein. "It's what retail is about in the 
1990s."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE HEADLINES; THE MONEY 
MAN; HARVEY FEIG, BANKER WHO COLLECTS FOR BIG LABELS: "WE TELL APPAREL 
COMPANIES WHO AND WHAT TO AVOID." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KISSEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He doesn't dictate hemlines or consult on jacket silhouettes. Harvey Feig 
does, however, control the purse strings of some of the West Coast's biggest 
fashion labels. Among them, Jessica McClintock, Mossimo, Joe Boxer, Gotcha and 
Ocean Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Feig's official title is senior vice president / regional manager of the CIT 
Group, but in the apparel trade he's known as a factor. His branch of banking 
serves as the outside accounting and credit division for clothing 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "An apparel manufacturer will use outside contractors to cut and sew their 
garments. They don't do it themselves because they need to keep track of 
overhead and don't want the expense of employing sewers," Feig says. "It's the 
same thing with credit and collections. Why take the risk of bad debts by 
selling to Merry Go Round or Macy's, both of which (have filed for bankruptcy 
protection)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Factors not only do simple credit checks but also send out late statements and 
collect debts. In most cases, they also prepay a store's debt, collecting a fee 
and interest in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We buy up the receivables. We own the bills," says Feig, a 26-year veteran of 
the factoring business. "So when the goods have been shipped, Nordstrom knows 
to pay the bill to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Feig says nearly 80% of his apparel clients ask for this kind of up-front 
money to take them from season to season. Although costly -- generally a 1% 
commission on sales -- such a service aids struggling new designers, who cannot 
always afford to wait 60 to 90 days to collect a debt.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a traditional bank, which makes loans on collateral and good credit, a 
factor banks on ideas. "We're much more flexible than a bank," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very subjective. . . . If we like the person, if their designs look good 
and we think they have talent, we'll back them." On the other hand, "there are 
people in this business who do not have the greatest reputations; who in the 
past have not done well and shown an ability to lose money. We look at the 
integrity of the person first, not the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the risks of such a venture are enormous. "If a store goes 
bankrupt, we take the loss." Having a factor saved a number of struggling 
companies in 1991 and 1992, when retail bankruptcies were at a record high, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell apparel companies who and what to avoid -- people who pay slow or not 
at all. Or people on the verge of bankruptcy," says Feig. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for small fashion entrepreneurs to get this information 
on their own. It takes a great deal of time. And they don't have the access to 
extensive credit files that we do." 
</P>
<P>
 It can also take an enormous sense of humor. Unlike most bankers, Feig spends 
a good part of his day explaining his services to apparel makers in their 
offices. During one of these meetings with a women's lingerie supplier, a 
fashion show was going on next door and the models were using the executive 
offices as a changing room. Feig says it was all he could do to keep a straight 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot wilder stuff has happened," he says. "But I wouldn't want to get into 
that. Some of my clients might recognize themselves."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE HEADLINES; THE TREND 
MONITOR; BARBARA FIELDS, OWNER OF BUYING OFFICE WITH ACCOUNTS WORLDWIDE: "I 
HAVE TO BE THE EYES AND EARS FOR MY CLIENTS." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Barbara Fields is the first to admit her life is a three-ring circus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just this morning I had three appointments going all at the same time," says 
the owner of the L.A.-based apparel buying office that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
 While she bounced around her second-floor office suite at the CaliforniaMart 
bowing to Sears executives in one room and buyers from Hilton Hotel's new 
Intervision in-room shopping service in the other, the owners of a small Costa 
Rican specialty store waited in a third for this fashion ringleader to guide 
them through the new California collections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be the eyes and ears for my clients," says Fields, who acts as an 
outside buying service for more than 300 accounts worldwide while overseeing a 
staff of 40.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to live and breathe this business, and have a lot of dedication to 
it," she says. "And thank God for faxes and conference calling at 10 o'clock at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 While there are those who consider Fields to be overly confident and 
aggressive, others call her a dynamo and a master of salesmanship. "I may be 
known as being hard-core," she says, "but you need to be in order to get the 
job done. In the end, the only thing that matters is that they respect me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like her or not, Fields's reputation for understanding and evaluating the West 
Coast fashion scene has earned her a highly sought-after client list, including 
Nordstrom, Merry Go Round, Judy's, Jay Jacobs, Mervyn's, Target and the Speigel 
catalogue division. "Some of the stores we buy for only get to California a 
couple of times a year but don't want to miss an item in the meantime," says 
Fields. It's not uncommon for retailers to leave their bank accounts in her 
hands to buy specialty items.  
</P>
<P>
 When she's not shopping, Fields presents trend reports to out-of-town buyers, 
offers advice to retailers, organizes multimedia fashion productions, runs a 
travel office and sets up retail tours of the city. She is also busy opening 
branch offices in Paris, London and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think I should write a book," Fields says with a sigh, shuffling 
a stack of paperwork. "I know it would be a bestseller."

 More than $140-billion worth of two-way trade flows through the Los Angeles 
and Long Beach seaports and LAX in a single year. John H. Heinrich, district 
director for the U.S. Customs Service, heads the department responsible for 
documenting and approving it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, the reaction you get when you say you work for customs is 
someone's story about coming through the airport," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the recent case of the tourist who swallowed a condom filled with heroin. 
It leaked, says Heinrich, causing the man to go into convulsions. "He turned 
around and sued us for false search, which he lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Less titillating but just as big a concern is the illegal entry of textiles 
and apparel. "Our main responsibility is to enforce trade agreements between 
the U.S. and foreign countries as well as check quotas and visa restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Quotas are limitations on certain garments, such as cotton T-shirts and silk 
blouses, or on raw materials, imposed by the government to protect U.S. 
interests.  
</P>
<P>
 Cheats are easily caught, he says, either through faulty documentation or 
through paid informants, locally and abroad. Suppose no one squeals? "Suspect 
merchandise can easily be examined under a microscope to determine its original 
point of origin," Heinrich says.

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; MORE PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE HEADLINES; THE CAMERA 
MEN; DEAN AND DAVIS FACTOR, OWNERS OF THE PHOTOGRAPHIC SOUND STAGE SMASH BOX: 
"THERE WAS NOTHING TO MATCH (N.Y.) STUDIOS IN L.A." 
</P>

<P>
 Brothers Dean and Davis Factor -- great-grandsons of makeup pioneer Max Factor 
-- have clearly inherited their ancestor's flair for turning fashion into 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, 29, and Davis, 33, own and operate Smash Box, a 20,000-square-foot photo 
studio tucked away in an offbeat part of Culver City that is home away from 
home to photographers like Bruce Weber, Greg Gorman, Matthew Ralston and Annie 
Leibovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio, named for the accordion-like device once used to shield a camera 
lens, is more than a photographic sound stage. The Factors have turned this 
once-barren warehouse into a one-stop shopping service for art directors, 
fashion stylists and photographers who don't always have time or energy to 
drive around Los Angeles in search of backdrops and lighting, hand props and 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea belongs to Davis, who opened a smaller version of Smash Box in Santa 
Monica in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, New York had all these great studios but there was nothing to 
match them in Los Angeles," says Davis, a photographer now working on the 
Guess? ad campaign. Italian photographer Fabricio Ferri, shooting a cover photo 
of Cindy Crawford for L.A. Style magazine, was the first client.  
</P>
<P>
 The larger studio was added last year when Dean, who has a master's in finance 
from USC, entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not running a complex specifically catering to photographers," says 
Dean. Music videos and commercials are also shot at the studio, which has 
become known as a hot spot. Smash Box recently hosted actor Johnny Depp, Vogue 
magazine, designer Richard Tyler and Neiman Marcus for a high-profile party to 
benefit the DARE anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
 Artfully austere, the studio also invites cast and crews to unwind with 
billiards and gourmet meals by chef Phillip Weingarten.  
</P>
<P>
 With high-profile subjects holed up inside on any given day, one would expect 
Smash Box to be a magnet for paparazzi. Not so, say the Factors, who insist the 
offbeat location helps. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day I looked out my window and saw Jack Nicholson wandering around in the 
parking lot with a big cigar in his mouth," says Dean. "When I came out to ask 
him if he was lost, he told me he'd been looking all over the place for the 
front door."

THE STYLE FILES: THE PLAYERS; MORE PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE HEADLINES; THE BEST 
SELLER; NATALIE VIGIL, TOP SALESPERSON AT CLOTHESTIME: "I NO LONGER ASSUME THAT 
A MAN COMING INTO THE STORE IS BUYING SOMETHING FOR HIS WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND."

 OK, so Natalie Vigil smiles a lot. And yes, she always asks the dreaded 
question, "Can I help you?" But unlike some retail salesclerks, Vigil knows how 
to take a hint. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell by their expression or the way they say 'hi' to you," says 
Vigil, who, at 22, is one of the top-dollar sales associates for the 542-store, 
Anaheim-based Clothestime chain. "Sometimes they'll say, 'Oh, I'm just 
browsing' in a way that you know they want to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the case with a transvestite who wandered into the South Pasadena 
store where Vigil works. He wanted a pair of leggings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He insisted on trying them on," she says. "But we couldn't let him into the 
fitting room because there were a lot of ladies in there." Unwilling to let a 
potential sale walk out the door, Vigil took him to the store's bathroom and 
stood guard outside while he tried them on. The man bought six pairs. Now, she 
says, "I no longer assume that a man coming into the store is buying something 
for his wife or girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical day, Vigil sells something to one out of every three shoppers. 
That translates to about $6,000 worth of merchandise a week.  
</P>
<P>
 Her secrets include friendliness, assertiveness and attentiveness. Avoid at 
all costs, she says, wandering eyes, yawns and the dreaded dancing feet. Vigil 
plans to attend law school; until then, she will practice her considerable 
powers of persuasion.

 Down, Wisconsin! Apparently, the Badger State's anger over the 1994 Rose Bowl 
ticket snafu hasn't abated. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wisconsin store called the Dollar Shop has adopted this advertising slogan: 
"There's a name for deals this good. In L.A. it's called looting. In Milwaukee 
it's called the Dollar Shop."

 Icy reception: Which reminds us of an ESCAPE TO WISCONSIN bumper sticker 
promotion that state started in the Midwest several years ago. The stickers

read, COWS IN SIN.

 A sure sign of spring's approach: It's KFI radio's annual campaign against the

actor/famous husband Tom Arnold and later finds obscenities scrawled on her 
car, as well as a photo of what appears to be a large man's naked posterior.  
</P>

 * 1989 -- A film animation executive charges that Clint Eastwood ruined her 
day by ramming her parked car with his pickup truck on the Burbank Studios lot. 
She had made the mistake of leaving her car in Eastwood's spot while making a

 * 1989 -- Zsa Zsa Gabor is convicted of slapping a Beverly Hills cop, driving 
without a license and possessing an open container of alcohol (a flask of Jack 
Daniel's) after being stopped in her Rolls Royce. She serves 72 hours in an El 
Segundo jail cell but later wins a part in the movie "Naked Gun," in which she 
re-enacts the slap. 
</P>

 * 1980 -- Actor James Garner is choked, beaten and kicked in the head by

"I faked unconsciousness," he said later.

always liked their "WELCOME TO SAN DIEGO" greeting, or some variant thereof, on 
April Fool's Day.

WELCOME TEAMWORK ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's politically diverse congressional delegation rarely agrees on 
anything, especially a controversial issue like illegal immigration. And, as 
among Californians in general, debate on the issue in Washington is not purely 
partisan; within the ranks of either party strong differences often emerge. 
That is why a new comity among seven House Democrats -- including one who has a 
reputation of being tough on immigration and several who often advocate on 
behalf of immigrants -- is welcome. Their consensus on a package of proposed 
legislation bodes well for a broader national compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Democrats who took the lead on this difficult subject despite their 
differences are Xavier Becerra and Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles, 
Anthony C. Beilenson of Woodland Hills, Esteban E. Torres of La Puente, Bob 
Filner and Lynn Schenk of San Diego and Sam Farr of Carmel. Their balanced 
approach already is attracting additional support in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A measure sponsored by Beilensen would increase the size of the U.S. Border 
Patrol from 3,500 to 6,000 agents, upgrade its equipment and improve training. 
Controlling the nation's borders better is an approach that many Republicans 
like, so bipartisan support is probable. 
</P>
<P>
 Another immigration law enforcement bill would require the federal government 
to reimburse states for the cost of imprisoning undocumented immigrants who 
have been convicted of a crime. Beilenson puts that cost at $18,000 per year 
per prisoner. Gov. Pete Wilson puts the cost even higher. Whatever the amount, 
California would benefit from enactment of this legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Becerra, a staunch advocate for immigrants, would toughen federal rules to 
protect from workplace discrimination Latinos, Asian Americans and other legal 
U.S. residents who may look or sound foreign. His bill would expand federal 
authority to investigate discrimination complaints that arise in connection 
with employers' required checking of the immigration status of workers. Another 
bill by Becerra would establish a federal review board to investigate civil 
rights abuses by federal agents. Both bills are needed to protect citizens and 
legal residents from the improper treatment that can result from overzealous 
efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 By eliminating a backlog in the naturalization and swearing-in process, a bill 
sponsored principally by Farr would encourage more immigrants who reside here 
legally to become citizens. Legal residents who seek U.S. citizenship would 
also benefit from the additional English and civics instruction provided for in 
a bill pushed by Roybal-Allard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each of these bills has a primary sponsor, the packaging of the 
legislation reflects a team effort that encourages rational debate on a 
hot-button issue. This constructive approach to the immigration issue merits 
support both in Washington and at home.

CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS; IF YOU TAKE THE HIGH PROFILE, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO DUCK 
THE TOUGH QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton holds no constitutional or appointed office, 
but she has vastly expanded the traditional role of a President's wife. The 
scope of her public duties no doubt has heightened the furor surrounding the 
questions about her role and judgment years ago in a real estate deal called 
Whitewater. Mrs. Clinton has begun to selectively address media inquiries about 
Whitewater. She needs to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that Mrs. Clinton is a professional of high standing and 
credentials. Hillary Rodham Clinton, a graduate of one of the nation's top law 
schools and a deeply knowledgeable student of public policy, is in many ways an 
enigma to America. She both dazzles and puzzles. Her sterling command of health 
care issues and the President's health care plan before Congress last year was 
truly impressive; that image clashes so with last December's photo spread in 
Vogue magazine featuring Mrs. Clinton in movie-star-like poses. Similarly, her 
quest for privacy, including her original foot-dragging on the Whitewater 
matter, has clashed with her high-profile activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Her assignment to such big policy issues as health care reform has placed her 
in a gray area of government, with ill-defined duties, responsibilities and 
accountability to the public. That fuzzy role, extending far beyond the past 
conventions of a First Lady, makes her an easy target for political critics and 
rough questioning by the media. Having said that, it must also be said that she 
can't have it both ways: the big issues and the big influence on the one hand 
and immunity from scrutiny on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mrs. Clinton is going to play the Washington game, she has to step up and 
take the fastballs from the people and the press. She has to do more of what 
she has started to do this week: answer the questions, even hostile ones. 
Otherwise Hillary Clinton may, by ducking the hard questions, lose her 
credibility in staking out the tough issues.

GENETIC EXPLANATIONS: A TWO-EDGED SWORD; IS OUR SEXUAL AND BEHAVIORAL FATE IN 
OUR GENES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seldom has science been so wrong, and so misused, as when it has come to 
fathoming the biological basis of human behavior. Genetics spawned the 
misguided eugenics movement early this century in America and Europe. Thousands 
of the "feeble-minded" were sterilized under U.S. law, mostly in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice ultimately was abandoned, but not before Germany copied the 
California law in its program to eliminate "defective" genes, part of the 
grotesque Nazi ethic that would underlie the effort to exterminate Jews, 
Gypsies and others. More recently, scientists erroneously linked violent 
antisocial behavior among men to an abnormal extra Y chromosome. Many men with 
the chromosome indeed were in jail, but actually the condition correlated with 
mild retardation, not criminality per se. 
</P>
<P>
 SCIENCE IN LAW: Now the powerful tools of modern biology have added a complex 
wrinkle to the heated public debate over gay rights. Two years ago, Simon 
LeVay, a neurobiologist then at the Salk Institute, discovered that a part of 
the hypothalamus was much smaller in the brains of gay men than heterosexual 
ones. And last year, Dean H. Hamer of the National Cancer Institute examined 
the chromosomes of 40 pairs of brothers who were gay and found that far more 
than a chance percentage of them had identical snippets of genes inherited from 
their mothers on their X chromosome; this suggested that male homosexuality is 
rooted, at least partly, in genes. 
</P>
<P>
 These findings are hard to interpret and remain to be confirmed, and they have 
been attacked from some quarters because LeVay and Hamer are openly gay. 
However, evidence accrues that homosexuality is immutable, not a personal 
choice. If so, that could bolster the argument that homosexuals should enjoy 
the legal protections that forbid discrimination based on race or gender. On 
the other hand, this research could also be used to try to "cure" 
homosexuality, to screen out homosexuals from the military or insurance 
coverage, to abort fetuses carrying a "gay gene." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamer argues that sexual orientation is unlikely to be inherited like eye 
color, that it probably is caused by a intricate mix of genetic and 
environmental factors. Human sexuality is not an either-or matter, given the 
incidence of bisexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists say that to prevent public misunderstanding, such research 
should not be published until fully confirmed. That is an issue that will 
sharpen as the federal Human Genome Project, which is attempting to chart the 
entire human genetic map, uncovers the genetic underpinnings of thousands of 
traits and disorders, opening the possibility of curing many inherited 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Research results should not be withheld. But in absorbing this data it must be 
kept in mind that the mechanisms of human inheritance invariably have turned 
out to be far more complicated than originally imagined. Some ask, for example, 
why homosexuality is so widespread in the human and animal realms even though 
homosexuals seldom reproduce, and they suggest that the genetic basis of 
homosexuality may be linked to other traits, some highly desirable, such as 
creativity. Would you have aborted the fetuses that grew into Michelangelo or 
Tchaikovsky? 
</P>
<P>
 MORALITY IN LAW: Whatever the basis of homosexuality, it is foolish to think 
that good science will abolish homophobia. Skin color and gender obviously are 
governed by genetics but that has not wiped out racism and sexism. Gay rights 
activists skate on thin ice when they resort to science. Wise advice comes from 
Daniel J. Kevles, a historian at Caltech who argues that claims to social or 
legal rights should be based on morality and principle rather than inconclusive 
biology. As science peels away layer after layer of the biology that supports 
human behavior and expression, we should remember how science has been abused 
out of evil or ignorance.

STEEL-FRAME BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a once-qualified structural engineer, I was intrigued and somewhat appalled 
by the article "Steel-Frame Building Cracks Spur Wider Damage Fears" (Feb. 27). 
Admittedly, it may not be possible to predict the magnitude, displacement and 
rate of application of earthquake forces with any accuracy, but I could wonder 
if the lateral forces that are actually designed for are really taken 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 If the illustration is representative, it seems to me that the vertical and 
static loads and weights are well provided for in the classic rigid corner 
frame design. However, lateral loads -- a considerable fraction of the weight 
of the building -- are resisted by beam and column bending moments which are a 
maximum at the joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Welds are cooled and hardened melted metal (cast condition) and are most 
efficient and reliable in compression and in shear (preventing one piece from 
sliding on another). In tension (pulling apart), welds are relatively 
inefficient and tend to crack. No one would think of systematically cutting 
through the lower flange of a crossbeam and re-welding without a splice plate 
with shear welds to take up the tension. However, this is exactly what is done 
at all the corners, with either the top flange or the bottom flange in tension 
at the column weld when bending occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that the potential strength of the joint could be developed by 
welding a flat plate to the stiffener and to the edge of the beam flange, 
converting the flange load, tension or compression, to shear in the column web. 
If the beams and columns are different widths, the column flanges could be 
slotted. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not one standard of construction for all required design loads, static, 
seismic and wind force?

MIDDLE EAST EXTREMISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your March 8 editorial urging the Israeli government to evict a few hundred or 
few thousand Jewish settlers of Judea and Samaria makes an ironic point, which 
has long been a cornerstone of PLO policy. In that view, Arabs have the right 
to live in Israel, as attested by the 700,000 Arab Israeli citizens. Further, 
Arabs who fled Israel during the 1948 war should have the right of return to 
Israel, to cities such as Jaffa, Tel Aviv, Haifa, etc. But Arab areas are to be 
Judenrein -- free of Jews, who are to have no right to live in areas claimed by 
Arabs, such as the West Bank or East Jerusalem, despite the 3,000 years of 
Jewish presence. 
</P>
<P>
 This view, to which you give support on pragmatic grounds, flows logically 
from the long-held and widely publicized pronouncements of the Arab League and 
the PLO that Israel is an alien presence among the Arab nations -- an 
undesirable island in an Arab sea, which must ultimately be submerged. This 
view, which is in Arab textbooks and is taught in the schools of all Arab 
nations, is the ultimate bar to real peace in the area, not the Jewish 
residents of the territories.

 Reading Rabbi Robert L. Wolkoff's thoughtful discussion of factors underlying 
the Hebron massacre ("The Clash of Darkness and Light," Commentary, March 3), I 
am driven to two conclusions about Middle East affairs; one general, one 
specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, rationally thinking Middle Easterners, Arabs and Jews alike, would 
do well to rein in their more fanatical brethren so that something even 
resembling civilized living can return to that part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Israel should remain a democracy instead of, as some wish, 
transforming itself into a theocratic state.

 The commentary by Rabbi David Eliezrie ("Jews Have Long Suffered in Hebron," 
March 1) contained several disputable points. Rabbi Eliezrie failed to realize 
that the Kach movement is an organized terrorist organization that eulogized 
Baruch Goldstein as a martyr and that embraces the expulsion and bloodshed of 
Arabs ("1 million Arabs are not worth the fingernail of a Jew"). 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi also failed to realize that Palestine was illegally settled by 
Jewish terrorist organizations, such as the Irgun and the Stern Gang, who 
slaughtered entire villages and expelled Arab residents from their homes. He 
states that the Israeli government has failed to protect its citizens from 
terrorism. That is true. No police made an attempt to protect the Muslim 
worshipers from Goldstein's abhorrent act. The Israeli government continues to 
treat the Israeli Arabs as second-class citizens.

 Hanan Ashrawi, in her interview with Nathan Gardels (Commentary, March 2), has 
laid to rest any question about the PLO agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oslo accord is not sacred and has many flaws," she declared. If this 
accord -- the Declaration of Principles -- is not "sacred," then it follows 
that it can be cast aside. Consequently, PLO leader Yasser Arafat's signature 
on any agreement is only a worthless, uneven line of ink; and the PLO will 
continue its quest for the immediate formation of a Palestinian state without 
any intervening period of time to evaluate the progress toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, those Israelis with misgivings about the PLO's intention to live 
up to the agreement are being proved correct.

 Re "Child Care a Key Hurdle to Clinton Welfare Plan," March 6: 
</P>
<P>
 When will our country get realistic? Raising children is a full-time job. 
Instead of providing child-care centers for welfare mothers to teach them to 
work at male-oriented tasks, welfare should mandate that parents who are 
unemployed attend week-long classes on parenting, food preparation, 
decision-making and constructive use of time with their children. In other 
words, pay them for the job they are doing ineffectively at home while teaching 
them how to do it more effectively. These are the skills I found lacking in the 
dysfunctional young women I worked with for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The skills can be taught in neighborhood classrooms by peer role models 
trained in behavior modification methods using sophisticated computer 
techniques. This will give students skills that will be marketable when the two 
years of welfare benefits have elapsed. Children must be involved in the 
learning process, solving the child care dilemma. We have the woman-power, 
we're just using it in a male-dominated paradigm that has proven to be 
unsuccessful.

 President Clinton's welfare task force will allow two years of benefits before 
requesting a recipient to get a job. Where does the father fit into this 
training plan? Why not help him make something of his life? Make a man of 
himself and find work to support his girlfriend and child. How about "a public 
job such as some form of community service"? 
</P>
<P>
 The $7 billion over five years could be spent on teaching young people trades, 
educating them and teaching them how to look for opportunity. Let's all "escape 
from welfare" and teach the guys and girls some preventive measures. Make the 
Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) program mandatory for unmarried girls. 
Let's hunt down deadbeat dads and make them accountable. If taxpayers are going 
to spend $7 billion training these girls to work, let's educate them and give 
their kids some self-esteem. If we can't afford it, well, we've all had to 
sling hash at some time or another.

...OR IS RETAIL REVITALIZATION THE KEY?; DEVELOPMENT: STORES AND SERVICES WILL

By MAXINE WATERS, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) is a member of the House 
Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Small 
Business. She lives in the affected neighborhood.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, Vermont Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles was a dynamic 
commercial strip that served the community from Figueroa to Arlington and from 
Slauson to Imperial Highway. You could find car dealerships and doctors' and 
lawyers' offices. You could bank at any of several branches and shop at J.C. 
Penney's. There were supermarkets and furniture stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the 1970s, Pepperdine University closed its campus on Vermont and 
moved to Malibu. Ford and General Motors, Goodyear and Firestone closed up 
shop, laying off workers. With the area in decline, shoppers opted for the Fox 
Hills, Hawthorne and Del Amo malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, we have an opportunity to re-create a neighborhood retail and 
commercial center that could enhance the quality of life and boost the economic 
viability of South-Central. I have been working closely with the Vermont 
Knolls/Vermont-Manchester Vicinity Assn., representing the surrounding 
neighborhoods, to promote just such development. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacle to the kind of development the community wants is First 
Interstate Bank. First Interstate owns the first option on a key property, the 
former Pepperdine administration building at Vermont Avenue and 81st Street. 
The bank is insisting on building low- to moderate-income housing on the site 
instead of dedicating it to commercial development, despite strong opposition 
from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe a new housing project on this parcel is not the best use of a unique 
property. It is zoned for commercial use. The census tract adjoining the 
property has an 11% housing vacancy rate. There are existing apartment 
buildings just east of Vermont that are sorely in need of rehabilitation. Why 
not invest scarce resources in rehab rather than starting from scratch? 
</P>
<P>
 In no way is this a "not-in-my-backyard" kind of attitude on the part of the 
community. Rather, it is a question of allowing the community to make judgments 
on the kind of development most appropriate to this particular property. 
Vermont is the only South-Central street that connects to the Santa Monica and 
Century freeways. There is discussion of running future light-rail lines down 
Vermont. All this enhances the argument for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Census, the tract adjacent to the property in question 
boasts an aggregate income of $59 million -- or $32,250 a year per household. 
The unemployment rate, at 9%, is comparable to statewide rates. There is a 
strong unmet demand in these neighborhoods for goods and services -- a demand 
sufficient to support a new retail and commercial area. Such developments have 
succeeded in Pasadena's Old Town and in Larchmont Village. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate should listen to what the community is saying. Instead, the 
bank has turned a deaf ear. That is not surprising, given that First Interstate 
has been criticized by the California Greenlining Coalition for its lack of 
lending to African Americans. According to the coalition, 332 First Interstate 
branches gave a total of 337 loans to African Americans in all of 1990. Their 
data showed that even affluent African Americans were turned down for loans at 
rates 50% higher than whites. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for First Interstate Bank to either listen to the community and 
respect the community or to get out of the way. Community Build, the Los 
Angeles grass-roots rebuilding coalition, has offered to buy out First 
Interstate's option. SRP Investments, a consortium based in Columbus, Ohio, has 
pledged to work with the community on planning and design and to assemble a 
financial package of up to $40 million. During a walking tour in January, 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros pledged his agency's 
support for Vermont Avenue commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 We can restore Vermont Avenue as a vibrant retail and commercial area. This 
will create jobs and provide sorely needed goods and services for a 
neighborhood of working people with money to spend. We can have commercial 
development and boost low- to moderate-income housing in the area. All it takes 
is listening to the folks who live there. It's as simple as that.

SOUTH-CENTRAL DEBATE: IS GOOD HOUSING CRITICAL . . .; DEVELOPMENT: IT'S NOT A

 Healthy neighborhoods require key elements: jobs and incomes sufficient to 
raise families; access to jobs (both in and outside the neighborhood); stores 
and banks; schools and parks; health-care facilities and safe, decent 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 No city -- certainly not Los Angeles -- can prosper without an adequate supply 
of affordable housing. Businesses will not come, stay and grow if they cannot 
house their work forces, no matter how many police patrol the streets. Retail 
will suffer if many households continue to pay more than half their incomes for 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the slump in prices and rents, Los Angeles still has the widest gap 
between wages and housing prices of any major city. Most of the region's rental 
vacancies are for higher-priced one- and two-bedroom units, while the need is 
for moderately priced three- and four-bedroom units. There are long waiting 
lists for the city's small stock of subsidized units. Each year, the city loses 
almost 14,000 units of affordable housing to deteriorating stock and 
demolition, while producing fewer than 5,000 units. Before the earthquake, Los 
Angeles had the dubious distinction of having the worst affordable housing 
crisis in the country. The earthquake demolished more than 25,000 units, 93% of 
them multifamily and largely affordable. Los Angeles now has the worst 
affordable housing crisis with the largest pile of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 It is incredible that in this situation there are those who would argue 
against affordable housing. Opponents to housing cite high vacancy rates -- 
rates that stem from renters' lack of income, not overproduction of stock. In 
times of tight budgets, we have debates about whether housing is less important 
than education, less important than police or transportation -- indeed, even 
whether housing is less important than investment in economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over a portion of Vermont Avenue at 81st Street -- whether to 
include housing in a mixed-use development or have the entire portion dedicated 
to economic development -- is not about whether to revitalize a neighborhood, 
but how. This debate will be decided in the community, but the argument that 
the affordable housing being proposed is "the easy way out" is not in the best 
interest of the community, nor is it factual. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing has, tentatively, been put on the public agenda as a result of 
advocacy by community-development organizations and residents. Banks are now 
required to invest in low-income communities because of their Community 
Reinvestment Act responsibilities, and they invest in housing because advocates 
have demanded they do so. A city Housing Department was created because 
advocates demanded attention to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the organizations that carried out this advocacy are nonprofit 
development corporations. They do housing and they do economic development. 
They do not do one because it is easy; they do both because it is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has the potential to both build more affordable housing and create 
more economic development (and we must not forget that housing production is 
economic development). A strong "community development" agenda for the city 
would include initiatives such as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Forming a "community partnership" to bring businesses, government and 
nonprofits together to undertake both housing and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a housing trust fund supported by a linkage fee on commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encouraging the city's major lenders to form more bank-sponsored 
community-development corporations, such as the one now under way in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 * Working with banks to build branches in inner-city neighborhoods. Experience 
in other cities, such as Boston, demonstrates that branches in low-income areas 
can be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Implementing a "linked deposits" policy. Like Pittsburgh, Chicago and 
Boston, Los Angeles should research and publish an annual banking "report 
card," including mortgage lending, branch sites and employment. The city's own 
deposits should be in banks with a track record of meeting neighborhood needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing support to grass-roots credit unions that focus on promoting 
neighborhood businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating elected neighborhood councils with real decision-making power 
regarding community development. 
</P>
<P>
 We lost thousands of jobs in the April, 1992, unrest. We lost thousands of 
housing units in the earthquake. Our communities continue to deteriorate. We 
need to build affordable housing -- for shelter and as an economic development 
tool. We need to invest in economic development and create more jobs. And we 
need to do it now.

THE TARRED FEATHERS OF HATE; BEYOND FARRAKHAN AND ANTI-SEMITISM, THERE ARE 
ISSUES OF DIVISION AND UNITY THAT ALL AMERICANS MUST FACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE ADLER MARKS, Marlene Adler Marks is a columnist for the Jewish 
Journal of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All race hatred is essentially equal, if not at inception, then in result. 
Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, the Palestinian extremist group Hamas, and lately, 
Louis Farrakhan and Baruch Goldstein, all are filled with the virus of loathing 
some objectified "other." In fulfillment of that loathing, some use ovens, some 
use only words.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Jewish community reels from both the Farrakhan controversy and the 
massacre in Hebron, it is not for Jews alone to explore the meaning of hate. 
There is no doubt that many critics of the Jewish community would like this to 
happen. They urge us to discriminate between really dangerous speech (David 
Duke) and presumably impotent rage (Farrakhan). This presumes that hate is a 
problem only for Jews. Not so. In fact, if there is a reason why the Jewish 
community came down so heavily on Farrakhan aide Khalid Abdul Muhammad, it was 
that Muhammad's speech was filled with venom from across the spectrum, 
including Catholics and gays. If nothing else, the Jewish community was trying 
to establish a bottom line on interethnic relations: Hate speech is not to be 
tolerated, not merely because it not good manners, but because it leads 
inevitably to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, that effort has backfired. Weeks of stories and TV shows about the 
Nation of Islam leader have turned an issue about racial hate on its head. It 
is Jewish leaders who have been marginalized, not Farrakhan, and the matter 
turned into a question of whether blacks have enough self-respect to reject 
alleged Jewish intrusion into the African American agenda. This has only 
intensified since the Hebron massacre. Compared with the American-born Jewish 
killer, critics say, Farrakhan's followers pose not much danger at all.  
</P>
<P>
 But America must establish some common ground on hate, not to distinguish 
one's own devil from others', but to learn from one another's mistakes. Here's 
where we might start: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hate speech is dangerous. The American Jewish community went through a 
20-year effort to isolate Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose "Never Again!" slogan was 
first used against African Americans in Brooklyn. Jews pushed Kahane out of the 
country, thinking Israel would make short shrift of him. But in Israel, he 
found fertile soil among that small segment of the settler movement that 
grounds itself in fanaticism. As the Jewish community mourns with Palestinians 
for the atrocities committed in Kahane's name, American Jews worry: What more 
could we have done? Hate is a weed, and you never can tell when it's out. As 
for potent vs. impotent hate, remember that a failed Austrian painter turned 
into Der Fuhrer.  
</P>
<P>
 * Unity has costs. Here's an issue with wide impact beyond African Americans 
and Jews, currently preoccupying, for example, the Latino community in Los 
Angeles. Is it wise to use xenophobic politics to bring one's own group 
together? Does one reject all criticism by outsiders as "meddling?" Certainly 
the Jewish community, with its intense interest in Israel and anti-Semitism, 
has not been above using fear of others as a galvanizing force. America's 
liberal Jews struggled against charges of "traitor" when criticizing Likud's 
"break the bones" policy against West Bank Palestinians. But there are times 
when achieving a united front is critical and times when breaking ranks is the 
higher good. 
</P>
<P>
 * The need for coalition remains. Hate speech, even that presumed innocent of 
violent intent, keeps people at arm's length. That's why the call to denounce 
Farrakhan was so crucial for the Jewish community. In the search for coalition 
partners with common values, some claim to be able to listen to anti-Semitic 
hate speech while also working for the common good across ethnic lines. It's a 
hard sell. For Jews, it has been breathtaking to discover how frequently 
significant policy disputes are accompanied by a blase anti-Semitism that we 
are expected to grin and bear. Jewish leaders have traditionally restrained 
their response in the interest of solidarity and good will with others. No 
more. Bad deeds, says the Talmud, are like an open pillow case; you never know 
where the feathers will land. In the instances of Farrakhan and the Hebron 
massacre, the feathers have flown home.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; EXAMINING A THIN SLICE OF RUSSIA'S BOLSHEVIK RED PERIOD; 
RUSSIA UNDER THE BOLSHEVIK REGIME BY RICHARD PIPES ; KNOPF, $35, 608 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite our brief but bright hopes, history did not end with the fall of the 
Soviet bloc, as we are sharply reminded by Harvard historian Richard Pipes in 
"Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Pipes shows us that history has reasserted itself with a vengeance. 
The bloodthirsty nationalism and raw ethnic violence now ravaging Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union were only concealed behind the vast Potemkin 
Village of the Bolshevik regime and the Soviet empire that it created. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsheviks, like the czar before them, ruled over a "prison house of 
nations" whose inmates spoke 85 languages and dialects. Under the guise of a 
Marxist revolution, Pipes explains, the Bolsheviks managed only to suppress -- 
but not eradicate -- the religious, ethnic and national identities of various 
subject peoples, including Poles and Germans, Ukrainians and Georgians, 
Turkestanis and Kazakhistanis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenin, who had no difficulty in changing tactics when necessary, decided now 
to abandon . . . the principle of national self-determination in favor of 
federalism," Pipes writes.  
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, the Soviets were only a facade to conceal the true sovereign, the 
Communist Party. The result would be formal federalism, with all the trimmings 
of statehood, presumably able to satisfy the aspirations of the non-Russian 
peoples, concealing a rigidly centralized dictatorship centered in Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime," the third in a series of related books by 
Pipes, is a disciplined work of scholarship that focuses on a rather narrow 
slice of Russian history, starting with the consolidation of power after the 
1917 revolution and ending with the death of Lenin in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipes describes in detail the campaigns of the civil war, the holy war against 
religious and intellectual freedom, the cynical experiments in a free market 
under the so-called New Economic Policy, and the furious efforts at inventing 
the first totalitarian regime of the 20th Century -- an invention, Pipes 
argues, that served as a model for Mussolini, Hitler and the enduring remnants 
of fascism.

 "The effect of the Communists' activities at home and abroad was not to 
unleash a global revolution, but, paradoxically, to give rise to movements that 
assimilated their spirit and copied their methods," Pipes writes. "No prominent 
Europeans socialist before World War I resembled Lenin more closely than Benito 
Mussolini." 
</P>
<P>
 Pipes refuses to paint Lenin and Trotsky in warmer tones than Stalin. Indeed, 
he credits the Old Bolsheviks with creating the apparatus of terror that Stalin 
used with such devastating effect in the '30s and '40s -- and he points out 
that Soviet flirtation with the German military machine in the '20s allowed the 
future leaders of the Wehrmacht to perfect their weapons and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tactics which formed the basis of Hitler's Blitzkrieg," he writes, "were 
first tested on Soviet soil." 
</P>
<P>
 The work is enriched in intriguing ways by the author's access to the 
once-secret archives of the Soviet Union. We learn that Lenin used to prescribe 
drugs for himself from the Kremlin pharmacy, and Pipes shows us that Stalin 
managed to consolidate his growing power even during Lenin's lifetime precisely 
because the ailing dictator was entrusted to Stalin's cynical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pipes downplays the importance of the newly opened archives in the 
study of contemporary Russian history, and he insists that "in not a single 
instance did it compel me to revise views, which I had formed on the basis of 
printed sources and archives located in the West." And he is not shy about 
pronouncing judgment on the vast enterprise of the Bolsheviks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judged in terms of its own aspirations, the Communist regime was a monumental 
failure: It succeeded in one thing only -- staying in power," Pipes concludes. 
"At every stage of its history, the Communist regime in Russia did whatever it 
had to do to beat off challengers, without regard to Marxist doctrine even as 
it cloaked its actions with Marxist slogans. Lenin succeeded precisely because 
he was free of . . . Marxist scruples." 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment of history, of course, is that the Bolsheviks failed even at 
staying in power. We are shown that Russia and the other subject peoples of the 
former Soviet Union paid a terrible price for the temporary success of the 
Bolsheviks, and a still more terrible price for their failures. That is the 
real subtext -- and the timely message -- of "Russia Under the Bolshevik 
Regime."

 'Cosby Mysteries' to Go Weekly: Bill Cosby is returning to weekly TV. Network 
sources have confirmed that "The Cosby Mysteries," which were to have aired 
four times a year in the form of two-hour movies, will become a weekly drama

himself, who is said to prefer an hourlong format. The first "Cosby Mysteries" 
movie aired in January, and several of its cast members, including James 
Naughton and Lynn Whitfield, will return for the series.

 Charges in Swedish Theft: Three young men were charged in Stockholm Tuesday in 
connection with Sweden's biggest art heist -- the theft from Stockholm's Modern 
Museum last November of five Picasso paintings, a Picasso bronze sculpture and 
two works by French cubist Georges Braque. Polish citizen Krystian Marczak, 25, 
was charged with theft and his 24-year-old brother Erwin, a Swedish citizen, 
was charged with handling stolen goods. Another Swede, Kenneth Vikstrom, 23, 
also was charged with theft. Police said they are still trying to determine if 
others were involved. Thieves sawed a hole in the museum's roof, lowered 
themselves into the building and escaped with the artworks, valued at more than 
$60 million. Three lesser-known Picassos were found virtually undamaged in 
December but the other more famous works are still at large. A Swedish 
newspaper has reported that the best-known stolen Picasso, the 1921 oil 
painting "La Source," has been smuggled out of Sweden by a diplomat and sold to 
a foreign collector for $1.8 million. POP/ROCK

 Violence Hits Home for Rapper: With several rappers charged lately with 
committing acts of violence, including murder, the New York rap band Wu-Tang 
Clan was on the receiving end of violence this week. Group member U-God's 
2-year-old young son, Dante Hawkins, is in intensive care with a destroyed 
kidney following a gunshot wound sustained Sunday while playing outdoors in the 
Staten Island area. The group, which has been criticized by some for its 
"hard-core" rap, issued a statement Tuesday saying: "Unfortunately, it takes 
incidents such as this tragedy for people to realize that what we rap about is 
reality, and if that is HARD then perhaps it is time for this country to wake 
up. Tragedies like children getting shot while they are playing won't go away 
until people are ready to make a change." QUICK TAKES

THEATER REVIEWS; SMALL-SCALE 'GRAPES OF WRATH' LOSES EPIC BREADTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most impressive thing about Frank Galati's adaptation of "The Grapes of 
Wrath" may be the way he keeps faith with the book's epic sweep. John 
Steinbeck's famous novel about rural yearning during the Great Depression comes 
at you with size and melodramatic vision, and it's remarkable how well Galati 
was able to suggest that on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a legion of naysayers who thought it couldn't be done, Galati brought 
his version to Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company in 1988 and later moved it 
to Broadway, where the show won a Tony Award for best play of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Galati's adaptation has become the standard for any theater group, 
big or small, that wants to do Steinbeck. To be successful, you have to give it 
room and a certain Dust Bowl grandeur; being economical just won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what we get at Orange Coast College, which opened last weekend with 
a hemmed-in production based on Galati's staging. There's not much space to 
work with in the Drama Lab Theatre, and director Alex Golson and set designer 
David Scaglione respond by paring everything down. It's clear they didn't have 
much of a budget to work with, and that's one of the problems. Galati's "The 
Grapes of Wrath" requires more than a little extravagance, earthy and 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 A good contrast -- and one that shows how well a college drama department can 
tackle "The Grapes of Wrath" -- is the production Cal State Fullerton mounted a 
year ago. Director Don Finn and a group of talented student actors and 
technicians offered a production full of ambience and breadth, all the while 
capitalizing on Galati's stage ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 The floorboards, almost magically, opened up to become several things, from 
campfires to graves to the Colorado River, where characters splashed about in a 
ritualized bathing scene. At OCC, Golson and Scaglione incorporate the same 
inventions, but they're rudimentary. When their river materializes, you have 
the sense it's merely a basin under the stage, not something more evocative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is Lonnie Alcaraz's lighting, which could do more to 
generate a mood that inspires the viewer's imagination to take over. On the 
other hand, Donna Mae Dickens' costumes are excellent, giving the production a 
much-needed aura of authenticity. Her clothes look as soiled and vulnerable as 
the lives of the Joad family that wears them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens' details work, but few others do in this production. Perhaps the most 
distracting feature is the cardboard representation of the wheezing, 
broken-down truck the Joads journey in from Dust Bowl Oklahoma to the lush, but 
cruel, fields of California. With it's bug-eyed headlights and caricatured 
look, the truck seems like something out of Disneyland's new Roger Rabbit's Car 
Toon Spin ride. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the acting, there's zealousness from top to bottom; too bad there's not 
more finesse as well. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Agnew provides Tom with a degree of rough-hewn humanism, but the 
portrayal lacks depth. We want more from him, as we do from the rest of the 
cast. The performances are soft and folksy, and we don't always feel the 
resignation that comes with their hardship. In this family, there's a little 
too much Waltons and not enough Joads.

THEATER REVIEWS; ERRORS OF COMEDY; AT SADDLEBACK, THE CLASSIC 'BOYS FROM 
SYRACUSE' FALLS SHORT OF THE HIGH STYLE RODGERS & HART INTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "If it's good enough for Shakespeare, it's good enough for us" is the authors' 
disclaimer at the top of "The Boys From Syracuse" at Saddleback College's 
McKinney Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 We could amplify that to "and if it's good enough for Rodgers & Hart, it's 
good enough for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz Hart was, with Cole Porter, the ultimately sophisticated lyricist of 
the 20th Century, obsessed by inner rhymes, intellectual puns and often by 
flawless lyric poetry. Richard Rodgers wrote more interesting music to Hart's 
patterns than he ever did to that corn-fed simplist Oscar Hammerstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The individuality of their combined talents in its giddy heyday was never more 
evident than in the light-fingered, escapist score they wrote for "The Boys 
From Syracuse," George Abbott's 1938 adaptation of Shakespeare's "The Comedy of 
Errors." 
</P>
<P>
 Two immortal love songs came from this score: "This Can't Be Love" and 
"Falling in Love With Love." The team's comic genius flowed into "He and She," 
their shameless will to entertain in the riotous "Sing for Your Supper." 
</P>
<P>
 Any revival of this classic -- an example of the pure fun of musical comedy in 
a Great Depression that desperately needed a laugh -- has to have a sense of 
humor, boundless energy and, most important, high style. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Gregory de Silva's staging definitely has its tongue in its cheek and 
enough energy to light up the city of Ephesus on a dark night. 
</P>
<P>
 But except for a few of the principals, there is little style here, presumably 
because those without it were never told how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 To some it comes naturally. To begin with, conductor (and musical director 
with de Silva) Lee Kreter knows the Broadway sound and gets it from his 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also generally tuned into the tempos, although sometimes inclined to give 
the ballads an anachronistic gentleness, particularly in "You Have Cast Your 
Shadow on the Sea." In the show's period, even love songs had verve. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Style also comes naturally to Edward Snyder as Antipholus of Syracuse and his 
Dromio, John Petersen. Snyder has a fine, raucous comic sense and a vibrant 
musical-comedy voice that's perfect for the period, while Petersen knows his 
way around physical humor that comes out of character. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stauffacher is close to the mark as Antipholus of Ephesus but is 
enough distant from high style to take the edge off his performance. His 
Dromio, Tony Houghton, also knows his shtick, but it's just that, without a 
developed character to bolster it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a fine, period-style feel to the performances of Susan Crouse as 
Luciana, sister to Adrian (Olivia Anderson) who is the wife of Antipholus of 
Ephesus, and Beth Ann Monaco as Luce, shrewish wife of Dromio of Ephesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouse and Monaco have fine voices for the genre and understand the style. 
Anderson, like Stauffacher, is close on, but hasn't yet relaxed into the aura 
of the era. In the supporting cast, the style is best captured by Matthew John 
Snyder, as both the strait-laced Duke of Ephesus and the big-voiced but 
puppy-dog Sergeant who drags Antipholus of Syracuse off to the slammer in "Come 
With Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Huntoon's entertaining settings are versatile and of the period, but 
Charles Castagno's costumes are ugly on both men and women and have little to 
do with either ancient Greece or '30s musical comedy; the two Antipholuses look 
like they're dressed for some lodge initiation. And Susan Errickson's 
unimaginative choreography looks recycled from an old Arthur Murray class. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BIG HEAD FULL OF THE HEARTLAND; TODD & THE MONSTERS PLEASE A 
YOUNG CROWD AT THE COACH HOUSE WITH EARNEST EMOTION, BUT THEY HAVE ROOM TO 
GROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For several years now, heartland rock has been on life support. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of the grunge-alternative movement seemed to turn the page on the Bob 
Segers, Bruce Springsteens, Tom Pettys and John Mellencamps who dominated the 
charts for most of the 1980s but have seen recent releases fall short -- 
sometimes far short -- of their accustomed blue-chip results. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, though, the old heartland sound has been registering renewed vital 
signs, thanks to CPR administered by younger bands and younger fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting Crows is perched in the Top 10 with "August & Everything After," a 
platinum album full of Petty-ish vocals. Its breakthrough hit, "Mr. Jones," was 
a knockoff of "Wild Night" by Van Morrison, one of the heartland rock 
movement's prime precursors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come Big Head Todd & the Monsters, whose first album for a major label, 
"Sister Sweetly," has just topped the gold sales mark of 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado trio played to a packed house of mainly college-age fans at the 
Coach House on Monday night. It won ovation after ovation for an approach 
practically bursting with earnest, fervent emotional expression (a heartland 
staple) while taking musical cues from some of the same roots-rock antecedents 
that inspired the big-name heartlanders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bandleader Todd Park Mohr -- a strapping fellow who is big all over, not just 
above the shoulders -- had a husky, drawling, passionate delivery that sounded, 
at various moments, like Springsteen, Seger, John Hiatt, Eric Clapton or some 
combination of the Band's Levon Helm and Rick Danko. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly two-hour show hit a few impressive peaks provided by a smattering 
of well-wrought songs (especially the winsome "Bittersweet") and Mohr's ability 
to achieve liftoff at least occasionally with his fast-flurrying, 
Hendrix-inspired guitar work. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the evening showed that, while they are promising in several 
respects, Mohr and his band-mates -- drummer Brian Nevin and bassist Rob 
Squires -- still have a lot of craft to learn before they can measure up to any 
of heartland rock's heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr needs to become a more varied and resourceful guitarist, especially if he 
is going to remain the point man in a trio. While he was hot enough to ignite 
the audience with emphatic, flurrying explosions, hot was his only temperature. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr's fret work quickly became repetitious as he stuck with the same thick, 
throaty guitar sounds and the same wailing, chordal solos. Mohr has mastered 
the trick of twiddling a volume knob to get a sob-like, bowed-string vibrato 
effect. It's a nice card if you play it once; he tediously dealt it four or 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
 He proved himself a sometimes powerful but ultimately unimaginative and 
one-dimensional player, and that's not especially good news for a trio. Mohr 
has the hefty throb but needs a Nils Lofgren-type sidekick to complement him 
with more nimble, stinging, cleanly etched counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 The sultry, funk-based number "Sister Sweetly" especially could have used some 
coy, slinky, sexy touches instead of Mohr's blatant wah-wah wailing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nevin and Squires were serviceable if unremarkable players. It was no help at 
all that Nevin's massive drum kit was over-miked, leading to a dense sound mix 
that intruded on Mohr's vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr's material worked best when the melodies allowed him to soar into his 
emotive high range. Meditations on failing relationships made up the bulk of 
the show, although several songs showed an ability to work on a larger canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dinner With Ivan" (which nicked a riff from Elton John's "Love Lies Bleeding" 
and borrowed other stormy licks from Dire Straits) was a caustic narrative in 
which Mohr loses patience with a friend's self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellis Island" effectively conveyed sorrow over soured American dreams. 
"Monument in Green" was an epic lament for the bloody past and environmentally 
fallen present of the American West, told (in an imaginative stroke) by the 
now-disillusioned ghost of a pioneer who had thought that the harsh means he 
took in his lifetime would lead to more fruitful ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr followed that stormy epic with a laid-back version of "Everyday People," 
Sly & the Family Stone's hopeful broadside against bigotry. In a nice touch, 
Mohr, who comes from Korean stock, dabbed a distinctive musical touch of his 
own onto this R & B anthem for a rainbow coalition: His concluding guitar solo 
had a distinctively East Asian cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his flashy, guitar-gladiator moves (shaking the guitar neck until 
it almost choked, slashing dramatically at the strings with his strumming 
hand), Mohr was a restrained performer who confined himself between songs to 
broad smiles and sincere expressions of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Humor wasn't high on the agenda, but it did turn up in a partly fond but 
primarily joking rendition of the Nat King Cole chestnut "Mona Lisa." After a 
bleary, crooned intro that sounded like Tony Bennett on a bender, the band 
cranked the song out rockabilly style. 
</P>
<P>
 Give them credit for the idea and the attempt, but it would have been much 
better if they could have made it swing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Freddy Jones Band, a Chicago band with nobody named Freddy Jones in it, 
opened with a fine display of musicianship. Churning, coursing rhythms conveyed 
a sense of purposeful but free-ranging motion, while an excellent guitar tandem 
worked in a country and blues tradition carved out by the likes of the Grateful 
Dead and the Allman Brothers Band. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of songs had glistening folk-pop arrangements that might have suited 
James Taylor. Add an appealing, three-voice harmony blend, and you have every 
ingredient for excellence except the one that the Freddy Jones Band 
unfortunately lacks: striking material. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix didn't allow many lyrics to get through, but that was no great loss: 
The band's debut album, "Waiting for the Night," is stocked with homilies, 
advice and other stock sentiments. But the quality of the playing momentarily 
made up for what was missing.

MUSIC REVIEWS; ST. MARTIN ENSEMBLE SPARKLES AT CALTECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The presentation in Beckman Auditorium at Caltech on Sunday afternoon by the 
Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields Chamber Ensemble mirrored the weather 
outside: warm, sunny, sparkling clear. There was also deep concentration from 
the players, not a common occurrence in such weather and in view of their 
doggedly chipper program, which was enthusiastically received by a more than 
usually large and responsive Coleman Concerts audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart's Divertimento in F, K. 138, delivered with flawless balances by a 
string quintet led by violinist Kenneth Sillito, opened the proceedings 
blithely, paving the way for a cute curiosity, an arrangement by one Franz 
Hasenorl of Richard Strauss' sardonic "Till Eulenspiegel." 
</P>
<P>
 The reworking represents a reduction both in forces, from Strauss' mammoth 
late-Romantic orchestra to a quintet of violin, double-bass, clarinet, bassoon 
and horn, and in the dramatic action of the tone poem, to about half its 
original 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, a good deal of wit has been lost while providing the 
performers with a virtuoso romp. And romp the players did, with snap and 
precision, notably via Sillito's silken, insinuating violin, Andrew Marriner's 
sly clarinet, and Timothy Brown's clarion horn. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep Schubert's familiar Octet, the afternoon's major offering, from 
remaining just this side of interminable, it must be delivered cleanly, 
affectionately, energetically. Dawdling over its already languorous lyricism 
can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy players filled the bill, with not a jaded moment within earshot 
and even some welcome doses of agitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sillito here shared leadership with Marriner, the latter pouring out streams 
of soulful warmth, with prime solo work as well from the suave cellist, Stephen 
Orton. HERBERT GLASS

MUSIC REVIEWS; CHORAL SOCIETY CELEBRATES 'CARMINA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A warm and stuffy church locked and latched against the sunny skies, a stewing 
audience, a local choral group, an overfamiliar musical standard -- it might be 
a prescription for a bad time. 
</P>
<P>
 All the elements were in place Sunday afternoon in Beverly Hills Presbyterian 
Church, but the Choral Society of Southern California attacked Carl Orff's 
"Carmina Burana" with such obvious relish and agility that the performance 
compelled a different reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the driving vulgarities and primitive sentiments of "Carmina" do not 
require an interpreter so much as a traffic cop and tempo setter, guest 
conductor Guntar Einhaus, artistic director of the Nuremberg Symphony, made the 
most of the opportunity, leading a crisp, volatile and, where appropriate, 
sweet and gentle reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Orff's work benefited as well from a streamlining of sorts, with the 
orchestral parts played by two pianists and five percussionists, and a choir of 
just 42: Things weren't so heavy and overblown as they sometimes can be, and 
the quieter, more lyrical passages spoke with an added intimacy and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Choral Society, although an occasional rough edge could be noted, sang 
with fervor, power, sensitivity and finesse; its bright, pealing fortes 
especially impressed. The soloists proved equally strong, with baritone Andrea 
Martin deserving special mention for his full-throated, stylishly flourished 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Music director Nick Strimple's "Cuchulain's Fight With the Sea," a setting in 
three dramatic scenes of a poem by Yeats, received its premiere on the first 
half. Its evocative orchestration (including handbells and harp), imaginative 
tone painting and easy flow between solo and choir, action and commentary, 
served well in bringing the Celtic events to life. Einhaus and company 
performed it with vivid energy. TIMOTHY MANGAN

THEATER REVIEW; 'MOTHER'SON' SPEAKS DAGGERS ABOUT 'HAMLET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Words. Words. Words. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine Shakespeare on a psychiatrist's couch, racked with writer's block. Fed 
up, the analyst interrupts his patient's rant: "So the boy wants to sleep with 
his mother? So what?" The cured Bard dictates a tragedy titled "Mother'Son." 
Instead of a medieval castle, we get a claustrophobic cell. Instead of a 
melancholy prince, we listen to a sadomasochistic mommy's boy. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, we get a 20th-Century version of "Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade-off has its merits, especially in the humor department. Who expected 
that grim incest could make us hoot and holler? At the Met Theatre, Raymond J. 
Barry's tour-de-force accomplishment as writer and star of "Mother'Son" 
transforms psychosis into burlesque entertainment. No wonder Oscar-nominee 
Holly Hunter co-produced this avant-garde talkathon where every sexual and 
intellectual impulse is given full voice -- it's the flip side to the mute 
Victorian repression of "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother'Son" is also indebted to Samuel Beckett's "Endgame" -- too much so. 
Its derivative structure conceals a lack of substance. Like most psychodrama, 
this ritual exorcism is truly much ado about nothing, even though the sound and 
fury prove entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ominous gray cinder-block room with a single high window, Barry's Son 
paces like Beckett's Clov, obsessively debating his keeper. Here the 
jailer-figure is Mother, but otherwise the situation is uncomfortably close to 
Beckett's. Even the haunted room (brilliantly designed by Yael Pardess) 
resembles the space in "Endgame," metaphorically representing a prison cell as 
well as a brain. 
</P>
<P>
 But similar to his 1989 hit "Once in Doubt," Barry writes hilarious Joycean 
soliloquies and solipsistic arguments. As an actor, his delirium possesses a 
trance-like mania that makes us laugh even as we note the homicidal menace 
underneath. (Barry's role as a police chief in the cinematic comedy "The Ref" 
makes a similar impression.) Straitjacketed in a size-too-small suit coat, 
tottering like a shy little boy, this Far Side weirdo skips and chants, "Hi, 
Ma." 
</P>
<P>
 As if answering a Freudian call for help, his mother materializes, pushing a 
salad-cart, eager to force-feed her son. Judy Jean Berns becomes the archetypal 
mom from hell. Smothering, seductive, castrating, Berns is the perfect acting 
mate to Barry. A deadly duo, they merge into a grotesque vaudeville team: 
Norman Bates and mother, Oedipus and wife, Charles Manson and Norma Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as in "Once in Doubt," the repetitive arguments lose momentum and 
force the playwright to manufacture an intruder. Here it's the girlfriend 
crashing through the wall, coming to the rescue like RoboCop. Kim O'Kelley's 
entrance is stunning, but the rest of her work can't compete with the 
mother-son dynamic. We know he's bound and determined to murder mom. 
</P>
<P>
 The predictable conclusion is a limp stab at significance. It's more than an 
ethical reach to try and make the stylish but hollow "Mother'Son" a statement 
about our culture's addiction to sex and violence -- it's overkill. Until that 
fatal aesthetic flaw, director David Saint adroitly suspends our sense of 
disbelief, projecting the illusion of theater as therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mother'Son," Met Theatre, 1089 N. Oxford Ave., Hollywood. 
Wednesdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends April 17. $15. (213) 957-1152. Running time: 1

MUSIC REVIEW; SLOBODYANIK THE SON AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1968, six years before Alex Slobodyanik was born, his father, Alexander 
Slobodyanik, made his first Los Angeles-area appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the auspices of S. Hurok, the 24-year-old pianist from Kiev played a 
recital at El Camino College. A small audience recognized the incipient 
virtuosity and musical individuality of Slobodyanik, father-to-be, who returned 
the following year to make a major debut and, as they used to say, a sensation, 
with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, history is repeating itself. Nineteen-year-old Alex, the son, made 
his debut at Ambassador Auditorium Monday night, producing an enthusiasm that 
by all rights ought to have been more vociferous. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger pianist Slobodyanik has earned all the medals, honors and grants 
with which he is credited (at this time, he is a student of Sergei Babayan at 
the Cleveland Institute). 
</P>
<P>
 He is an uncommonly polished keyboard virtuoso, flashy in technique but not in 
manner, poetic to a fault, musical beyond his years. His 
Chopin/Haydn/Rachmaninoff/Prokofiev program displayed all the ingredients for a 
long and successful career to come: musical depth, comprehensive technical 
resources, a probing mind and a clear sense of communication. Beginning with 
Chopin, Slobodyanik exhibited an authoritative style, mechanical ease and gifts 
for musical rhetoric rare in pianists of any age. 
</P>
<P>
 His playing of the B-flat-minor Scherzo reinstated the passions in that 
over-familiar showpiece; his caressing of the D-flat Nocturne, Opus 27, rivaled 
the loving and practiced ministrations of colleagues three times his age. His 
way with the B-minor Sonata had spontaneity and affection and, most of all, 
speed -- but quickness with sense; at any tempo, his pianistic speech keeps its 
dignity and logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving Haydn's C-major Sonata, Hob. XVI:48, for the second half gave it pride 
of place; its many beauties were not wasted on a warm-up spot. Prokofiev's 
ubiquitous Seventh Sonata had freshness, kaleidoscopic emotions and, in the 
finale, breathtaking speed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, encores were forthcoming: a touching revival of "October" from 
Tchaikovsky's "The Seasons," and one of the "Visions Fugitives" by Prokofiev.

TV REVIEW; '48 HOURS' OFFERS A GRIPPING LOOK AT LAPD'S 77TH DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SCHEIDERER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With fear of crime now the No. 1 concern of most Americans, according to the 
polls, CBS' "48 Hours" sent its cameras for a timely look into what it calls 
the toughest police precinct in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That precinct is the Los Angeles Police Department's 77th Division, which 
includes a 12-square-mile area of South-Central Los Angeles. In "Behind the 
Blue Line," Dan Rather and four other "48 Hours" correspondents offer a 
gripping, tele-verite look at a police force, undermanned and poorly equipped, 
barely coping. 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based policing is the new tactic in the war against crime and we 
watch as officers try to win over the hearts and minds of community residents 
after the turmoil of the Rodney G. King beating and subsequent events. "We've 
been set back 20 years with the people of the community," says a veteran cop 
who has remained by choice in the 77th. 
</P>
<P>
 We see one police officer give up her day off to help youngsters paint over 
graffiti. Hours later, the graffiti is back. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also plenty of tough, traditional police work in "Behind the Blue 
Line." The 77th Division vice officers are seen arresting both prostitutes and 
their customers; two detectives painstakingly gather evidence in a recent 
murder, only to discover that their prime suspect has been in prison for the 
past year; two squad car officers who grew up in the neighborhood see 
themselves fighting a losing battle to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most compelling is the 77th's so-called Crash Squad, 11 cops detailed to 
anti-gang duties. Led by an ex-Marine, they fight by the rules of the street, 
according to correspondent Harold Dow. That means quick-striking, hard-hitting 
tactics that, the commander insists, have full community support. 
</P>
<P>
 While the CBS cameras were present, it was a quiet 48 hours, Rather points 
out. There was only one murder, 12 assaults and 19 robberies in the 77th. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind the Blue Line" is a fascinating look at police work in the central 
city. Most apparent is how dangerously thin the blue line is stretched.

DANA PARSONS: FIGHTING APATHY, GETTING RESULTS: ONE MAN'S DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's see, if this is Wednesday and Orange County, it must be stop No. 42 on 
Sam Harris' national book tour. Only 43 more to go. From a phone booth in San 
Diego (or is it San Jose?) Harris says this interview is his 106th since 
January when his book, "Reclaiming Our Democracy," was published. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot of sound bites. A lot of airplane trips, cab rides and hotel 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris needs a massive tour because he has a tough book to sell. In an age of 
cynicism -- if not outright hostility toward government -- he's trying to 
convince individual citizens they can still make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not a humor book. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 47, Harris is the founder of Results, a Washington-based organization with 
the goal of ending world hunger. A key element of that has been to involve 
local citizens, like the chapter in Orange County, to contact their 
congressional delegates and newspaper editors. A few years ago, the Washington 
Post quoted a congressman who called Results, "pound for pound, the most 
effective lobby in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first 31 years of my life, I really felt hopeless about solving any 
big problem," Harris says. "I wanted to feel I could have some impact some way, 
but when it got down to, if it were a big problem like the environment or world 
hunger, I felt it was beyond my scope, that there was nothing I could do about 
that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He came to realize, however, that he wasn't hopeless about the magnitude of 
the issue -- but about human nature. "People wouldn't do the right thing," he 
fretted. 
</P>
<P>
 A former high school music teacher, Harris was shocked at how little 
connection his students felt toward elected officials. His informal polling of 
7,000 students over a couple of years revealed that about 200 could identify 
their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 He began Results in 1980 from Los Angeles, he says, and operated without a 
paid staff until 1984. "All I knew is that there were deaths from needless 
hunger and disease and that they were preventable. I knew there were experts 
who had called for political will (to tackle the problem), and that we were 
ill-equipped to produce it." 
</P>
<P>
 So he began his volunteer army of local residents, fighting with little more 
than telephones and pens and pencils. Results now claims more than 100 citizen 
groups in the United States and another 40 in eight other countries. Each month 
about 300 volunteers gather for a national conference call. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts, he says, have helped reduce childhood deaths due to diseases 
preventable with immunizations and also from dehydration brought on by 
treatable diarrhea. A key part of that success was citizen pressure on Congress 
to appropriate money earmarked for those problems, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamenting the attention to so-called "tabloid" news at the expense of more 
sober topics, Harris says: "People think they make some difference with their 
families and maybe with their neighborhood, but when it comes to the nation or 
world, people don't feel they make any difference. It's a painful place to be, 
so it's almost kind of useful to cover that pain with diversity and 
distractions, rather than look at the world and say, 'What can I do about it?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 One of the converts was Shirley Kline Williams, now a 65-year-old retired art 
teacher in Corona del Mar. She's been active in the local chapter since sitting 
in a dozen years ago at a nationwide Results conference call. "I was just so 
moved," she says. "I was so touched by this group of people who were doing this 
kind of work that I got more and more involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often you hear people saying, 'Politicians, they're in it for money.' 
Obviously, they're not, because most are lawyers who would make 10 times more 
if they were doing law work. People have not really felt that politicians 
(were) on their side or even cared. Our experience over and over is that 
politicians really do care. The reason they're in it, mostly, is because they 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 I hear you laughing out there. Harris has heard the laughter too. "It's not 
pie-in-the-sky influence, where you're going to get everything you ask for, 
but, yeah, you absolutely have influence and probably a little bit more because 
so many other people are discouraged and inactive. Your voice probably is a 
little bit louder." 
</P>
<P>
 I would remind the skeptics that the recent "three strikes" legislation is 
largely being attributed to the efforts of a single angry and motivated 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key strategems, Harris says, is to pick an issue you're passionate 
about, take action and line up support. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that's the way this democracy was supposed to work. And to hear 
Harris tell it, as he will tonight at 7 at the Costa Mesa Neighborhood 
Community Center, 1845 Park Ave., you almost believe it still can.

MEMORIAL IS FRIDAY FOR SADDLEBACK MUSIC DIRECTOR LABONTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memorial service for Monte C. LaBonte, instrumental music director at 
Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, will be held Friday in the school's 
McKinney Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte died Sunday at UCLA Medical Center.He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Laguna Hills resident, LaBonte joined the Saddleback faculty in 
1969 and led development of the music department's curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 He was president of the college's academic senate in 1974-75 and served as 
dean of the college's Fine Arts and Communications Division from 1976 to 1983 
before returning to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 As dean, LaBonte oversaw the design and construction of the college's 
55,000-square-foot fine arts complex. One of his proudest moments came when he 
appeared as the padre in "Man of La Mancha," the first production staged in the 
400-seat McKinney Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte was an organizing founder of the Music Assn. of California Community 
Colleges and served as its president from 1984-86. He was an advocate of arts 
education and testified many times before state legislative committees on 
matters pertaining to the community college curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, LaBonte was recognized for his innovative teaching methods, 
including the incorporation of computer and CD-ROM technology into the music 
and arts curriculum. He also taught music courses via the campus radio station, 
KSBR-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 LaBonte received his master's degree in music from Cal State Long Beach and 
was director of instrumental and vocal music at Norwalk High School before 
coming to Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Sharon; sons Greg, Chris and Mark; daughter Leigh 
Ann and six grandchildren. A private funeral will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial service will be from 3 to 5 p.m.

WORK-RELATED SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The killing of three workers and the wounding of two others at the Extron 
Electronics plant in Santa Fe Springs was the latest in a series of job-related 
killings in California in recent years. Here are workplace slayings recorded in 
1993: 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 2: A La Habra janitor, enraged over a late $150 paycheck, poured 
gasoline on a bookkeeper and set her afire, then walked away as the woman was 
fatally burned. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 6: A former postal worker, after stabbing his mother to death, walked 
into the Dana Point post office and killed a former co-worker. Five other 
people were wounded in a bloody two-day rampage. He had been fired for stalking 
a female co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 2: A mortgage broker, blaming a law firm for his financial trouble, 
rampaged through three floors of a San Francisco high-rise. He killed eight 
people and wounded six others before killing himself as police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 8: A onetime ranch hand who was said to have a hot temper and a 
personal grudge against some of his family members shot down his sister-in-law 
and another employee at a Fountain Valley embroidery store. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: GOLDEN IDEA FOR DISNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN C. SMITH, Stephen C. Smith is a political consultant who once worked 
for Anaheim and Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it ever too late for a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
 According to recent news reports, state and county transportation officials 
have pledged $50 million for freeway ramps and the world's largest parking 
garage to entice the Walt Disney Co. to build Westcot in Anaheim -- even though 
Disney still hasn't committed to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 As those who live in Anaheim can attest, traffic in the Disneyland 
neighborhood is already clogged. On a typical summer day, it's not unusual to 
spend more time in line on the Santa Ana Freeway and Harbor Boulevard than at 
Pirates of the Caribbean. Disney's proposal to build Westcot in Disneyland's 
parking lot doesn't exactly thrill its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Westcot would be a West Coast version of Epcot -- Walt Disney's vision for an 
Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. Anyone who has visited Disney 
World in Florida knows that its transportation infrastructure is based not on 
cars and parking garages, but on monorails connecting the attractions and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 So here's what I think is a good idea. The Disney Corp. should build Westcot 
not in Anaheim, but in Irvine's "Golden Triangle." The two Disney facilities 
would be linked by the urban rail lines already planned by the Orange County 
Transportation Authority. Just as monorails link Florida's Epcot and Magic 
Kingdom, so too would the urban rail line link Anaheim's Disneyland and 
Irvine's Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Triangle is the huge tract of undeveloped land formed by the 
intersection of the Santa Ana, San Diego and Laguna freeways. It is next to the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, scheduled for closure by the end of the 
decade. Originally planned as a mall and office complex, the Triangle remains 
largely unbuilt. The mall could not have competed with South Coast Plaza or 
Laguna Hills Mall, and Orange County is woefully overbuilt with excess office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 So why try to shoehorn Westcot into Disneyland's parking lot when the triangle 
offers much more open land and a far superior transportation infrastructure? In 
addition to the nearby freeways, the Laguna Freeway will eventually link to the 
Eastern Transportation Corridor and open the area to the Inland Empire. And 
let's not forget that Irvine's Multi-Modal Transportation Center is already 
open for business in the triangle. This facility was envisioned years ago as 
the anchor for an Irvine monorail system financed by $125 million from a state 
transportation bond. That money still sits in a special account.  
</P>
<P>
 OCTA's plan for its initial 13-mile segment will run the urban rail line from 
Disneyland to South Coast Plaza. By extending the line to Irvine's station, 
Mouseketeers could connect from Disneyland's monorail system to the OCTA line 
and head for an Irvine Westcot. This would spread throughout the county the 
economic benefit of the entertainment colossus, as well as dispersing its 
traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran recently proposed that the Marine base, 
already slated for closure, be dealt to the Irvine Co. in a land swap that 
would preserve open space. This would turn over conversion of the base to a 
business that knows how to develop property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. owns the Golden Triangle land. It could enter into a 
development agreement with Disney to build Westcot. Imagine the synergy of 
Orange County's top entertainment enterprise and its foremost development 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the Irvine Co. became the first private developer to pay for its 
own interchanges, enhancing its projects along the freeways. The same approach 
could be used here -- a Disney/Irvine Co. consortium could fund the 
infrastructure improvements as part of the El Toro conversion. We could forget 
the public gift of $50 million to underwrite Disney's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 These improvements would be minimized by building the urban rail line with its 
terminus at the Triangle's Multi-Modal Transportation Center. It would give 
Orange County the opportunity to break from the endless cycle of more freeways 
and more traffic. After all, wasn't that Walt Disney's message in 1959 when he 
built his monorail? 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's claim to fame is its heritage as a master-planned community, a vision 
that the New York Times once said "may be the American future." That thinking 
was precisely what Uncle Walt had in mind for his first Community of Tomorrow. 
Wouldn't Westcot and Irvine be a perfect match?

GRETZKY FIRES UP KINGS, 7-0; HOCKEY: HE EDGES CLOSER TO HOWE'S RECORD WITH 
THIRD-PERIOD GOAL. TEAM FINALLY SHOWS SOME LIFE AMID RUMORS THAT MELROSE WILL 
BE FIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The day started with reports of Coach Barry Melrose's demise and ended with 
Wayne Gretzky inching closer to Gordie Howe's all-time record of 801 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky had one goal and three assists in the Kings' 7-0 victory over the 
hapless Ottawa Senators at the Forum on Tuesday night before a sellout crowd of 
16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky had gone without a goal in four games, and it was the first King 
victory in five games and second in 15. A penalty against Tony Granato late in 
the first period nullified what appeared to be Gretzky's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 His third-period goal came in deep at the right crease at 3:15 as he finished 
off a two-on-one with Robert Lang, leaving Gretzky two goals from tying Howe's 
NHL record. He had six shots on goal against the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have much to do with it," said Gretzky, "I just put it in the nets." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Gretzky's 799th NHL goal came against Ottawa goaltender Craig 
Billington, who replaced starter Mark LaForest at 12:44 of the first period. 
The Senators have lost nine consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it was King goaltender Kelly Hrudey's first shutout of the season, 16th 
of his career, and the 10th-place Kings (23-36-10) moved within seven points of 
the eighth-place San Jose Sharks, who are in the final playoff spot in the 
Western Conference.  
</P>
<P>
 In between, there were the usual bizarre twists and turns that one comes to 
expect from the Kings. After the morning skate, Melrose's self-help guru, 
Anthony Robbins appeared for the first time this season and spent more than two 
hours with the team, attempting perhaps to awaken the defenseman within. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, King owner Bruce McNall denied that Melrose was about to be fired and 
offered words of support. McNall was responding to a New York Post report on 
Tuesday -- "Kings Set to Ax Melrose," which quoted an unidentified source. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has my support," McNall said. "There will be no coaching change the rest 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone is trying to find an answer. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Melrose: "I find it kind of humorous because they finally got a coach 
here who has won something and took them where no one else has ever taken them. 
John Paddock has a losing season in Winnipeg and they make him GM. Now they 
want to burn me at the stake.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. McNall believes in me and I believe in him. If we don't win, I deserve to 
be fired. I'll move on like a hired gun." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall would not speculate about the future of any of his executives or 
coaches beyond the regular season, which is understandable because the Kings 
could be the first team in 24 years to miss the playoffs after reaching the 
Stanley Cup final the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone connected with the Kings deserves a certain amount of blame in regard 
to the lousy season, including the players. McNall said that perhaps the King 
players would be held more accountable in a different city. Melrose, too, has 
criticized the Los Angeles media for being too soft on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coach can only do so much," McNall said. "It (a change) gets the players 
off the hook one more time. He works hard and he's trying hard. How can you 
make the change?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors surrounding a losing team are hardly unusual. Last month, a Toronto 
newspaper reported that club president Roy Mlakar and General Manager Nick 
Beverley would not be around next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Problems start at the top," McNall said. "The top isn't Roy and Nick, it's 
me. Part of it may be that I haven't been around as much -- not able to be the 
mediator." 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose taped an interview with Prime Ticket before the game and made a point 
to say hello to his parents in Kelvington, Canada: "I'm still here. I haven't 
been fired." 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Tony Granato had one assist as he returned to the lineup after serving 
a 15-game suspension for clubbing Chicago defenseman Neil Wilkinson over the 
head on Feb. 9. . . . King defenseman Marty McSorley, suffering from a pulled 
stomach muscle, did not play the final two periods.

MORNING BRIEFING: SWISS SOCCER COACH FOCUSES ON BUSINESS, NOT PLEASURE

 A celibacy order has been imposed on Switzerland's World Cup players for the 
soccer tournament this summer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my players to concentrate totally on football with all their 
strength," said the Swiss national coach, Englishman Roy Hodgson. "This is not 
a pleasure trip. I will not tolerate any wives or girlfriends in the squad's 
hotel. Neither will I tolerate any surreptitious visits to the women's hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgson has ordered his players to stay celibate from June 7, when they leave 
Geneva, until the World Cup ends July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add celibacy: Said midfielder Martin Rueda, soon to be a father for the second 
time: "If the coach finds that sex could affect our performance, we have to 
accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said midfielder Ciri Sforza, who has a live-in girlfriend: "I had to laugh 
when I first heard of the ruling. In my opinion, when all is well in your 
private life, this is reflected in your performance on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nicole Arm, Sforza's girlfriend: "A sex ban? It's a joke, a kindergarten 
game."

</P>
<P>
 An honest man: Frank Bruno has lost three world heavyweight title fights. He 
says he will quit if he loses his non-title fight tonight against Jesse 
Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Ferguson beats me, there will be nowhere for me to go," said Bruno, who 
has lost world title shots to Tim Witherspoon, Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 So long: Montreal pitcher Jeff Fassero told Chicago Sun-Times baseball writer 
Dave van Dyck that losing Dennis Martinez to the Cleveland Indians is good 
riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to miss his pitching, but we won't miss his attitude in the 
clubhouse," Fassero said. "He was a me-me-me, I-I-I type of player. We don't 
need that at all." 
</P>

 Pretty target: Lynne Austin, who has filed for divorce from the Phillies' 
Darren Daulton, still enjoys the sign in center field of Jack Russell Stadium 
-- where the Phillies train -- in which she is seen advertising for Hooters, a 
national restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're separated, I'm still a Phillies fan," she said. "Besides, 
it makes a great target for him to hit at."

 Bad career move: Defending Portugal soccer champion FC Porto had to practice 
in a Lisbon parking lot after its stadium was seized and put up for auction for 
failure to pay back taxes. 
</P>

 Tax director Francisco Rodrigues Porto ordered the stadium doors chained shut, 
citing FC Porto's debt of $1.2 million in back taxes. Hours later, Rodrigues 
Porto was fired for alleged incompetence.

 Vernon Maxwell was a bit late Tuesday, but his entrance was grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell was arrested at midday in Houston for carrying a concealed weapon in 
his car, police said. By the time he was released, it was halftime of the 
Rockets' game against the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 He played the whole second half, hitting key shots in Houston's 105-99 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Max came back and I talked with him at halftime," Rocket Coach Rudy 
Tomjanovich said. "He told me he was ready to go and that his energy level was 
great. I thought he gave us a boost." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell made a three-point shot with eight minutes to play to cut the Trail 
Blazers' lead to 90-86, then made a basket that tied the score at 90 with 6:47 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Akeem Olajuwon scored 41 points for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 89, Seattle 87 -- Terry Mills' basket with 43 seconds to won the game

<P>
 Phoenix 119, Cleveland 106 -- The Suns made 18 of 20 shots in a 42-point third 
quarter at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 88, Indiana 82 -- Patrick Ewing scored 26 points and Derek Harper had

MARTIN HELPS CLIPPERS EXTEND THEIR STREAK; PRO BASKETBALL: RESERVE CENTER HAS 
10 POINTS AND 11 REBOUNDS IN 108-105 VICTORY OVER JAZZ, L.A.'S FOURTH IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Clipper center Bob Martin, who perpetually blinks, has the look of someone 
waking up from a long sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 7-foot rookie, who had played only two minutes in the last month, woke 
up the Clippers, who overcame a 20-point first-half deficit against the Utah 
Jazz to extend their winning streak to a season-high four games, 108-105, 
before 10,584 at the Sports Arena on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who entered the game in the second quarter because starting center 
Elmore Spencer was ineffective against Utah center Felton Spencer, played the 
entire second half and had a season-high 10 points and 11 rebounds as the 
Clippers outscored the Jazz by 59-44 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little winded out there because I hadn't played for a month in a 
game," Martin said. "I was on injured reserve for about three weeks and I 
hadn't played much the last couple of games." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Ron Harper, who had a season-high 39 points in his last game, had 32 
points, including 12 in the fourth quarter, and forward Dominique Wilkins had 
31 points and nine rebounds as the Clippers beat the Jazz for the first time in 
three games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said Wilkins, who was acquired for disgruntled forward Danny Manning, 
has helped rejuvenate the Clippers (23-38), who are in the midst of their 
longest winning streak since they won four games in December of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Dominique has brought a lot of enthusiasm," Martin said. "Nothing 
against Danny Manning, but Dominique is a more exciting player. I'm not 
slighting Danny, but . . . as a kid I grew up watching Dominique." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Clipper forward Charles Outlaw played almost as well as Martin as he 
helped to neutralize forward Karl Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Malone had 34 points and 14 rebounds, Outlaw harassed him throughout 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone knocked Outlaw to the court in the first quarter and wasn't called for 
a foul. But Malone got a technical when he wrestled Outlaw to the court and put 
him in a headlock in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone missed 12 of 26 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be intimidated by Karl Malone," Outlaw said. "Basketball is 
a contact sport these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Outlaw had nine points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots. "When I start 
scoring, people are going to start hearing about me," Outlaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by as many as 20 points in the first half, closed 
the third quarter with an 11-2 run to pull to 82-78. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers trailed by 96-92, then went on a 10-1 run in 2:14 to take a 
102-97 lead on a layup by Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have played their best basketball of the season over the 
last three games, played one of their worst opening halves as the Jazz took a 
61-49 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins missed nine of 12 shots in the first half as the Clippers shot only 
37% in the opening half. Harper wasn't much better, missing six of 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer outplayed Spencer as Utah took a 35-21 lead at the end of the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz center almost registered a double-double in the first quarter as he 
scored 10 points and grabbed nine rebounds as Utah built a 16-point lead. The 
Clippers' Spencer had only two points and no rebounds as the Clippers were 
outrebounded by 19-7 in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss pulled Spencer and inserted John Williams, but he wasn't any more 
effective as Utah built a 20-point lead.

 Marques Johnson noticed that his son Kris was uptight the morning of Crenshaw 
High's game against Mater Dei for the Southern Regional Division I 
championship. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So Johnson called an old mentor and friend and asked him to say a few words to 
Kris. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Telephone!" Marques yelled up to Kris in his bedroom. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was John Wooden. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The legend who coached UCLA to 10 NCAA championships talked with Kris for 10 
minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as though Kris had just seen the face of God," said Johnson, who 
played on Wooden's last championship team in 1975 and was the first winner of 
the Wooden Award in 1977. "Coach was a very calming influence. He got him ready 
to play." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4 forward went out and calmly scored 27 points and got 12 rebounds 
to lead Crenshaw to a 71-67 victory. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Marques did the commentary on the Channel 9 telecast. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I had to show some restraint, but it was fun," he said. "We had a lot of eye 
contact. A couple of times, he made a good move and scored and then looked over 
at me and winked." . . . Kris has signed a letter of intent to attend UCLA, 
where his dad is a regular on the KMPC broadcasts. But Marques, whose true 
passion is acting, isn't sure he wants to do Bruin games while his son is on 
the team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wrestling with that decision," he said. "The actual broadcasts would be 
OK, but I'm not sure about me being on the road with the team. I want to give 
Kris some space. It's especially important for him to be able to grow, to be on 
his own, and not have to look over his shoulder at his father." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For certain, though, Marques and play-by-play announcer Chris Roberts will 
call UCLA's first-round NCAA tournament game against Tulsa on Friday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough Bruin team to figure out," Johnson said. "They haven't played 
well the last month and that's not a good sign. They don't have a great draw in 
the tournament. But they do have the talent. It's a question of being mentally 
ready. They were last year against Iowa State and Michigan." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another NCAA tournament entrant that interests Johnson is Alabama Birmingham, 
which faces George Washington on Friday. He happens to be the 
restricted-earnings assistant coach to Gene Bartow, his coach at UCLA the last 
two years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They're very good defensively," said Johnson, who has worked mostly with the 
Blazers' big men during a few trips to Birmingham. "They're not great 
offensively, but defense can carry you a long way in the tournament." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's selection is Purdue. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the year of a great player -- Glenn Robinson -- leading a team 
to the title," he said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, Marques is also picking Crenshaw to beat Sacramento Jesuit for the 
Division I state championship Saturday night at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Terry Donahue's most severe loss might be that of recruiting 
coordinator Bill Rees, who did a great job for 15 years before leaving for 
Kansas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, don't read too much into the departure of Rees. It is a lot easier to 
live on a recruiting coordinator's salary in Lawrence, Kan., than it is in Los 
Angeles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former DePaul and Denver Nugget guard Gary Garland is a brother to Whitney 
Houston and sings backup on some of her albums. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to my fellow Sullivan Award voters for recognizing an obscure sport 
and making Charlie Ward the first football player since 1946 to win the honor 
as the nation's outstanding amateur athletes. I realize Ward also plays 
basketball, but his work at quarterback was most responsible for getting him 
the award. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is refreshing to see an NBA team, the Lakers, show patience with a young 
coach, Randy Pfund.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TRADE TALKS WITH METS WOULD SEND SNOW FOR 
PITCHER ANTHONY YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, in a desperate search for a starting pitcher, are discussing a 
trade that would send first baseman J.T. Snow to the New York Mets for starter 
Anthony Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked to them, and he's the type of guy we'd like to have," Angel 
General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but we don't have anything done yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely want to get another starter, and to get one, we'll have to go 
through some pain. We're going to have to give up somebody that that we like." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, the principal player acquired in the Jim Abbott trade of a year ago, 
batted .241 with 16 homers and 57 RBIs during his rookie season. He's 
considered expendable because of the play of Eduardo Perez, who had been 
projected to be the starting left fielder, but his tender elbow and 
deficiencies in the outfield now have the Angels believing he would be more 
suited at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who's batting .320 with eight RBIs this spring, also made two stellar 
defensive plays at first base Tuesday in the Angels' 13-6 victory over the San 
Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there will be less wear and tear on the elbow at first base," 
Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said, "so we've got to find out whether we need both 
of them in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to evaluate J.T., and decide whether to keep him, send him down, or 
we trade him." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels trade Snow, they can keep rookie left fielder Jim Edmonds. It 
also would create more playing time for outfielders Bo Jackson and Dwight 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season Young, 28, set the major league record for losing -- 27 
consecutive games over two seasons. The streak ended July 28, and Young 
finished the season with a 1-16 record and 3.77 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Kevin Flora played in his first "A" game since suffering a 
strained right quadriceps March 6 and is the front-runner to be the Angels' 
opening-day second baseman. . . . The Angels placed catcher Mike Fitzgerald on 
waivers for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release, and optioned 
left fielder Garret Anderson to triple-A Vancouver. Fitzgerald is expected to 
reject the Angels' offer to be their backup catcher at triple-A Vancouver and 
is interested in a coaching career. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; DUNSTON MIGHT BE READY TO RECLAIM SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The depth chart on Manager Tom Trebelhorn's office wall at the Chicago Cubs' 
spring stadium lists four shortstops. 
</P>
<P>
 Two, Jose Vizcaino and Rey Sanchez, have done most of the playing for the Cubs 
during the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 A third, Jose Hernandez, is an insurance policy formerly of the Texas Ranger 
and Cleveland Indian organizations, still young enough at 24 to generate 
interest among scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth name is that of Shawon Dunston, who had a herniated disk removed 
from his back on May 13, 1992, and hasn't played regularly since the previous 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, he might be ready to become more than a name on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't four shortstops," Dunston said. "I'm the only one. I know I can 
play. I know I can be the best again." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Cubs are hoping, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a phenomenal talent," Trebelhorn said. "If he's healthy, 
he'll be the opening-day shortstop, and right now he's ahead of the timetable I 
had for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy where he is, but knowledgeable it can change quickly. He 
seems to have total freedom, but how will (his back) respond when we get back 
to the cold in April?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston played 18 games before the surgery in 1992 and seven games last 
September. It has taken two years for him to feel he is prepared to play at his 
previous level. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew, he said, that when Darryl Strawberry tried to come back from a 
similar operation after only a half-year of therapy last year, it wouldn't 
work. And, indeed, Strawberry gave up after 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a learning experience," Dunston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do want to play, but I'm prepared to walk away. I won't make a fool of 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd miss the game, but my role as a parent is worth more than the money and 
more than the game. 
</P>
<P>
 'I believe I'm a better person now and can be a better player because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston suspects he injured his back lifting daughter Whitnie from a car seat. 
He played in pain even in 1991, he said, but neither the back nor the game will 
get in the way of his responsibilities as a father. 
</P>
<P>
 At his home in Fremont, Calif., during the winter, Dunston said he would get 
up at 4 a.m. to do three hours of therapy -- swimming, stretching and weights 
-- so that he could be done in time to drive Whitnie and her sister, Jasmine, 
to school. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended PTA meetings and romped with 18-month-old Shawon Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough," Dunston said of the long recovery. "Some days you feel you 
can do anything in the world, the next day nothing. If I have my health, they 
can take the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston signed a four-year, $12-million contract before the '92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to sleep, knowing if I have to retire I'll be able to take care of 
my family," he said, "but the Cubs have been great to me and I want to come 
back and repay them, show my appreciation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston, 31, and the Cubs believe he is through the worst. He homered in his 
first exhibition at-bat, beat out a pair of infield grounders the other day and 
has been playing consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 His potential return obviously strengthens the Cubs' depth and bargaining 
position. Both Vizcaino, a former Dodger who batted .287 in 151 games last 
year, and Sanchez would become valuable commodities.  
</P>
<P>
 Of Vizcaino, a switch-hitter who can play three infield positions and the 
outfield, Trebelhorn said: "He may be the best in baseball for what he brings 
to a club. His versatility becomes a terrific asset (if Dunston is playing 
regularly). I can't make the world perfect for everybody, but my job will be to 
see that they all stay ready." 
</P>
<P>
 He nodded at the chart on the wall and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A former teacher in the Portland school system, Trebelhorn was asked what 
lessons he had learned managing the Milwaukee Brewers for six seasons. He was 
25 games over .500 during that stint, but his authority often was tested by 
players who thought he was too soft and had two sets of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't keep everybody happy, you can't do it all yourself and I have to 
make sure everybody understands what I'm doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tendency for my mind to get ahead of my mouth, so I have to slow it 
down a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 In the long-suffering world of the Cubs, Trebelhorn succeeded Jim Lefebvre, 
despite pleas by Ryne Sandberg, Mark Grace and others to retain Lefebvre for 
the sake of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Cub manager inherits hefty historical baggage, but Trebelhorn, the 44th, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with the 43 who preceded me or the decades that preceded 
me. We've changed coaches, personnel, uniforms and divisions. It's part of the 
business, but I think we're comfortable and I think we're together on what 
we're trying to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to rebuild the mind set here. We have a good club. I want it to go 
out expecting to win. I don't want it hoping to win, but expecting to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy to say, harder to do. Still, the Cubs finished over .500 for only the 
third time since 1972 last season, despite the loss of free agents Greg Maddux 
and Andre Dawson, an injury that sidelined Sandberg for two months, the 
inability of former Dodger Mike Morgan (10-15) to fill Maddux's No. 1 berth in 
the rotation, an outfield that didn't need the Wrigley Field wind to have 
trouble catching balls and soap opera bickering between Lefebvre and General 
Manager Larry Himes. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Save Lefebvre" push by Grace and Sandberg might have contributed to 20 
victories in the last 28 games, but it didn't save Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
 Trebelhorn must fight the perception that he helped undermine Lefebvre during 
two years as a Cub coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't grow in stature over the winter when he provided fodder for Chicago 
columnists and comedians with his response to a question on the psychological 
test Himes required of managerial candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The question: "If you were a tree, what kind of a tree would you be?" 
Trebelhorn's answer: "A Cubs tree." 
</P>
<P>
 An oak or redwood, something perceived as hearty and strong, might have been 
the more suitable response, not a tree that wilts every summer. Nevertheless, 
Trebelhorn got the nod over Tony Muser, now on his coaching staff and viewed as 
a powerhouse successor if Trebelhorn and the Cubs stumble out of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, trying to build that expectation of winning, Trebelhorn said 
the following is essential for the Cubs to contend in the National League's 
Central division: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The blossoming of career minor leaguer Karl Rhodes as a major league center 
fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The bona fide arrival of Yorba Linda's Steve Trachsel as the No. 4 starter 
and a successful search for the No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The physical soundness of an infield that could be baseball's best: Grace, 
Sandberg, Dunston, Steve Buechele and Rick Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former commissioner Fay Vincent displayed the extent of his bitterness at 
being forced from office in his 40-page book proposal that reduces Vincent to 
name-calling and sheds the stately and literate image he and the late Bart 
Giamatti espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 In his attack on the owners, Vincent described Peter O'Malley of the Dodgers 
as a "nitwit and bigot" and said that Jackie Autry of the Angels was 
"mean-spirited and not bright." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley declined comment. Autry would only say she was disappointed. So were 
many who thought Vincent got a bad deal, but expected him to keep it on a 
higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The decision by Senate majority leader George Mitchell (D-Maine) not to 
seek reelection moves him to the forefront of commissioner candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing is everything, and Mitchell would not be available until the fall, when 
the owners will have a better grasp on the status of labor talks and could be 
ready to appoint a commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While shredding the Major League Scouting Bureau in a cost-cutting move and 
reducing the umpire developmental fund by $1 million, owners have also rewarded 
interim commissioner Bud Selig with a $1 million salary bonus, showing they 
have their priorities in order as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hallelujah! The Michael Jordan circus is thought to be heading into its 
final week. A decision by the Chicago White Sox is expected no later than 
Sunday. The Jordan experiment spits on all those scouts who spend hours 
tracking college and high school players with far more baseball talent than 
Jordan but never even get the rookie league chance Jordan is receiving at the 
major league level. Jordan got his chance simply because he was outstanding in 
another sport and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who also owns the Bulls, 
wanted to show his gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The theory was that Asians were too small and too frail to do more than 
pitch with finesse, not strong enough to pitch in the majors with consistent 
success. So much for stereotypes. The Dodgers' Chan Ho Park of Korea and the 
Seattle Mariners' teen-ager, Makoto Suzuki of Japan, are lighting up spring 
speed guns and might be the two hardest throwers in baseball.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; LINEUP SHOULD LOOK FAMILIAR ON APRIL 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lineup the Dodgers fielded Tuesday in their 11-1 victory against the 
Montreal Expos is the same one that is expected to open the season April 5 at 
Dodger Stadium. Orel Hershiser, who cruised through five innings, giving up one 
run and striking out five, is expected to be the opening day pitcher, according 
to Manager Tom Lasorda, for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 Delino DeShields -- who had two hits, scored three runs and stole a base -- 
led off, followed by Brett Butler, Mike Piazza, Darryl Strawberry, Eric Karros, 
Tim Wallach, Raul Mondesi and Jose Offerman in the game at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi's hold on the right field job became stronger Tuesday through comments 
made by Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, after 12 players were cut 
from the major league roster. Right fielder Billy Ashley, who was the club's 
minor league player of the year last season, was optioned to triple-A 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raul Mondesi jumped out of the gate and is off and running with the job. He 
is clearly in the lead to go right into right field at Dodger Stadium," Claire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Busch, once believed to be the next Dodger third baseman, was moved back 
to first base, but Henry Rodriquez, a left-handed batter who is out of options, 
is expected to back up Eric Karros there. Also sent down was left-handed 
pitcher Ben VanRyn, whom Claire says needs a full season of starting at 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts leave the Dodgers with 28 players on their roster, but that is 
deceiving because there are also 11 non-roster players, including infielder 
Jeff Treadway, who will make the club as a reserve. Of the 39 players, 21 are 
pitchers, including six left-handers vying for a spot in the bullpen. But 
Lasorda said that there are no standouts among them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also optioned to Albuquerque were catcher Jerry Brooks, infielders Ron Coomer 
and Eddie Pye and pitchers Jose Parra and Todd Williams, who is probably going 
to have an operation on his right elbow. . . . Pedro Astacio is scheduled to 
make his first appearance this spring when he follows Ramon Martinez in 
Friday's game against the Philadelphia Phillies. . . . Kevin Gross will start a 
"B" game today. MARYANN HUDSON

<P>
 Oriole left-hander Sid Fernandez walked off the mound in pain after facing 
four batters in Baltimore's 7-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, and 
probably will sit out the early weeks of the regular season because of a sore 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second physical setback of the spring for a pitcher who was 
considered a health risk when the Orioles signed him to a three-year, 
$9-million contract in November. Shoulder soreness delayed his entry into the 
spring rotation for several days.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL DAILY REPORT; POSTSEASON HONORS; ROBINSON IS UNANIMOUS 
ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Purdue's Glenn Robinson, the nation's leading scorer, was a unanimous 
selection Tuesday to The Associated Press All-America basketball team, and 
California's Jason Kidd was named on all but one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined on the first team by Donyell Marshall of Connecticut and 
Grant Hill of Duke, both three votes shy of unanimous, and Clifford Rozier of 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a 6-foot-8 junior forward, averaged 30.3 points and 10.1 rebounds 
and shot 49%, including 36% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, a sophomore who led the nation in assists at 9.1 per game and averaged 
16.8 points, was Cal's first first-team All-American since Darrell Imhoff in 
1960; and Marshall, a 6-9 junior forward who averaged 25.8 points a game, was 
UConn's first first-team selection ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is the only senior on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozier, who transferred to Louisville after playing as a freshman at North 
Carolina in 1991, is the first Cardinal first-team selection since Darrell 
Griffith in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The second team includes Jalen Rose of Michigan, Corliss Williamson of 
Arkansas, Khalid Reeves of Arizona, Eric Montross of North Carolina and Melvin 
Booker of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 The third team had Bryant Reeves of Oklahoma State, Lemond Murray of Cal, B.J. 
Tyler of Texas, Juwan Howard of Michigan and Damon Bailey of Indiana.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL DAILY REPORT; SOUTHLAND; COMMENTS DRAW REPRIMAND FOR UCLA'S 
HARRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Jim Harrick was reprimanded Tuesday by the Pacific 10 Conference 
because of remarks he made about the officiating after a game against Oregon on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The action was taken under league regulations prohibiting derogatory public 
comments on officiating by institutional personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick's comments came after UCLA's 80-79 loss at Oregon. The Ducks' Zach 
Sellers scored with five seconds to play, and UCLA's Tyus Edney missed a 
three-pointer at the buzzer. Edney, who was closely guarded by Darryl Parker, 
said he believed he was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Harrick was quoted as saying about the incident: "That's not 
hard to call; it's easy. It's not a judgment call; it's a guts call or lack of. 
It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen said Harrick's remarks were "inappropriate and 
unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Conference coaches are expected to express their views of officiating to the 
conference office through established procedures, not public comments," Hansen 
said. "The conference will not permit such criticism of officials to be made."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL DAILY REPORT; POSTSEASON HONORS; ROBINSON NAMED UNANIMOUS 
ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Purdue's Glenn Robinson, the nation's leading scorer, was a unanimous 
selection Tuesday to The Associated Press All-America basketball team, and 
California's Jason Kidd was named on all but one ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined on the first team by Donyell Marshall of Connecticut and 
Grant Hill of Duke, both three votes shy of unanimous, and Clifford Rozier of 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a 6-foot-8 junior forward, averaged 30.3 points and 10.1 rebounds 
and shot 49%, including 36% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very deserving honor for Glenn because of all the players I ever 
coached, he's the best," Purdue Coach Gene Keady said. "This guy can do it all 
and he's a great person besides." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who was a second-team All-American last season and passed up an 
opportunity to jump to he NBA, came back to lead the Boilermakers to the Big 
Ten title. He is Purdue's first first-team, All-American since Joe Barry 
Carroll in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd, a sophomore who led the nation in assists at 9.1 per game and averaged 
16.8 points, was Cal's first first-team All-American since Darrell Imhoff in 
1960, and Marshall, a 6-9 junior forward who averaged 25.8 points a game, was 
UConn's first first-team selection ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, the only senior on the team, is Duke's third consecutive first-team 
selection, joining Christian Laettner and Bobby Hurley with that designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill averaged 17.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 5.1 assists, playing guard or 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been incredibly consistent," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "I think 
he's helped us become a balanced team in not trying to take too many shots and 
making sure he was available to do the dirty work and not just shooting the 
basketball. He's really as good of a team guy as we've had here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozier, who transferred to Louisville after playing as a freshman at North 
Carolina in 1991, is the first Cardinal first-team selection since Darrell 
Griffith in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozier averaged 19.1 points and 11.2 rebounds for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The second team includes Jalen Rose of Michigan, Corliss Williamson of 
Arkansas, Khalid Reeves of Arizona, Eric Montross of North Carolina and Melvin 
Booker of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 The third team had Bryant Reeves of Oklahoma State, Lemond Murray of Cal, B.J. 
Tyler of Texas, Juwan Howard of Michigan and Damon Bailey of Indiana.

 Debbie Wilson drove in a run with a single down the third-base line in the 
10th inning to give Los Alamitos a 3-2 victory over Pacifica in a nonleague 
softball game Tuesday at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson (6-0) also pitched a five-hitter, striking out eight, for the Griffins 
(9-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica (4-2) scored in the first inning on an error. Toni Mascarenas reached 
first on a fielder's choice, stole second and came home when Natasha Sisco's 
grounder bounced away from shortstop Michelle Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos answered in the bottom of the inning. Amanda Peterson walked, was 
sacrificed to second, took third on a wild pitch and scored when Carolyn 
Wilson, Debbie's sister, singled under shortstop Autumn Gwinner's glove. The 
Griffins scored again in the third, when Peterson singled, was sacrificed to 
second and scored when Schneider singled to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica tied the score in the fourth, but Coach Rob Weil thought his Mariners 
should have gotten more. 
</P>
<P>
 After Andrea Pickett doubled to center, Kristina Carlson grounded to short, 
and was called out at first.

 Weil disputed the call with umpire Rudy Kominek, saying first baseman Megan 
Barnes' foot was off the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Kominek ejected Weil from the field, but Weil continued to coach from the 
dugout. Pickett then scored on Kristin Freed's line-drive single. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team had a chance to score before extra innings. Pacifica loaded the 
bases with two out in the fifth; Los Alamitos had runners on second and third 
with no outs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the top of the 10th, Natasha Sisco tripled with two outs, but Pickett 
grounded to short. First baseman Barnes made the scoop of a low throw to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bottom of the inning, Schneider reached first on an error by shortstop 
Gwinner. Carolyn Wilson singled to advance Schneider to second and Debbie 
Wilson hit a grounder down the third-base line to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the toughest game we've had," Los Alamitos Coach Jami Shannon said. 
"But our Nos. 1-6 are batting .300 or better -- a lot better offensive 
performance than we've had in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very intense team. I'm glad they're on my side."

FISHING REPORT: IF CATFISH COULD READ, THEY'D HIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Baker has surfaced, so it must be catfish season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles resident was at Lake Piru in Ventura County last weekend and, 
sure enough, landed 10 catfish totaling 86 pounds, the largest an 18-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people read his name in the paper, they know the catfish are going to 
start biting again," said Art Caldara, lake manager. "A lot of people buy the 
paper just for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Southland, the whiskered fish are slowly moving into the 
warmer shallows to feed, a sure sign of spring.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: IT MIGHT BE THE BEST MARCH EVER FOR CATCHING PRIZE 
MARLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 March madness in Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 For some, that translates to fighting marlin after marlin on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly the most exciting March anyone can remember out of Cabo San 
Lucas, where the big tail dance is showing no real signs of letting up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, February is very good, but it's usually bad at this time because of 
wind and rough weather," Juan Arce of the Pisces fleet said Tuesday. "Right now 
we have nice weather and fishing is still really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabulous is a more accurate description. One of the Pisces boats rounded 
land's end Tuesday flying five marlin flags, and the average catch per boat is 
two or three, Arce said. "And there's some wahoo, too, good-sized fish between 
60-70 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaviota fleet reported similar results this past week, with 59 catches (49 
releases) at the area known as the Golden Gate, where striped marlin to 150 
pounds have been holding up -- and gobbling up live mackerel -- for the past 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Fish and Game's new rule requiring anglers to display their 
fishing license above the waist is apparently paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Lavoie, DFG licensing officer, said she and fellow officer Eleanor 
Burke reported the sale of $33,378 worth of licenses and special-use stamps 
during the recent outdoor show in Long Beach. The money was twice that raised 
at last year's show. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavoie said about half the buyers were in favor of the display-your-license 
rule, which went into effect March 1 in an attempt to sell more licenses. 
"(But) we heard a lot of what-if stuff like, 'What if it falls off?' and 'What 
if I don't want to wear a hat or shirt when I fish?' " One posed the question, 
'What if I want to fish naked?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lavoie would only say that she gave an appropriate response to each question, 
including a reminder that failure to display the license could result in a 
$1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- White seabass, bonito, barracuda, yellowtail -- sure signs of 
spring, have been showing, however spottily, in the fish counts at Southland 
landings. This time last year, the white seabass bite at Catalina was the talk 
of the sportfishing community. So far, though, the bite hasn't been worthy of 
much discussion. Most of the fish that are being caught are too small to keep. 
The bulk of the effort remains on the bottom for rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: While the Cabo fleet is targeting marlin, the San Jose del 
Cabo fleet is putting its customers on top of a plethora of pargo. The tasty 
bottomfish are so prevalent at the Iman and Gordo Banks that boats are 
returning with up to 20 fish per day, according to a representative for 
Victor's panga fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 La Paz: Strong winds at times are keeping the fleet in the protected areas of 
Cerralvo Island. Pargo and yellowtail are in the area, but the bigger fish are 
more often than not making it back and breaking the line. "The fishing is 
quality, not quantity," said Kit McNear, who returned Sunday from holding a 
Western Outdoor News fishing school at La Paz. "The yellowtail are 35 and 40 
pounds and up and many of the pargo are the same. We had broken rods, rods 
pulled over the side. The people had a hell of a time catching those fish." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego long-range: The giant yellowfin at the Revillagigedo Islands have 
begun to feed a little more heartily. The American Angler returned Saturday 
with 19 anglers accounting for 165 tuna and a smattering of wahoo and other 
fish. The largest tuna was a 268-pounder by Vern Barney of San Diego. The 
largest fish was a 379-pound black marlin by San Diego's Greg Trompas, who 
fought the fish from an anchored boat. 
</P>
<P>
 San Martin Island: Yellowtail and barracuda are prevalent at the island off 
Baja, an indication of an early surface-fishing season. The Trilene Big Game 
returned to San Diego on Sunday with 105 yellowtail to 16 pounds and limits of 
barracuda and bonito for most of the 18 anglers. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Bay: Salmon season has begun and anglers are "mooching" for king 
salmon averaging 8-10 pounds, with limits or near-limits the rule outside the 
harbor and in a larger area 20-30 miles south, according to Roger Thomas, of 
the Salty Lady out of Sausalito. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSERVATION -- Nearly $3 million was raised during the Foundation for North 
American Wild Sheep's annual convention in San Antonio. Most of the money came 
from a bid of $310,000 for a Montana bighorn sheep permit and a bid of $110,000 
for a California desert bighorn permit. . . . Volunteers are needed to help 
construct a cattle enclosure around a bighorn sheep watering device March 19 in 
the desert 100 miles east of Barstow. According to the Society for the 
Conservation of Bighorn Sheep, stray cattle "have drunk dry the 3,000-gallon 
drinker" and left the sheep high and dry. Details: (213) 256-0463.

 CALENDAR -- Pacific Edge, Inc., is holding a halibut seminar today at 7-9:30 
p.m. at Reubens Restaurant in Marina del Rey. Cost is $10. Details: (818) 
762-5873. . . . Fred Hall's Western Fishing Tackle Show begins a five-day run

TENNIS; UPSETS ELIMINATE TOP CHALLENGERS TO TOP-SEEDED GRAF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Upsets eliminated Steffi Graf's three foremost challengers Tuesday at the 
Lipton Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time defending champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Gabriela Sabatini and 
Jana Novotna -- seeded second, third and fourth -- all departed in the space of 
less than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterfinal results left only longshots to face Graf, a 6-1, 6-1 winner 
over fifth-seeded Kimiko Date. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has won 30 consecutive matches and 53 sets in a row. Her dominance 
underscores a predictability and lack of depth that have hampered women's 
tennis in the absence of Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope all of women's tennis gets maybe a little bit more recognized," said 
Lindsay Davenport, a 17-year-old senior at Murrieta Valley High who defeated 
Sabatini, 6-1, 6-2. "Maybe some more players will be pushed into the media and 
the public's knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest stunner claimed second-ranked Sanchez Vicario, who squandered five 
consecutive match points and lost to Brenda Schultz, 1-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the match in my hands," Sanchez Vicario said, "but it went away." 
</P>
<P>
 Novotna blew a 4-0 lead in the second set against Natalia Zvereva, who won, 
7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Zvereva will play Schultz in Thursday's semifinals. Davenport will face Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 The top men weren't immune to upsets, either. Unseeded Australian Patrick 
Rafter defeated eighth-ranked Michael Chang, 6-2, 6-7 (7-2), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Grabb, ranked No. 185, defeated Aaron Krickstein, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5. Andre 
Agassi eliminated Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Goran Ivanisevic won in singles, then retired from his doubles match 
when he was hit in the side of the neck by a serve from partner Marc Rosset. 
Ivanisevic is expected to play singles tonight against Jim Courier, but will be 
re-evaluated beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, top-ranked Pete Sampras, Stefan Edberg and Petr Korda all advanced to 
the quarterfinals with straight-set victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario nearly was a straight-set winner. She led Schultz, 6-1, in 
their second-set tiebreaker, but the Dutchwoman took the next seven points to 
force a third set. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz, at 6 feet 2, slammed 10 aces and won 38 points at the net to 10 for 
Sanchez Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hits the ball very hard, harder than maybe any woman," Sanchez Vicario 
said. "When she puts in her serve, she is really dangerous."

NEWSWIRE: NO BAN SOUGHT ON ALCOHOL AT WORLD CUP SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, chairman of World Cup USA 1994, has backed off on his Feb. 18 
request to keep alcohol from being sold before and during games in the nine 
cities where the five-week tournament will be played this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't advocate the ban of alcoholic beverages at World Cup matches," 
Rothenberg said at a Tuesday news conference in New York. "I favor a 
responsible alcohol policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract between World Cup USA 1994 and the Rose Bowl, site of the final, 
gives concessions and novelties to the organization, according to Dave Jacobs, 
interim general manager at the Rose Bowl. Hence, a ban on alcohol would involve 
a large amount of lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol was banned from the 12 World Cup stadiums in Italy four years ago, and 
some Italian authorities stopped sales in entire cities before high-risk games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, who is heading a new U.S. soccer league that will start play next 
year, also announced that the Major Soccer League will be televised by ABC and 
ESPN.

his home Feb. 2, but he did not comment on the closed hearing. Miscellany

 The Cincinnati Bengals signed safety Louis Oliver to a two-year, $3.5 million 
contract. . . . The Washington Redskins have agreed to terms with Dallas Cowboy 
offensive lineman John Gesek on a contract reportedly worth $3.6 million over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edmonton Oilers and Winnipeg Jets swapped defensemen, with the Oilers 
sending Dave Manson and a draft pick to the Jets for Boris Mironov, center Mats 
Lindgren, who is playing in Sweden, and two draft picks. . . . Center Craig 
Janney, awarded by an arbitrator to Vancouver as partial compensation for the 
St. Louis Blues' signing of free agent Petr Nedved, said he wouldn't report to

LOS ALAMITOS; AFTER FOUR STAKES VICTORIES IN A ROW, LIL EGGIE FINDS HERSELF 
ALONE AT TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a lonely year for driver Frank Sherren and the 3-year-old trotter 
Lil Eggie. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonely at the top. Sherren has driven Lil Eggie to four stakes victories in as 
many starts this year and has watched the filly improve in each start. It also 
has him wondering how she will do against horses from other parts of the nation 
when Sherren takes her to the Mid-west. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she had a little left at the finish," Sherren said. "It's hard when 
you're racing by yourself. They kind of relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the summer, when its warm, we'll see what she can do. She's done what 
we've asked her to do so far with little effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Lil Eggie, a full-sister to Eggwhite, the star 3-year-old trotting filly of 
1993, has clearly been best of a small class of California-breds trotting 
fillies from the 1991 crop. Her winning times, though, have held up against 
others in history. She holds the track record for 2-year-old trotting fillies 
at Cal-Expo in Sacramento, breaking Eggwhite's record. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Alamitos this year, she has had three races on fast tracks and each one 
has been faster than the previous, including an easy victory in 2:02 2/5 on 
Thursday in a $15,000 division of the California Sires Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got pushed a little early (on Thursday), so she went a little faster," 
Sherren said. "I didn't want her to go 100 miles per hour, but she's so good I 
can do what I want. I don't want to say these are easy races, but they're 
easier than other tracks. If I took her anywhere else right now, she'd have to 
be in the invitational because she's got so much money ($47,500 in earnings) 
and so many wins (nine)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherren trains the filly for his parents, Jack and Ann Sherren, and for 
Northern California breeders Jim and Virginia Batagelos. The two couples also 
owned Eggwhite. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sherren says Lil Eggie will race a few more times at Los Alamitos before 
the meeting ends on April 2 and then race a few times at Sacramento, if a 
meeting occurs there this summer. After that, she has stakes engagements at 
tracks in Lexington, Ky., New Jersey and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "A trotting filly is hard to place because they have the least amount of 
stakes races," he said. "Pacing colts have a zillion of stakes." 
</P>

 Six victories in 10 starts this year have given the 4-year-old trotter Hays My 
Game every reason to stake his claim as the top older trotter at Los Alamitos 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hays My Game has won five of his last seven starts, including the $23,060 
Electioneer Futurity against his own age group in late January. But what he has 
done since has set him apart. 
</P>
<P>
 He has routinely defeated older horses in the invitational division, which 
seldom numbers more than six horses each week. The highlight of the season came 
on Feb. 5, when Hays My Game trotted a mile in a meet best 1:58 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Kenneth Smith of Brawley, Calif. and trained and driven by Rick 
Plano, Hays My Game won Friday's invitational trot by 1 3/4 lengths against the 
six best older trotters at the track -- Star Hangover, Gaelic King, Always The 
One, Armbro Laughter, Gotcha Spirit and Joe's Birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hays My Game's was the easiest of victories on Friday, a turnaround from his 
race on March 4. On Friday, Plano guided the son of Camp David to the lead 
going into the first turn and was never challenged through modest fractions. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't hurt that Armbro Laughter, who beat Hays My Game in the March 4 
race, went off-stride in the final turn and was well-beaten. The final time of 
1:59 2/5 was one of Hays My Game's fastest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't himself (on March 4)," Plano said. "He got roughed up a little bit 
and he never got a breather. He had to go to the front and (Armbro Laughter) 
got a perfect trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good horse and he's been that way from the start (of the year)," Plano 
said. "I expected him to win the stakes early and then become an invite horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Hays My Game has accomplished more during the brief Los Alamitos meeting than 
any other older trotter. He has earned more than $36,000 and aside from Joe's 
Birthday is the only horse to win at least two divisions of the invitational 
trot. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year of Hays My Game's three seasons of racing have been more lucrative 
than the previous. In 1992, as a 2-year-old, he earned $25,292, racing at 
Sacramento and Los Alamitos. Last year, he earned more than $57,000, winning 11 
of 28 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 This year -- in only 10 starts -- he is already over the $36,000 mark. The 
Electioneer Futurity, and a victory in an $18,000 division of the California 
Breeders Championship, have greatly enhanced his earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 His future, through, is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll definitely go to Sacramento if we have a meet there," Plano said. "I 
want to support that meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Plano is currently engaged in a close race with Ross Croghan for the lead in 
the driver's standings and with Doug Ackerman for the trainer's title. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter, Plano's stable has operated on two coasts. Aside from the Los 
Alamitos division, which numbers almost 30, Plano has several top-class pacers 
racing at The Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., site of the nation's top 
harness meeting. Keepyourpantson and The Starting Gate, two 4-year-old pacers, 
are both racing there. 
</P>
<P>
 Keepyourpantson was fifth in a division of the Four Leaf Clover Series on 
Saturday night. In four starts at The Meadowlands, Keepyourpantson is winless, 
but has finished second and third. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Len Blaylock, a driver with only three victories at the current meeting, was 
seriously injured in a four-horse accident on Saturday, the first harness spill 
at Los Alamitos since the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock was sent to Los Alamitos Medical Center late Saturday and later 
underwent surgery on a shattered elbow and a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred as the field turned for home for the final time in the 
one-mile pace. Sleep N Sealed, who was driven by Mark P'Pool, was making a move 
three horses wide when he apparently tried to step out of the hobble, a device 
usually made of plastic, that keeps the pacers' legs moving in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep N Sealed fell and P'Pool was thrown. Blaylock, who had been driving 
Lindas Lad along the rail, made a move for the outside and clearer racing room 
at the same moment as Sleep N Sealed's mishap. Blaylock was thrown and his 
elbow appeared to hit P'Pool's sulky. 
</P>
<P>
 D.R. Ackerman, and Infellable, and Nicol Tremblay with Lucky Lead'Em could not 
avoid the accident and fell. Ackerman and P'Pool appeared unhurt and Ackerman 
even won a race later in the program. Tremblay's ankle, however, later was 
diagnosed as having a chipped bone in it. 
</P>
<P>
 The four horses were not injured.

ARNOLD VICTIMIZES SAN DIEGO; COLLEGE BASEBALL: CENTER FIELDER'S FOUR RBIS, 
DIVING CATCH LEAD TO NORTHRIDGE'S 6-5 VICTORY, KERNEN'S 200TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Finally, Joey Arnold was the perpetrator. Most of the year, he'd been a 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold began the week with a batting average of .226 and 27 strikeouts in 84 
at-bats.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think I hit one ball on the barrel all last weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a barrel of fun on Tuesday. Arnold homered, doubled, drove in four runs 
and saved another with an acrobatic catch in center field to lead the Matadors 
to a 6-5 victory over the University of San Diego in a nonconference game at 
Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Matadors' fourth consecutive victory, their eighth in the past 
nine, ninth in the past 11. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was a milestone victory for Coach Bill Kernen, whose teams are 
200-105-3 in his six seasons at Northridge. In other words, Arnold and Kernen 
both entered the game flirting with the number 200 in one statistical form or 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having big problems clearing my head in the batter's box," said Arnold, 
a transfer from Pierce College. "I wasn't getting my head into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor the head of his bat. Things finally started going Arnold's way in the 
second inning, when he robbed Josh Stepner of a double with a diving grab in 
right-center. At least, that was the official ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Catch or no catch? 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold wouldn't answer for the record, but he did drop this not-so-subtle 
hint: "Don't want to make the umpires mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, it saved starter Rick Orr (1-1) a run, because Eric Morton 
followed with a double. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's luck held again in the fourth. With none out and runners on first and 
second, he was called on to lay down a sacrifice bunt with Northridge leading, 
1-0. He fouled off two attempts before Chris Collins wild-pitched the runners 
up a base. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold then doubled to drive in two, and one out later, swiped third on 
reliever David Russell's first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The theft forced San Diego, trailing by three runs, to play with a drawn-in 
infield and red-hot freshman Eric Gillespie grounded a single into center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie had two hits, marking his eighth multiple-hit game in the past nine, 
and raised his average to a team-high .394. He has 30 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr, a junior right-hander with a tricky knuckle-curve, was more than holding 
his own. In fact, Northridge held a 4-0 lead and Orr had allowed two hits 
through six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr committed a balk in the seventh, however, as San Diego (12-11) scored 
twice to halve the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 An unearned run in the eighth cut the margin to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Arnold made the difference in the bottom of the eighth, when he slammed 
a two-run homer -- his first -- for a 6-3 lead. The Matadors (13-10) needed 
everything they could get. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego scored twice in the ninth and had the potential tying run on first 
before Orr retired Stepner on a popup for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had plenty left, I felt," said Orr, a transfer from Cypress College who 
recorded his first complete game. "Nobody else felt that." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but Arnold had definitely experienced the same general feeling 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was starting to wonder when this (slump) would end," Arnold said.

MASTER'S REMEMBERS AT THE END; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MUSTANGS FALL TO GEORGIA 
SOUTHWESTERN, 98-86, IN SCHOOL'S FIRST NAIA TOURNAMENT, ENDING OATES' FIRST 
YEAR AS COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the end, it was hard to remember the good things. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to remember that The Master's College won 28 games in Bill Oates' 
first season coaching at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to remember that this season marked the first National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics tournament appearance for Master's. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was hard to remember exactly what went wrong during a 98-86 loss to 
Georgia Southwestern in the first round of the NAIA basketball tournament 
Tuesday at Oral Roberts University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just never got in sync," Master's center Emeka Okenwa said. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was echoed across the locker room. Generally, the Mustangs did 
not play well. Much of that had to do with the exceptional play of Georgia 
Southwestern guards Dwayne Harper, Marcus Jackson and Eric Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's guard Andy Thompson had the difficult dual task of guarding Harper 
and penetrating Southwestern's press. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I played well at all," said Thompson, who fouled out with 
nearly four minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the team as a whole didn't play our style, and that's my fault 
because I'm the point guard. That's very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Southwestern didn't trail and twice led by 10 points before Mike 
Penberthy's eight points, two steals and two assists cut the lead to 30-29 with 
just under six minutes to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But a technical foul on Thompson helped spark a 21-8 run by Georgia 
Southwestern that made the score 51-37 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really hurt us -- that was a six-point turnaround," Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Thompson was caught reaching in on Jackson, Thompson grimaced and was 
whistled for a technical, although it appeared he didn't say anything or try to 
show up the official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was the first 'T' of my life," Thompson said. "I was just 
walking away from the play, like I always do, and (the referee) said I got in 
his face." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Mustangs nibbled away at Georgia Southwestern's lead 
and trailed, 61-58, six minutes after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we got close, they would give the ball to No. 12, and he was on 
his game," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 was Harper, who scored 35 points. Master's, which played man-to-man 
defense throughout, could not stop his quick drives or his pull-up jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to put a lot of people on him to get fresh legs to guard him," Oates 
said. "He just dribbled around us, shot over us, or just put it in from 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was surprised to find himself guarded one-on-one so often and took 
advantage of it. Taylor added 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa scored 27 for Master's, followed by James Mosley (21), Penberthy (17) 
and Thompson (11). Master's finished the season with a 28-5 record, best in the 
school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Southwestern (24-9), which has three times greater enrollment than 
Master's (850), will play the winner of today's game between Mobile, Ala., and 
Midwestern State, Tex., in the second round.  
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it doesn't feel good to come all this way to lose in the first 
round," Thompson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But you know what? We had a great season. I never thought I would get to play 
on a team that was this good and go to a tournament like this. I feel blessed 
to be on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard, but he remembered.

GRIFFIN WINS DESPITE FLAW IN DELIVERY; HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL: WITH ARM GRAZING 
HER SIDE ON EACH PITCH, SENIOR LEADS SIMI VALLEY PAST NEWBURY PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley High's Sara Griffin possesses enough talent that even on an off 
day she still dominates. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case in the Pioneers' 2-0 victory over Newbury Park in a Marmonte 
League softball opener Tuesday at Borchard Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, the 1993 state player of the year, threw at about 80% of her 
potential because of a mechanical problem with her delivery, but still tossed a 
one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I'm not in a good mood because of my arm," said Griffin, who 
had a bag of ice wrapped around her arm after the game. "The speed wasn't 
there. I'm not gonna try to throw at full speed and hit my side. No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon delivery, Griffin's lower arm constantly grazed her right hip just before 
her release. As a result Griffin was unable to produce maximum rotation and her 
pitches simply lacked their normal zip. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite her pitching problems, Newbury Park (3-1) did little to take 
advantage. Only three Panthers reached base and Brandi Funk provided Newbury 
Park's only hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Funk looped a single into right-center field to lead off the fourth. Melissa 
Thornhill slapped a ground ball to the left side and third baseman Lisa 
DeStefano bobbled the dribbler. A double steal put Funk and Thornhill in 
scoring position with none out. 
</P>
<P>
 But Griffin (5-0), who struck out eight, retired the next three batters to end 
the Panthers' only threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (7-0), the top-ranked team in the state, managed five hits off 
Carolina Bernal (2-1). Three hits never left the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know at this level they don't ever let up," Simi Valley Coach Suzanne 
Manlet said. "We run sprints every day and two or three times it paid off for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Hatfield led off the third with a line-drove single to right field. 
Hatfield advanced to second on DeStefano's bunt and to third on a ground out. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out, Jenny Conmay beat out a slow ground ball to the right side and 
Hatfield scored the only run the Pioneers would need. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley added another run in the fourth when Nicole Newhart scored on a 
throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Griffin's arm problems, which began to develop in the Simi Valley 
tournament over the weekend, no one seems overly concerned. "She threw a 
one-hitter," Manlet said. "I have to be happy with that."

WOLF GUNS HIS WAY PAST MONROE, 10-1; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: SCOUTS FLOCK TO DUEL 
BETWEEN EL CAMINO REAL ACE AND VIKINGS' ZAMUDIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The radar guns were lined up two deep behind the Monroe High backstop Tuesday, 
which meant one thing -- El Camino Real's Randy Wolf and Monroe's Joel Zamudio 
were pitching. Six scouts clocked their every toss. 
</P>
<P>
 That's life as a live-armed prospect. One scout had to stand on tiptoes, 
straining to hold his gun above an equipment shed attached to the rear of the 
backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good (to get so much attention)," Zamudio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get kind of nervous, but after a while I forget about the scouts and 
concentrate on my pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zamudio and Wolf were clocked in the mid-to-high 80 mile-per-hour range, 
so call their speed duel a draw. As far as the game was concerned, though, the 
matchup was one-sided. Wolf dominated, pitching a two-hitter in the 
Conquistadores' 10-1 nonconference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, the City Section 4-A player of the year last year, improved to 3-0. In 
his three starts this season, the senior left-hander has thrown three complete 
games and allowed only seven hits and three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing all right," he said. "I have to do work on a lot of things, though. 
My mechanics aren't straight on. I'm trying to work on that every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three Monroe batters reached base against Wolf, who allowed merely two 
third-inning singles. The second hit, by Viking third baseman Michael Perez, 
scored Evan Lovett from second base and trimmed a Viking deficit to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wolf promptly picked off Perez to end the inning and did not allow a 
ball to be hit out of the infield the remainder of the game. He finished with 
seven strikeouts. Monroe dropped to 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamudio (0-2) also pitched well, allowing only one earned run through six 
innings. However, his teammates committed three errors, and by the time he left 
the game at the end of the sixth, Monroe trailed, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made too many botches defensively," Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell said. 
"Against a kid like Wolf, you can only give him three outs per inning, not four 
or five like we did." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real (4-0) scored five runs in the top of the seventh against 
reliever Michael Perez, including two on a triple by Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Said El Camino Real Coach Maio: "He just keeps on doing the job."

NAIA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT; THE END COMES QUICKLY FOR THE MASTER'S 
</P>

<P>
 Its first trip to the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics basketball 
tournament was short and sour for The Master's College. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseeded Georgia Southwestern defeated the 10th-seeded Mustangs, 98-86, in the 
first round Tuesday at the Mabee Center on the campus of Oral Roberts 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne Harper scored 35 points and Eric Taylor 28 for Georgia Southwestern 
(24-9). 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to put a lot of different people on (Harper) to get fresh legs to 
guard him," Master's Coach Bill Oates said. "He just dribbled around us, shot 
over us or just put it in from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Master's (28-5), which trailed by 10 points twice in the first half, cut 
its deficit to 30-29 with 5:28 to play before halftime. But after guard Andy 
Thompson was called for a technical foul, the Mustangs never really recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really hurt us," Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous questionable calls affected the Mustangs, center Emeka Okenwa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called a lot of blocking fouls early and then other things they didn't 
call," said Okenwa, who scored 27 points. "We didn't know how the officials 
were going to call the game. You don't want to foul out, so you have to play 
off of your man. We were out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
 James Mosley, who scored 21 points for The Master's, said the Mustangs simply 
played a bad game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes that happens," he said. "We weren't tired from traveling, but maybe 
the arena and the setting had something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when The Master's closed to within three points in the second half, 
Georgia Southwestern retained control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we got close, they would give the ball to (Harper), and he was on 
his game," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper said he was surprised that he was not trapped and double-teamed more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were leaving me one-on-one too much," he said. "As a good offensive 
player, I felt that was to my advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific (28-4), seeded 11th, will play unseeded Transylvania (25-7) of 
Kentucky and unseeded Westmont (18-12) will play third-seeded Salem Teikyo 
(24-3) of West Virginia in first-round games today. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Southwestern will play the winner of today's game between Mobile 
(Ala.) and Midwestern State of Texas in the second round Thursday.

SKIING / WORLD CUP FINALS; MOE LOOKS FOR RESPECT TO GO WITH STARDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Obviously not satisfied with mere Olympic glory, American Tommy Moe enters the 
World Cup finals this week with a chance to prove he is a fixture in Alpine 
skiing, not a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, winner of gold and silver medals at the Lillehammer Olympics, is looking 
to become the first American to win an individual World Cup title since Phil 
Mahre in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 With his first World Cup victory at Whistler, Canada, last weekend, Moe moved 
to within 47 points of Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli in the super-G standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahre won his title in giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 While Olympic victories make stars, respect among skiers is attained through 
achievements on the World Cup circuit, where champions are determined based on 
consistent performances throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe is not content with flash-in-the-pan success. The 24-year-old from 
Girdwood, Alaska, proved it last weekend by finishing third in the Whistler 
downhill on Saturday and winning the super-G on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe leads a world-class field into the final week of World Cup competition, 
which begins today with a downhill, followed by a super-G Thursday, a giant 
slalom on Saturday and a slalom on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Olympics, men and women compete on the same day in each event. In 
disciplines where World Cup point totals are close, final races will determine 
the champions in the four events -- downhill, super-G, GS and slalom -- and 
perhaps the overall winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt holds a comfortable points lead over Girardelli 
in the men's overall standings, but the women's race between Switzerland's 
Vreni Schneider and Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg is close, with the winner to be 
determined this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, with his most recent victory, moved to seventh in the overall standings 
and has a legitimate chance to overtake Girardelli in the super-G. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm refocused," Moe said after finishing third in Tuesday's downhill training 
run. "I want to put on a good show for the home crowd. I'm confident now. I've 
had five top-threes this season and any time I get in the start in downhill or 
super-G, I feel I can win." 
</P>
<P>
 Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $220,000 prize money will be awarded this week. The money breakdown 
for each race: $16,500 for first, $8,250 for second and $2,750 for third. . . . 
The top 20 skiers in each discipline are guaranteed starts in the finals based 
on World Cup points. Defending Olympic champions are also invited, which saved 
super-G gold medalist Diann Roffe-Steinrotter of the United States, who would 
not have qualified otherwise. Also receiving invitations are Junior World and 
Europa Cup champions, the top three finishers in the NorAm series 
championships, and World Cup skiers who have amassed more than 400 World Cup 
points. As it stands, Olympic silver medalist Picabo Street is only eligible to 
ski today's downhill, but could surpass the 400-point mark with a good 
performance, which would qualify her for Thursday's super-G. . . Luxembourg's 
Marc Girardelli probably will not catch Kjetil Andre Aamodt to win an 
unprecedented sixth World Cup overall championship, but he is the points leader 
in both downhill and super-G.

WILSON GAVE HERSELF A BIRTHDAY GIFT, HER DUCKS A BERTH IN THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD and BILL WALKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Sara Wilson, two days from 21, an early birthday present. For Wilson's 
Oregon Ducks, a 76-68 victory over UCLA at Pauley Pavilion and an NCAA 
tournament invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't easy. UCLA, with an aggressive half-court, man-to-man defense, 
caused numerous Duck turnovers Saturday and led at the half of the final 
regular-season game, 33-30. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon answered with an 8-0 run to take a 38-35 lead, but the Bruins weren't 
through. Debbie Sporcich, the Ducks' All-Pac-10 forward, went to the bench with 
a knee injury, and UCLA reclaimed a lead that grew to six points. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 58-54, with five minutes remaining, Oregon went on an unlikely 7-0 run, 
taking a lead it held to the finish.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were determined. We definitely weren't going to lose again," said Wilson, 
whose team had dropped previous games to Stanford and USC. "We wanted to go out 
on a winning note." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who scored 18, called on the past for further motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the playoffs weren't involved, this game was definitely special," 
Wilson said in the aftermath, surrounded by well-wishers including Pam Walker, 
a UCLA assistant who coached her at Hart High and Nicole Anthony, Nikki Brodowy 
and Kim Posey, Indian starters from a 1989 Southern Section championship team. 
The fifth starter, Anjanette Dionne, was at USC playing for Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year I've been at Oregon, our team has come to Southern California and 
lost to USC and UCLA," she said. "We were 0-7. How would that look if we lost 
again and I never won a college game in my home town?" DANA HADDAD and BILL 
WALKER

 Fannie Mae to Reach Out to Potential Home Buyers: The nation's largest home 
mortgage investor said it plans to help finance homes for 10 million families

now renting.The Federal National Mortgage Assn. said it expects to put $1 
trillion into the effort by the close of the decade. Since its inception in 
1938, Fannie Mae has provided about $1.35 trillion in home financing. The plan 
will also serve families with incomes at or below the median for their 
communities, new immigrants, residents of central cities and other underserved 
areas.

INFLATION NEWS CLIPS YIELDS; STOCKS MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * News of a small rise in the core rate of wholesale inflation 
last month was well-received by bond traders, who let yields fall. Another 
inflation test looms today. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wall Street closed mixed, with smaller stocks again in the lead. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders breathed a collective sigh of relief after the government 
reported the wholesale inflation figure for February. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Commerce Department said overall wholesale inflation rose 0.5%, 
economists said the jump was attributed almost entirely to soaring prices for 
heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, rose just 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 The news sent the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond tumbling to 6.87% from 
6.95% on Monday, and shorter-term yields also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the number was terrific," said John V. Sebastian, analyst at bond 
firm Clayton Brown & Associates in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The market faces another test today, when the government reports consumer 
price inflation in February. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, subdued inflation should give investors more confidence to lock in 
current yields on bonds, because long-term market interest rates tend to 
decline in periods of low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, bond yields have surged as investors have bet that the strong 
economy will push inflation up as well. But the wholesale inflation figure 
suggested those expectations were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts say the market also has another fear: that the Federal 
Reserve Board will continue to push short-term rates up to restrain the economy 
and that long-term yields will automatically rise with short rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed was a help to the bond market Tuesday, buying an estimated $3.5 
billion to $4 billion in Treasury securities in its seasonal operation to add 
to banking system reserves, analysts said. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Blue chips eased Tuesday, but smaller stocks continued to rebound sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials lost 13.39 points to 3,849.59, paying little mind to the 
bond market rally. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 
to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 And buyers again showed a preference for smaller stocks, which have led the 
market's slow climb back from its recent slide. In fact, the Nasdaq industrial 
index, heavy with small technology issues, rose 0.68 point to a record high 
842.12. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Dow remains 3.2% below its record high. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the market's improving tone, some analysts say investors are on edge, 
worrying that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates for a second time 
when its policy-making committee meets next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some financial services and mutual fund company shares rose in the wake of 
GE Capital's unsolicited takeover offer for Kemper Securities. Kemper shot up 4 
3/4 to 61 3/4, SunAmerica gained 2 to 40 1/2, Travelers added 1 1/4 to 37 3/8, 
Franklin Resources rose 3/4 to 47 3/4 and Dreyfus surged 1 1/2 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology winners included Intel, up 1 1/4 to 71 1/4; Western Digital, up 1 
1/4 to 19 3/4; Filenet, up 3/4 to 27; California Amplifier, up 3/4 to 5 1/4, 
and 3Com, up 3 5/8 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, Jefferies Group added 1/8 to 30 5/8. After the 
market closed, the brokerage said it will spin off its Investment Technology 
Group in a public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's losers, Perrigo, a maker of store-brand-name

 Strike Threatens Production at GM Assembly Plants: Negotiators for General 
Motors Corp. and unionized workers at two brake plants resumed contract talks, 
seeking to end a strike that could soon shut down at least two GM assembly 
plants.Three thousand members of United Auto Workers Local 696 in Dayton, Ohio, 
walked off the job Monday after negotiators failed to agree on a new three-year 
contract. Joe Hasenjager, president of the local, has said the issues 
separating the two sides include job security and subcontracting. GM officials 
say production at the company's Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., and its 
truck plant in Janesville, Wis., will have to stop if the strike is not 
resolved by today.

INFLATION NEWS SENDS BOND PRICES SOARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * News of low wholesale inflation last month sent long-term 
bond prices soaring Tuesday, but caution ahead of a second inflation report 
today tempered the enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market failed to shake inflation worries and finished mixed. 
Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The bond market also got some unexpected help from the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York, which bought Treasury securities to meet a seasonal need to replenish 
banking system reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's key 30-year bond yield dropped to 6.87% from 6.95% on Monday. 
Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 29/32 point, or $9.06 
per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported that inflation at the wholesale level jumped 
0.5% in February, but bond traders dismissed the increase because it was 
attributed almost entirely to soaring prices for heating oil in response to the 
unusually cold winter.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, market participants focused on a 0.1% increase in the so-called core 
producer price index -- excluding volatile energy and food prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the inflation report should ease pressure on the Federal Reserve 
Board to raise interest rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 A perception of reduced pressure on the Fed spurred bond buying and pushed up 
prices, because higher rates on new securities would hurt the value of 
already-sold bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market view that inflation is under control was far from unanimous. In 
a separate report, the Fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in February, 
its ninth straight advance. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the weekly Johnson Redbook report showed retail sales increased a 
sharp 5.8% in the first two weeks of March from the February average. 
</P>
<P>
 Both reports seemed to point toward inflationary economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Also giving a lift to bond prices, the central bank bought an estimated $3.5 
billion to $4 billion in Treasury securities in its seasonal operation to add 
to banking system reserves, said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. Other News  
</P>
<P>
 The government's wholesale price report sent stock prices up, but profit 
taking in blue chips and other technical factors set in by noon. Analysts cited 
the other less-well-known signs of inflation that kept investors cautious and 
quick to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed off 13.39 points at 3,849.59. The blue 
chip indicator hovered near Monday's close of 3,862.98 but was knocked down in 
midafternoon by computer-generated sell programs before recovering ground at 
the close, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 8 
on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 303.26 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader indexes didn't fare as badly. The NYSE's composite index lost 0.02 to 
258.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.38 to 467.01. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on the plus side, the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller 
companies gained 0.71 to 793.51. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks closed mostly higher after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
reported record commercial bank earnings in 1993. Citicorp gained 1/2 to 40, 
First Chicago gained 2 1/4 to 49 3/4 and First Interstate rose 1 to 69 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kemper, the insurance and mutual fund concern, gained 4 3/4 at 61 3/4 on the 
NYSE, a day after GE Capital Corp. announced a $2.2-billion bid for the 
company. General Electric, parent of GE Capital, was down 3/8 at 104 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perrigo lost 5 to 22 3/8 after a securities analyst downgraded his earnings 
forecast for the drug maker. 
</P>
<P>
 * AT&T, which joined a consortium building the first undersea fiber-optic 
system linking Vietnam, Thailand and Hong Kong, gained 1 1/8 to 52 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time Warner added 1 to 40 on rumors that Seagram's will make a takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold prices rose on the New York Comex, closing at $386.90 an 
ounce, up 50 cents from Monday. Silver finished up 1.5 cents at $5.462 an 
ounce.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; FLORA'S PROVES HE BELONGS IN LINEUP WITH 
STRONG PLAY AT SECOND BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first spring-training game was the worst, Angel second baseman Kevin Flora 
says. He woke up that day thinking about his late wife, looked into the stands 
envisioning she was there, and sat on the bench wondering if she were watching 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my test," said Flora, whose wife, MaryAnn, was killed last season in 
a car accident. "It was a bad day, a real bad day. But I knew I had to go in 
there or it would make the next one that much worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora was able to survive emotionally that day, but two games later on March 
6, wondered if his bid for a starting job was coming to a halt. He sustained a 
strained right quadriceps, and spent the past week feeling as if the job was 
slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 Any lingering doubts of whom the Angels want as their starting second baseman 
ended Tuesday with Flora's return in their 13-6 victory over the San Diego 
Padres. He was hitless in two at-bats, but hit a hard grounder and was superb 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin's play woke up a few guys," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "You can 
really see the difference. He gives you that speed, that range, and he can run. 
There's a big gap between him and the others, talent-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the only guy we have who can be an everyday second baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Flora: "For the first time, I finally sense I belong here. Everything's 
behind me. I really feel I can win the job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels placed catcher Mike Fitzgerald on waivers for the purpose of giving 
him his unconditional release, and optioned left fielder Garret Anderson to 
triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald is expected to reject the Angels' offer to be their backup catcher 
at triple-A Vancouver and instead is interested in pursuing a coaching career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have my agent send faxes out to every team to let them know I'm 
available," Fitzgerald said, "but it looks like my career ended on a homer in 
Peoria (last week against Seattle). I wish I had it on tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, 33, who played 10 years in the major leagues -- including 1992 
with the Angels -- knew he was no longer needed once Rodgers decided to employ 
only two catchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how one pitch can change your whole life," Fitzgerald said. "If 
not for the one wild pitch (in 1986) that snapped my finger, I could have made 
millions in this game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Fitzgerald's baseball career probably is over, the Angels believe 
Anderson, 21, will be a star.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told Anderson we're not grooming him to be the fourth outfielder," Rodgers 
said. "If he keeps going about it the same way, there's no reason he won't be 
in camp competing for a starting outfield job next year. He's got a chance to 
be a pretty good player." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a graduate from Granada Hills Kennedy High School, certainly has few 
doubts that he'll soon be in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doesn't bother me at all that I'm going down," said Anderson, "because I 
know I'll be in the big leagues. They heard a lot about me, and now they know 
got to see it with their own eyes." BOB NIGHTENGALE

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: FOUR TITAN WRESTLERS MAKE NCAA 
MEET, BUT COACH WANTED FIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week's NCAA wrestling championships will be slightly bittersweet for Cal 
State Fullerton Coach Ardeshir Asgari. He hopes it will be sweeter by the end 
of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 He's delighted he has four wrestlers qualified for the competition, which runs 
Thursday though Saturday at the University of North Carolina. That's the 
second-highest number for the school; seven Titans made it in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Maes (126 pounds) and Laszlo Molnar (167) qualified for the NCAAs for a 
fourth time. Dwayne Buth (190) also qualified in 1992. Ken Workman (142) will 
be making his first NCAA appearance. No Titan wrestler had previously qualified 
four consecutive times, and Asgari takes pride in the way that reflects on the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone disappointment for Asgari: One of his strongest wrestlers and another 
senior, Christian Holiday, didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel bad about that," Asgari said. "He came so close to making 
All-American last year and didn't. He won three matches in the nationals but 
didn't wrestle well in the fourth, and that was the one he needed. I sure wish 
he could have had another chance this year." 
</P>
<P>
 That loss cost him a spot in the top eight, which affords All-American 
recognition. But Holiday, who had 26 victories in 35 matches and finished 
fourth at 158 pounds in the Pac-10 championships, still has an outside chance. 
He's the second alternate, which means he could still get in if two wrestlers 
withdraw because of illness or injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Asgari, however, is optimistic the other four will represent the school well. 
None of them won at the Pac-10 meet, but Workman (23-11) was second in his 
division. Workman surprised the top-seeded wrestler, Tony Evans of Boise State, 
with a 5-2 decision but was beaten in the final, 5-4, by Cory Sonnen of Oregon. 
Buth (23-10), Maes (27-6) and Molnar (20-6) all were third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all four of our guys have a good chance to make All-American, but so 
much depends on how they wrestle on the given day and what kind of draw they 
get," Asgari said. "If they get one of the top two seeds in the early rounds, 
it will be rough." 
</P>
<P>

</P>

 Mike Ammann, goalkeeper for Al Mistri's soccer team that reached the NCAA 
final four last season before losing to South Carolina in a semifinal, has been 
selected for the U.S. national B team that will train and compete in Bermuda, 
March 26-April 2. The B team will play against Bermuda's Olympic squad and a 
select team picked from Bermuda club and soccer league players. Ammann was one 
of two goalkeepers chosen in tryouts this month at Seminole, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection keeps Ammann in contention, although probably as a longshot, for 
a spot on the 22-man team that will compete in the World Cup. That squad will 
be picked in May. "It will be good experience and some travel for me, but 
beyond that, we'll just have to see," Ammann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ammann, whose brother Bob is a goalkeeper for the Salsa, gave up only 20 goals 
in 21 games for the Titans. He had 67 saves and nine shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really impressed with Mike," said John Ellinger, who is coaching the 
B team. "We'd seen him in the NCAA semifinals, and he had been highly 
recommended to us by several coaches who had seen him play in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Ammann is 6 feet 3 and 190 pounds, and Ellinger commented: "I really didn't 
realize how big he is until I saw him in our training camp. He has great 
quickness for a big man. He's very quick when it comes to getting to low balls. 
This is his first time in a national team situation, but he appears to have all 
the tools to do well down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mistri, three other Titan players will be in contention for 
future national teams. He regards Adrian Cortes, a recent transfer from Cal 
State Los Angeles, as a possibility for the 1996 Olympic team. Demian Brown and 
Alfred Partida also are future age-group national team possibilities. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Titan track Coach John Elders is enjoying having his own home facility this 
season after the problems of a year ago. All meets last spring had to be held 
at away sites because the Fullerton track was mistakenly designed and built to 
incorrect specifications, 440 yards rather than 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that it's fixed, it's a first-rate facility," Elders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with the first two home meets of the spring: Hurdles and 
steeplechase barriers had to be borrowed from UC Irvine. Fullerton's still 
hadn't arrived last weekend from the New York company from which they were 
ordered. Elders said the company's shipments have been running behind because 
of the bad weather in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend's Titan Invitational produced two school records. Zaylore Stout 
cleared 6 feet 10 inches to finish second in the high jump, and Greg Thewes ran 
21.86 in the 200 meters in finishing sixth in his heat. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Titan baseball team remains No. 1 in the national rankings by Collegiate 
Baseball. Florida State (20-5) is second and Georgia Tech (13-3) third. 
Baseball America has Florida State ranked first, Fullerton second and Georgia 
Tech third. Fullerton is 18-4 after the three-game sweep of Grand Canyon during 
the weekend and has a home game at 7 p.m. tonight against Pepperdine. The 
Titans play at UCLA at 7 p.m. Friday and meet the Bruins at home at 1 p.m. 
Saturday. . . . Jason Gill, who replaced Craig Skyberg at third base when 
Skyberg quit the team for personal reasons, was four for nine with two doubles 
against Grand Canyon. He had one error in 11 chances at third in the series. 
He's five for 12 (.417) at the plate for the season. Skyberg was hitting .228 
when he left the team. . . . Coach Bill Reynolds' women's tennis team will be 
the host for the third Titan Classic Friday through Sunday. Also entered are 
Idaho State, Cal State Northridge, New Hampshire, Montana State, Sacramento 
State, St. Mary's and Nebraska. . . . The softball team plays Saturday in its 
Mini PONY tournament. Ohio State and Kansas also will compete in round-robin 
play. The regular PONY-Louisville Slugger tournament begins March 23.

 Tiger Woods is absent from the Western High golf team this week, but he has a 
good excuse: a note from Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods accepted a personal invitation from Palmer to play in the Nestle 
Invitational in Orlando, Fla.The PGA Tour event starts Thursday at Bay Hill, 
which Palmer owns. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Woods' fifth PGA event and sixth major professional tournament. 
Last month, he made the cut for the first time in a pro event, at the Johnnie 
Walker Classic in Phuket, Thailand. Woods finished eight-over-par 292 in the 
four-day tournament, 15 strokes behind winner Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Coach Don Crosby said Woods' absence won't hurt the team because the 
league season hasn't started. 
</P>
<P>
 "He missed one week last year," Crosby said, "and one this year, which is no 
big deal because he'll come back next week fired up." MARTIN BECK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brandon Jessie of Ventura College and Jamie Townsend of Columbia have been 
named California junior college men's basketball co-players of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, a 6-foot-5 sophomore forward from Edison High in Huntington Beach, 
helped the Pirates reach the state title game in each of his two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura lost to Long Beach City, 63-61, in this year's final and to Columbia, 
97-88, in last year's.

and 5.7 assists. He and Jessie were co-most valuable players in the Western 
State Conference North Division. Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
 The Harvard-Westlake High volleyball team, touted as the top team in the area, 
suffered a blow when senior Doug Park quit the team last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, a 6-foot-1 outside hitter who would have been one of five returning 
starters, surprised teammates and Coach Jess Quiroz with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was pretty upset because there was no notice whatsoever," Quiroz 
said. "No one had any idea this was going to happen." Running

GIRLS' TRACK AND FIELD / SEASON PREVIEW; DEEP THOUSAND OAKS WON'T BE JUST 
ANOTHER TEAM CALLED JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marion Jones has taken her nine state and 10 Southern Section championships to 
the college ranks at North Carolina, but there is no reason to fret over the 
health of the girls' track and field program at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, under the direction of 17th-year Coach Art Green, appear to be 
doing just fine, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' chances of winning a Southern Section team title this season -- 
as they did in 1992 with Jones -- are slim. There is little hope of the Lancers 
finishing third in the state championships as they did last year, yet they 
might have enough depth to win their first Marmonte League title in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure yet how good this team is," Green said. "When we get everyone 
together in (Thursday's meet against Camarillo and Westlake), I'll have a 
better idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that we have more depth than before and that should make it 
easier on the kids. Instead of them having to run in three or four events every 
meet, they can run in two events this meet and in two events next meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' departure has brought a refreshing return to normalcy for Green, who 
frequently found himself besieged last year by college coaches, reporters and 
other interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the telephone calls and the interviews wear on you," he said. 
"And that's nothing against the kid, but it does take a toll on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the incomparable Jones -- who posted marks of 11.13 seconds in the 
100, 22.58 in the 200, 52.79 in the 400 and 22 feet 1/2 inch in the long jump 
-- all of Thousand Oaks' leading performers return from the team that finished 
third in the league finals behind Agoura and Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Kim Mortensen leads the returnees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen ran 5:12.74 in the 1,600 meters and 11:05.46 in the 3,200 as a 
freshman, and followed that with a superb sophomore cross-country season. She 
placed 10th in the Foot Locker West regional in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow sophomore Tara Marsden, who finished 14th in the state Division I 
cross-country championships, timed 2:22.91 in the 800 and will give the Lancers 
a potent one-two punch in the distance events. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Crystal Crawford has put the shot 34 feet 2 inches, thrown the 
discus 112-5, and timed 12.8 seconds in the 100, making her one of the Lancers' 
top sprinters as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Trina Sognnaes has bests of 15-11 in the long jump and 34-2 in the 
triple jump, junior Kim Robinson has timed 12.8 in the 100 and 26.8 in the 200, 
and sophomore Michelle Stevenson, who has cleared 5-1 in the high jump, will 
run the 300 low hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jenny House is the Lancers' top returning 300 hurdler with a personal 
best of 49.4, and junior Molly Orr has run 16.5 in the 100 high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good, young group of kids," Green said. "But when you've got a 
group like this, you've got to be careful. You don't want to spread them too 
thin over too many events. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If this group (of sophomores and juniors) stays with it and can keep rested, 
that will really make a difference when they're seniors." Other Teams to Watch 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands -- After finishing second behind Agoura in the Marmonte League 
finals, the Raiders were tabbed as favorites this year. However, the academic 
ineligibility of sophomore Sharika Higgins and junior Laquina Moore has hurt 
their chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins was the runner-up to Jones in the 100 and 200 in the league finals. 
Moore finished second in the 100 highs and also has run 26.58 in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands still fields a strong team led by seniors Delores Tuimoloau 
and Shawanda Hotchkiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau raised her personal best in the shotput to a region record 46-11 1/2 
in Saturday's Ventura Relays and set a Ventura County record of 142-0 in the 
discus last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss has personal bests of 17-1 in the long jump and 35-8 1/2 in the 
triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Dawn Harper set a personal best of 17-1 in the long jump to defeat 
Hotchkiss by an inch in the Ventura Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Kosha Boyd (26.5 in the 200) and Tamara Anderson (12.7 in the 100) give the 
Raiders solid, if not spectacular, performances in the sprints, but a group of 
young, inexperienced hurdlers and distance runners must develop quickly for the 
Raiders to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be interesting to see what happens," first-year Coach Myra Bemis said. 
"A lot of people have told the girls that we're not going to be that good this 
season because we don't have Sharika and Laquina, but the girls want to prove 
them wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura -- The two-time defending Marmonte League champions finished second in 
last year's Southern Section Division I championships, but without Amy 
Skieresz, the Chargers' chances of equaling that feat seem slim. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, the two-time defending state Division I cross-country champion and 
the defending section champion in the 1,600 and 3,200, will not run this season 
in order to concentrate on raising her grades to meet her parents' standards. 
</P>
<P>
 With Skieresz out, Cathy Prater becomes Agoura's most valuable performer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater finished third in the 300 low hurdles in last year's state 
championships and has a personal best of 44.45 in that event. She has also run 
15.4 in the 100 highs, bounded 34-3 1/2 in the triple jump, and has the 
potential to be a superb performer in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mile and two mile are the only events she hasn't competed in," Coach Bill 
Duley said, "and she could do both of those before the season is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Nekota, runner-up to Skieresz in the 1,600 and 3,200 in last year's league 
championships, has personal bests of 5:00.98 in the former and 10:52.68 in the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Bleiberg, defending league champion in the high jump, has cleared 5-2 in 
that event, and Carrie Malnekoff gives the Chargers a solid performer in the 
400 and long jump with bests of 59.76 and 16-3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa -- The Spartans lost several key performers to graduation, but Buena 
Coach Steve Blum says they remain the favorite to win their ninth consecutive 
Channel League title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be one of the better dual-meet teams around, but my goal is to 
not get blown out by them," Blum said of Rio Mesa. "Last year, they just 
creamed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Andrea Wasden leads the Spartan sprint and hurdle corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasden timed 12.6 in the 100, 26.04 in the 200 and 14.98 in the 100 high 
hurdles as a sophomore, and ran 46.3 in the 300 lows last week in her first 
race at that distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina DeVries has personal bests of 5 feet in the high jump, 15-11 in the 
long jump and 33-9 3/4 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey Mescher has run 2:19.50 in the 800, and Susyn Heidenrich (46.42 in the 
300 lows) gives the Spartans depth in the hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Briana Kanongata'a has a best of 107-3 in the discus and Coach Brian 
FitzGerald says she has the potential to be a 120-foot thrower. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart -- The Indians won their third consecutive Foothill League title last 
season and their top 10 point scorers in dual-meet competition return. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica De La Cerda, the defending league champion in the 800, has run 2:19.3 
in that event and 5:11.82 in the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy James, defending league champion in the 100 and 200, has run 12.6 and 
26.7 in those events, and Melissa Dunkerley has bests of 5-2 in the high jump, 
15-9 in the long jump and 34 feet in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Karianne Usrey has personal bests of 37-8 3/4 in the shotput and 112-2 in the 
discus, and is the defending league champion in both events. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Dietz is the defending league champion in the 100 highs (personal best 
of 16.5) and has bounded 33-2 in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, first-year Coach John Ahart is not convinced that Hart should be 
favored to win its fourth league title in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saugus will be real strong in the distance races and Burroughs always seems 
to have a good team," he said. "If we stay healthy, we should do OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena -- FitzGerald calls Buena the Channel League favorite, but Blum 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the ones who have won (eight) titles in the row," Blum said. 
"Sounds like Brian's saying that to get his team motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Stacy Hebert and junior Amy Van Atta are expected to be the 
Bulldogs' top performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert has a personal best of 45.6 in the 300 lows and finished second in last 
year's Southern Section Division II championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Atta was a Division II finalist in the 1,600 and has bests of 5:12.45 in 
that event and 2:22.43 in the 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth McGill (34-0 3/4) and Julianna Rosick (32-2 3/4) give Buena solid depth 
in the triple jump, as do Gilliam Barkalow (60.9) and Kristi Garza (62.53) in 
the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Golden has a best of 110 feet in the discus. Individuals to Watch 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriela Rodriguez (Oxnard) -- The Yellowjacket senior was a well-beaten 
fourth in the 3,200 in the Spartan Relays at Rio Mesa on March 5, but her time 
of 11:15.57 bodes well for the future. She typically starts the season slowly 
before reaching her peak in May and June. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez started slowly last year, yet ran a personal best of 10:52.34 to 
finish fourth in the Southern Section Masters Meet and followed with a 
third-place effort in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Watson (Saugus) -- As a sophomore, Watson cleared 5-5 in the high jump 
and finished second in the Southern Section 4-A Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, she improved to 5-7 and won the section Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, she would like to tack another two inches onto her personal best 
and qualify for the finals of the state meet for the first time.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: CLASSIFIED INFORMATION NETS A COACH

listings. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake, the defending Marmonte League champion, is ranked seventh in 
Division I by the Southern Section. But Alan Hopkins left the program after 
last season because of a conflict with a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 So the school ran a classified advertisement in a local newspaper. Grant 
Calkins, 54, answered the want ad and got the job. But Calkins is no stranger 
to the Warriors. He served as a volunteer coach in the mid-1980s when his 
daughter, Sandi Calkins, played singles. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Calkins feel about suddenly coaching a top-10 team? 
</P>
<P>
 "As a neophyte coach, I don't know," he said. "But I think we should be ranked 
higher." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you like pitching, keep on eye on the Marmonte League. Assuming pitchers 
improve with experience, the league should have plenty of good ones. Ten 
pitchers who threw 37 innings or more last year are back. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Camarillo's Matt Buttell; Newbury Park's Keith Smith and Ray Clinton; 
Royal's David Vicari and Maki Kramer; Simi Valley's Bill Scheffels; Thousand 
Oaks' Tim Baron and Brian Downing; and Westlake's Chris Flanagan and Todd 
Singleton.  
</P>
<P>
 Among other notable returnees who pitch less frequently is Westlake's Scott 
Morris, who threw 13 2/3 innings and will play shortstop for the Warriors. 
Morris had a 1.57 earned-run average in 35 2/3 innings of American Legion 
baseball over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Nathan Celusta didn't pitch much last season because of 
Scheffels, Trevor Leppard and Bill Treadway, but he threw a no-hitter for the 
junior varsity two years ago and has an overpowering fastball, Coach Mike 
Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands' Todd River threw only 15 innings at the end of the season, 
but he was 3-0 and had an 0.93 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Some new members of the club might be Camarillo juniors Ryan Bourget and Roth 
Valencia, who could be the Scorpions' top two starters in their first seasons 
on the varsity. Thousand Oaks sophomore Micah Weathers, who dominated freshman 
ball and was promoted to the junior varsity in midseason, pitched six shutout 
innings Saturday in his varsity debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the above, only Downing and Weathers are left-handed. WEST VALLEY

 The Reseda baseball team was forced to forfeit its March 2 victory over Grant 
in the L.A. Invitational for using pitcher Jorge Macias, who hadn't received 
medical clearance from the school nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day the school's athletic director, Norman Weiler, discovered that 
Macias played. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw his name in the box score in the sports section," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiler reported the violation and the Regents forfeited. Macias, a junior, has 
since received medical clearance and is eligible. 
</P>

<P>
 Chatsworth, the top-ranked team in The Times' preseason area poll, started 
slowly, losing two of its first five games and winning two others by one run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chancellor pitcher/outfielder Ray Daryabigi has been red hot. After five 
games, the junior led Chatsworth's regulars with a .444 average. He had a 2-0 
pitching record with a 0.95 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 His twin brother, Rod, also started strongly with three hits in six at-bats.

 Minor Records 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon guard Greg Minor set several school records this season. His 22.9-point 
scoring average was the highest in school history, and his 619 points broke the 
single-season mark of 533 set by Greg Paskowitz, a 1987 Canyon graduate who 
became an NAIA All-American at Hawaii Hilo. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor's 1,138 career points eclipses the mark of 1,018 set by Jermaine Nixon, 
a 1991 graduate. Minor's 69 three-point baskets this season and 139 in his 
career are also records. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best statistic on Minor for Coach Greg Hayes is this: He's a junior. 
FRONTIER LEAGUE

 Damian's Destination 
</P>

 Santa Clara swingman Damian Cantrell outshined Duke recruit Ricky Price of 
Serra and outshot Andre Miller of Verbum Dei, who will attend Long Beach or 
Utah State. The 6-4 Cantrell twice scored 37 points in playoff games and led 
the Saints to the Southern California Regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 So where is he going to college? Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich had been 
closed-mouthed about the future of his prized senior, who averaged 22 points 
and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, however, Cvijanovich said that only two Division II schools have 
contacted him: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cvijanovich said that might change with Cantrell's next Scholastic 
Aptitude Test score. Cantrell said will he take the test Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the reason why more schools haven't called about him," Cvijanovich 
said. "He needs 25 more points." MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>

 Not Another Injury 
</P>
<P>
 In the span of three days, three starters on the Birmingham baseball team were 
injured, joining ace right-hander Steve Brown, who suffered a preseason back 
injury and has yet to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Against San Fernando, first baseman Don Wingo collided with catcher Jimmy 
Uline on a popup in foul territory and sustained a concussion. Wingo, also the 
Braves' No. 2 pitcher, is expected back later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Danny Arnold sustained a broken nose at practice Wednesday when 
he attempted to field a bad-hop ground ball, but is expected to return by next 
week's league opener. And left fielder Carlos Petino sustained torn ligaments 
in his ankle trying to beat out an infield hit against Granada Hills and is 
expected to miss at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic," said Coach Rick Weber, laughing at the onslaught of 
injuries. "We're gonna be fine." PACIFIC LEAGUE

 Just Add Confidence 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley basketball Coach John Goffredo looks at senior Richard 
O'Neill differently than his other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I just created Richard," a smiling Goffredo said of his 
23-points-a-game point guard. "I've never felt that way about any other player. 
I felt like I believed in him when no one else thought he was good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought him up to JV when no one thought he was good and I brought him up 
to varsity as a junior and everyone said, 'What are you bringing this guy up 
for?' " I think I gave him the confidence and the green light to do what he's 
done."

<P>
 The Falcons' trip to the Southern Section Division I-AA championship game this 
season was like a journey into the past. Several players from the 1970-1971 
team, the last Crescenta Valley squad to advance to a section final, flew into 
Los Angeles for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Goffredo arranged for Bob Trowbridge and Bill Boyd, the starting forwards in 
1971, to speak to this season's team the day before the game against Long Beach 
Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1971 team, unlike the 1994 version, went into the championship game 
undefeated. This season, the Falcons entered the final 19-9 and needed an 
at-large bid just to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 One similarity: Both lost.

 Crescenta Valley sophomore guard Jake Willis finished the season with 185 
assists (6.1 per game), the fifth-best total in school history. MISSION LEAGUE

<P>
 Twice the Benefit 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany swimming Coach Walt Cannon took the Northridge earthquake and worked 
it to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Because damage to the Mission Hills campus was so extensive, Alemany runs a 
split-session school day. As a result, Cannon runs two practices a day: 
freshmen and sophomores early in the morning and upperclassmen at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 For most sports, not having an entire team together would be a hindrance, but 
because swimming is a more individual sport, two practices means twice as much 
attention to the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural break because of the maturity levels," Cannon said. "We teach 
strokes more to the younger swimmers, and just work on refining the (older 
swimmers). It just means I practically live at the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which has struggled for several years, already has defeated Bishop 
Amat and Notre Dame in dual meets. Around the Leagues. . . .

 In our travels, which sometimes allow us to combine business and pleasure, we 
always try to discover and develop new products for our retail and wholesale 
business. We have found that it is important to maximize time and still be 
comfortable.Take time before your trip to map out the itinerary, then be 
flexible. We have also found it very helpful to read a book on the area and 
find out weather conditions and visa and health requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 A good example of being prepared was when we traveled to India with a group of 
travel professionals and the unexpected happened. We were at the Varanasi 
airport when we were suddenly unable to fly on to Katmandu. All visas were 
canceled due to a Third World conference. The flights from Varanasi back to 
Delhi, about 1,200 miles, were filled for the next four days. But by using our 
maps and travel books, we found another airport in a distant farming area. 
There were seats on planes from there and we were able to reach that town, 
although only after four hours on a bouncy bus. Our inflatable neck rests, 
which we brought for the long plane flight, also saved us from stiff necks on 
the bus.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; LEARNING TO SERVE THE SOLO DINER 
BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dining out alone has been the bane of business travelers. With the traditional 
social stigma attached to eating alone in this country, solo diners have had to 
put up with surly waiters, poor tables and the stares of other customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that appears to be changing as restaurateurs trying to build business turn 
to this overlooked segment of would-be customers. 
</P>
<P>
 A large percentage of solo diners are business travelers, said Marya 
Alexander, a restaurant consultant based in South Pasadena. Alexander, who 
wrote the book "Solo Diners: The Untapped Mega-Market of the 1990s," has been 
championing the solo-diner market for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you walk into most restaurants, you'll see they are set up for couples or 
groups," she said. "It's no surprise so many business travelers have preferred 
to hide out in their hotel rooms." 
</P>
<P>
 But restaurateurs are changing their ways. Around the country they are 
experimenting with new ways to attract and keep solo diners, including business 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategies range from new restaurant layouts that use clusters of smaller 
tables to teaching employees how to make people eating alone feel more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant host or hostess, for example, shouldn't ask, "Are you alone?" 
or "Is it just you?" Alexander said. Rather, he or she should ask if the 
customer wants a table for one and then make friendly conversation on the way 
to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westwood Marquis and Gardens is one Los Angeles hotel that has decided to 
go after the solo visitor. Three weeks ago, it launched a "Traveler's Exchange" 
room package that includes breakfast and dinner at a communal table in the main 
dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, the feedback has been very positive," said Mohammed Khan, food and 
beverage manager for the hotel. The table seats as many as six people, but it 
most often has two or three diners. Khan said it offers a good opportunity for 
business travelers to network or simply have someone to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming up with the package, the hotel wasn't doing anything to attract 
solo business travelers to its restaurant, Khan said, but because many of the 
hotel's guests are high-level managers who travel alone, the hotel realized it 
was overlooking a potential market. 
</P>
<P>
 Going after the solo traveler is becoming a trend in the industry, Khan said. 
"The way this business is right now, people are looking for every opportunity 
to capitalize on added floor traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Community tables are nothing new, but apparently they are catching on now as 
never before. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pasqual Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., has had a community table from the 
time it opened 15 years ago, but the table's popularity has increased as people 
have become used to the idea, manager David Coulson said. The table seats as 
many as 15 and can be used by anyone, including couples and small groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Local business people as well as solo travelers sit at the table, Coulson 
said. "It's an interesting way to have an opportunity to talk to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Coulson should know; he's done his share of eating alone. "I've traveled by 
myself on business before," he said. "It does get old." 
</P>
<P>
 For Danny Meyer, owner of the 8-year-old Union Square Cafe in New York, the 
solo diner is, so to speak, his establishment's bread and butter. Meyer, who 
spent years on the road eating alone, wanted his restaurant to be a place where 
solo diners could feel comfortable.  
</P>
<P>
 Solo eaters used to have two choices, he said: They could eat bad food at a 
coffee shop bar and not feel conspicuous, or eat fine food at a good restaurant 
and feel like outcasts.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Meyer said, he used to make reservations for two at some places 
because a reservation for one would not be accepted. After claiming the table, 
he'd say his companion would not be showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed to make things easier for other solo diners in his own restaurant. 
"From the day we opened, 30% of our square footage has been set aside for 
single diners," Meyer said. The 18-seat bar, for example, is designed more for 
dining than drinking, he said, and its best waiters are promoted to that 
station. For their part, solo business travelers can benefit from applying a 
little strategy. Here, according to Alexander, are some suggestions for making 
eating out alone a more rewarding experience: 
</P>
<P>
 * Call ahead and make a reservation. Tell the maitre d' what type of table 
you'd like. If you need to spread out to do some work, for example, make sure 
the restaurant can accommodate you. Make sure too that you will have enough 
light to work where you are seated. When making the reservation, emphasize that 
the reason you chose this restaurant is that you want the pleasure of its food 
while you're working and that you're looking for a place to entertain clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * When you're at a restaurant with other people, notice how the restaurant 
treats single diners. Are they treated courteously? Or are they stuck at poor 
tables, with less-than-enthusiastic servers? 
</P>
<P>
 * If you think you might become a regular, consider tipping generously your 
first time and leaving your business card.  
</P>
<P>
 * If you're interested in networking with other business people, let the 
maitre d' know what kind of business you're in and whom you might like to meet. 
Tell the maitre d' if you're willing to share your table so that he or she can 
offer it to another solo business diner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another way to go about that, or to learn more about the local area, is to 
look for restaurants that offer community tables or clusters of small tables 
that encourage opportunity for conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't settle for the proverbial table near the kitchen. Ask for the table 
you want. One frequent solo diner points out that she never accepts the first 
table she's offered, on the assumption that a restaurant always keeps something 
better in reserve for its most discriminating customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be sensitive to restaurant traffic. If it's very busy, offer to take your 
coffee and dessert at the bar. Your server will probably be so grateful that 
you offered, he or she will be all the more pleased to wait on you in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give the restaurant feedback, and let them know you're telling others 
whether you were pleased with your experience.  
</P>
<P>
 * Another way to become a favored solo customer is to occasionally order a 
good bottle of wine, then send what you don't consume to the chef with your 
compliments. "I guarantee they will never forget you," Alexander said.

BRIEFING BOOK / SCOTT SANDELL: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, 
REFORM EFFORTS AIM TO LURE INVESTMENT, TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: In the wake of recent political and economic reforms, sub-Saharan 
African countries are hoping to boost foreign investment and increase trade 
with Asia, Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the region's largely underdeveloped economies, will the efforts be 
successful? BACKGROUND: History casts a negative shadow. In recent times, 
Africa has played only a minimal role in international business, accounting for 
just 1.1% of total world trade in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite abundant natural and human resources, many of sub-Saharan Africa's 42 
independent countries are among the world's poorest. Massive foreign debt has 
sapped the strength of the area's diverse economies. Under prodding from 
international lending organizations, many sub-Saharan countries introduced 
reforms in the 1980s. In its first comprehensive report on African countries, 
the World Bank reported last week that those countries that introduced tough 
austerity measures and other reforms, such as Ghana, showed growth, and those 
that did not fell further behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The current global recession has hit the region particularly hard. Falling 
demand for Africa's main exports -- basic commodities such as metal, timber and 
coffee -- hurt individual countries' abilities to raise hard currency used to 
import needed food and fuel. Many observers say the resulting shortages of 
basic supplies have added to social strife and political instability. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa, the region's economic powerhouse, is expected to benefit from 
the lifting of economic sanctions in response to reforms to end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, officials from several U.S. firms, including IBM Corp., Arco 
Chemical and Time Warner Inc., accompanied U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. 
Brown on a trade mission to Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sub-Saharan nations are hoping to ride the coattails of a reformed South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But while South Africa's comparatively well-developed infrastructure has 
allowed it to attract foreign trade, sub-Saharan Africa as a whole suffers from 
a long list of problems that discourage commerce: primitive transportation 
networks, power shortages, severely limited financial resources and struggling 
education and health care systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, human-rights abuses and ethnic violence in some countries have 
given international investors pause. STRATEGY: Faced with such obstacles, many 
African countries are undergoing dramatic structural reform. As a condition for 
new loans and debt refinancing, the World Bank has required privatization of 
banking, energy and transportation industries in some countries. In addition, 
the International Monetary Fund has urged governments to curb spending and 
devalue their currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 World Bank officials say the programs have created sustained economic growth 
in about 15 African countries, most notably Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. 
Currency devaluation has allowed African exporters to offer their goods at 
prices low enough to compete with cheaper products from Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the economic gains have been offset by higher costs for basic 
goods and lower living standards. A devaluation of the African franc in 
January, for example, sparked fears of food shortages and riots in the Congo, 
Ivory Coast and Niger, as prices doubled overnight. OUTLOOK: Much of the effort 
to boost trade in Africa depends on the success of political and economic 
reforms. Consider Kenya: Despite special tax breaks and trade zones for 
importers, worries about political and ethnic strife have negated the 
government's efforts to attract foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 While continued privatization of key industries and restructuring of foreign 
debt payments have spurred growth in the region, many economists doubt such 
gains will endure without modernized roads, railways and power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent financial commitments from the World Bank and IMF may help. The World 
Bank approved $440 million for a Tanzanian energy project several months ago 
and could help with plans to upgrade airports in Zanzibar and other cities. 
Last year, the bank's renewed ties to South Africa resulted in an $850-million 
loan to finance imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the focus will be on attracting multinational corporations, some 
observers say the key to economic development could lie with small and 
medium-sized companies in Africa and overseas. The IMF recently opened an 
office for small-business loans in South Africa, and American entrepreneurs are 
looking at ventures throughout the sub-Saharan region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small businesses are often a better fit for African countries, which tend to 
buy imports in relatively small quantities," said Reuben Jaja, president of the 
Africa-USA Chamber of Commerce & Industry. "Also, small-business men can be 
mentors for their counterparts in Africa. There's more of a one-on-one 
relationship with them than with companies like IBM and AT&T."

 * For Mexican investors, things have gone from bad to worse. The Bolsa index 
tumbled 67.85 points to 2,362.03 on Tuesday, its lowest level since early 
December. The latest selloff was prompted by the apparent kidnaping of the 
chairman of banking giant Banamex by extortionists.

 * While unrelated to the political uprising in the southern state of Chiapas 
earlier this year, the latest apparent kidnaping points up the risks to Mexican 
businesses from political and social upheaval. In effect, many investors are 
now lowering the prices they're willing to pay for Mexican stocks to reflect 
the return of those risks--a big change from the heady post-NAFTA days.

AIR TOUR LIMITS OVER U.S. PARKS BEING PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to years of complaints that noisy sightseeing flights disrupt the 
tranquillity of national parks, two federal agencies are considering new 
restrictions on air tour operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior and Transportation department officials said at a press conference 
Tuesday that they specifically want to curtail noise at the Grand Canyon and 
Hawaii volcanoes parks, although new rules also might be considered for other 
parks.The agencies are inviting the public to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue that has long been just ignored," said David Hinson, 
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, a branch of the 
Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible restrictions include new limits on air tour flight zones and on hours 
of operation, said Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. The government also 
might create maximum permissible noise levels similar to those in place at 
commercial airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint Interior-Transportation announcement ends years of disagreement 
between two agencies whose missions often conflicted on the issue of park 
noise. The Park Service, a division of Interior, wanted to reduce noise levels. 
The FAA was concerned with air carrier safety, which usually meant spreading 
flights over the largest possible geographic area and the longest time periods.

TV RATINGS; ABC PLACES 6 SHOWS IN TOP 10, INCLUDING 2 NEW SERIES

 With six shows in the Top 10--including the debuts of two series--ABC won the 
prime-time ratings race last week, the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday. It 
was the 10th time ABC has won this season, but the network still trails CBS in 
the season-to-date standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home Improvement," "Roseanne" and "Grace Under Fire" gave ABC a 1-2-3 punch 
at the top of the list, followed by "Coach" (No. 6) and the premieres of the 
newsmagazine "Turning Point" (No. 8) and the comedy "Thunder Alley" (No. 10), 
with Ed Asner and Diane Venora. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thunder Alley" was pitted against the second installment of CBS' "Tom," which 
finished 70th among the week's 94 prime-time network programs. CBS fared far 
better with "The Road Home," which in its second outing won the 8 p.m. Saturday 
time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fortunate was NBC's "Winnetka Road," which premiered at 10 p.m. 
Saturday and tied at No. 75, attracting 14% of the available viewers. Southland

MANY REMAIN HEAVILY BURDENED BY STUDENT LOANS YEARS AFTER COLLEGE; EDUCATION: 
SOME GRADUATES MUST HOLD TWO JOBS. THEY MAY DELAY MARRIAGE, STARTING A FAMILY 
OR MEDICAL CARE.

 Hillary Wicai has her dream job as a television reporter, but she can't afford 
the clothes that make her look professional on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 She's trying to pay off "an enormous debt, probably $20,000 or $21,000" for 
the year at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism that helped 
her land the job. And that's on a novice newsperson's salary of $16,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my clothes are gifts," says Wicai, who works for WLFI in West Lafayette, 
Ind. "Every single thing I have for work was given to me. My mother, my 
grandmother -- they shop for me for bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of today's students must smirk when, studying Shakespeare, they come 
across Polonius' advice to his son Laertes, "Neither a borrower nor a lender 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 If they weren't borrowers, they wouldn't in college be. 
</P>
<P>
 And after they get out, their debt can influence the course of their lives. A 
study finds that many graduates in debt postpone marriage, delay having a 
family, hold down two jobs, even put off medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Much attention has been paid to college borrowers who default, but relatively 
little to the impact of indebtedness on the 12.5 million who ploddingly, month 
after month, pay off their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively they owe $41.9 billion. Many are still in hock 10 years after 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 No time for these young people to backpack across Europe; no year off to "find 
themselves" -- they've got debts to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are students who would like to take a couple of years of their life and 
go to work in the nonprofit sector, and return something to their country 
before they mush on with their careers," said Victor Lindquist, director of 
placement at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 'But they feel they are unable to do that and still meet their financial 
obligations. The clock begins ticking once you graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 For a variety of reasons -- college tuitions have soared, more people of all 
incomes are enrolling and there are more loan programs available -- more 
students are leaving school in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In many schools, 70% of the student body must borrow. One survey said that the 
average undergraduate borrower carried away a $7,900 debt. Those who also 
borrowed for an advanced degree owed $31,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And the burden is compounded when one student debtor marries another. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in school in the 1950s, I had three jobs and worked summers," 
recalled Lindquist. "If you hustled, you could make your way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Peevey, director of career and counseling services at the University of 
Houston at Clear Lake, said some graduates with loans leap at the first job 
offer that comes along "rather than taking the time to find the job that fits 
their skills and interest. So they pay a price." 
</P>
<P>
 Debt, of course, isn't a burden for every borrower. Jerry Heet, a Northwestern 
computer engineering graduate with AT&T Bell Laboratories in Naperville, Ill., 
the first member of his family to go to college, finds his loans an 
inconvenience, but not much more. 
</P>
<P>
 He pays back $110.59 a month; he knows the figure by heart. He said he had to 
postpone buying a new stereo system and drove his 1981 Nissan 220SX "basically 
into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 "But looking at what it gave me -- a great education -- I would recommend 
borrowing rather than going to a lesser school," Heet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newscaster Wicai agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could I have gotten this job without that degree?" she asked. "Yes. But would 
I have been as prepared? No. I wanted to be the best entry-level reporter I 
could be, so I could feel confident in my abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "My lifestyle is dictated by two things -- my loan and my lack of income," she 
said. "I could have had these loans and been a stockbroker and been OK. But the 
combination means I have no social life." 
</P>
<P>
 To measure the after-college impact of college debt, educational researchers 
Joseph Boyd and Carol Wennerdahl questioned 551 recent college graduates who 
had borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Four in 10 said they found their payments easily handled. 
</P>
<P>
 But for one in four, the debt affected decisions on when or if to marry; more 
than a third who did marry said it influenced decisions about starting a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Four in 10 work at two jobs or more because of their debts. More than a 
quarter said their loans caused them to live with family or relatives, and 35% 
said they postponed needed health care because of their debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, about 13% said their loans forced them to drop out of college 
-- leaving them perhaps worse off than if they had never gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of earning power you have with just some college is not much more 
than with a high school diploma," said Ted Marchese, vice president of the 
American Assn. for Higher Education. "So these kids are in a bind; $6 an hour 
doesn't go far when you have a $110 monthly debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Hall, director of career services at Howard University in Washington, 
said he has seen students "struggle through one, two, three semesters, just 
worn down" by mounting debts. "I have a feeling we push out a lot of kids," he 
said. "The financial burden is just too great." 
</P>
<P>
 As a step toward relieving these problems, Congress reformed federal student 
loan programs last year. President Clinton recently bragged about the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The change will give students "the choice of repaying loans as a small 
percentage of income over time, which is a big deal for young people who know 
they want to do things that are personally rewarding but don't pay very much," 
Clinton said. "It will decrease the debt burden that crushes too many of those 
people and discourages them from spending a few years in lower-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some educators think more could be done to relieve young people of 
starting careers mired in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern's Kellogg Graduate School of Management is setting up a 
loan-forgiveness program for students who take low-paying jobs for nonprofit 
outfits or in government or teaching, and Stanford University is studying 
compressing undergraduate work into three years to reduce the overall cost.

RICHEST ARE BAD TAX PLANNERS, STUDY SAYS; FINANCES: SURVEY CONCLUDES THAT 
AFFLUENT GREATLY UNDERESTIMATE THE INHERITANCE TAX BITE.

 Wealthy Americans will pass on $5 trillion to the next generation over the 
next 20 years, with $1 trillion changing hands by the end of the decade, but 
the nation's richest are lousy tax planners, a financial services company said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trust Co. said a recent survey it conducted also found that $5.5 million 
is the biggest amount of money a single person could inherit without messing up 
that individual's values. 
</P>
<P>
 The sampling of the top 1% of the wealthiest Americans -- two-thirds with 
estates of $1 million to $10 million -- found that 84% have a will and 70% have 
a formal estate plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating in the survey were 152 people with an average age of 47, U.S. 
Trust said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the most affluent in our society make extensive preparations 
for the disposition of their estates is a good lesson for anyone," said Jeffrey 
Maurer, president of U.S. Trust, which administers more than $393 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based company said its survey found that rich Americans put 49% 
of their money in securities. Twenty percent of their investments were in real 
estate holdings, and their personal residences accounted for 12% of their 
worth. The rest was in cash, interest in businesses, personal effects and 
collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the survey revealed an important area of weakness in the estate 
plans of the affluent: tax planning," Maurer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of those surveyed wrongly underestimated the rate at which their estates 
would be taxed -- citing an average of 24%, while in reality, the range is more 
likely to be 37% to 55%." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Uncle Sam can grab 55% in taxes from an inheritance of $3 million, and 
the tax bite can rise up to 60% in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite their wealth, some people don't take the recommendations of 
professionals, such as estate-planning experts, seriously," Maurer said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that the affluents are cheap," he said. Some just simply 
delay making decisions, while others use the same people who run their 
businesses to give them advice on planning their estates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, while half of those surveyed have established trusts to reduce their 
estate taxes, the most popular type of trust named -- a revocable trust -- is 
not a tax-saving device." 
</P>
<P>
 He said a lot of people are not aware that they can pass on to their spouses 
up to $600,000 tax free, and they can create shelter trusts to reduce tax 
payouts. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trust said 85% of the married affluents surveyed said they expect to 
leave the majority of their estates to their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case where there is no living spouse, the children will inherit about 
two-thirds of the wealthy parents' assets. 
</P>
<P>
 While 75% of all affluents said it was a good idea to talk with their children 
about inheritances, only 34% said they had, in fact, discussed their estate 
plans with their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, the rich said 23 years old was the youngest age at which an 
individual should be entrusted with a large inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that $5.5 million was the most money an individual could 
inherit without having "a detrimental effect on the values of that person." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond leaving their wealth to family members, half of the respondents plan to 
give at least part of their estates to charities. About 58% named colleges or 
academic institutions as beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45% of the people said they would leave money to health-related 
organizations, and 34% mentioned religious groups.

STARBUCKS TO BUY ITS BIGGEST COFFEE BAR RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starbucks Coffee Co. took a big step Tuesday in its aggressive expansion into 
the Northeast, saying it plans to buy its biggest rival in the region, 
Boston-based Coffee Connection Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Starbucks' stock rose sharply on the deal, which analysts called good news for 
the Seattle-based purveyor of specialty coffee drinks. The stock gained $2.25 
to $24.50 in midday Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very positive announcement," said Trica Reebs of Dain Bosworth. 
"This gives Starbucks a much broader reach, great locations, and it's always 
good to get rid of one of your competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Starbucks, which has 300 coffee bars, mainly in the West, has been bringing 
its espresso drinks east with stores in Chicago and Washington. It has 
announced plans to break into New York, Boston and Minneapolis this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held Coffee Connection, with 22 stores and a strong reputation 
in the Boston area, has been "one of the major negatives hanging over 
Starbucks," said Matthew Patsky of Robertson, Stephens & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 George Howell, chief executive officer of the Coffee Connection, said in a 
statement that he was confident Starbucks would "maintain the integrity of the 
Coffee Connection brand." 
</P>
<P>
 Patsky pointed out that the Coffee Connection has its own coffee-roasting 
facility, eliminating the need for Starbucks to build a costly East Coast 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Starbucks, which plans to open at least 78 more stores in the current 
fiscal year, will be able to save money through economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised if the stock were to continue to trade higher," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starbucks, which went public in June, 1992, more than doubled to nearly $27 a 
share in its first year but has since drifted as low as $19.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a letter of intent the two companies have signed, Starbucks plans to 
acquire 100% of the Coffee Connection in exchange for newly issued shares of 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expect the deal to be neutral or positive to Starbucks' 
earnings in the near term, but said they could not make any forecasts because 
the company has refused to reveal any details of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsky said the tough New York market has no similarly entrenched competition 
in the specialty coffee business and predicted Starbucks would be dominant in 
New York within a year or two at most.

SALMON MARKETERS SAY THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT ADS FOR CHICKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Radio advertisements that suggest eating chicken to help save dwindling 
Pacific Northwest salmon stocks are drawing squawks of protest from Alaska 
seafood processors and marketers. 
</P>
<P>
 Spots developed by Stanton Robison Group for the Washington Fryer Commission, 
a state trade-promotion agency, promote eating more chicken, "like the salmon, 
a local food treasure," because "there aren't as many (salmon) as there used to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowl, er, foul, clucked Vince Curry, president of the Pacific Seafood 
Processors Assn., a Seattle-based seafood trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salmon is one of our most abundant seafood products," Curry said in a news 
release Tuesday. "Consumers shouldn't hesitate to buy salmon for fear of 
depleting the resource. The idea is preposterous." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Puget Sound and Columbia River salmon runs are severely depressed, 
commercially sold salmon are primarily from Alaska, where the catch last year 
was a record 193 million, Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we're astounded that the Washington Fryer Commission would come up 
with such a misguided campaign," Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was intended as a tongue-in-cheek campaign," commission marketing director 
Sue Hatch responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were really trying to tap into was Washington-grown chicken as being 
a premium product -- like salmon," Hatch said. "We don't want to damage the 
salmon industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to wiggle out of it, Curry huffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have found the ad amusing, but the potential effect on the salmon 
industry isn't funny," he said. "To suggest that not eating salmon can remedy 
stock problems in the Pacific Northwest trivializes a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said there were no plans to change or pull the ads.

 LIGHTS, CAMERA, BUGS: The Oxnard boy who loves to show off his collection of 
live and dead bugs, James Fujita, makes his national television debut this 
evening on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" . . . NBC producers, intrigued by 
last week's story on the sixth-grade entomologist, booked the bug boy for a 
show in April. But Leno got so excited, he announced on his show that James 
would air tonight. So this afternoon, an NBC limousine will whisk James and a 
few of his critters to the Burbank studio. James said he'll bring live 
tarantulas, scorpions and walking sticks. "We'll let them decide which ones to 
put on the show." 
</P>
<P>
 ALL ABOARD: Burbank-bound commuters, including those who don't get to ride in 
a limousine, got some good news: Metrolink will cut its fares to Burbank as 
much as 20%. (B1) Transit officials lowered the price to attract more 
customers. . . . But the cut annoyed some passengers to other stations. 
Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason won't get a break on his $112 monthly pass to 
Chatsworth. "They're cherry-picking the fare reduction and I can't agree with 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A NUTTY NIMBY: To Kathleen Adams, the fuzzy-tail squirrels she feeds in her 
yard are an endless source of delight (B1). But to her Thousand Oaks neighbors, 
they're terrorists with teeth, ripping up their yard and gnawing holes in their 
roof. . . . The result: a lawsuit seeking $5,000 to cover repairs. Randy and 
Nancy Hecht claim their neighbor has "transformed her house. . . into (a) wild 
squirrel sanctuary." 
</P>
<P>
 REAR WINDOW: Silver-dollar-sized decals with the initials "OB" are popping up 
on police cars' windows across Oxnard in memory of Jim O'Brien, known as OB to 
his friends. . . . He was the officer slain during the Dec. 3 massacre at a 
local unemployment office. Oxnard police also dedicated its annual charity 
football game to O'Brien and will give some proceeds to programs for kids. "He 
was always promoting youth activities," said Cmdr. Jamie Skeeters. "We're just 
carrying on where he left off."

PREP WEDNESDAY: ALL-COUNTY BASKETBALL; HER STAGE PRESENCE SETS ERICKSON APART; 
PLAYER OF THE YEAR: IT'S THAT QUALITY THAT ALLOWS THE BREA-OLINDA SENIOR GUARD 
TO EXCEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She passes, dribbles and shoots like a champion. 
</P>
<P>
 She plays defense, has great court vision and makes those around her better. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the undisputed leader of a team favored to win its fourth consecutive 
State championship on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 She leads by example and by voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Erickson is The Times Orange County player of the year -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson's ability transcends description. What can't she do on a basketball 
court? 
</P>
<P>
 She creates baskets for herself and her teammates. She never gives up on a 
loose ball. She finds the open teammate. She is not concerned with statistics 
but rather the bottom line: winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats are 32-0 this season. They have beaten three teams recognized by 
USA Today -- two among the top 20 and another among the 10 best in the West 
Region. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, a 5-foot-6 guard, averaged only 15.7 points in her senior season. 
But she averaged 8.1 assists, shot 47% from the field this season, including 
46.9% from the three-point arc. She shot 81% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 She seldom played a full game, either. She doesn't have to score more, but she 
could if she needed to. In a game against Lake Oswego (Ore.) Lakeridge this 
season, the Ladycats were facing highly touted Chandra Benton, a 6-foot-7 
center bound for Stanford. Benton scored 28 points; Erickson scored 38 and the 
Ladycats won by nine. The night before, they beat a team ranked sixth in the 
nation by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 That's as close as any team played Brea-Olinda all year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other players in the county who are as physically gifted as 
Erickson, but few are able to get as much from their talent, leadership skills 
and determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Her greatest gift might be her presence, that quality that allows her to make 
a game-winning basket and treat it as another day at the office. She is 
businesslike when it comes to basketball, in practice and in games. 
</P>
<P>
 Most expect her to be as successful at Purdue, one of the nation's top women's 
basketball teams, as she has been at Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, an All-Orange County first-team member for the third consecutive 
year, plays on a level reached by few county girls. Much of that has to do with 
the talent that surrounds her. Brea-Olinda's dynasty is unequaled -- not even 
Mater Dei's boys can claim four State championships, which is testimony to 
those who preceded her and who stand beside her now. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been a starter for the Ladycats since her first game as a freshman. 
Since then, the Ladycats have won 129 games and lost five -- a 96% winning 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 That's her legacy.

MIKE PENNER: HERE'S A SURE-FIRE SYSTEM TO PICK NCAA WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen of the NCAA basketball office pool, you huddled masses 
yearning to break free and win a month's coffee money, a piece of advice: 
</P>
<P>
 In order to determine who is about to win this year's tournament, you first 
must decide who can't. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas can't win it because Arkansas' center and point guard are due to be 
implicated in the Whitewater scandal any day now. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina can't win it because Michael Jordan is embarrassing baseball -- 
so Sports Illustrated has declared -- and the Tar Heels can't bring themselves 
to show their faces in public over that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan can't win it because some time in the next three weeks, the 
Wolverines will desperately need a timeout called and every player on the court 
will put his hands behind his back and say, "Not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Duke and Kentucky can't win it because the two schools will implode when their 
teams meet in the Southeast Regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue can't win it because no one-man team has reached the NCAA final since 
Larry Bird carried Indiana State there in 1979, and Glenn Robinson is no Larry 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 California can't win it because Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray will announce 
this weekend their intention to quit school and form their own NBA expansion 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA can't win it because this is March, not December; because the Bruins lost 
six of their last 13 games; because the Bruins lost to Oregon; because the 
Bruins could use about three more O'Bannons; because the Bruins could use 
someone who doesn't quiver at the thought of taking an 18-footer at the buzzer, 
and because the Bruins are celebrating the 30th anniversary of John Wooden's 
first NCAA championship with Jim Harrick on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri can't win it because in order to reach the sixth round you have to 
win the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts can't win it because Coach John Calipari has run out of gas 
answering the question, "So, did you think John Chaney really wanted to kill 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana and Temple can't win it, though, with a little luck, Bob Knight and 
John Chaney could meet in the second round in what basketball writers are 
calling the First Alert Security Bowl. The loser gets eliminated, the winner 
gets one phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania can't win it because it is an outstanding academic institution, 
beyond reproach, dedicated to developing scholars first and athletes second. It 
has no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 College of Charleston can't win it because junior colleges shouldn't be 
allowed into the NCAA tournament in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State can't win it because saying you're the best basketball team 
in the Big West is the same thing as saying you're the best professional hockey 
team in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (Maryland) can't win it, and neither can Loyola (Chicago) and Loyola 
Marymount. These franchise universities are just so tacky. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee Chattanooga can't win it because being the best basketball team in 
Tennessee is no big deal anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee State can't win it because the school is still on probation for 
alumna Oprah Winfrey's "interview" with Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty can't win it because Danny Sheridan lists the odds at 10 
trillion-to-one. Jerry Falwell wagers a buck and starts praying. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham can't win it, but give Gene Bartow UCLA's talent now and 
you never know. 
</P>
<P>
 Rider can't win it, because he plays with the Timberwolves now and the 
Timberwolves can't beat anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina A&T can't win it, and neither can North Carolina MCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio can't win it, but if the Bobcats win their first-round game, we'll 
forgive them. The Bobcats' first-round game is against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Kentucky, Central Florida, Southern Illinois, Texas Southern, 
Southwest Texas State and Southwestern Louisiana can't win it because if you 
need directions just to find the campus . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Drexel can't win it because investment bankers can't jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas can't win it because it went 12-2 to finish first in the Southwest 
Conference. So? 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse can't win it because if Jim Boeheim couldn't win it with Derrick 
Coleman, Rony Seikaly and Sherman Douglas, why should he now? 
</P>
<P>
 Navy can't win it. Navy doesn't have a Tailhook shot in hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin can't win it because it won the Rose Bowl. That's enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville can't win it because the 80s are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State and Marquette can't win it because the 70s are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa and Oklahoma State can't win it, but if one doesn't finish off UCLA this 
weekend in Oklahoma City, the other will. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State can't win it, though it is interesting to note that this is the 
Broncos' fourth NCAA appearance since former Cal State Fullerton coach Bobby 
Dye arrived in Boise. Fullerton, meanwhile, hasn't qualified once since Dye 
left in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Green Bay can't win it because Brett Favre might sign with Louisiana 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine, Washington State and New Mexico can't win it because . . . let's 
get serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland and St. Louis can't win it, but whoever wins their first-round 
matchup on Thursday gets the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College can't win it, even though Bobby Bowden promised to do whatever 
he could, just his way of saying thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska can't win it because Tom Osborne has tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati can't win it because Houston has better pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois can't win it because of two words: Lou Henson. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona can't win it because of four words: East, Tennessee, Santa and Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut, Georgetown, Providence and Seton Hall can't win it because I'm 
really getting sick of the Big East, aren't you? 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama can't win it, though country music fans swear by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia can't win it because, no, there is no Santa Claus. If there was, he'd 
have left Virginia Coach Jeff Jones some jump shooters. The Cavaliers shot 
38.7% in conference this season, the lowest mark in the ACC since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida can't win it because Rush Limbaugh as spokesperson for Florida orange 
juice constitutes a recruiting violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas can't win it because everyone says the Jayhawks' talent is down this 
year. And it is -- down on its knees, bowing before Coach Roy Williams and 
chanting, "We're not worthy, we're not worthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest can't win it because players will be demoralized after PC police 
demands name change from highly offensive "Demon Deacons" to more palatable 
"Very Tall Sensitive Feeling Leaping Persons." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota can't win it because Minnesota can't win on the road and Minneapolis 
has no suburbs named "Sacramento," "Los Angeles" and "Charlotte." 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington and James Madison can't win it because they're dead. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves us with . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii, home of the always colorful Rainbow Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii, land of pearly white sand, turquoise blue waves and golden sunshine. A 
great place to catch a basketball game, I always say. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't think of any reason to rule out Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm going with Hawaii. All the way. By a lei up. 
</P>
<P>
 See you there at the victory parade.

 They are getting closer and closer -- Tara VanDerveer, the Stanford coach, and 
Cheryl Miller, the USC coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Look out. Rumors of bad vibes between these two.  
</P>
<P>
 It's Jan. 30, 1994, and USC has beaten Stanford, 81-73. The final horn has 
sounded and the coaches are striding toward one another for the traditional 
postgame whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Will they shake hands? How about a little hug? A smile? 
</P>
<P>
 They're only steps apart now. . . . And it's a . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's sort of a handshake. No smiles. No eye contact. No exchange of 
words.  
</P>
<P>
 Each keeps right on walking, right by the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, she was a spectator's delight. From 1980 through 1984 at USC and 
the '84 Olympic team, she was the closest thing to Magic Johnson women's 
basketball has ever had.  
</P>
<P>
 But for opposing coaches and players, Cheryl Miller wasn't so delightful.  
</P>
<P>
 She talked, she strutted, she show-boated, she laughed. Most annoying of all, 
she almost always won. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, not much has changed. As a rookie coach, she has seen as many 
cold shoulders as she has felt pats on the back for a Pacific 10 championship 
and a 22-3 season that continues into the NCAA tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 In a first-round NCAA playoff game, her team plays Portland at the Sports 
Arena tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 As a coach, she still exhibits the old Miller style. There are great leaps off 
the bench, wild gestures at her players and short, blunt conversations with 
officials that . . . well, they will never put a lapel mike on this coach.  
</P>
<P>
 Brash? Cocky? Arrogant? 
</P>
<P>
 All of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime example: On Feb. 24, USC was blown out of the building at Stanford, 
80-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, she walked into the media room and said that her team would not 
lose again, in effect predicting that her Trojans would win the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters looked at each other, wondering if they'd heard her right. Not even 
Bob Knight would say that.  
</P>
<P>
 Claims that resentment of Miller is linked to her style as a player are 
probably overstated. It has been 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Miller finds herself a continuing focal point of the gender equity 
suit former USC Coach Marianne Stanley filed against the university after 
refusing to sign a contract extension last summer. USC then allowed Stanley's 
contract to expire, and eventually replaced her with Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were disappointed in Cheryl, that she did that," VanDerveer 
said earlier this season. "But of course, someone was going to take that job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It said a lot about how USC perceives women's basketball, not only by what 
they did to Marianne, but also that they'd give the job to someone with so 
little coaching experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Was she saying Miller was unqualified to be a head coach? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said VanDerveer, who hired Stanley to be the Cardinal's part-time 
marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Portland, coach of fourth-ranked Penn State, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tara's on the right track," Portland said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is USC went down a long list before they got to Cheryl. I hope 
Cheryl understands this has nothing to do with her as a person, that there 
would be (criticism) of anyone who fell into that position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women's coaches are stuck on the gender pay-equity issue, and how SC handled 
the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In reporting on the Miller-Stanley-USC imbroglio recently, an article in the 
Women's Basketball Coaches Assn.'s magazine quoted Portland: 
</P>
<P>
 "USC has now threatened the future of the game by firing a previous national 
championship coach, and replacing her with someone with no college coaching 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Threatened the future of the game? No coaching experience? 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was a part-time USC assistant coach from 1987 to 1991. She was a full 
time TV basketball announcer after that. 
</P>
<P>
 As for coaches who weren't previously head coaches, who wasn't? 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA promoted assistant Kathy Olivier to its head coaching job last year. She 
had never been a head coach, either, but no one has accused her of threatening 
the game's future. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Miller something special?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, according to Washington Coach Chris Gobrecht.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people (in coaching) see this as threatening, but (Miller) isn't 
just another former player," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheryl is special, one of the greatest players ever. And that's her school. 
It's a unique situation. Everyone should calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Miller, she knows a cold shoulder when she sees one and she has heard 
the whispers. If she's troubled, she doesn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has come up to me and said anything to my face," she said. "As far as 
I'm concerned, it's all just a bunch of mumbling behind my back. 
</P>
<P>
 "For anyone to believe I've betrayed women's basketball . . . that's a bunch 
of BS. I've dedicated my life to this game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe a lot of the criticism stems from when I was a player. I 
knew I was good, and I talked the talk and I walked the walk. But I don't think 
I ever did it in an arrogant way -- I wasn't a selfish player." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was asked if she knew of any coaches out there who actually liked her.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I think Kathy (Olivier) likes me (Miller and Olivier were once on the 
same USC staff), and Leon Barmore at Louisiana Tech likes me," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Leon was the only coach who sent me a congratulations card when I got the 
job. Now, if any coach should bear animosity toward me, it should be him. We 
beat him for the national championship one year." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barmore: "It's beyond me why people resent Cheryl. 
</P>
<P>
 "To resent her because she got that job without much coaching experience, 
that's a bunch of crock. Cheryl Miller had a basketball in her hands before she 
could spit. She was a great choice for USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who're criticizing her, she shouldn't worry about those people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, when she was a player she rubbed you the wrong way. In 1982, we'd won 
back-to-back national championships and were 30-1 and going for three in a row. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "But she beat us. She was cocky and she kind of rubbed me the wrong way at the 
time. But looking back on it, it was simply a great performance. Did I hate her 
at the time? Yeah, maybe I did -- at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Miller's prediction that her team would win the national championship, 
Barmore said, "I personally wouldn't have said that. But if she is going to say 
stuff like that, she'd better lace up her boots and get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to assess Miller's coaching style, her part-time assistant, Frank Scott, 
gives her high marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "After one of her locker room speeches I told her, 'Cheryl, you missed your 
calling -- you should've been a preacher.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't always work, though. She gave one of her best speeches before the 
Oregon State game (last Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 "She told them they'd been through a lot, gone over a lot of roadblocks, and 
that she was happy to have had the opportunity to lead them, that no one in the 
country can beat them. The volume kept going up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they went out and played lousy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very spontaneous as a coach, but she's also patient. The players know 
they have a free rein, that they won't get yanked for a single mistake.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was frustrated at first. I think part of her wondered why her players 
couldn't do the things she could, because she was such a great player. She's 
still a great player, and she shows them every time she gets in there and mixes 
it up."

<P>
 America didn't have a clue about the Black Coaches Assn. until January, when 
the 3,000-member organization threatened to shut down college basketball with a 
nationwide boycott. In the time it took to issue the threat, the BCA suddenly 
became a major power broker in college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the BCA's concerns is the belief that NCAA legislation and 
policies don't have the student-athlete's -- more specifically, the minority 
student-athlete's -- best interests at heart. The boiling point was reached at 
the NCAA Convention in January, when the powerful Presidents Commission chose 
not to support an amendment that would have returned the men's basketball 
scholarship level from 13 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The BCA, as well as the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches, thought an 
understanding had been reached with the university presidents regarding the 
scholarship limit before the convention. Instead, the presidents shot down the 
proposal, which ultimately prompted the BCA and its executive director, Drake 
Coach Rudy Washington, to talk openly of a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by its inability to work within the NCAA legislative system, the 
BCA decided enough was enough. It and the NABC believed they had, in essence, 
been betrayed by the Presidents Committee. Rather than do what it usually did 
-- nothing -- the BCA demanded that the system be reworked . . . or else. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the BCA's complaints: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A decreased number of educational opportunities for minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Decreased access of coaches to players. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A lack of minority hiring in the upper reaches of the NCAA hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Concern over standardized academic eligibility standards and NCAA research 
involving those standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The or-else strategy worked. Not long after the threatened strike, the Justice 
Department arranged for federal mediation between the BCA and the NCAA. Those 
discussions are ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 For the BCA, which was formed nearly seven years ago by 29 coaches, most of 
them assistants, the federal mediation was a major triumph. For Washington, who 
has been with the BCA from its birth, it was simply another step in a long 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, 42, grew up in Los Angeles and his resume shows stints at Verbum 
Dei and Locke high schools, USC, Compton College, Clemson and Iowa before he 
took his first head coaching job in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington recently agreed to an interview to discuss the BCA's genesis and 
agenda at his Des Moines, Iowa, office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How would you describe the BCA's power base and why do you think the 
BCA can change the way the NCAA does business? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think this is the first time there's ever been any organized effort, 
especially in college athletics, to challenge the system. It's very difficult 
to say what makes us powerful. Obviously the people make us powerful in the 
organization, in their willingness to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't expect 100% participation and never did in terms of a boycott 
situation. But who cares if Appalachian State and East Carolina boycott? But if 
Duke and North Carolina boycott, then you get maximum results. The boycott 
wasn't necessarily meant to hurt individual schools, which it would have. But 
it's more to really get into the pockets of the NCAA and its member 
institutions because of the TV contract.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: There was a recent PBS documentary on Malcolm X and near the end of the 
program someone asks Malcolm X . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A: . . . Are you militant? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That's right. And he says . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A: . . . No, I'm Malcolm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So then, are you a militant? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I think it's just me. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't come up in a militant time. When the Watts riots broke out on 115th 
Street and Avalon, I lived three blocks from there. As a child of 13 or 14, I 
could sit on my porch and listen to the windows breaking. At the time, there 
was a place around the corner from me on 120th called Shop-Rite. The drug store 
was there and I . . . could sit on my front porch and (watch) people running up 
and down my street with couches and televisions. It was entertainment. It 
wasn't even real life. 
</P>
<P>
 My mom and dad were both at home. We didn't participate. We didn't get 
involved in the riots at all. As a child, I saw the whole thing transpire. I 
watched the police come, the National Guard. I watched the looting, I watched 
the killings. That was at 14 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 You never realize what it is to be black until you have to live it, and you 
live it every single day. I'm reminded every day that I'm black. Somebody says 
something to me that reminds me that I'm black. I think it's a uniqueness, 
particularly in my situation, that you have a foot in two worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 I've often told my white counterparts that my life is much more integrated 
than theirs. I have to live in their world. Yet, when I have to go back to my 
world, usually I'm just alone and with other blacks. When they go home, they're 
simply in their own white world. Even though they reach out and try to touch us 
sometime, it's a very difficult thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think people truly understand what the BCA is trying to do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, they definitely don't understand it. That's what's so difficult about 
what we're doing. I think the public, when it's on its way to work, a doughnut 
and cup of coffee, it simply centers around one word. Like this time it was, 
"They're boycotting because they didn't get the 14th scholarship." And that 
became the issue. That's easy for the American public to consume, but it wasn't 
even close to the issue itself. As a result of that, people don't take time to 
understand the issues and read, point-counterpoint. They simply take sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Supposedly in our legal system, it's illegal to lead a witness to a 
conclusion. But the press does it every single day and I'm not so sure that the 
columnists and journalists who are writing this stuff understand it. That's why 
it's difficult for me to do TV interviews because they want to do a sound bite 
in two minutes or three minutes. I can't explain . . . how it directly affects 
what we're doing in the NCAA in three minutes. You can't do it.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the BCA do a very good job of explaining those issues to America? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the issues are constantly being formulated. As a result of that, 
it's difficult to say, "Here are the issues." You can set down some issues, but 
you may have to expand on that. 
</P>
<P>
 You talk about academics. The first thing we were dealing with was, "Black 
coaches are against academic standards." That's ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, when you're fighting a billion-dollar corporation like the 
NCAA, and you've got coaches who don't have the ability to have public 
relations people, press people and those kind of things, then there's a good 
chance that (the NCAA is) going to sway public perception. They're pros. I'm a 
basketball coach fighting for what I think is right. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has happened now because of a grass-roots support of the people, 
perhaps public opinion is beginning to balance a bit. But those people are pros 
and we just don't have the manpower, the money or the time to battle them in 
terms of public perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Did we do a bad job? No, because we knew there was a particular problem and we 
wanted to address it. It's important to mention that we also sent our 
representative for coaches (Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski) to the NCAA convention 
the year before last and he was literally laughed off the stage. I think at 
that point, white coaches started to realize that they didn't have the power 
they thought they had, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Here you take a guy from Duke University, a prestigious academic institution, 
and you have a clean cut, non-controversial guy, Mike Krzyzewski -- two 
national championships in America's hotbed of basketball, North Carolina -- and 
he comes to make a passionate appeal to America's (university) presidents and 
they more or less toss him off the stage and discard him as just another person 
who wants to win a game. I think that's when everybody started to say, "Hey, 
what's going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think Walter Byers or Dick Schultz (former NCAA executive directors) 
or Cedric Dempsey (newly elected NCAA executive director) appreciate the 
problems encountered by black coaches and athletes? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it would be very difficult and it gets back to the thing of having 
a foot in both worlds. I don't think any white person can feel like a black 
person, or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 I do think, though, that there is a median for sensitivity for a particular 
problem. I thought Dick Schultz was good at that. I thought he tried to 
understand. I think Ced Dempsey will be excellent at that. I think Ced has had 
the experience of being an athletic director. He's actually touched some kids' 
lives, black kids in particular. He's been at some very good schools. I think 
he'll do a good job, but right now he's in a tough political position. 
</P>
<P>
 He just accepted the job and you've got the African-Americans at one door 
knocking, trying to get in, and you've got gender equity at the other door 
knocking to get in. You've got cost containment at another door and you have 
the almighty Presidents Commission. He's in a tough political position, there's 
no question about it. It's something he's going to have to work out. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if this was still Dick Schultz, he would have had his network and 
political factions in order. He would have had his lobbying efforts in order. 
This catches Cedric at a very difficult time because he doesn't even know who 
he can depend on for certain things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the NCAA is inherently racist? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't like to label anything and I'm not going to say the NCAA is racist. 
When you talk about the NCAA, we have to define what the NCAA is. Are we 
talking about the national office or are we talking about the individual 
institutions around the country? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We're talking about that billion-dollar corporation you referred to. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think they're inherently racist. I don't think that's it. I think a 
lot of the presidents and the people making the decisions have a mentality like 
this: If you want to get rid of poverty, let's stop feeding the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 With them thinking like that, that's how it directly affects us in legislative 
things that come down the pike. I can't say if a person is racist or not. 
</P>
<P>
 If a white person disagrees with a black person, that does not make him 
racist. I don't like to put that label on anybody. When white people get that 
label as racist, they can never get it off. . . . If you don't like me because 
of me, that's one thing. But if you don't like me because I'm in a group of 
people, then that's a whole different thing. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm very reluctant to say that about the NCAA itself. I will say because of 
its makeup and structure, it is extremely difficult for them to be sensitive, 
whether it be women's or minorities' needs. They just don't have the input they 
need. You can't have, say, 15 white men (actually, 14) at the top of this 
organization, making decisions for women and blacks, and think they're going to 
hit every sensitive point that needs to be addressed. It's virtually impossible 
and it's a lot to ask them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you worried about your job security if there's a boycott? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not as secure as my three counterparts (Temple Coach John Chaney, USC 
Coach George Raveling, Georgetown's John Thompson). They make a good dollar. I 
don't make six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you have more to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. There's no question about it. But I probably have more to gain, 
because I'm younger. If you're talking about public perception and all that, 
I'm probably just starting my career. I feel strongly enough about the issue 
that I need to fight that. Unfortunately, most of our people, meaning 
African-Americans, will die like they lived their lives: asleep. They never 
know what's going on around them. I just felt a real need to take a step and 
make some things work for us. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm younger than them, I'm a protege of theirs and I'm learning a lot. I think 
all of them will retire at their particular institutions. I don't think Chaney, 
Thompson or Raveling will be going anywhere else. They'll stop right there, 
where I'm looking to move. Now, taking this position might set me back, but I'm 
very comfortable with that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you respond to the people who say, "Here we go again. The black 
coaches are complaining about something else." What makes this movement so 
different? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have the ability to stop work now. I was just thinking about that. This 
is no different from a man ignoring his wife, and his wife wants a new pair of 
shoes. So she asks for them for six months, and one day the husband comes home 
and nothing is done that was usually done and it becomes a crisis. So he takes 
her out and they go buy the shoes. . . . She creates a crisis. This is no more 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been talking about these things for years and the NCAA kept saying, 
"Yes, we'll put a committee together. We'll study it. We'll do this, yes, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 And then we say, "Well, we're not going to play any basketball. You're not 
going to make any money. This thing is going to stop until something is done." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a crisis, a dramatic gesture, if you will. As a result, we get the 
attention to deal with these avenues. We were forced to do this. This isn't 
something we wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there disagreement within the BCA on the wisdom of a boycott? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure there is. I think one of the worst things in the world is that people 
think all blacks think alike, that we should all be in lock-step with one 
another. When the (NCAA convention) vote was 191-119 (against restoring a 14th 
scholarship for men's basketball), there were a lot of whites that agreed, but 
didn't agree. It's no different for blacks. We all have our own individual 
problems on our own individual campuses.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you see as the future of the BCA? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The organization has taken on a life of its own. I got a letter from a 
young lady in the Pac-10 who feels like she's being discriminated against. 
We're getting more and more requests for somebody to stand up, whether it be 
students, coaches, whatever. We're kind of being looked on by black people as 
somebody they can turn to, have a sympathetic ear and defend them if necessary. 
I think that's where we're headed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel like a martyr of sorts? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To be honest with you, I get scared like everyone else on different issues. 
But what I'm doing, I believe in. It's easy to continue because it's what I 
believe in. I've never seen myself as a martyr. I'm the last guy to go up 
front. I'm the kind of guy who likes to stay in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 When we went to Washington D.C. the first time, I stayed in the back. When we 
have our conventions, I never go to the microphone. I always let someone else 
handle the process up there. I kind of enjoy being in the background. But I do 
know there are times when I do have to stand up front and be a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think your role in the BCA could hurt you professionally? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It could. It might. There's people out there who . . . either like me or 
don't. That's good with me. At least, there's no gray areas. That's OK, because 
I have a problem with people who are neutral. I think people who like me will 
give me an opportunity. People who don't like me, that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're an insecure athletic director, would you want this so-called 53rd 
most powerful person (according to a 1993 Sporting News ranking of sports 
figures) in the country on your staff? Am I somebody you can work with? That's 
something you're going to have to ask the athletic directors. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that siding up with me is dangerous for some people. You find very few 
athletic directors and presidents who are willing to side up with the coaches. 
They might agree with them behind closed doors, but in order for them to take a 
public stance, that's a tough thing for a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It appears your job might have been in jeopardy had you participated in the 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I realized that, but (Drake administrators) never told me that. They never 
sat down and outlined that and I appreciated that, not issuing an ultimatum. I 
think you never go to war without having casualties. Is this something that is 
that important to me? My answer is yes, it is that important to me. I don't 
think there's a parent out there who wouldn't give his life to give a better 
life for his child. That's the way I feel about that. I'm committed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It's also true you received death threats because of your involvement with 
the BCA, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I got some good advice from George Raveling not long ago. He said, "Listen, 
have your secretary get all of your hate mail and death threats, take them out 
of the envelope and don't read them." He said all it does is depress you. When 
I first started this job, it really used to bother me. But now the more and 
more death threats I get, the less it bothers me. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . I've found when I do read some of the negative mail it's because the 
people don't understand the issues. That's what makes them react the way they 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: OK, let's go through the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are four major issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The first one is academic standards for eligibility. In that arena right 
there, there is obviously apparent conflict between NCAA data and increasing 
academic standards. I think that we need to revisit some of these because it 
(disproportionately) affects minorities. That's it in a nutshell. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, I think we should reconsider freshman eligibility. When you try to judge 
someone on test scores and grades, it makes it very difficult. I think the only 
way to judge whether the kid can do the work or not is let the kid do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 is gender equity. How will it affect African-American females. Once 
black women fight for gender equity, they have to turn around and fight for 
racial equity. We're simply saying, "Take a good hard look at that, because you 
may not want to fight for gender equity. Because while you're running around 
campaigning for gender equity, well, once you achieve that, racial equity is 
the balance." 
</P>
<P>
 People don't hire black women because they're women, it's because they're 
black. When white women get a job, it's because of gender equity. It 
(disproportionately) affects them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to explain to people in basketball and football who are black 
how you can increase sports on one side of the ledger for women, but decrease 
them in two major sports that black men make up a large percentage of. So it 
does affect African-American males. But we support gender equity. We just want 
to make sure it doesn't hurt anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 We support academic standards, but we don't want to hurt anybody. We believe 
in individual assessment when it comes to academic standards. Because high 
school education isn't standardized, how can you do it in college? What they're 
learning at Jordan High School in Watts, they're not teaching at Valley High 
School in West Des Moines, Iowa. Two different worlds. Yet, those two different 
kids could end up in the same class next year. They could both be at UCLA or 
USC in history class, sitting side by side, coming from two different worlds.  
</P>
<P>
 No. 3, accessibility to student-athletes is another issue. The rules just 
preclude coaches from being role models. It doesn't give us access to our own 
kids on our own teams on our own campus in our community. 
</P>
<P>
 The last one, of course, is the issue of hiring minorities. I was told once 
there are no exclusionary tactics going on. But when you have three football 
coaches, six athletic directors, one is a woman, 20 women basketball coaches, 
40 men's basketball coaches, no black commissioners in the country, in the top 
35 conferences -- you're right, exclusionary tactics might not be taking place, 
but I'm paranoid as hell about the whole thing. Makes you think a little bit 
about what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not one African-American in the top 15 of the NCAA national office. 
They couldn't find one to make the final five in the executive director's job. 
</P>
<P>
 If I told you 30 years ago that in 1994 the Palestinians and the Israelis 
would be in Washington talking peace and living in the same hotel . . . that 
the Berlin Wall would be down . . . that black and white South Africans would 
be shaking hands and talking in an effort to unite their country . . . and that 
Russia would no longer be as we know it . . . but in America in college 
athletics we're fighting for opportunities and access, you'd have me toted away 
in a strait jacket. Yet, here we are today and those things are happening. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sad state right now that we're in. Something has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In your own BCA literature, you quote Arthur Ashe. Didn't Ashe share some 
of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's (recently stated) feelings, that blacks shouldn't be 
afraid of the academic bar being raised? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think Arthur also did mention, too, that his battle with racism was 
tougher than his battle with AIDS. People never talk about that. We're not 
against standards. We're against denial of opportunities. That's where this 
argument comes in. We're not saying, "Don't raise standards." But if you raise 
the standards, that's one thing, but don't deny opportunities based on those 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 People are doing this for freshmen in college. But the problem isn't when we 
get them. The problem is before we get them, at the elementary, junior high and 
high school levels. Any reasonable man will support standards. But when you 
start talking about specific standards and where people fall, it becomes very 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Former Marquette coach Al McGuire (who once served on the BCA's advisory 
board) recently said that the BCA's involvement with politicians isn't 
altogether wise. His reasoning was that politicians are attracted to what he 
called, "bright lights," that as soon as another hot issue arrives, the BCA 
will be left without a guardian angel. 
</P>
<P>
 A: One thing we do have is the Congressional Black Caucus. We have a permanent 
task force formed with them now, which gives us government intervention if we 
need it. I would think that Al is probably right. The NCAA is capable of 
devouring us and doing whatever they want. But they can't take away the 
fighting spirit from us. I don't think this fight is over. It will continue 
until something is done that people are comfortable with.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Give us the worst-case scenario and a best-case scenario involving your 
dispute over policy with the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the worst-case scenario is there's a boycott and coaches and 
players lose scholarships and jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 The best-case scenario is sitting down at the table and working toward a 
solution.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; NCAA ISSUES AND THE MEN'S, WOMEN'S TOURNAMENTS; IT'S NOT 
EASY TO FIGURE OUT THESE BRUINS; NCAA MEN: AFTER 14-0 START, UCLA BELIEVES IT 
COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER THAN 21-6 IN REGULAR SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day before his team was to play its last Pacific 10 Conference game, a 
loss to Oregon that cost the Bruins a share of the conference title, Jim 
Harrick sat on a bench at McArthur Court and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I don't know if we're 21-5 or 5-21," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He sounded more confused than angry, understandable if you look at the 
tortured path the Bruins have followed to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins have to be the most unfulfilled 21-6 team still playing, mostly 
because they know very well that they could have done a whole lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 But after opening the season with 14 consecutive victories and climbing to No. 
1, UCLA staggered home. The Bruins finished 7-6 and dropped to a No. 5 seeding 
in the Midwest Regional at Oklahoma City, where they will play home-state 
favorite Tulsa in the first round Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Bruins get past Tulsa, they may very well play another semi-local team, 
Oklahoma State, on Sunday. Then, as a reward, if they are still alive, they can 
look forward to a possible showdown against second-ranked Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, there are three main reasons for UCLA to be in this fix: Notre 
Dame, USC and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverse those three ignominious defeats and the Bruins are 24-3 and probably 
seeded first in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be good for the Bruins' tender psyches to be reminded, but these 
were the obvious low lights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Losing by 16 points to a Notre Dame team that was 6-13. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Losing by six points at USC after blowing out the Trojans four weeks 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Losing at Oregon against a 9-17 team after scoring one basket in the last 8 
minutes 38 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins seem eager to atone for all that. At Oregon, two players actually 
dived after a loose ball. The last previous time a UCLA player dived for a 
loose ball? Well, who can remember? 
</P>
<P>
 There also is the possibility that UCLA is going to be an entirely different 
team now that the tournament is here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't wait to play," George Zidek said. "We need to put everything 
that has happened behind our backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe UCLA should forget the good things, too, like the 75-72 victory over 
Louisville, which is seeded third in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the consecutive victories over Arizona and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the comeback victory at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Dalis, UCLA's athletic director, said he had thought before the season 
that the Bruins would challenge for the conference championship and that their 
14-0 start did nothing to raise his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalis had no public opinion on UCLA's play this season and would not discuss 
Harrick's performance until after the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 He said UCLA's "artificially weak" schedule contributed to the 14-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't really give you a good sense of what the team was about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Bruins actually were about was inconsistency. Team leaders Ed 
O'Bannon and Tyus Edney spoke out on many occasions in the second half of the 
season on the subject of playing hard and emotionally every game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always expect us to come out and play with a lot of emotion," O'Bannon 
said. "When we do, it carries over." 
</P>
<P>
 And when they don't, the results are often disastrous. The Oregon game was a 
picture of what went wrong for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon got off to another slow start, the rest of the team joined him and 
UCLA trailed at the half. O'Bannon, who'd had six points and four turnovers in 
the first half of a narrow victory over last-place Oregon State, had one 
basket, one rebound and four turnovers in the first half against Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse for UCLA at the end. The Bruins missed 10 of their last 11 shots 
and committed six turnovers.  
</P>
<P>
 Coaches will tell you that missed shots can happen to anyone, but 20 turnovers 
against one of the worst defensive teams in the conference? That generally 
indicates a lack of execution stemming either from lack of focus or inadequate 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Bruin star Bill Walton says Harrick is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, college basketball's championship will be decided without UCLA," 
he said. "How disappointing. Maybe not as much of a disappointment as the coach 
complaining about the officiating and whining about the team's lack of 
emotional commitment and not being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruin pride is being stretched to the limit." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick, however, is taking UCLA to the NCAA tournament for the sixth time in 
six years and has won at least 20 games each season since he arrived on the 
Westwood campus in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as predictions go, Harrick doesn't share anyone's pessimism about 
UCLA's chances, at least for the record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, they'll have to get well in a hurry. One remedy for Bruin ailments is 
to get some production from the bench, which has contributed almost nothing 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins have discovered that freshman Cameron Dollar is valuable in trying 
to unplug a continually stopped-up half-court offense because with Edney he 
gives UCLA two playmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dollar is foul-prone. Backup center Rodney Zimmerman hasn't been the same 
since he injured his back before the Notre Dame game, Marquis Burns doesn't 
play much and Kevin Dempsey has played his way to the end of the bench. There 
isn't anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins ought to benefit from Tulsa's up-tempo style of play and also from 
a height advantage. But the Bruins must make some adjustments on their own if 
they are going to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA must put a premium on handling the ball and cut down on turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon has to score and rebound, Charles O'Bannon has to play defense, 
rebound and stay out of foul trouble, and Shon Tarver has to play well away 
from Pauley Pavilion, which he has had trouble doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek needs to stay on the court and be a force inside and Edney must stay 
under control and make good decisions when he penetrates. When Edney drives, 
the Bruins have to keep good floor balance so they don't give up layups. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than anything else, the Bruins have to play with aggressiveness. They 
need to go after loose balls, try for every rebound, actually look at whom they 
are passing the ball to, play as if they intend to win.  
</P>
<P>
 If they don't, they're going to be out of the tournament before you can spell 
Oklahoma.

THEIR FANFARE IS FOR SIGNING OF PLAYER WHO COVERS BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders held a rare, full-blown news conference Tuesday to announce the 
signing of . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe cornerback Albert Lewis? 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders must announce by 1 p.m. Friday whether they will match the 
four-year, $11-million offer sheet Brown has signed with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only announcement they made Tuesday concerned the acquisition of the 
33-year-old Lewis, an unrestricted free agent from the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 195-pound Lewis, coming off one of his best seasons, signed a 
three-year, $4.5-million deal, with the first year kept below the average for 
salary-cap purposes. Lewis made $850,000 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs were reportedly caught off guard at the news. They had expected 
Lewis to givethem a chance to match any offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also talked to the Atlanta Falcons and the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 A third-round draft choice of the Chiefs in 1983 from Grambling, Lewis is 
third among active players with 38 interceptions, six last season. But he is 
under no illusions about his playing time with his new team. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows that the Raiders have Pro Bowl player Terry McDaniel at one corner 
and veteran Lionel Washington at the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, I come to the Raiders with no preconceived notions, but a lot 
of ambition," Lewis said. "My whole idea of coming to the Raiders is that I 
have an opportunity to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see myself, and I never will, as a backup. I'll never accept that 
unless it really happens That's not my mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 That's understandable. Lewis is himself a four-time Pro Bowl player, a veteran 
able to combine productivity with versatility. He is known for coming up with 
big plays in opposing backfields as well as in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 In last season's playoffs, Lewis sacked the Houston Oilers' Warren Moon twice 
in Kansas City's 28-20 second-round victory. Lewis has also spent time in 
opposing backfields as a member of the Chiefs' special teams. He has blocked 11 
punts, four in 1986 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lewis has proved to be an emotional leader as well. His fellow players 
give him the credit for igniting Kansas City's comeback postseason victory over 
Houston two months ago. His tackle of running back Gary Brown near the end of 
the first half led to a fight that fired up the Chiefs and inspired them to 
overcome a 10-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have enough good cornerbacks," Raider Coach Art Shell said. 
"Especially with all the three- and four-receiver sets." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Al Davis apparently feels the same way, which has been appreciated among 
the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the great cornerbacks want to wind up here," said Scott Casterline, 
Lewis' agent. "I represent 13 cornerbacks and they all like the Raider 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, but what about Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 Was Tuesday's news conference designed to show a Raider desire to get on with 
the future, to emphasize that the team is still in the business of signing 
players, even if Brown is not necessarily one of them? 
</P>
<P>
 "Albert will be covering Tim," said Steve Ortmayer, the Raiders' director of 
football operations, "either here in practice or somewhere else."

MIKE DOWNEY: A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT PROVES RAIDERS STILL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday's news in tropical El Segundo turned out to have nothing to do with 
Bronco Timmy Brown, a go-for-broke receiver for the Raiders who is being 
offered everything by Denver but the mint. Instead, what the Raiders did was 
proudly announce the acquisition of Albert Lewis, a quality cornerback from 
Kansas City, perhaps a hash mark or two past his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Brown was not far from everyone's thoughts, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Shell, for one, objected to some of the tactics and comments coming out of 
Denver, but the Raider coach stressed that even though Brown himself said he 
prefers to be a Bronco, "I don't see any reason why he couldn't come back to 
our team." 
</P>
<P>
 For good measure, Shell added, "He hasn't left." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing specific came from Raider executive Steve Ortmayer, who has used the 
word obnoxious to describe Denver's ludicrously lucrative offer. Ortmayer did 
emphasize that this contract being signed by Lewis was totally unrelated to the 
contract terms being negotiated by Brown, except that the cornerback will be 
dealing with the receiver person to person down the road -- "either here in 
practice or somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line came from another Raider exec, Al LoCasale, who said, "We'll 
know everything by Friday at 1 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
 It is my hunch, though not my hope, that when this deadline arrives, the 
Raiders are not going to match the offer to Brown. "Spend the money" is easy 
advice to give, but aside from being painted into an extremely expensive 
corner, the Raiders have two other causes for pause: (1) the specifications of 
Brown's contract, including its length, impact on the salary cap and no-trade 
clause, and (2) the hesitancy to richly reward someone who has gotten into bed 
with your enemy and pretty much told you to take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
 With all this in mind, I have concluded that Brown will be coming to town next 
season dressed in orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Broncos have been giving the Raiders the old hee-haw. They love 
having L.A. over a barrel. Wade Phillips, the Denver coach, has been all but 
cackling over this one, saying that he wins either way. Either he gets to 
couple Brown with Shannon Sharpe as his wideouts or he gets to stuff the 
Raiders' skulls up their salary caps, if you know what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can he come out and say some of these things?" asked Shell, who would 
prefer gentlemen to behave like gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even gentle Art got a little hot under the collar during the Marcus 
Allen contretemps of a year ago. Business is business, but it doesn't diminish 
the personal element when someone from your side does business with someone 
from your archrival's side -- or, if you prefer, from your Art's rival. It has 
to grate on the Raiders that of all the teams in the NFL, Tim Brown sided with 
the one the Raiders probably like least. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said of Brown: "Don't worry about him. He's going to get his money, one 
place or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't understand how people can question our resolve. This has been a 
winning organization and it will always be a winning organization. Even if we 
do lose one player, we don't sit still. We act." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, there is no law against the Raiders going out and sticking it 
to the Broncos some day, if this is the way they want to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Albert Lewis. He might not be as famous a name as Marcus Allen. There are 
some people in California who haven't heard of any Al Lewis except the one on 
TV who played Grandpa Munster. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust me, though, Albert Lewis can play football. He has been to the Pro Bowl 
four times. He ranks third among all pass interceptors in the NFL today. He has 
personally blocked 11 punts. He is as much a pro as Marcus Allen was, but 
without the touchdowns. The Raiders have taken away a useful player from the 
Kansas City Chiefs, proving once again that business is business. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things Shell said he liked most about Lewis was that he "always 
carried himself as a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 If only those Denver guys did.

BRAVES DECIDE TO SAVE MONEY, RELEASE INJURED GANT; BASEBALL: BY LETTING LEFT 
FIELDER GO, ATLANTA WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY HIM ALMOST $4.6 MILLION OF HIS 
$5.5-MILLION CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Normally the most free-spending of clubs, the Atlanta Braves decided to save 
$4,593,340.60 Tuesday by releasing left fielder Ron Gant. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off personal bests of 36 home runs and 117 runs batted in last season, 
Gant had signed the biggest one-year contract in baseball history, a 
$5.5-million deal, on Jan. 27, then his right leg was broken in two places in a 
dirt bike accident in suburban Atlanta on Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehabilitation will take three to five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he is unavailable to perform as a result of this accident and, 
according to our doctors, will be rehabilitating for an extended period of 
time, we have decided to take this action," said John Schuerholz, Brave general 
manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Schuerholz and team president Stan Kasten called Gant shortly before noon with 
their decision. Then they met with several players who are team leaders and 
Gant's friends. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it came down to money and the fact that Gant, 29, can be a free 
agent at the end of the season. By releasing him before 2 p.m. EST Tuesday, the 
Braves are liable only for 30 days' severance pay, or $906,593.40, though 
Kasten said that the owners' Players Relations Committee had advised the team 
not to pay Gant at all because he might have violated his contract by being 
injured in a dangerous hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant's agent, Eric Goldschmidt, said this week that he would ask the Major 
League Baseball Players Assn. to file a grievance if Gant was cut, meaning an 
arbitrator might decide how much the Braves must pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on whether to file the grievance will not be made until Gant 
clears waivers. Any club can claim him before 2 p.m. Friday at his full salary. 
Otherwise, he will be a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves will try to win their fourth division title in a row with Tony 
Tarasco, Ryan Klesko or Chipper Jones -- all of whom are having good spring 
trainings -- in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad and upset," Brave Manager Bobby Cox said. "He's going to be a tough 
guy to replace." 
</P>
<P>
 Gant has spent his entire career in the Atlanta organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is emotional for me thinking about not being a Brave. But I realize 
baseball is a business," he said earlier this week.

ANGELS, METS ARE DISCUSSING A DEAL INVOLVING SNOW, YOUNG; BASEBALL: HARD-LUCK 
STARTER WOULD COME WEST FOR THE YOUNG FIRST BASEMAN WHO GREW UP IN ORANGE 
COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Angels, desperately searching for a starting pitcher, are discussing a 
trade that would send first baseman J.T. Snow to the New York Mets for starter 
Anthony Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked to them, and he's the type of guy we'd like to have," Angel 
General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but we don't have anything done yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely want to get another starter, and to get one, we'll have to go 
through some pain. We're going to have to give up somebody we like." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, the principal player acquired in the Jim Abbott in December, 1992, 
batted .241 with 16 homers and 57 RBIs during his rookie season. Snow, a Los 
Alamitos High graduate, is considered expendable because of Eduardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez has been projected as the Angels' starting left fielder, but his tender 
elbow and deficiencies in the outfield now have the Angels believing he would 
be more suited for first base. Perez, who's batting .320 with eight RBIs this 
spring, also made two stellar plays at first base Tuesday in the Angels' 13-6 
victory over the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there will be less wear and tear on the elbow at first base," 
Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said, "so we've got to find out whether we need both 
of them in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to evaluate J.T., and decide whether to keep him, send him down, or 
we trade him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an option we didn't have a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels trade Snow, it would enable them to keep rookie left fielder Jim 
Edmonds, whom they expect to be a .300 hitter in the big leagues. It also would 
create more playing time for outfielders Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 28, gained national prominence last season when he set a major league 
record by losing 27 consecutive games over two seasons. The streak ended July 
28, and Young finished the season with a 1-16 record and 3.77 ERA. Still, the 
Angels believe Young is capable of being a consistent 12- to 15-game winner.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; THE BLACK COACHES ASSN.: STANDING AT A CROSSROADS; HE 
FIGHTS FOR ACADEMICS, NOT ATHLETICS; OPPOSING VIEW: SOUTHERN'S BEN JOBE DOES 
NOT SUPPORT BCA'S ARGUMENTS FOR A BOYCOTT. 'THIS IS NOT THE CIVIL RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT,' HE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Not all members of the Black Coaches Assn. have embraced the idea of a 
boycott, especially if it is based on the refusal of university presidents to 
restore a 14th scholarship to Division I men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern University Coach Ben Jobe, a BCA dues payer, said the 14th 
scholarship should be the least of the association's worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most organizations are fighting for things that aren't even important," said 
Jobe, a 22-year coaching veteran whose team upset Georgia Tech in the first 
round of last season's NCAA tournament. "This is not the civil rights movement. 
This is not the war on poverty. This is not ethnic cleansing. This is not 
pro-life. Abortion. This is not crime. This is not the killing of black 
youngsters by black youngsters. So . . . I'm not going to be wasting my energy 
. . . on fighting for a 14th scholarship for a kid who probably doesn't want to 
be going to school in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if you have an important issue, call me. If not, don't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 The BCA has insisted that the threatened boycott was not a 14th-scholarship 
issue. Instead, it says the boycott talk was in response to the idea of lost 
opportunities for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobe said that isn't how it was presented to him in the days leading to a 
possible walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two coaches called me and asked for my support," said Jobe, who declined to 
name the coaches. "That's all they talked about, that 14th scholarship. They 
sent me some literature about 300 youngsters per year being disenfranchised 
times five years, which comes to 1,500 youngsters. And then the comment was 
made by one of these coaches that kids will not get a chance to play major 
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the ceiling, because they were talking about going to major 
universities and that's an insult to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobe, who has coached at predominantly black universities for most of his 
career, said the BCA, as well as the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches, has 
its priorities mixed when it comes to scholarship opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those 300 black youngsters who they say will be disenfranchised . . . that's 
ridiculous," he said. "You've got 117 black schools in the United States. 
You've got probably three times that many small white universities -- NAIA, 
junior colleges, whatever. They will be fighting over those 300 kids like a dog 
over a bone. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when it was first mentioned that these youngsters . . . would not get a 
chance to play at the major universities, now that's an insult. Who cares about 
playing at a major university when most of us graduated from small schools in 
the first place? We have educated black youngsters when no one else would do it 
and we did a great job. We're great at it because we've been doing it a lot 
longer than other institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobe, who describes many of the Division I coaches as "industrialists," and 
himself as "a country teacher," wasn't through with his assessment of the 
14th-scholarship issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at those teams that have (14) scholarship players on a team, 
who has the 12th, 13th, 14th scholarships?" he asked.  
</P>
<P>
 White players? 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly," Jobe said. "A nice little white boy who's going to be a doctor, a 
nuclear scientist. We have enough scholarships for those type of kids. We need 
scholarships for black kids with brain power, who don't even know what a 
basketball or football is. That's where we need our money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now if the NCAA wants to do something glorious, then cut the scholarships to 
10. That forces you to give another five to honor students all over the 
country. Now you're talking about something. That forces us to go into the 
student body and get some walk-ons (non-scholarship players)." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was told to do otherwise by school officials, Jobe used to give four 
scholarships back to the university each season for deserving honor students. 
One year the dean of the school told one of the honor students about the 
scholarship arrangement. Much to Jobe's surprise, the student tried out for the 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Took me a week to cut him," Jobe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobe said the NCAA would never adopt such a measure and the coaches' 
associations would never support it. That explains his reluctance to boycott 
games based on athletic opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't fight for athletics like I used to," he said. "Now, I'll fight for 
academics until I die."

DATA GROUP'S LINKS CONCERN BCA LEADERS; ISSUES: COACHES CLAIM NCAA-FUNDED 
ANALYSTS ARE CONNECTED TO FOUNDER OF MOVEMENT THAT FAVORS GENETIC SUPERIORITY. 
PANEL MEMBER DENIES CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With the exception of a threatened boycott, no Black Coaches Assn. 
announcement attracted more attention than a charge on Dec. 14, 1993, that at 
least three members of an NCAA-sponsored research panel were linked to the 
founder of a movement known as Beyondism, which in some cases advocates polices 
of genetic superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, the panel's principal consultant, Jack McArdle, an 
associate professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, continues to 
dispute the allegations and defend the research. 
</P>
<P>
 McArdle's Data Analysis Working Group, whose findings are crucial to NCAA 
policy concerning academic entrance and eligibility standards for 
student-athletes, particularly minorities, was labeled "the hidden enemy" in a 
statement by Rudy Washington, executive director of the BCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty years ago, millions of Jews were herded onto railroad cars and sent to 
their deaths," Washington said in a statement. "Letting this group continue to 
advise the NCAA can only propagate the same basic ideas of a superior race." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the issue are the beliefs of Raymond Cattell, a noted 
psychology professor who first published his views on the subject in 1936. 
McArdle said Cattell believes there is a disproportionately large number of 
children born to those with less intellect. A possible solution, according to 
Cattell's writings, is that some people would be encouraged more than others to 
reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
 In its most basic form, the beginnings of genetic breeding, otherwise known as 
eugenics. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection between Cattell and some members of the data analysis group 
became the focal point of concern for the BCA and others. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, Congresswoman Cardiss Collins 
(D-Ill.) wrote to NCAA President Joseph Crowley raising the issue. In the 
letter, Collins said McArdle, John Horn, a USC psychology professor, and John 
Nesselroade, a Virginia psychology professor, "appear to be on the 
'self-appointed executive group' " to Cattell's Beyondism Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the panel said it is unfair to assume guilt by association. They 
say many psychologists who did graduate work under Cattell, as Horn and 
Nesselroade did at the University of Illinois during the 1960s, do not endorse 
Cattell's beliefs of eugenics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not part of my personal belief system and I've told (Cattell) so on 
numerous occasions," said McArdle, who was appointed director of Cattell 
Research Institute in Charlottesville, Va., last year. "But eugenics is a 
complex topic and it's one that is easily confused with racism, so I understand 
the concerns of the people (in the BCA) from the eugenics aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 According to McArdle, who was hired as the principal researcher for the NCAA 
project in 1989, no member of the Data Analysis Working Group adhered to the 
belief of eugenics as proposed by Cattell. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no genetics in here at all," he said of the research. "This is not 
genetics study." 
</P>
<P>
 This has not mollified Collins, who chairs the Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Consumer Protection and Competitiveness. Collins is also vice chairwoman of the 
Congressional Black Caucus' Task Force on Intercollegiate Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' subcommittee, which reports to the powerful Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, has launched an investigation into the inner workings of the Data 
Analysis Working Group. If the investigation continues at its present pace, the 
first hearing could take place by the end of the month, just in time for the 
NCAA's crown jewel, the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 McArdle, who said he admires some of Cattell's work, said it was because of 
Cattell's pro-eugenic policy that he chose to not join the psychologist's 
Beyondism group. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the BCA's charges, McArdle said he can understand why the coaches and 
Collins are concerned by appearances of a link between Cattell and the research 
group. For instance, Nesselroade, McArdle's colleague at Virginia, published a 
book with Cattell in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not denying that their question is good," he said. "They should ask such 
a question and they should ask us where we stand on these issues. The best 
evidence we have is the research we've done for the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
 In that research, the group's data support the BCA's contention that higher 
entrance standards are possibly racially biased. Additional research, which 
should be completed within two months, McArdle said, also seems to support the 
initial findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were viewing us as adversarial when, in fact, we were not at all in the 
position to advocate one or the other sides," McArdle said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Horn said he talked to Trojan Coach George Raveling, a BCA leader, about 
his links to Cattell, explaining his association did not cause him to do 
"anything dishonest or improper with data or to advise anyone to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Horn: "Rudy Washington has made some accusations that are absolutely 
scandalous. He's accused people on the basis of no evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 McArdle said he has written Collins and offered to make himself available for 
any questions concerning the research. He said he has not been contacted by the 
BCA, but that he would be willing to speak with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with information they believe suggests that the NCAA research findings 
were tainted, the BCA and Collins recommended, among other things, that all 
eligibility standards be repealed immediately. The NCAA didn't go along with 
that, but it did call for an immediate review of all available research on 
Proposal 16, legislation that would impose new academic standards for incoming 
Division I freshman athletes beginning in August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution was adopted in January at the NCAA Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' subcommittee not only wants McArdle's findings examined by an 
independent third party, but it wants access to the raw data used in the 
research. It contends that there is no system of checks and balances within the 
Data Analysis Working Group, that data this important require independent 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins also plans to challenge the scientific integrity of the process, as 
well as the NCAA's choice of consultants and the research panel's alleged lack 
of diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a source familiar with the subcommittee, the NCAA has yet to 
respond "adequately" to Collins' written request for access to the raw data. 
Nor has it agreed to allow an independent research group to study the data.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; THE BLACK COACHES ASSN.: STANDING AT A CROSSROADS; USC'S 
BOYD A CASE OF BEATING THE ODDS; ACADEMICS: FORWARD WILL GRADUATE WITH A DEGREE 
IN ECONOMICS AFTER A ROCKY FRESHMAN YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lost in the squabble between the Black Coaches Assn. and the NCAA over the 
plight of young African-American athletes has been the viewpoint of the black 
athlete .  
</P>
<P>
 USC senior Mark Boyd is one such athlete.  
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, a 6-foot-7 forward who was selected this week as the team's most 
valuable player, enrolled at USC on a basketball scholarship in 1990 and will 
graduate in May with a degree in economics after having been a four-year 
starter for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting my degree on time has been the most important thing for me," he said. 
"I know that basketball only lasts for a very short period of time, which makes 
getting a degree from a school like USC that much more important. Getting to 
the point where I can support myself, so that I don't have to depend on anyone 
else, has been a goal, and that's why I've worked so hard to graduate in May." 
</P>
<P>
 When the NCAA does its next study on black athletes, Boyd will be used as an 
example of how the system works. What will be lost in his story, however, is 
the struggle he had merely to get an opportunity to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd grew up without a father in a small two-bedroom house in a predominantly 
black area of Decatur, Ga. His mother, Betty, slept in one room, and his two 
older sisters shared the other. Until he went to college, Boyd's bedroom was 
the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 In his neighborhood, academics were not valued because the local school system 
was notorious for having inferior resources, facilities and lower test scores, 
not to mention campus gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time for Betty Boyd to send her only son to high school, she 
cringed at the thought of sending Mark to the neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The street we lived on was not that bad, but the surrounding area was filled 
with problems," she said. "I wanted him to go to a school in a different area 
because I didn't think that the kids who went to school in our neighborhood 
were given much of a chance academically." 
</P>
<P>
 So, she took action. Without financial resources to send him to a private 
school, she searched for other options, finally enrolling him in a "Minority to 
Majority" busing program.  
</P>
<P>
 Boyd rode a bus every school day for four years to Redan High in Stone 
Mountain, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. There, he exchanged hanging out with his 
neighborhood friends for sitting in a classroom with mostly white students, 
many of whom grew up in mansions. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade-off worked for Boyd, who maintained a B-minus grade average while 
becoming Redan's all-time leading rebounder.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason why I went to (Redan) was to get out of my neighborhood," 
Boyd said. "If I had stayed, there's no way I would have accomplished what I 
have done today. I may have ended up like some of the guys who grew up around 
me who went away to play ball, but are now back home hanging around." 
</P>
<P>
 When Boyd began high school in 1986, he was part of the first freshman class 
that would have four years to prepare under the NCAA's Proposition 48, which 
required high school athletes to graduate with a 2.0 grade-point average or 
have a 700 score out of a possible 1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to 
qualify for a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eight years Prop. 48 has been in effect, blacks have made up more than 
two-thirds of the athletes who failed to make the cut, many of them failing to 
earn a qualifying score on the SAT, which has been criticized as culturally 
biased. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd wasn't among them. The difference, he said, was that he had been in 
position to gain a quality education, thanks to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd is against the NCAA raising minimum academic standards for incoming 
freshman athletes. He believes that too many black athletes, who did not 
receive quality educations because they live in urban areas, will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it at all because it already is hard enough for kids who are 
halfway riding on basketball alone to get to college," Boyd said. "Increasing 
standards to get in would really hurt kids who are trying to get out (of urban 
areas). For some, if they can't get it through sports, they would probably be 
stuck there for the rest of their lives. Basically, by doing this (the NCAA) is 
trying to keep black athletes out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that I would be upset if I wasn't accepted because of a standardized 
test. When you don't score well on a test like the SAT, that doesn't mean that 
you are not capable to be competitive in college. To hinder someone's ability 
to get ahead is wrong, especially when tests are used like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The true story behind Boyd, he says, is that he is an example of how the 
system should work. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that instead of spending time denying opportunity by creating 
tougher admission standards, the NCAA should be more concerned about making 
sure college athletes get an education and graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman at USC, Boyd had more than his share of problems academically. 
His grades were so bad after his first two semesters that Coach George Raveling 
was told not to expect him to be enrolled as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still remember people in our academic counseling office telling us 
during Mark's freshman year that there is no way that he would make it to his 
second year," Raveling said. "The only way that he was going to stay eligible 
was for him to take (seven) summer school courses." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Raveling, Boyd responded the only way he knew -- to come back 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd credits Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't ready academically my freshman year," Boyd said. "I had 
problems adjusting to a new environment and I made it tough on myself. The 
person who was there for me was Coach Raveling. I had never had a father figure 
in my life, and he became one for me. I watched and learned from him. He helped 
me grow as a person, on and off the court."

THE TIMES' 1994 ALL-COUNTY BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM; BILLINGSLEY, BARONS OVERCOME 
ADVERSITY; COACH OF THE YEAR: HE LEADS FOUNTAIN VALLEY TO UNEXPECTED LEAGUE 
TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Baron boys' basketball team and its coach, Gordon Billingsley, had a rough 
ride through the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a fun ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and defections depleted the roster, and vandals ruined the Fountain 
Valley High gym floor. The Barons didn't have a home gym to practice in until 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the adversity, Fountain Valley won the Sunset League championship for 
the first time in Billingsley's five-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teams you really have to get after, but this team always played hard," 
said Billingsley, The Times Orange County boys' coach of the year. "It got to 
the point that as a coach, you say to yourself, 'Hey, this is a lot of fun.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great group of kids. . . . I was just along for the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Billingsley's selfless attitude and emphasis on teamwork was something 
mirrored in his team. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's persona took shape after a 43-40 overtime victory over Ocean View 
Jan 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, every team gets a mental image of itself," he said. "And this 
team got the image that they could win every game." 
</P>
<P>
 That victory over Ocean View began a 12-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons didn't have a marquee player, but Brandon Leimbach, Phil Domingo 
and Danny Hoppie led their teammates into the Southern Section Division I-AA 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a buzzer-beating basket by Long Beach Poly, the eventual Division I-AA 
champion, to beat the Barons, 50-48. 
</P>
<P>
 While the loss ended the Barons' season, it didn't dampen Billingsley's 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't trade this team for a million bucks." Schea Cotton 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei; Forward Fr.; 6-5; 20.5 ppg Maybe the best high school freshman in 
the nation. He transferred from Bellflower St. John Bosco in December, making a 
good Monarch team a great one. He possesses incredible leaping ability, which 
makes him a force inside. He can also step outside and hit three-pointers. He 
averaged nine rebounds. Gil Gonzales 
</P>
<P>
 Orange; Guard Sr.; 6-2; 14.3 ppg One of the top shooters in the county. He 
made 79 three-pointers this season and 171 during the past two seasons. The 
main reason the Panthers finished as co-champions of the Century League. He had 
22 points and made five three-pointers in a 64-58 victory against Santa Ana 
Valley. Tony Gonzalez 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach; Forward Sr.; 6-6; 25.6 ppg At 6 feet 6, 230 pounds, the 
California-bound forward was the county's most dominating inside player. 
Gonzalez, who also will play football for the Golden Bears, became Huntington 
Beach's career scoring leader with 1,533 points, surpassing Mike Contreras, who 
graduated in 1969 after scoring 1,477 points. Doug Gottlieb 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin; Guard Jr.; 6-0; 18.0 ppg Gottlieb is one of the county's best 
playmakers, averaging 8.1 assists in the regular season to help the Tillers tie 
Santa Margarita for the Sea View League championship. Gottlieb, the league's 
MVP, led Tustin to the Division II-A semifinals, where they lost to Compton 
Dominguez, 70-35. Thomas Harmon 
</P>
<P>
 Century; Center Sr.; 6-4; 18.0 ppg Harmon's tremendous quickness and leaping 
ability made him a force in the post. He earned Pacific Coast League co-player 
of the year honors with Trabuco Hills' forward Ryan Karnoff and led Century to 
its first playoff victory, a 63-61 Division I-A first-round triumph over 
University. Tim Lin 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos; Guard Sr.; 6-0; 16.7 ppg Moved from point guard to off-guard 
this season and helped the Griffins win the Empire League title. He has great 
range and actually shot for a higher percentage on three-pointers than on 
regular field goals. He made 101 of 207 three-pointers. He also averaged 4.8 
assists and had 73 steals. Olujimi Mann 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley; Guard So.; 6-4; 21.9 ppg Mann, a transfer from Mater Dei, 
pushed the Falcons all the way to the Southern Section I-AA semifinals. Quick 
and aggressive, he was one of the top defenders in the county. He made 73 
three-pointers and shot 44.5% from behind the three-point line. He had 116 
steals and averaged 7.2 assists and 6.6 rebounds. Miles Simon 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei; Guard Sr.; 6-4; 21.0 ppg One of the top high school seniors in the 
nation. He has signed with Arizona. Improved his game in the past year, 
becoming a better ballhandler. He moved to point guard, where his passing 
skills were more effective. He helped the Monarchs reach the Southern 
California Regional Division I final. Chris Vlasic 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica; Forward Sr.; 6-5; 20.0 ppg Vlasic usually didn't start in Coach Bob 
Becker's two-platoon system, but the senior was always a clutch fourth-quarter 
performer. Vlasic, who led the team in scoring, three-pointers and free-throw 
percentage, helped Pacifica reach the State Division III finals and win its 
first Southern Section title. Demitrius Zeigler 
</P>
<P>
 University; Guard Sr.; 6-3; 26.2 ppg Zeigler led the county in scoring for the 
second consecutive season and set the school's career scoring record, finishing 
with 1,470 points in three seasons. Several Ivy League schools are interested 
in Zeigler, who was equally effective outside (151 career three-pointers) and 
driving to the basket. THE SECOND TEAM 06,06,16,17,05,06,06 Pos. Player School

WALK SIGNS ON FOR A SPEAKING PART; VETERAN PITCHER NOW PART OF ROTATION IN 
PIRATE RADIO BOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Knowing his chances of having the last word had grown slim, Rich Donnelly 
instead chose to dig in the first needle. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Bob Walk's new job as a broadcaster covering the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Donnelly, the club's third base coach opined, "He's been 
second-guessing (Manager) Jim (Leyland's) decisions for eight years. He might 
as well get paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Walk, who has spent the past eight baseball seasons as a mainstay on the 
Pirate pitching staff, had a long, hard laugh over that one. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more he thought about it, the more truth he saw in Donnelly's 
tongue-in-cheek statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's actually a pretty accurate quote," Walk said by telephone from the 
Pirates' spring training base in Bradenton, Fla., last week. "A lot of times I 
would bring things up, like why did he make a certain move in a certain 
situation. But it wasn't to second-guess as much as it was for my own 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 In his new role for the team after his retirement as a player, Walk will be 
asked to pass along his knowledge over the airwaves. About six weeks ago, the 
Pirates added the 37-year-old former Hart High and College of the Canyons 
pitcher to their four-man broadcasting crew as a color commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, just as one door appeared to be closing, another opened wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I never retired," said Walk, who spent at least part of 14 
major-league seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves and 
Pirates. "I just have a different job description. I still ride the same bus 
and go to dinner with the same people." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Walk declined a $275,000 offer from the Pirates to return to the 
club as a relief pitcher. He expected his services would be worth twice as much 
to another club as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 He miscalculated. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month before the start of spring training, his only offers were 
for minor league contracts from the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs. Walk, who 
made $1.825 million last season, decided he would rather quit and pursue the 
Pirates' radio job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know in my mind I still could probably pitch another year or two, but by 
the time I was done this window of opportunity might not be open," Walk said. 
"I knew I couldn't play forever, so it was time to get out while the getting 
was good." 
</P>
<P>
 Walk has no broadcast experience other than that derived from mimicking 
then-Angel announcers Dick Enberg and Don Wells as a youth growing up in 
Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is totally new," Walk said. "They just threw me in the deep end. But the 
play-by-play guys drive the ship. All I'm there to do is sit back and talk 
about the game. What type of training do I need for that? I've been doing it 
all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Before pursuing his new position, Walk sought the advice of Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion is that he did the right thing (by) bowing out 
gracefully," Leyland said. "There's so much financial reward nowadays, it's 
hard to go out when you still might be capable of winning some games. But I 
think he made the right choice, and I'm tickled to death that he's still going 
to be with us as a part of the Pirate organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling is mutual. Walk resurrected his career as a member of the Pirates 
after being released by the Braves 10 years ago. Walk had a record of 82-61 for 
Pittsburgh and played a key role as the club won division championships in 
1990, '91 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange feeling, that first day I came back to spring training," 
Walk said. "I got . . . a nervous stomach when I saw everyone else on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm happy I made the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Walk was considered a student of the game. He is using the same 
approach in the booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that really impressed me about Bob was that he held a 
position with the Pirate broadcast team in such high regard," said Lanny 
Frattare, who is in his 19th season as the club's top play-by-play announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen other players go into the booth and act like the position was owed 
to them. Bob's enthusiasm for his new job has been infectious for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Frattare said Walk's tenure with the Pirates will both help and hinder him at 
his new post. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage is that he knows the players and they trust him and he has that 
same relationship with Jim Leyland and the coaching staff," Frattare said. 
"They are going to tell Bob things, on or off the record, that they might not 
tell anyone else. The down side to that is you have to learn how to use that 
information without violating trusts." 
</P>
<P>
 Walk is also aware he must navigate a fine line as a critic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work for the Pirates and they pay my salary, so I have to be positive," he 
said. "But I also still have to maintain my credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to be fairly conservative and I think they like me that way. They've 
told me they're not looking for any home runs. Just some singles." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Walk will be remembered as a steady if rarely spectacular 
performer. He was, at one time or another, a starter, a reliever and a bullpen 
stopper. He was traded, released, sent down to the minors and fought his way 
back up. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was on a world championship team -- the Phillies, 1980 -- pitched for 
five division winners and made the All-Star team in 1988. In one six-year 
stretch, from 1987-92, Walk was the only National League pitcher to post a 
winning record with at least 10 decisions each season. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes him good trivia but does not trivialize his accomplishments in the 
eyes of his former coaches and teammates. Yet, as a blue-collar pitcher toiling 
in a blue-collar town, his contributions to the success of the Pirates went 
largely unrecognized outside Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Walkie ever did was give you his best, whatever it was, every time out," 
Leyland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on his career, Walk said he wouldn't change a thing -- not even the 
low point, his 1984 release by the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, that was the best thing that could have happened to me 
because I ended up with the Pirates," Walk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like my whole career I've been in the right place at the right time. 
It's been a great run, and it's not over. This is just another chapter that's 
beginning."

THE TIMES' 1994 ALL-COUNTY GIRLS' BASKETBALL TEAM; LITTLE THINGS SPARK BIG 
FINISH FOR BANGS; COACH OF THE YEAR: HE GUIDES YOUTHFUL WARRIORS TO UNDEFEATED 
SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They were expected to be good. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expected them to be undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodbridge Warriors were one of only two girls' teams that finished the 
regular season without a defeat; three-time defending State champion 
Brea-Olinda was the other. They played in Orange County's second-most difficult 
league and, possibly, had the county's second-most difficult schedule given 
their tournament opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 They won with one senior, one junior, two sophomores and a freshman in the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Eric Bangs, The Times Orange County girls' coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection was based on Woodbridge's 25-0 regular-season performance, 
though the Warriors have made an impressive playoff run; they have since won 
seven games, including a victory over unbeaten Mission Hills Alemany in the 
Southern California Regional final. They play for the State championship 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits his assistants, Tracy Roberts and William Stovall, and the players, 
who have melded into a remarkably efficient program. 
</P>
<P>
 "One, it's been easier because of the kids. They've done more than they've 
ever done before," Bangs said. "Two, I've had more help than I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have taken care of some nitty-gritty things; there haven't been any 
internal conflicts and we haven't had one bad practice. You can get into pure 
coaching -- that's why you do this. I've never had kids respond to what you say 
as well. For some reason, these kids are really listening intently and carrying 
things out on the court. It's little things, but they make a big difference." 
Jessica Eggleston 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress; Forward Sr.; 6-0; 29.5 ppg Eggleston led the county in scoring (29.5 
points) and shooting (63.4%), helping Cypress (23-3) win the Empire League 
title. She took what she wanted from about eight feet in and, incredibly, 
scored 186 points from the free-throw line, shooting 72.1%. Her 11.6 rebounds 
came in handy, too. Nicole Erickson 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda; Guard Sr.; 5-6; 15.7 ppg The two-time all-county player of the 
year is one of the primary reasons the Ladycats never played a game closer than 
nine points. Erickson, a point guard, averaged 15.7 points and 8.1 assists, 
shot 47% from the field, 46.9% from the three-point arc and a county-high 80.9% 
from the free-throw line. Karun Grossman 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills; Forward Sr.; 6-0; 23.5 ppg Everything revolved around Grossman, 
and she came through most of the time, leading Dana Hills (17-7) to the 
playoffs by averaging 23.5 points and 10.9 rebounds. Her quick release served 
her well: She made a county-high 62 three-point baskets (37%) and converted 
74.3% of her free throws. Colleen Hudson 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda; Center Sr.; 6-2; 14.0 ppg Hudson provided the strength inside 
that helped Brea (25-0) ascend to No. 2 in the nation. She averaged 14.0 points 
and 6.0 rebounds to make the All-County team for the second year. She shot 
62.2% from the field and 63.8% from the line. Like everyone at Brea, she is 
also a terrific defender. Michelle Macintyre 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente; Guard Sr.; 5-9; 17.4 ppg Macintyre had the capacity to take over 
a game, and San Clemente (18-5) took advantage of that skill. A second-year 
first-team selection, she averaged 17.4 points and 4.8 assists and did nothing 
to shake the confidence of Hawaii, which she committed to attending before the 
season's start. Jamie Oenning 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge; Guard Sr.; 5-7; 13.5 ppg Oenning was the only senior starter for 
unbeaten Woodbridge (25-0), and her value came as much from her leadership 
qualities as it did from her scoring (13.5 points) and playmaking (4.7 assists) 
skills. She shot 47% from the field, 38.1% from the three-point arc and 77.1% 
from the free-throw line. Melody Peterson 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei; Guard So.; 5-7; 15.1 ppg Perhaps the county's best pure athlete, 
Peterson helped Mater Dei (20-3) win the South Coast title. The Monrovia 
transfer averaged 15.1 points, 4.2 rebounds and 5.2 assists -- a figure that 
could have been greater had teammates been ready for some of her amazing 
passes, or scored on the ones they caught. Marie Philman 
</P>
<P>
 Edison; Forward So.; 5-10.; 27.0 ppg Philman, one of the county's strongest 
players, was also a dominant scorer. She scored 40 or more points on four 
occasions and had 30 or more 10 times. She averaged 27.0 points on the year and 
14.3 rebounds, which ranked her second and third countywide. She shot 53% from 
the field and 80% from the line. Shandy Robbins 
</P>
<P>
 Marina; Forward Jr.; 5-11; 16.9 ppg The Sunset League is the county's 
toughest, and it was Robbins' defense that secured a share of the league title; 
her blocked shot in the final seconds saved a victory over co-champion Ocean 
View. She led Marina with 16.9 points and was equally adept under the boards, 
averaging 11.6 rebounds. Akilah Rodgers 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos; Center Sr.; 6-0; 19.5 ppg A two-time All-County selection, 
Rodgers could be as devastating as any post player in the county when she 
wanted to be. She averaged 19.5 points, 15.4 rebounds and 3.7 blocks as Rancho 
Alamitos shared the Garden Grove League championship. She was dominant inside, 
shooting 56.4% from the field. THE SECOND TEAM 06,06,18,19,05,06,06 Pos. Player

RAMS OFFER: $4.1 MILLION TO DONNALLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 After making a favorable impression with Oiler wide receiver Haywood Jeffires 
on Tuesday, the Rams continued their raid on Houston Oiler personnel and 
presented offensive tackle Kevin Donnalley with a $4.1-million, four-year offer 
sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to sign it (today) and then wait and see if Houston will match it," 
Donnalley said. "I'd rather play in L.A. . . . I just hope Houston doesn't 
match the offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams declined to reveal the yearly breakdown, but it has been learned that 
they have offered him a $1-million signing bonus and salaries of $700,000 in 
1994 and '95, $800,000 in '96 and $900,000 in '97. Donnalley earned $275,000 in 
1993. T.J. SIMERS

DONNALLEY SAYS HE'LL SIGN $4.1-MILLION RAM OFFER SHEET TODAY 
</P>

<P>
 The Rams continued their raid on Houston personnel by presenting offensive 
tackle Kevin Donnalley with a $4.1-million, four-year offer and making a 
favorable impression on Oiler wide receiver Haywood Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to sign it (today) and then wait and see if Houston will match it," 
Donnalley said. "I'd rather play in L.A. They pursued me, and they made it 
clear they want me. They said they need me to fill their left tackle job. I 
just hope Houston doesn't match the offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams declined to reveal the yearly breakdown, but it has been learned that 
they offered him a $1-million signing bonus and salaries of $700,000 in 1994 
and '95, $800,000 in '96 and $900,000 in '97. Donnalley earned $275,000 in 
1993, and the Rams' offer has been designed to make it difficult for the 
Oilers, who have serious salary cap problems, and still have 27 unsigned 
players on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers have seven days to respond to the Rams' offer sheet, and if they 
choose not to match it, they will receive the Rams' third-round pick in next 
month's draft as compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a left tackle and he has played well there," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. 
"He's a quality player in an area where we have a definite need." 
</P>
<P>
 If Donnalley, 25, joins the Rams, starting left tackle Irv Eatman, due to earn 
$1.1 million, probably will be asked to take a pay cut if he wishes to remain 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnalley (6-5, 305) impressed the Rams with his play against San Diego's 
Leslie O'Neal and Kansas City's Derrick Thomas last season. The Rams are 
scheduled to play the Chargers and Chiefs in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they want me there to protect (quarterback) Chris Miller," said 
Donnalley, who has started eight games in his three-year career. "They showed 
me they really wanted me on my visit to L.A., and after meeting Coach Knox, I 
can't wait for the opportunity to play for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, a three-time Pro Bowl selection who is an unrestricted free agent, 
sang the same tune after spending two days with the Rams' brass. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys really impressed me," Jeffires said. "I'm very high on the Los 
Angeles Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, who earned $900,000 and caught 66 passes for 753 yards in '93, 
including six for touchdowns, said there are four suitors for his services -- 
the Rams, Redskins, Oilers and Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos would obviously eliminate themselves if the Raiders choose not to 
match their offer sheet to wide receiver Tim Brown. The Oilers' salary cap 
concerns might make it difficult to meet Jeffires' salary demands, leaving 
Washington -- without a quarterback -- to compete with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signing of Chris Miller shows the Rams are headed in the right 
direction," Jeffires said. "And after talking with the coaches here and seeing 
the interest the coaching staff has in me, I'd be a fool not to want to be with 
the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams worked out Jet wide receiver Terance Mathis on Tuesday and will look 
at Giant safety Greg Jackson and Patriot wide receiver Greg McMurtry today. 
Colt wide receivers Clarence Verdin and Jessie Hester will be here next week.

 NIXON'S TAYLOR: Maybe you recognized the face: Standing alongside Richard 
Nixon on news clips of his current Russian trip is Orange County's John Taylor. 
. . . He's director of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda 
and a longtime associate of the former President. He'd been on previous Nixon 
trips to China and the Soviet Union. Library spokesman Kevin Cartwright says 
Taylor's trip has been exciting but hectic: "He's sending back a lot of 
middle-of-the-night voice mails." 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S THE OTHER GUYS: White Water Realty, near the pier in San Clemente, has 
decided to have a bit of fun with seeing its name turned into a household word, 
thanks to the Clinton Administration. Its new sign, with a smiley face, says 
"No! We are not affiliated with the Whitewater Development Co. in Arkansas." 
Says a spokeswoman: "We've been here for years, even longer than those people 
have been in Arkansas. . . ." There's also a White Water Capital in Newport 
Beach. They've got no kin in Clinton's home state either. 
</P>
<P>
 ANY GENERATION: He was a counterculture hero in the '60s. But every decade, it 
seems, a new crop of readers discover Kurt Vonnegut ("Cat's Cradle," 
"Slaughterhouse Five"). He's written 14 novels, but Vonnegut could easily make 
a living these days with his highly paid college lectures. . . . The author 
says he'll give his "most requested" lecture at UC Irvine's Bren Center tonight 
at 7:30: "How to Get a Job Like Mine." Tickets for his speech are $13. 
</P>
<P>
 SHEAR FUN: One sign that winter is over and warm weather is here to stay: 
Godzilla is ready to shed his coat. He's the large Suffolk sheep at the Santa 
Ana Zoo, and folks there have built an annual festival around shearing the wool 
from Godzilla and his four fellow sheep. Many area elementary schools are 
sending classes on field trips to the event at 10 a.m. today. The wool goes 
straight to the spinning wheel, where veteran spinners will help the children 
transform it into refined yarn in a demonstration.

 SAVE THE KIDS: Dear parents: There is hope for children losing brain cells by 
watching too much TV. They can still lead normal lives. . . . Schools, like 
Harvard-Westlake in Studio City, teach media literacy, showing children how to 
manipulate the screen images instead of vice versa."It's not the quality of the 
TV that matters," said one educator. "It's the quality of the skills of the 
person who uses the TV." (E1)

 SPRINGTIME: Baseball isn't the only rite associated with spring. This is also 
the season of wildflower viewing, and once again, the Theodore Payne Foundation 
in Sun Valley is sponsoring a 24-hour Wildflower Hotline ((818) 768-3533) 
through May 26 with a four-minute recording listing popular spots. . . . Last 
year, the line received 18,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 QUICK EXIT: Maybe it was the unfamiliar Oklahoma climate. Or maybe the team 
wanted to hurry home to watch the NCAA Tournament. Whatever the case, The 
Master's College in Newhall (above) quickly bowed out Tuesday of the NAIA 
Division I tournament in Tulsa, losing 98-85 to Georgia Southwestern. . . . 
Still, Master's (28-5) had a great year. (C10)

 REUNION: Izzy the Iguana is done with running away from home. Or, at least, 
that's how it looks to its guardian, owner Jeff Gullickson, 17, of Lake View 
Terrace. "She looks pretty mellow," he said. "I think she's had enough of the 
outside." . . . Gullickson was reunited with Izzy Tuesday at a Shadow Hills 
school where it was found. (B3) 
</P>
<P>
 DAMAGE CHANGES: The quake's financial toll on the city of Santa Clarita isn't 
as bad as officials feared. But it's still pretty bad. New figures place the 
destruction at $244 million, $52 million lower than original estimates. . . . 
That's because of a clerical mistake, as well as lower damage estimates for 
highways and bridges, public facilities and utility equipment. (B16) Michael 
Arkush

PLAN TO RENAME SCHOOL SPARKS FUROR; SANTA PAULA: PROPOSAL TO CALL CAMPUS AFTER 
A LATINO WOULD BE A DISTRICT FIRST. FOES WANT LONGTIME PRINCIPAL HONORED 
INSTEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Except for Glen City School, every elementary school in Santa Paula is named 
after a prominent local citizen -- all of whom happen to be white. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the majority of the city is Latino, longtime Santa Paula resident 
and activist Bob Borrego proposed to the school district last month that the 
lone holdout, Glen City School, be renamed in honor of Joe Bravo. A former 
mayor who served for many years as principal at two other Santa Paula 
elementary schools, Bravo, a Latino, is currently a school board trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents say Borrego's proposal, a topic of debate among many of the 
town's 25,000 residents, has ignited old racial tensions between Latinos, who 
make up about 60% of Santa Paula's population, and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Bravo never worked at Glen City, some residents say, the district 
shouldn't name the school after him. But if the name is changed, they suggest 
calling it Dorothy Pinkerton School, after a longtime resident who was Glen 
City's principal from the school's inception in 1952 until she retired in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dorothy Pinkerton was there for all these years, and she made that school 
what it is today," said Marjorie G. Hudson, a former teacher in the district. 
"This man had nothing to do with the school. I think it's a terrible slap in 
the face to Dorothy Pinkerton." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bravo supporters insist that it is high time the district show students 
that Latinos, too, are worthy of having schools named after them. Recently, 
Glen City was designated the district's bilingual, multicultural magnet school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it as a recognition for his past accomplishments and as a 
role-model issue for our youth," said Laura Espinosa, a 20-year Santa Paula 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Intent on taking their cause before the Santa Paula Elementary School District 
board, residents on both sides have bombarded trustees with phone calls 
lobbying either for Pinkerton or Bravo. Residents have also flooded the local 
paper with emotional letters. The board has yet to formally consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrego admits that he's a bit overwhelmed by the furor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be very proper, very appropriate," he said. "The guy's 
been a real neat, clean, All-American kind of guy. Why do they resent it so 
much?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo, 75, said that for now he'd prefer not to discuss the matter in detail. 
But, he added: "Of course, it's always an honor to be named for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 And Pinkerton, who has been dragged reluctantly into the center of the 
conflict, said she'd rather the name just stay the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a nice sound to it," said Pinkerton, who said she is in her 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from sounding pleasant to the ear, the name Glen City has historic 
significance, longtime residents say. It commemorates Santa Paula's former 
name, decades back, when people referred to it as "the glen city" before it was 
formally called Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's keep some of the heritage there," said Ray Gonzales, a Santa Paula 
resident who said he opposes naming the school after Bravo because of 
philosophical differences between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Pinkerton supporters say the proposal appears to be racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see any other reason for this change other than the minority angle," 
said Elizabeth Blanchard, a former school board member who years ago married 
into a family after whom one of the town's schools is named. "Our schools have 
enough problems without trying to do that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the town's Latino residents, however, note that schools in the city 
have been renamed before without any of the rancor surrounding the latest 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just kind of odd," Borrego said. "When I approached the school board, I 
hoped this would be done quietly like all the other school dedications." 
</P>
<P>
 Borrego said the last thing he ever meant to do was offend or embarrass 
Pinkerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know Dorothy Pinkerton; I don't know a thing about her," he said. 
"I'm just saying to these people, 'Where have you been for the last 20 years? I 
just brought this up, and where have you been?' "

THE FUR FLIES; COUPLE SUE THOUSAND OAKS NEIGHBOR WHO WELCOMES SQUIRRELS TO YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The squirrels in a remote Thousand Oaks neighborhood near Wildwood Regional 
Park seem to know where they're wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them frolicked Tuesday in a tree in front of the home of Kathleen 
Adams, a 13-year resident of Silver Spur Court who has set up a sign in her 
front yard announcing, "Squirrel's Welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, 50, a craftswoman, is known around the quiet, semirural neighborhood 
for her love of the fuzzy-tailed critters. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, she has been thrust into the role of squirrels' advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' next-door neighbors, Randy and Nancy Hecht, have sued her, saying the 
squirrels she invites into her yard are wreaking havoc in theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become a terrible situation," said Leigh Datzker, attorney for the 
Hechts. "She's made her home into a little motel for squirrels, and the result 
is that they've trampled the yard of my clients." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hechts, who declined to be interviewed, argue in their lawsuit that the 
squirrels have been digging up their yard and gnawing holes in their roof since 
they bought the house in 1992. The damage, they say, will cost between $5,000 
and $7,500 to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which names Adams and her landlord, Harold Runyan, asks for Adams to 
stop feeding the animals and for the money to make the repairs. Runyan could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Datzker said the lawsuit is less about money than it is about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "These squirrels are wild," Datzker said. "They can carry diseases or come up 
and bite one of the Hechts' (two) small children. They're really concerned 
about the health risks of having all of these wild animals around." 
</P>
<P>
 But Adams shakes her head when she hears about her neighbors' worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "These little squirrels are naturally friendly," she said. "They're not going 
to hurt anyone unless they're provoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said she has become a bit of an expert on squirrels in the past seven 
years since they began visiting the house that she rents with her husband, 
Henry Bayramian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to just feed the birds when the squirrels started coming around," she 
said. "I really enjoyed watching the little squirrels, so I started feeding 
them, and they've been coming here ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams set up boxes in the trees around her house with nuts for the squirrels. 
The creatures climb up to the boxes, open the lids and pick out the food they 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeders, she said, attracted only a modest collection of the frisky 
rodents, with no more than four or five stopping by at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Datzker said the care and feeding has led to an infestation of squirrels 
-- more than would ever occur naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a concentrated cadre of squirrels who are visiting her home," Datzker 
said. "She's providing them with a habitat that allows them to flourish much 
more easily than in the wild." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hechts, he said, can't document the change in squirrel population, but 
they insist that it's rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Adams' other neighbors, however, said they have not noticed much 
difference since Adams began her hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live within eyeshot of a natural reserve," said Joe Berg, a Thousand Oaks 
resident since 1974. "With all the development and the fires, I'm amazed we 
don't see more squirrels than we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Norma Chotiner agreed, saying she fully expected there to be wild 
animals around when she moved to Silver Spur Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very woodsy area," she said. "I think it comes with living this 
close to the hills." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hechts say otherwise. According to Datzker, if Adams stops feeding the 
squirrels, they will go away. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to present Ventura County Superior Court with a motion to 
temporarily prevent Adams from providing food for the squirrels, at least until 
the dispute is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said she may be gone before that happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid that with this lawsuit and all the arguing, I'm just going to have 
to move," she said. "I can't be comfortable like I used to. The pressure is 
just too much for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of her neighbors said that would be a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really cares about those animals," said Robin Devine, who moved to Silver 
Spur Court in September. "If that's her cause, I hope she sticks with it."

CONSTRUCTION TO RESUME ON SANTA ROSA ROAD; SUPERVISORS: UNDER COMPROMISE 
APPROVED BY THE BOARD, CREWS MUST TAKE EXTRA CARE NOT TO DESTROY NATIVE 
AMERICAN REMAINS AND ARTIFACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Construction crews can resume work on Santa Rosa Road east of Camarillo, but 
must take extra care not to destroy the remains of Native Americans and other 
archeologically significant artifacts, Ventura County supervisors decided 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four supervisors scrapped a staff recommendation that the site fails to meet 
state legal qualifications as an "important archeological resource" and that it 
does not constitute a Native American "sanctified" cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the board approved a compromise plan to allow crews to continue road 
construction provided that they look for artifacts in areas that have yet to be 
graded and halt all work if artifacts or human remains are discovered. 
Supervisor John K. Flynn was absent from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are satisfied with this, generally," said A Lul Koy Lotah, an Ojai 
resident who is considered by state officials to be a descendant of Chumash 
tribe members. "We have established a dialogue, and I am hopeful that they will 
now listen to our concerns when we voice them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lotah said she predicted that the numbers of burials that will be 
discovered at the site will once again hobble the construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that we were able to talk, but I'm convinced that we have discovered 
a (Chumash) village at the site and there will be many, many more sets of 
remains found there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Supervisor Vicky Howard said the board could support the 
Public Works Department's revised "go-slow" approach to resuming construction. 
But she refused to declare the site archeologically unimportant, thus allowing 
crews to resume work without concern about destroying what could be a 
significant archeological discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot make the finding that the site is unimportant as long as we have 
virgin territory to explore out there," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur E. Goulet, the county's public works director, said he was pleased to 
have negotiated an agreement with the Native Americans that satisfied everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent was never to destroy history here," he said. "Our intent was to 
find an acceptable solution to all parties that would allow us to get back to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the written agreement approved by the supervisors, the Public Works 
Department will: 
</P>
<P>
 * Resume road construction work at the site, but remove only 1 1/2 inches of 
earth at a time so not to disturb artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Halt work if additional cremation pits, remains or relics are discovered so 
that artifacts could be saved and remains could be properly reburied by tribal 
custom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conduct a detailed archeological investigation of a natural earthen berm at 
the site that has not been graded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish a work plan for two archeologists who are supervising the work 
on-site and keep Native American monitors on the site during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The project to widen all 11 miles of Santa Rosa Road was interrupted in one 
area in December after grading crews unearthed a cremation chamber containing 
the remains of two to three Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In early February, scientists working the site discovered a series of round, 
smooth stones that may have been part of a Chumash burial ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the 90-year-old road began in 1990 and is being done in three 
phases, with the final phase to be completed next year. The project aims to 
widen and eliminate blind curves and hills on the two-lane thoroughfare that 
runs between Camarillo and the north end of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials estimate that an estimated 10,000 commuters use the road 
daily.

METROLINK'S FARES TO BURBANK WILL BE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to boost Metrolink ridership, transit officials are cutting fares from 
Ventura County to Burbank by as much as 20%. But fares to downtown Los Angeles 
and other stops along the Metrolink line will not be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank is the destination for more than a third of the riders on the commuter 
train's Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 But some passengers who travel to the four other stations between Ventura 
County and downtown Los Angeles criticized Metrolink officials for not 
including their fares in the price cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting April 1, passengers who take the train from Camarillo, Moorpark or 
Simi Valley to Burbank will pay less than those who travel all the way to Union 
Station in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduced fares will also apply to the emergency Metrolink service scheduled 
to begin in Oxnard on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 For Burbank-bound passengers boarding in Moorpark and Camarillo, the price of 
a monthly pass will drop from $176 to $144. Single round-trip tickets will cost 
$10 apiece, down from $12. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, commuters will pay $112 for monthly passes and $8 for 
individual round-trip tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The price cuts were approved by the Southern California Regional Rail 
Authority, which runs Metrolink, to try to lure potential riders by shifting 
Burbank into a cheaper zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink fares are based on a seven-zone rate structure that radiates outward 
from Union Station. The authority agreed to shift Burbank to a cheaper zone, 
thus reducing the fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership on the Ventura County line has increased more than 25% since the 
earthquake, holding steady at about 3,000 passengers a day, Metrolink spokesman 
Peter Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means in a marketing sense is we will be able to attract new 
riders," Hidalgo said. "We believe it will also help us retain the ridership we 
have gained since the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason, who rides Metrolink each day to his job in 
Chatsworth, criticized the Burbank price reduction. The $112 cost of his 
monthly pass will not be included in the fare cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares for passengers traveling to Van Nuys, Glendale and Union Station will 
also remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're cherry-picking the fare reduction and I can't agree with that," 
Lawrason said. "I'm disappointed with this. It's certainly not equitable to 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Colleen Sherman was surprised to discover that the price 
cut would not reduce the cost of a monthly pass to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like taking the train to my job, but I kind of feel cheated," said 
Sherman, who works as a filing clerk. "It's pretty expensive for someone like 
me, and a little price break would make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Addison, a Simi Valley resident who works as an editor in Glendale, said 
she thinks that the train is a good value, even at its present price. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cheaper fare would be nice," Addison said. "But to me it's worth it not to 
have to put up with the traffic." Metrolink Fare Changes 
</P>
<P>
 Starting April 1, Metrolink commuters who travel from Ventura County to 
Burbank will get discounts of as much as 20%. These are the new fares: 
05,17,09,10,12,09 Monthly Ten-trip Single pass ticket Round-trip one-way Simi 
Valley to Burbank $112 $35 $8 $4.50 Simi Valley to Los Angeles $144 $45 $10 
$5.50 Moorpark to Burbank $144 $45 $10 $5.50 Moorpark to Los Angeles $176 $55 
$12 $6.50 Camarillo to Burbank $144 $45 $10 $5.50 Camarillo to Los Angeles $176 
$55 $12 $6.50 Oxnard to Burbank* $176 $55 $12 $6.50 Oxnard to Los Angeles* $208 
$65 $14 $7.50 * Metrolink service from Oxnard is scheduled to begin April 4.

 Vandals took aim at Ventura's first storefront police station early Tuesday,

 Sgt. Carl Handy said he believed that the window was smashed by youths living

<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, it was directly pointed at us," he said. "On the 
other hand, it won't make a lick of difference, because we're going to come in 
no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials said they hope to open the small storefront, squeezed 
between a video store and a Laundromat, by the end of the month. It will be 
open a few hours a day and used as a base station for two officers patrolling 
the Montalvo area. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront is patterned on two similar substations in Oxnard, one of which 
was firebombed before it opened. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 A subcommittee of the City Council is scheduled to decide today between two 
development proposals for a 25,900-square-foot parcel in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 An Oxnard-based company wants to build 26 townhouses and shops on the property 
at the northwest corner of Figueroa Street and Thompson Boulevard.Holguin, 
Fahan & Associates, a Ventura-based environmental consultant company, is 
proposing a Victorian-style office building and warehouse at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both would be compatible with the area," Associate Planner Pat Richardson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the vacant lot in 1989 for $312,000, Richardson said. It is 
now valued at $310,000, and both companies are interested in buying it from the 
city. Both are asking the city for low-interest rate loans and other 
concessions such as waiving permit fees and traffic mitigation fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is at 8:30 a.m. at City Hall in Conference Room E. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY TO STUDY NAMING STREET FOR CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard will study changing the name of Garfield Avenue in La 
Colonia to honor Cesar Chavez, the late farm labor organizer who once lived on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a motion by Mayor Manuel Lopez, the council agreed Tuesday to delay 
action on a staff proposal to name one of three streets in the yet-to-be-built 
Northeast Community after Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said Garfield Avenue was a better choice because the Chavez family twice 
lived in residences on the street when they stayed in Oxnard to work on area 
farms. Chavez began his career as an activist in Oxnard when he helped start a 
community group. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff did not evaluate Garfield Avenue for the name change because of the 
difficulty of changing the name of existing streets, Lopez said. But he added 
that no more than 30 to 40 residents live on Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the people who live there would not object to the name 
change," Lopez said. "I think this is the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Vasquez, a member of the United Farm Workers union that Chavez founded 
in 1968, invited the council to a March 26 procession in honor of Chavez that 
will go through Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, which will begin at 8 a.m. at Harbor Boulevard and Gonzales 
Avenue, will wind through the city before arriving at 1 p.m. at the newly 
renamed Cesar Chavez School in La Colonia, where a statue of Chavez will be 
dedicated. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI VALLEY; FORUM SET TO DISCUSS AREA'S TRANSIT 
NEEDS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A community meeting is scheduled tonight in Meiners Oaks to discuss transit 
needs for residents of the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan K. Lacey and the Ventura County Transportation Commission are 
seeking input from residents about what kind of public transit services should 
be offered and whether there is support for extending the Ojai trolley beyond 
city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at South Coast Area Transit recently decided to cancel the express 
route that runs from the Ojai Valley to Ventura and Oxnard. That cancellation 
becomes effective in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Although SCAT will continue to offer its regular route through the valley, 
Lacey and commission officials want to see whether bus service should be 
extended through Meiners Oaks and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour forum is scheduled at 7 p.m. at Meiners Oaks School, 400 S. 
Lomita Ave. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; ASSAULT SUSPECT SAID HE HAS AIDS VIRUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fillmore man who told authorities that he is infected with the virus that 
causes AIDS is scheduled to be arraigned today in Newhall Municipal Court for 
allegedly scratching, punching and attempting to bite an emergency room 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
 David Detoth, 45, remained in custody Tuesday in the jail ward of Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center in lieu of $20,000 bail. He was listed in stable 
condition after complaining of a variety of ailments, including a stomach 
ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Detoth will be arraigned on one count of assaulting a medical doctor, but 
could face an additional charge of assault with intent to do great bodily 
injury if he tests HIV-positive, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "That obviously would make a difference," Stone said. "If it turns out this 
guy is HIV-positive, we're going to re-evalute the case with that added 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Detoth was brought to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia on 
Saturday night by a friend and was apparently crying out in pain, said 
Detective Howard Fairchild of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
Detoth became enraged about 9:50 p.m. when the hospital staff refused to give 
him painkillers, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got crazy and attacked the doctor," Fairchild said, adding that Detoth 
later "bragged 'I've been HIV since 1983.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the scuffle, the doctor was scratched and punched several times in the 
head and face but managed to fend off Detoth's attempts to bite him by pulling 
back on the attacker's hair, Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Stone said there was concern for the well-being of the doctor after the 
alleged attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were both scratched up and bleeding all over the place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor's identity was not disclosed. Hospital spokeswoman Cathleen Lee 
said hospital policy prohibits releasing information about the doctor, the 
patient or the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Detoth would be asked during his arraignment to submit 
voluntarily to an HIV test. If he refuses, Stone said his office would request 
that the court order him to submit. SCOTT GLOVER

 Port Hueneme police are investigating a drive-by shooting in which several 
rounds were fired into an occupied apartment, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, which occurred about 5:35 p.m. Monday in 
the 400 block of East Clara Street.Witnesses told police that they saw a red 
car speed away after the shots were fired, said Sgt. Jerry Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bullets passed through the apartment's exterior wall into the kitchen 
and one of the bedrooms. The occupants, Bryan Davies, 29, and Paul Mitchell, 
22, were sitting on the living room floor watching TV, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they do not believe that the attack was gang-related. 
Davies told police that he believes that the shooting was directed at him, Beck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have identified a suspect, but no arrests have been made, police 
said. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MASCOT SEARCH GETS A BERRY SMALL TURNOUT 
</P>

 Gloria Chinea was one of four judges who waited patiently Tuesday for 
somebody, anybody, to walk through the door of the Oxnard Community Center and 
audition for the role of Super Strawberry -- official mascot of the 11th annual 
California Strawberry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought this was going to be booming," she said, staring at the makeshift 
stage littered with tiny strawberry candies. "Maybe it was the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee hopes to produce at least four people to don giant red 
strawberry suits and make public appearances promoting the festival, to be held 
May 21 and 22 at College Park in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be booking Super Strawberry at all kinds of fun appearances and sending 
out strawberry alerts so people will know where to catch a glimpse of our new 
agricultural super-hero," festival manager Bill Garlock said. "We're looking 
for potential berries that have some speaking ability and can articulate . . . 
the different aspects of the strawberry festival. We're not looking for veteran 
actors by any means." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year that the 11-year-old festival has sought mascots. The 
idea was sparked by Pastoral Familiar, a nonprofit group whose food servers 
dressed up in strawberry costumes at last year's festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival representatives at the Oxnard auditions were at a loss to explain why 
there was such a poor response to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you try something new, you have to struggle with it," said 
festival committee member Don DeArmond, adding that auditions in Hollywood 
today would probably attract more would-be Super Berries. "If we don't have 
anybody from this area, we'll pick four from that area." 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly before 4 p.m., Terri George, 36, of Oxnard walked into the 
community center and said she wanted to be Super Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother told me about it," she said. "I thought, 'What the heck.' At first 
I thought it was kind of silly, dressing up like a strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
 George said the satiny red costumes covered with black faux seeds and a green 
hood were "corny," but she added that "a strawberry's a strawberry -- you can't 
make it look very sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Strawberry job will require about four hours a week as the festival 
nears, Garlock said. The berries will not be paid for their time but will 
receive tickets for both days of the festival and a night's stay at the 
Radisson Suite Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it didn't pay," George said, "but you get to talk to a lot of people. 
It seems kind of interesting. It's something that not everybody gets to do."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; SUSPECT IN SHOOTING DEATH TO STAND 
TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge Tuesday ordered a 24-year-old Santa Paula man to stand 
trial after hearing tearful testimony from a woman who described how her 
husband identified the man who shot him five times before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was made by Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark, who set an arraignment 
March 29 for Jose Luis Gonzalez before Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Storch ruled Gonzalez competent to stand trial despite the 
testimony of two psychiatrists who concluded that the defendant is a paranoid 
schizophrenic who believes that he is a "special person." One doctor, Patrick 
C. Barker of Patton State Hospital, testified that Gonzalez believes that he is 
being transformed into slain former Beatle John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's preliminary hearing, Grace De La Cruz said that shortly before 
her husband was killed at their Santa Paula home, she heard him struggling with 
someone who was trying to force his way into the family's back kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Cruz said she then heard the sound of breaking glass, followed by five 
blasts from a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 She found her husband slumped against a wall, she testified. After her husband 
lost consciousness, she testified that the assailant again tried to force open 
the kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I yelled, 'Jose Luis! Jose Luis! Please go away. You have already killed 
him,' " De La Cruz said, speaking through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez displayed little emotion throughout the hearing. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RALLY AGAINST REGISTRATION FEE INCREASES FIZZLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Student leaders at Ventura College held a rally Tuesday in an effort to stir 
up frustration over rising registration fees, but the event was sparsely 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The students passed out pamphlets, urged students to sign petitions and 
letters to state representatives, and issued a call to legislative arms from a 
microphone mounted on a campus quadrangle. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are being adamant about is that we will not accept any more fee 
hikes," said Kenn Woodward, the school's representative to the California 
Students' Assn. of Community Colleges. "The students that were here were very 
into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rally leaders said few students showed up because student government was 
notified only three days ago that a protest was planned and had little time to 
organize. A small but steady stream of students trickled by from 9 a.m. to 
noon, and about 40 students had assembled by the end of the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard College, student government officers said they were unaware that a 
protest had been planned. Moorpark College student government officers could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees at community colleges statewide increased from $6 per unit in fall, 1992, 
to $10 per unit in spring, 1993, before rising to $13 per unit last fall. Gov. 
Pete Wilson in January proposed raising the fees again to $20 per unit. A full 
semester load is about 15 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward said campus leaders are already organizing another protest for April 
13 that they hope will be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College students Brian Henry, 21, and Mike Hanger, 23, did attend 
Tuesday's protest, but they were not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what they were saying, but I didn't like the way they were saying 
it," Henry said. "They were yelling at us to get off our butts and do 
something, but we're just the little guys, and those big guys (in Sacramento) 
don't care about us." CONSTANCE SOMMER

 Andy Fox, a former Thousand Oaks planning commissioner, said Tuesday that he 
will run for the City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
 With his professional background as a Los Angeles fire captain, Fox, 35, said 
he believes that he can bring strong leadership to the council on issues of 
public safety and managed growth.He said he also believes that he can help 
return order to a council often criticized for its divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personal public attacks by elected officials against each other and, even 
worse, against residents attempting to exercise their civil rights, is simply 
unacceptable," Fox said in a campaign statement. He said he plans to make a 
formal announcement about his candidacy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, a resident of Thousand Oaks for 12 years, was a planning commissioner 
from 1990 to 1993 and has been a member of the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors' Citizen Advisory Group,the Thousand Oaks Housing Issues Committee 
and the Thousand Oaks Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three seats on the five-member council up for election in November, 
including those held by incumbents Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah. Councilman Alex 
Fiore will retire this fall after serving 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lazar and Zeanah said they will seek reelection. Also, Gregory Cole, a 
former planning commissioner and trustee of the Ventura County Community 
College District, and Mike Markey, a Compton homicide detective, have said they 
plan to run. CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: U. S. ASKED TO PAY FOR FOR IMMIGRANT COSTS

<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution 
Tuesday seeking reimbursement from the federal government for county funds 
expended on undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no specific cost estimates showing what the county expends were 
immediately available, board Chairwoman Vicky Howard said state officials will 
spend more than $3 billion this year to pay for health, education and public 
assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn was absent for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said the county and the state must, by law, provide services to 
undocumented immigrants, but that state and local governments in return should 
receive reimbursement for the expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been forced to continue covering these costs," Howard said. 
"Meanwhile, the federal government has failed to live up to their part of the 
program by not appropriating the necessary funding." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the non-binding resolution will be forwarded to federal 
officials. J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: D. A. RESUMES ASSET SEIZURES OVER DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office is back in the business of 
seizing drug dealers' cash and property after announcing in January that such 
cases would no longer be pursued because of confusion stemming from expiration 
of the state asset-forfeiture law in December, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty.Michael D. Bradbury said he reversed his policy after meeting with 
other California district attorneys who are still accepting cases under a 1988 
statute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our decision is just to take a very careful, conservative approach," he said. 
"We're reviewing all cases on an individual basis." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the confusion are conflicting legal opinions and court 
decisions on the status of California's asset-forfeiture law. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the state attorney general's office issued an opinion that 
once the law expired in December, an earlier forfeiture law from 1988 would 
take effect. That opinion clashed with a ruling by the state legislative 
counsel that no law would be in effect after Dec. 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other differences, the 1988 law requires law enforcement officials to 
obtain a criminal conviction to justify a seizure of property. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said his office will follow the guidelines of the 1988 statute. As a

 Women looking for discount fashion can buy secondhand clothes and support the 
Conejo Symphony at the same time during a fund-raiser running through May to 
support the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to raise $20,000, the Symphony Guild has set up a thrift store in the 
Westlake Plaza shopping center, at 1018 Westlake Blvd.The shop, called 
Secondhand Rose, sells donated women's clothing, and is open Monday through 
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers have set an ambitious fund-raising target because the symphony 
orchestra needs money to prepare concerts for the Civic Arts Plaza's inaugural 
season, which starts next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the thrift store has raised nearly $8,000 in a month of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very successful," Guild President Susan Ward said.STEPHANIE SIMON

COLLEGE CHANGES COURSE ON OFFERINGS; EDUCATION: THE CAMPUS IN MOORPARK IS 
REPLACING ITS COMMUNITY SERVICE CLASSES WITH A NEW, BUSINESS-ORIENTED SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Moorpark College had to drop two-thirds of the 166 self-enrichment 
classes it offered last spring because hardly anybody wanted to take them, 
officials knew that it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Out went the "How to Do Your Own Wallpaper" course the college had given for 
more than five years. Gone was "Cooking Vegetarian Dishes From India." 
Officials, in fact, chucked the school's entire non-credit, community service 
classes program. Instead, they contracted with a private firm and designed a 
new schedule of classes with an eye to the faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of days, Moorpark College will become the first Ventura County 
community college to see whether a catalogue of courses designed to give 
business people an edge sells better than the largely leisure-oriented 
selections that local colleges have doled out for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Ventura and Oxnard colleges say they too have seen enrollment in 
their community service classes fall since the recession began a few years ago, 
and are responding by altering the mix of courses in their catalogues. Neither, 
however, is making changes as radical as those at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to ask the essential question -- what can we do to create a niche 
for ourselves that will really help the area get a jump start on the economy?" 
said Jim Niles, director for the college's community services program. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's answer is contained in a slim white booklet entitled "Your 
Passport to Prosperity." On April 23, for instance, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., 
people willing to shell out $50 can learn about "Communicating Across the 
Gender Gap at Work." For $85 on May 14, they can listen to a professional 
copywriter and graphic designer explain "How to Produce Dynamic Newsletters 
That Sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Rounds, a Palos Verdes-based marketer who has taught community services 
classes at Moorpark College in the past, created the new package and is 
providing it to the college under a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Moorpark College, like Oxnard and Ventura colleges, hired staff 
to run its own program, but in recent years, it at best broke even, Niles said. 
The new contract has Rounds putting up the costs of the program, Moorpark 
College providing the facilities, and the college and Rounds splitting the 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles said the college hopes to make about $30,000 this spring, all of which 
will go into the its general fund. Last year, the college lost $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at all three community colleges say the main reason that traditional 
self-enrichment classes are losing enrollment is a decline in discretionary 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the economy, I assume," said Margret Hoag, student services assistant 
for Oxnard College's program. "These are classes that are not absolutely 
necessary for people's income." 
</P>
<P>
 However, they say, the programs also face increased competition from adult 
education centers and parks and recreation departments, which have also begun 
to offer a selection of leisure courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are offering very similar classes they also call community service 
programs," Niles said, "and we did see a definite impact on our enrollment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Moorpark College decided to completely overhaul its catalogue, Oxnard 
and Ventura colleges have taken a more conservative approach. Hoag said 
Oxnard's next community services catalogue will offer an array of new 
sports-oriented classes such as fishing and boating, in an attempt to add spice 
to a schedule that had stayed largely the same for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College will also add more career-oriented classes to its selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College officials say they will add more business-oriented classes, 
but for the moment plan little other fine-tuning. They have canceled about 20% 
of their classes this spring, however, because of low enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, "we're holding steady," said Sharon Dwyer, the college's 
community services supervisor. "But we're having to take a really hard look at 
the classes we are offering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real struggle."

5 OXNARD RESIDENTS ARRESTED IN MONTHLONG STING OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ending a monthlong sting operation, authorities have arrested five Oxnard 
residents on suspicion of conspiracy to possess and sell cocaine and heroin, 
sheriff's deputies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, conducted by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and Oxnard 
police, ended Monday when Norma Bosar, 35, and Francisco Alatorre, 31, sold 
nine ounces of cocaine to an undercover agent, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Alatorre, 33, and Jose Campos, 18, who allegedly acted as bodyguards and 
lookouts, were also arrested at the time of the sale, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Alatorre, 25, was also taken into custody, but details of her 
alleged involvement in the operation were not available late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the arrests, authorities armed with a search warrant found an additional 
half-ounce of heroin and three ounces of cocaine at Francisco Alatorre's 
residence on Gonzalez Road in Oxnard, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The street value of the drugs was estimated at $25,000, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were booked at the Ventura County Jail, authorities said.

CRIME DECREASED 5% IN THOUSAND OAKS IN '93; STATISTICS: FBI FIGURES COME AS 
GOOD NEWS TO CITY OFFICIALS, WHO WARN THAT THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE REMAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Despite a slight increase in homicides, overall crime in Thousand Oaks fell by 
5% in 1993, new statistics released Tuesday show. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 3,276 offenses ranging from arson to larceny to murder occurred 
within the city limits last year, according to FBI figures released by state 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. During the previous year, 3,447 crimes were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures were heralded as good news by city officials, who nevertheless 
said they have a long way to go in reducing the threat of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we are pleased," City Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "But yes, we would 
like to see even better statistics. I don't think anyone who lives here would 
say it's as safe as it was 10, 20 or 30 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mayor Elois Zeanah: "We all want to see a drop in our total crime, and 
I'm pleased that there is a 5% drop. However, we have got to make sure we stem 
our wave of violent crime and make sure it is not a trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp, who oversees the department's 
policing of Thousand Oaks, said that while the overall drop was encouraging, 
more needs to be done to curb violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is our challenge," Kemp said. "We are having some successes in reducing 
property crimes, but violent crimes are a continuing concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said the city has a special problem because of its proximity to the 
Ventura Freeway and easy access by youths driving in from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's statistics showed, however, that violent crime -- 
including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- dropped an overall 
15.6% last year contrasted with 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of violent crimes reached 341 last year, contrasted with 404 
the previous year. Robberies were down 17.7%, and aggravated assaults dropped 
18.2%, according to the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of murders increased from one in 1992 to three last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that figure is still small by comparison with other major California 
cities, the homicides "were all shocking for us," Lazar said. "When you don't 
have very many, they all stand out." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said the city is taking steps to address crime and is holding a series 
of town hall meetings that she described as "brainstorming sessions" on the 
topic. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 7, city leaders will hold a symposium to air ideas and come up with 
solutions for how to reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among their concerns, Zeanah said, are encouraging youngsters to steer 
away from gangs, educating parents about instructing children on right from 
wrong, and offering job training and career opportunities to idle youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to find ways to enforce our family values and protect our 
community," Zeanah said. "Parents must take more responsibility in conflict 
resolution and teaching children how to handle their anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen violence is a real concern in our city right now," she said, adding that 
she has seen increases in graffiti-tagging and vandalism. "While our city 
compares well with other cities, it's still more than what we are willing to 
put up with." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks figures were the first released for any of the five cities 
patrolled by the Sheriff's Department. The sheriff is expected to release 
Moorpark's figures today and those for Camarillo, Fillmore and Ojai within the 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Ventura County cities with their own police departments -- Ventura, 
Oxnard, Simi Valley, Port Hueneme and Santa Paula -- issued annual reports on 
1993 crime in January. Reported crime was down in each.

COMMISSION APPROVES $50-MILLION PLAN TO RENOVATE JANSS MALL; THOUSAND OAKS: BUT 
OWNER SAYS SCALED-DOWN PROJECT COULD JEOPARDIZE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EXPECTED 
MAJOR TENANT. NEW VERSION REDUCES NUMBER OF ADVERTISING SIGNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks planners have approved a $50-million project to spruce up the 
Janss Mall, but sign limits they imposed may scare away Mervyn's, the mall's 
expected major tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 The scaled-down version of the project, approved 4 to 0 by the Planning 
Commission late Monday, reduced the number of free-standing signs that will be 
erected to advertise the mall and called for smaller lettering on some signs. 
Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall owner said he fears that the changes to the signs could jeopardize an 
agreement he has already signed with Mervyn's. That agreement with the 
department store includes guidelines for the size and number of advertising 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote on the proposal after a public hearing 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting, planning commissioners told developer Bill Janss that 
they were eager to see the improvements to the mall, which has not undergone 
major renovation since it opened in 1960, four years before the city's 
incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us have been very sad about what the mall has looked like, so the 
thought of having it dressed up is very pleasing," commission Chairman Irving 
Wasserman said. "But as much as we hated to do it, it simply would have been 
inconsistent for us to approve the signage they requested." 
</P>
<P>
 As initially proposed, the shopping center would have seven free-standing 
signs that would advertise both the mall's name and the names of some of its 
stores. Also, signs on the Mervyn's store would in some instances have 
five-foot-high lettering, far exceeding the city's normal allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, however, approved only three free-standing signs that would 
advertise only the mall's name and not individual stores. And the signs on the 
Mervyn's building would have scaled-down lettering of varying sizes, but none 
as high as five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Janss said after the meeting that he was pleased with the commission's review 
but concerned about the project's future because the signs were a crucial 
factor in Mervyn's decision to sign a letter of intent to join the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mervyn's and other anchor tenants have agreed to contribute a total of $13 
million toward the $50-million face lift, Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I didn't make it clear to (the commission) that having the proper 
signs was a condition of our agreement with Mervyn's," Janss said. "If the City 
Council passes the version that we left here with today, Mervyn's may back 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mervyn's representative at the Planning Commission meeting said it was too 
soon to tell if the store would pull out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks is a community we've wanted to be in for years," said Ignacio 
Gomez, Mervyn's senior real estate project manager. "But asking us to cut back 
on our signage is like asking a runner to cut off one of his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said the store has conducted studies showing that signs play a major 
role in attracting business. He said it would be very unusual for the store to 
deviate from its normal signage, including the large lettering on the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said they simply could not grant the exceptions to the city's 
sign codes because it had turned down similar requests from The Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really up to the council to make that kind of exception," Wasserman 
said. "It would be irresponsible for us to deviate from the codes that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the signs, commissioners said they were impressed by the proposed 
design, which included extensive walkways, outdoor seating areas, landscaping, 
a multilevel parking garage and a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners recommended a zoning variance that would allow the theater and 
parking garage to extend above the zone's 35-foot height limit. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project and the zoning change are approved by the council, the mall 
will house several major chains, including Blockbuster Video, a Barnes & Noble 
bookstore and Mann Theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking for the project is scheduled for June, and the mall, renamed 
the Janss Marketplace, is slated to open in 1995, Janss said. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council is scheduled to vote on the Janss Mall 
expansion plan after a public hearing on the project at Tuesday's council 
meeting. The meeting will start at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall, 2400 Willow Lane.

GUNMAN SEEMED TO HAVE A HIT LIST; SHOOTINGS: THE DISGRUNTLED FORMER WORKER 
MOVED THROUGH SANTA FE SPRINGS PLANT METHODICALLY, WARNING SOME AND TARGETING 
OTHERS, WITNESSES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A disgruntled former employee who killed three co-workers and wounded two 
others before killing himself at a Santa Fe Springs electronics plant appeared 
to have methodically chosen his victims, witnesses said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one victim of the shooting rampage said he had no idea why he was 
targeted by Tuan Nguyen, a 29-year-old Huntington Beach assembly worker who had 
been employed for less than three months at Extron Electronics, the scene of 
Monday's violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting painfully in his bed at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, 26-year-old Hoa 
Pham, a Westminster assembly worker who was shot twice by Nguyen, said he knew 
Nguyen only as a work acquaintance and did not recognize him as the gunman 
until after he read newspaper accounts of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Pham and others said, Nguyen had remained a mystery during his short 
stint at Extron. Of the people he sought out in the manufacturing plant, they 
said, only one seemed a likely target for his rage -- his immediate supervisor, 
who had fired him 2 1/2 weeks ago for unsatisfactory performance, and who 
escaped the attack because she was out to lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconstruction of the rampage came as the families of Nguyen's victims and 
the gunman's former co-workers struggled to absorb the shock of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-workers, who earn $8 to $9 an hour producing interfaces that connect 
computers to video screens, said that until Monday they had considered the 
Extron plant a safe place to work. Access to the building is controlled by door 
locks that can be opened only by punching a secret, five-digit code, and 
witnesses said Nguyen entered the building just like a regular employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The families of those who died were crushed by the senseless violence of the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand," said the weeping sister of 27-year-old Chin (Chris) Van 
Nguyen, an electronics repairman from Garden Grove who died in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairman -- who is not related to the gunman -- was shot twice in the 
back. Workers who knew him said he had once been featured as a model employee 
in a company newsletter. He had become a U.S. citizen last year, and had 
celebrated by changing his name to Christopher Arthur Newell. 
</P>
<P>
 Engaged to be married, they said, he recently had been awarded a bachelor's 
degree from a technical school, and was hoping to move to a better-paying 
engineering job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chin always helped so many people," said his sister, her eyes and face 
swollen with grief. "Why would someone like that be shot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses had few clues to his motive, but said Tuan Nguyen moved methodically 
through the assembly plant singling out one employee after another. Survivors 
said he went so far as to warn some bystanders to "get down" or "get out" while 
he stalked his targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermes Bagnol, a 33-year-old La Habra product tester, was one of the lucky 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagnol said he had just crossed the room when Nguyen burst in. He said he 
looked up just in time to see the gunman take aim at Son (Sonny) Van Truong. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong, a technician from Pomona who was among the most skilled employees at 
the plant, had told friends that he hoped to someday earn enough money to open 
his own TV repair shop. As Bagnol stood, thunderstruck, the gunman shot Truong 
in the back of the head, killing him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire was enough to send Bagnol scrambling into a corner to hide; 
Nguyen, he said, never saw him as he turned and rushed into the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 From his vantage point, Bagnol said, he could see Nguyen take aim at co-worker 
Hoa Pham, who had ducked under a table, and shoot him in the buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the gunman paused to reload, Bagnol said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I ran," he said. "He just yelled, 'Get down! Get down!' He was 
out of his mind maybe. He was mad. He was angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Nguyen fled into yet another part of the building, brushing 
past worker Song Sabandith, 36, of Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, Sabandith said, the gunman raised his pistol and shot the 
co-worker he knew only by his new American name, Chris, twice in the back. 
Petrified, Sabandith threw his hands over his head and cried out in his native 
Laotian, "Man, don't shoot! I surrender!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he recalled, he dropped to his knees and prayed as the gunman -- 
obviously in search of someone -- rushed into another room, then left it and 
kicked open the door of a bathroom and then stormed into a third room where he 
fired twice more.

 Those shots, Sabandith said, were the gunman's last, and were fired in the 
office of Nguyen's immediate supervisor, Laura Ferrino of Murrieta. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabandith said that when Nguyen burst into the office and found Ferrino out to 
lunch, he turned and shot the woman at the desk next to hers, a more skilled 
employee who had helped train him when he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot, which killed Thu (Theresa) Pham of Santa Ana, apparently was the 
gunman's next to last round. Authorities said Nguyen's final bullet was 
reserved for himself. Deputies said he was still clutching the pistol when they 
found his body.

 Gary Kayye, a company vice president, said Extron is providing individual and 
group counseling for employees, who were told to take Tuesday afternoon and 
today off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's hitting everybody more than yesterday," worker Pat Topete said. 
"It's hard to believe this happened here." 
</P>
<P>
 Worker Connie De Diego said her reaction was more anger than disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you react?" she snapped. "This is supposed to be a civilized society. 
Then people turn into animals."

LAPD COMMANDER CLEARED IN RAPE CASE; COURTS: A JURY FINDS HIM INNOCENT OF 
ATTACKING A SUBORDINATE. THE VERDICT PRECLUDES A FURTHER TRIAL ON CHARGES OF 
DISCRIMINATION IN THE POLICE FORCE.

 Ending two days of deliberations Tuesday, a federal jury cleared a Los Angeles 
police commander of civil charges that he raped a female officer in his 
apartment two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander, Maurice Moore, smiled broadly at the U.S. District Court 
verdict and later shook the hands of jurors as they filed past him in the 
hallway. "I'm just clearly glad it's over, absolutely," said Moore, who has 
been with the force for more than three decades and is among the department's 
highest-ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict capped a weeklong trial in a federal lawsuit filed by one of his 
subordinates, who accused Moore of raping her and violating her civil rights 
and who also alleged that the LAPD had a history of discrimination against 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury of six men and two women voted unanimously in Moore's favor Tuesday 
afternoon, thereby precluding a second phase of the trial on the discrimination 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Tony Hillbruner said that initially he had been sympathetic to the 
plaintiff but that "a lot of her testimony didn't match logically." 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that he and other jurors could not understand why a trained 
police officer with a dozen years of experience would not have put up more of a 
physical fight if she was being sexually assaulted. He also noted that she 
vividly remembered details of a message left on Moore's answering machine 
during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very curious," Hillbruner said. "She says she's being violently raped. 
. . . Yet she was able to listen to a phone call." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Hillbruner added that he thought both Moore and the woman 
had acted stupidly in their meeting. "I think they both used very poor 
judgment," he said. "Particularly him, as a commander -- I think he may have 
taken advantage of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore testified last week that the female officer had sought him out for 
advice on marital and career troubles, met him in his apartment while they were 
both off duty and willingly engaged in sex with him. The next day, he said, the 
woman left several messages on his answering machine, saying she was thinking 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, who is now on disability, told the jury that she went to the 
commander's apartment in March, 1992, to get the name of a therapist he had 
recommended. Once there, she said, they talked and he invited her into his 
bedroom to see the view. She testified that he then pushed her onto the bed and 
raped her despite her repeated protestations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times is not publishing her name because the newspaper has a policy of not 
naming the alleged victims of sexual assault. The officer was not in court for 
the verdict. Her attorney, Stephen Yagman, said he would appeal the verdict and 
expected a reversal on grounds that the judge had improperly instructed the 
jury on the issue of consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Levin, Moore's attorney, scoffed at the notion of a reversal, saying 
that the plaintiff's case was one of the weakest he had seen in 15 years of 
practice. "Nothing in this case made any sense," Levin said. "I never expected 
anything but this verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 The case went to trial at a time when increasing attention is being turned to 
sexual harassment allegations within the LAPD. The Moore case was one of at 
least eight complaints in the past five years in which female LAPD employees 
have alleged sexual assaults by co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also is conducting a sweeping internal investigation of 
conditions at the West Los Angeles station, which has had a longstanding 
reputation as a difficult place for women to work. And today, the City Council 
begins hearings on sexual harassment problems in the city work force, including 
the LAPD.

COUNTY LIMITS, BUT DOES NOT BAN, DAY LABORERS; WORKERS: THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO 
SOLICIT JOBS, BUT COMMERCIAL FIRMS CAN RESTRICT THEIR ACTIVITIES. NARROWER LAW 
RESULTED FROM A CONTROVERSY IN LADERA HEIGHTS. 
</P>

 Setting aside a proposal to criminalize curbside job solicitation, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday adopted a much narrower measure 
that could subject laborers to fines and jail terms for seeking work in some 
commercial parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was a major victory for immigrants and their representatives, who 
had vowed to go to court to block the much broader plan to ban job-hunters near 
homes, schools, playgrounds and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance allows day laborers to continue soliciting work on 
sidewalks, where the job-seekers usually congregate. And job solicitation will 
not be barred from any commercial parking area until owners post signs 
prohibiting the practice and set up areas where laborers may look for work -- a 
step many owners may be unlikely to undertake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reasonable compromise," said Juan Carlos Ruiz, a laborer from 
Mexico who was among the many immigrant rights and day-laborer advocates who 
descended upon the hearing room Downtown. "We want to work with the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors' decision culminates months of debate about an issue that 
acquired a strong racial undertone. 
</P>
<P>
 Curbside labor provides jobs for thousands of immigrants, mostly Latinos, 
throughout Southern California. It has become perhaps the most visible 
manifestation of the large-scale immigration that has altered the region's 
demographics. Outraged residents who call the job-seekers a menace and an 
eyesore have often attempted to restrict or ban the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Displeased by the watered-down county alternative were homeowners from the 
upscale Ladera Heights neighborhood north of Inglewood who had backed the 
stronger version, which would have made curbside job-seekers subject to up to 
six months in jail and fines of up to $1,000. The penalties will remain the 
same in the narrower ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents blame the day laborers who gather at the HomeBase shopping center 
off Slauson Avenue for littering, trespassing, making lewd comments and eroding 
their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a compromise for the day laborers, not for us," said a disappointed 
Annabelle Simmons, one of about 30 neighborhood residents who showed up for the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other residents of the racially mixed, mostly African American, 
community dismissed suggestions by the immigrants and their representatives 
that the homeowners' opposition was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're insulted that people would call this a racial issue," said Ronni 
Cooper, who heads the neighborhood civic association. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, an African American, represents Ladera 
Heights and was author of the proposed ban. She withdrew the broad plan Tuesday 
and substituted the less-restrictive alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize this is not a total solution to any of the problems, but it's 
something everyone feels is a beginning," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor expressed the hope that laborers would exercise "self-policing" 
to control errant behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting the sole negative vote was Supervisor Gloria Molina, who, a spokesman 
said, favored a more geographically limited solution. The new law applies to 
Ladera Heights and other unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, it appears little will change near Slauson and Fairfax avenues in 
Ladera Heights, where about 50 laborers gather each morning to seek jobs from 
passing motorists, many of them customers at the HomeBase home supply store in 
the adjacent shopping center. Burke and immigrant advocates are hopeful that an 
employment site can be set up in the center's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the owner has no plans to set aside a portion of the 320-space parking lot 
for day-labor solicitation or portable toilets for workers' use, said Eric 
Schneider, a representative of the Bel-Air firm that manages the property. 
There is already a severe parking shortage, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' representative expressed other concerns: potential insurance 
liability, the need to comply with health and safety concerns, and the 
likelihood of more traffic congestion.

FLIERS' FARE; AIRPORT COMMISSION SEEKS TO PUT POPULAR RESTAURANTS ON LAX MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The days of steamed hot dogs and vending machine pizzas may be numbered at Los 
Angeles International Airport. The city Tuesday invited popular restaurants and 
fast-food outlets to compete for the business of feeding hungry travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Airport Commission voted unanimously to end a 34-year exclusive 
agreement that put Host Marriott in charge of all LAX food operations. The 
commission intends to bring in an array of smaller operators, ranging from 
espresso bars to bakeries, restaurants and burger stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly who will feed the 46 million passengers who pass through the airport 
every year remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new direction was hinted at by the list of companies that airport 
officials consulted before making the change, including Panda Express, Marie 
Callender, Tony Roma, Johnny Rockets International, Wolfgang Puck Foods, 
McDonald's, TGI Fridays and Subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals will be submitted over the next two months for nearly two dozen 
locations, withthe first new restaurants to open by late summer, officials 
said. About two dozen other bars and restaurants at the airport will continue 
to be run by a single general contractor. And Host Marriott executives said 
they will contend for that job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to mean that travelers and the people going to meet family and 
friends will have the opportunity to eat at first-rate restaurants," Ted Stein, 
president of the Airport Commission, said of the vote. "They will be able to 
buy products that are comparable or better than they would find at any other 
airport in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 LAX has only experimented with brand name food and beverage outlets. But the 
lines for cafe lattes and espressos at the Starbuck's coffee bar in Terminal 5 
have made an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, it's a welcome change," said Rhonda Lowry, a Redondo Beach 
engineering consultant who had stopped for coffee. "It's a little like being at 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission Tuesday rejected a staff proposal that would have promised the 
public lower prices, along with the snappier food selection. The proposal would 
have capped airport food bills at a maximum of 10% above those for equivalent 
items in the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport in Orange County and the Pittsburgh, Pa., airport are among 
those that cap prices to prevent restaurants from exploiting a captive market. 
A survey last year by LAX officials found that high prices were the top concern 
of local travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 But airport commissioners said they prefer to rely on the free market to level 
prices at Los Angeles International. If that does not work, they said, they 
will have authority under the contracts to order prices decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein said that price caps would limit the airport's ability to attract the 
highest quality restaurants and to maximize the city's revenue, one of Mayor 
Richard Riordan's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking office in July, Riordan's commissioners quickly scrapped a plan 
that appeared likely to let Host Marriott remain in charge of LAX food 
operations. Riordan has said he wants to increase revenue at the airport. He 
hopes to tap the money to pay for city services, such as more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 No estimates have yet been made of how much the city's take might increase 
under the new system. The airport earned $7.8 million from food and beverage 
operations in the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's airport commissioners said they will offer more than improved food 
to boost sales. More than 40 food outlets will get face lifts, with brighter 
color schemes, neon signs, palm trees and Southern California pop motifs. 
</P>
<P>
 A sketch of the new mezzanine of the Tom Bradley International Terminal, for 
instance, depicts a golden Sunset Cafe, alongside palm trees, a Mexican food 
stand and a Beach Burger outlet topped by a surfboard-laden beach buggy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to create some more fun in the terminals and remind people where they 
are -- in Los Angeles," said Tom Rossbach, a consultant who helped draw the 
conceptual plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dining traditions will be harder to change. 
</P>
<P>
 The enigmatic Theme Restaurant -- the giant, isolated pod structure at the 
center of the airport -- will remain despite advice from restaurateurs that the 
facility would be better used for offices or a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, airport officials will lower the rent for the building and hope to 
attract a popular operator to improve flagging business. RESTAURANTS

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SEX 
PRIESTESS NOT EXEMPT FROM LAWS, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed priestess who claimed her religion required her to have sex 
with parishioners is not exempt from state pandering and prostitution laws, a 
judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Tracy, leader of the Church of the Most High Goddess, and husband, 
Will, claimed they were victims of discriminatory prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Madeline Flier denied the couple's motion for a ruling in 
their favor in their lawsuit against Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. Flier ruled that 
the Tracys had no standing to challenge the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Tracy, also known as Sabrina Aset, was convicted in 1989 of 
pandering and prostitution. She acknowledged having sex with her followers and 
receiving money, which she said was given as a church offering. 
</P>
<P>
 She served five months in jail and her husband served six months after being 
convicted of operating a house of prostitution. She said Flier's ruling 
deprived her and her husband of their religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just completely annihilates the religion, which is exactly what the 
arresting officer claimed he was going to do back in 1989," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, the Tracys claimed they could continue operating their church 
under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed by Congress last year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DWP VOTES 
TO EXTEND LOW WATER RATES INTO SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the recommendation of a panel appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan, 
the Department of Water and Power board voted Tuesday to abandon higher summer 
utility rates -- which had set off howls of protests from San Fernando Valley 
homeowners whose water bills skyrocketed under the plan implemented last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure must still be approved by the City Council and the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who were affected by the summer rate surcharge can expect to see a 
reduction of 20% in their water bills this summer compared to last year, a DWP 
spokesman said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
METROLINK EXTENDS FARE DISCOUNTS THROUGH JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a continuing earthquake relief measure, Metrolink announced Tuesday that it 
has extended a fare discount for Antelope Valley and Santa Clarita commuters 
for three more months as of April.  
</P>
<P>
 Commuters riding the Santa Clarita line from Lancaster, Palmdale and the 
Vincent Grade/Acton stations will receive a 50% discount on monthly passes, and 
commuters riding from Santa Clarita and Santa Clarita/Princessa stations 
receive a 25% discount.A monthly pass from Palmdale to Los Angeles that was 
$208 is now $112 through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effects of the earthquake are still with us. While rebuilding of the I-5 
and 14 Freeway interchange continues, by this summer commuters can count on 
Metrolink to reduce the travel time on the route by 42 minutes due to track 
improvements being made," said Larry Walker, Metrolink board chairman and San 
Bernardino County supervisor.  
</P>
<P>
 In other fare-related action, the Metrolink board reduced the ticket prices to 
Burbank from points west and north by one zone effective April 1.  
</P>
<P>
 A monthly pass from Sylmar/San Fernando to Burbank will be reduced $32; it was 
$112 and is now $80. This change also reduces fares for riders on the Ventura 
County line.  
</P>
<P>
 A monthly pass is valid for unlimited travel between the station where 
purchased and selected destinations during a calendar month. Monthly passes are 
sold during the last 10 days and first 10 days of the month. All tickets are 
good for a free one-zone transfer from Metrolink to directly connecting 
transit, including return transfers to Metrolink stations. Passes for the 
disabled and those over 65 are reduced by half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares from Burbank and Glendale to Los Angeles, or to Burbank from Los Angeles 
or the San Bernardino, Riverside and future Orange County lines do not change.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAPD REPORTS MONITORING 
60 OFFICERS FOR USE OF FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department has spent more than two years monitoring 
activities of about 60 police officers whose history of excessive force 
complaints caused commanding officers to pay special attention to their 
conduct, department officials disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those officers each had two or more instances of sustained personnel 
complaints related to excessive force, and were part of a group of more than 
100 officers who came under scrutiny in the wake of the 1991 Christopher 
Commission report. That commission -- named for co-Chairman Warren Christopher, 
now U.S. secretary of state -- examined the issue of force used by Los Angeles 
police officers after the March 3, 1991, beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that group, between 30 and 35 officers were found not to have excessive 
force problems despite having racked up two or more complaints, Cmdr. Dan 
Watson told the Police Commission Tuesday. The names of 61 others were 
forwarded to their commanding officers, who have been charged with monitoring 
their activities and reporting back to department higher-ups, Watson said. A 
few of the 61 have since left the department for a variety of reasons, leaving 
about 50 who still are under special scrutiny, Watson added. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments came as members of the Police Commission conducted their third of 
four sessions intended to assess the LAPD's compliance with the Christopher 
Commission reform proposals. Those sessions conclude next week, but already the 
reports reveal that although the department has made significant progress 
toward implementing the reforms, some proposals remain unfulfilled, partly as a 
result of budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been nearly three years since the Christopher Commission 
completed its ground-breaking analysis of the department, the issue of police 
force continues to dog the LAPD. On Tuesday, ACLU leaders questioned the 
department's use of pepper spray, a relatively new device intended to reduce 
injuries to suspects and police officers but which has been criticized in some 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Parachini, public affairs director of the Southern California chapter of 
the American Civil Liberties Union, told police commissioners that the 
organization continues to harbor concerns about the effectiveness of pepper 
spray, a cayenne pepper mixture that is supposed to immobilize suspects when it 
is sprayed into their face. He cited reports of 14 cases in California in which 
suspects were sprayed and later died.  
</P>
<P>
 Monthly reports on pepper spray use for December and January reveal that most 
of the suspects who were sprayed were black. Parachini said those statistics 
troubled him. Police Chief Willie L. Williams said department officials will 
continue monitoring the use of the spray to ensure that it is not used 
disproportionately against suspects of any ethnicity. JIM NEWTON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY SUPERVISORS SEND 
MIXED SIGNALS ON CLOSING BUDGET GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's Board of Supervisors sent a series of mixed messages 
Tuesday on how it plans to close a $900-million gap in its annual spending 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors approved a hiring freeze, but only after approving exemptions 
for seasonal and temporary workers in a wide variety of departments. 
</P>
<P>
 They approved hiring of more lifeguards for the summer season but also agreed 
to give the state a formal second notice that the county will not provide any 
lifeguard services at seven state-owned beaches, including Malibu, Manhattan 
and Point Dume, after July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors then approved a plan for the district attorney to accept 
private funding for a special real estate fraud task force but in a 
parliamentary snafu failed to muster the votes for a measure that would 
actually allow prosecutors to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the board turned back a recommendation to complete formal budget 
deliberations in time for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. The board will 
hold hearings in June but will wait until July 14 to begin its budget 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Supervisor Ed Edelman, the board said it makes more sense to wait and 
see how the state government's budget shapes up before tackling its own 
spending plan. The state, which must have its budget completed by June 1, 
provides most of the county's funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll work with it," Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said with a sigh 
after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure is mounting almost daily for the county to resolve its budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the supervisors began their meeting Tuesday, Reed issued a report 
saying the county's bond rating will probably be downgraded. She said that 
analysts with Moody's Investors Service, one of the nation's largest credit 
rating agencies, have indicated that they will downgrade the county's lease 
transactions. As a result of the expected downgrading, the interest costs on a 
$100-million capital project would rise by $120,000 in the first year alone, 
Reed reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected downgrading follows a similar downgrading of the county's general 
obligation credit last year. FREDERICK M. MUIR

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CLAREMONT; 250 PROTEST 
POSSIBLE RELEASE OF SERIAL RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 250 city leaders and residents rallied in front of City Hall on 
Tuesday evening to decry the possible release of a serial rapist into the 
college community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections plans to release Christopher Evans Hubbart on 
parole if he passes a psychological examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't release him if they are afraid for his safety. It would be unsafe 
to release him," said Kathleen Ordway, a 12-year resident, as she distributed 
papers divulging what she said was Hubbard's possible address. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials were notified last week that a serial rapist would be released 
into the community this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Hubbard was placed in a state mental hospital for seven years in 
relation to as many as 20 rapes in Los Angeles County, state officials said. 
According to papers distributed at the rally, Hubbart is believed to have raped 
as many as 50 women over a period of 20 or more years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, he was convicted of rape with force, oral copulation and five counts 
of burglary in Santa Clara County and sentenced to 16 years in prison. The next 
year he was convicted of a 1972 rape in Los Angeles County and sentenced to 
nine years, which he served concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
 Paroled in April, 1990, Hubbart was back in prison within four months on a new 
conviction and was sentenced to five years for falsely imprisoning a woman. He 
was paroled in January, but his parole agent decided to return him to custody 
after two months out of concern for his mental condition, corrections officials 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HUNTINGTON PARK; POLICE 
TO SELL STEERING WHEEL LOCKS AT CUT RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After learning that Huntington Park ranks fourth in the nation for car theft 
in cities of similar size during 1993, police are sponsoring a program to sell 
steering wheel locks at a cut rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ranks first in the state for stolen cars.Huntington Park -- once the 
car theft capital of the nation -- fell behind Newark and Livingston, N.J., and 
Fresno among cities of comparable size, according to statistics compiled by the 
National Insurance Crime Bureau, said Huntington Park Senior Officer Ramon 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner International, makers of the Club, an auto security device, will offer 
the lock to hundreds of Huntington Park residents for $29.95 Friday through 
March 26, a police spokesman said. Truck locks will be sold for $34. The 
devices usually sell for $59.95, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner International will set up shop daily at two spots in the city's 
business district: Florence and Salt Lake avenues and Pacific Boulevard and 
Clarendon Avenue, Martin said. Police are sponsoring the sales as part of the 
city's El Protector project, a program that promotes car safety to schools and 
community groups.

JUDGE ARRAIGNED IN COMPANION'S DEATH; COURTS: JURIST PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 
MANSLAUGHTER, DRUNK DRIVING AND HIT-AND-RUN CHARGES RELATED TO A FEB. 21 
ACCIDENT IN WHICH A PASSENGER IN HIS CAR WAS KILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A judge in Compton Municipal Court became a criminal defendant Tuesday when he 
was arraigned on charges that he killed his companion in a car crash while 
driving drunk, then left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Albert J. Garcia, accompanied by his lawyers, Robin J. Yanes and Johnnie 
L. Cochran Jr., pleaded not guilty to vehicular manslaughter in the death of 
Josie Smith, 35, a mother of three who allegedly had a two-year romantic 
relationship with the judge. Garcia also pleaded not guilty to charges of 
driving under the influence and hit-and-run. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Garcia left the scene of the Feb. 21 crash in Eagle Rock and 
waited nearly four hours before surrendering to police. Yanes has said the 
judge wandered away from the accident because he was in a state of shock. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges filed against Garcia are felonies; if convicted, he would face a 
maximum prison term of five years. The complaint against him contends that he 
was speeding in his Mercedes-Benz at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 At the brief hearing Tuesday, Los Angeles Municipal Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt set 
Garcia's preliminary hearing for April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Garcia and his lawyers declined to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia has been on paid leave since his arrest, said Jerry L. Johnson, 
presiding judge of the Compton court. 
</P>
<P>
 If Garcia is ordered to stand trial, he automatically will be suspended with 
pay, Johnson said. If he is convicted of a felony, the state Constitution 
requires that he be removed from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, a native of East Los Angeles, graduated in 1976 from USC's Law Center. 
He was appointed to the bench in 1986. Last year, he was the Compton court's 
assistant presiding judge. He is unopposed for reelection in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Henley, chief counsel for the California Commission on Judicial 
Performance, said she does not know of any provision that would disqualify 
Garcia from reelection because charges are pending against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the judge's arraignment Tuesday, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti told 
reporters that "it hurts" to see felony charges lodged against someone whose 
career was as promising as Garcia's. Nevertheless, Garcetti said, his office 
will prosecute the jurist "vigorously." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's sister, Angie Montes, who was at the hearing, said she was upset that 
the charges against Garcia were not more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 She contended that gross negligence should have been added to the manslaughter 
count because he allegedly was drunk at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes said her sister had hoped to wed Garcia, who is married. Montes said 
she urged her sister to break off the relationship after an altercation between 
Garcia and Smith last summer in the judge's chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the police report of that incident, Smith and Garcia had argued 
during a lunch at a San Pedro restaurant, where they ordered seven glasses of 
wine between them. The report said each had flung a drink in the other's face. 
</P>
<P>
 They then returned to the judge's chamber, where they argued again. Smith told 
police that Garcia pushed her into a bookcase, grabbed her throat, put his 
fingers in her mouth and told her: "You're messing with the wrong person." He 
called court security officers to have her removed from the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith filed a complaint with police but later dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Latin, who is prosecuting Garcia in the 
manslaughter case, declined to respond to Montes' complaint that the charges 
filed against Garcia are too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses to the accident said Garcia's car went out of control after leaving 
the Ventura Freeway near Colorado Boulevard, and then hit a post. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who authorities say was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the 
vehicle and died after landing on a concrete median.

OFFICIALS LOBBY FOR PORT-TO-L.A. TRANSIT CORRIDOR; FINANCES: MAYOR RIORDAN, 
LAWMAKERS PUT ON BIPARTISAN PUSH FOR $700 MILLION IN U.S. FUNDS FOR ALAMEDA 
CORRIDOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an impressive show of bipartisan support, California trotted out its big 
political guns Tuesday to shoot for $700 million in federal transportation 
funds to help build a proposed rail-and-truck corridor from Los Angeles and 
Long Beach harbors to the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, joined Democratic Sens. 
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and a dozen other congressional, state and 
local elected officials in appearing before a House public works subcommittee 
to promote the $1.8-billion project as a major economic boon for Southern 
California and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not only a Los Angeles and Long Beach project, but it has national 
significance from the perspective of trade," said Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San 
Jose), chairman of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation who 
will play a key role in deciding the amount of funding the project receives. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Alameda Corridor, a decade in the making, has become a top 
priority of the pro-business Riordan Administration. It is designed to greatly 
accelerate cargo shipments by loading dockside freight directly onto high-speed 
trains bound for destinations throughout the state and country. 
</P>
<P>
 It would create 10,000 construction jobs and permanent employment for 
thousands more. The streamlined delivery system would also alleviate traffic 
delays at train crossings and improve air quality in the region, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan announced Tuesday that his office negotiated an operating agreement 
last week with Santa Fe Railway, the second of three railroad companies set to 
run trains on the 20-mile corridor along Alameda Street. A similar deal, 
covering cargo fees, the sale of track, cleanup costs and operating expenses, 
was struck in December when the two ports agreed to purchase Southern Pacific 
right of way for $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he is hopeful of reaching an agreement with Union Pacific soon in 
order to begin construction next year. The corridor is scheduled for completion 
in 2001. By 2010, annual trade activity at the San Pedro Bay ports is expected 
to jump to $253 billion, compared to $116 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the corridor's $1.8-billion price tag, $535 million is already committed by 
the two ports and local, state and federal agencies. Transportation officials 
are counting on $700 million from Congress and $600 million in debt service 
supported by user fees. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, California lawmakers requested $170 million from federal fiscal 
1995 transportation funds. Although the state is well-represented with eight 
members on the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, Boxer on the 
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and Feinstein on the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, officials admit that getting the entire $170 million 
is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds like a tall order," Riordan told the subcommittee, "but I'm an 
optimist." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Riordan Administration officials said they were hoping for $110 
million in next year's budget and that they would make up the difference in 
future years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 California witnesses ticked off reasons for financing the Alameda 
Corridor, including increased trade within the Pacific Rim, reduced highway 
traffic, cleaner air, expansion of the Los Angeles-Long Beach ports and the 
survival of the shipping industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this corridor, it is my belief that we will see a megaport developed 
in Mexico and we will see the ports of Los Angeles and San Pedro obliterated," 
Feinstein warned the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) said: "This comes at a time when the 
California economy needs a shot in the arm. The Alameda Corridor is that shot 
in the arm."

GRAND JURY CALLS MICHAEL JACKSON'S MOTHER TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jackson's mother, who has steadfastly proclaimed her son's innocence 
in the face of allegations that he sexually molested a 13-year-old boy, has 
been ordered to testify before a Los Angeles County Grand Jury on Thursday 
afternoon, one of Jackson's lawyers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the years of my experience, I've never before seen the mother of the 
target of an investigation called before the grand jury," said Howard Weitzman, 
one of two lawyers representing Jackson, who has been under investigation since 
last summer."It's just done in real poor taste. It borders on harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's mother has frequently given interviews and made public appearances 
to defend her son, but a source close to the investigation said she may be 
questioned about Jackson's physical appearance. Investigators have been 
attempting to determine whether Jackson has done anything to alter his 
appearance so that it does not match a description provided to them by the 
alleged victim, who turned 14 in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said Tuesday he expects to wrap up 
the Jackson investigation within the next month or so. Although grand juries 
are meeting in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, Jackson's attorneys say 
they have been told that neither grand jury is considering an indictment, at 
least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they can issue subpoenas, grand juries often are used to elicit 
statements from witnesses who otherwise are reluctant to speak to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman said Jackson was "very, very upset" to learn that his mother had been 
called to testify. Officials from the district attorney's office declined to 
comment.

OFFICIALS NOT IN SYNC ON PROJECT FOR 'BIG A' AREA; DEVELOPMENT: DOUBTS 
EXPRESSED ON SPORTS-ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX, SUGGESTED AS A WAY TO KEEP THE RAMS 
IN TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 City officials are at odds on how fast to proceed with a proposal to build a 
sports and entertainment center around Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city staff wants to move slower than I do," Mayor Tom Daly said Tuesday 
about a conceptual plan that would link -- possibly by monorail -- Anaheim 
Stadium and Anaheim Arena to Disneyland, the Convention Center and the city's 
other tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was floated last week as a way of enticing the Los Angeles Rams to 
remain in Anaheim. But the plan, which includes a proposal for a massive retail 
district similar to CityWalk at Universal Studios, would be considered 
regardless of whether the team stays. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they want to revitalize the stadium area, but some are 
hesitant to link the area's future to negotiations with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials said they do not think the city should explore such 
concepts until the Rams specify what it will take to keep them in Anaheim. 
Additionally, some city planners say a decade-old lawsuit over development 
rights to the stadium parking lot involving the city, the Rams and the 
California Angels should be settled before the city proceeds on the sports and 
entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for such a complex, largely pushed by Daly, has created concern among 
others on the council who fear the expense of trying to accommodate the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 While the entire council supports the sports and entertainment concept, 
several members have said they are unwilling to subsidize the Rams to keep 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should give them a thing," Councilman Irv Pickler said 
Tuesday. "As far as I'm concerned, they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's negotiating staff apparently is also hesitant about making any more 
unsolicited offers to the Rams before the team has outlined what it wants from 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials have told the city they are investigating moving the team for 
the sake of greater financial opportunities. To that end, they have said that 
in May they will exercise an escape clause in their stadium lease, which would 
keep them in Anaheim through the next football season. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Daly has been seeking ways to encourage the Rams to stay and has 
met with business and political leaders throughout the county to get them to 
help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said that he believes the Rams will stay in the city if the proper 
incentives can be pieced together, but that he does not want to make 
unreasonable offers to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 How the city might finance the sports and entertainment center has not been 
addressed, city officials said, though they acknowledge that Anaheim has a good 
bond rating and could float bonds to cover the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden Corp. officials, who backed the Anaheim Arena and are partners in it 
with the city, said they would not rule out participating in a similar project 
to build a new football stadium. Ogden has not looked into such a venture, nor 
have city officials proposed it to them, an Ogden spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the city is eager to keep the team, the Rams have not said what they 
want, according to city officials. As a result, the city is worried that by 
trying to accommodate the Rams, it may risk alienating the other Anaheim 
Stadium tenant: the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-tenant arrangement has previously led to tension among the city and 
its sports franchisees and has resulted in a protracted lawsuit among them. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is a potential obstacle in the planning of the sports and 
entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute concerns development rights to a portion of the Anaheim 
Stadium parking lot that the city granted the Rams as part of the deal to lure 
them to Anaheim. The Rams organization planned to build high-rise office 
buildings on the parcel, but the Angels sued to stop the project, claiming that 
such a development would reduce the number of parking spots and adversely 
impact them and their fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the case is before a state appeals court, which is expected to 
decide the matter within the next three months.

CRIME RATE FELL IN 1993 -- EVEN IN SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid rising public concern about crime, the number of reported criminal 
offenses in the state and Orange County fell last year, state Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception was homicide, which rose 5% statewide and by a whopping 34.5% in 
Santa Ana. Elsewhere in the county, the number of homicides remained constant.  
</P>
<P>
 For most of Orange County, crime decreased between 1992 and 1993, from 2.2% in 
Orange to 13.1% in Irvine. Even in Santa Ana, despite the rising homicide rate, 
overall crime decreased 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said the general decline -- in both violent and property crimes -- was 
a reflection of the state's tougher approach to criminals in recent years, but 
he argued that there was still no cause for complacency. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the increase in murders to what he called "the culture of 
violence" -- the glamorizing of violent behavior in movies, music, video games 
and even professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three areas of Orange County included in the study, Anaheim, Huntington 
Beach and the Sheriff's Department's jurisdiction, reported overall increases 
in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The area patrolled by deputies reported a 13.4% increase in violent crime, and 
a 6.6% increase overall.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to recognize that as an increase, even if a slight one, although we 
would not recognize that as a trend or a crime pattern," said Lt. Dan Martini. 
"It's a red flag to us that we need to isolate specific areas where those 
increases are. We'll make an effort in those areas as to why these increases 
are occurring. The causes could range from coincidence to hard economic times. 
We'll look for patterns." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach reported a 7.9% overall increase in reported crime. But there 
was a dramatic 42.2% drop in reported rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise did not surprise Huntington Beach Police Department spokesman Mike 
Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected it, and anticipated it to a certain extent," Corcoran said, 
"because of our shift to community-oriented policing program. Statistical 
increases start to happen when that is put in, although it's usually temporary, 
because we're in contact with the public more, and so they report crimes more." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the numbers run contrary to the public perception that crime in 
California is on the rise -- a view that prompted speedy approval of the "three 
strikes you're out" legislation. The bill, signed into law earlier this month, 
increases prison time for felons -- most dramatically for those with repeat 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Greenwood, acting director of the RAND Corp.'s criminal justice program, 
said it is not surprising that crime is declining, even though "the fact 
contradicts the national hysteria that we're in the midst of a crime wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime rates have been falling nationwide, with California lagging somewhat 
behind the trend, Greenwood said. "The population is getting older, and that 
means crime goes down." But he also wondered whether the figures on reported 
crime reflect the difficulty in reporting less serious crimes to understaffed 
police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said he would "like to think it 
reflects the hard work and efforts of Orange County law enforcement and the 
district attorney's office. Hopefully, it is an effect of vigorous 
enforcement."  
</P>
<P>
 The figures released Tuesday are from the 63-largest law enforcement 
jurisdictions in the state -- all of them representing populations of 100,000 
or more. These agencies typically account for 65% of all reported crimes in the 
state.  
</P>
<P>
 Of all the Orange County statistics included in the report, the most dramatic 
was a 53.5% drop in reported arsons by the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Young, spokesman for the County Fire Department, which is responsible for 
investigating arsons, said: "This Fire Department has experienced a dramatic 
drop in fires since November of last year, based on the high profile of the 
firestorms. People became very safety-conscious, maybe because they were still 
wound up about it. I wish it would stay that way." Decreasing Crime Crime 
declined last year in five of Orange County's seven largest cities, with the 
biggest percentage decrease taking place in Irvine. The California Crime Index 
is the total reported violent crime (homicide, rape, robbery, assault) and 
property crime (burglary and car theft). 08,14,09,09,10,08,08,09,09 *2*Crime

INITIATIVE MAY IGNITE HOT FIGHT FOR EL TORO; MARINE BASE: AIRPORT BALLOT 
MEASURE SIGNALS THE START OF A POLITICAL SKIRMISH THAT PROMISES TO BREAK UP 
TRADITIONAL ALLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Setting the stage for perhaps one of the hottest political battles in Orange 
County's recent history, some influential business leaders Tuesday filed a 
proposed ballot measure to let voters decide whether a commercial airport 
should be developed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative -- signed by 
Newport Beach businessman George L. Argyros and Marion Knott, a partner of 
Knott's Berry Farm -- unofficially begins the campaign to collect at least 
66,703 signatures before June 1 to place the measure on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "El Toro is a regional asset that has the potential to become a 'job machine' 
if it is properly converted" to civilian use once the base is closed under 
military cutbacks, Argyros said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the filing also signals the start of a political battle that is not within 
the traditional rivalries. It does not pit Democrats against Republicans, nor 
moderates against conservatives, but instead breaks up usual political allies 
who now sharply disagree on the airport issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the 
base and who chairs the county-sanctioned El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, 
said he feels "personally saddened" that the influential business leaders, whom 
he knows, proceeded with the initiative "and not one of them has talked to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue's divisiveness is illustrated by the rancor within the politically 
powerful Lincoln Club, which was at first publicly perceived as the driving 
force behind the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But while club leaders were speaking for the ballot measure, other members -- 
particularly some living in south Orange County communities near the base -- 
grumbled that they were being railroaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Club leaders were admonished during a weekend board of directors meeting for 
working on the ballot initiative without approval by the conservative club's 
general membership or the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is some Lincoln Club directors will be involved and provide 
financial backing for the signature-gathering drive, but the club itself will 
officially remain neutral until the initiative is reviewed by members. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln Club President Doy Henley was unavailable for comment Tuesday. But 
last week, as organizers finalized plans to file the initiative, Henley said he 
supported the commercial airport proposal but would not be involved in the 
campaign because it is not sanctioned by the club's membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are members of the Lincoln Club that are going to be involved . . . 
some of our members will be up to their eyeballs in this, and there will be 
some of our members maybe on the other side," Henley said. "As president of the 
club, I am going to do my job, which is to keep them all in the club." 
</P>
<P>
 And the dispute goes beyond the confines of the political organization. 
Business and industry groups, which are participating in the county planning 
process for the base, are assessing the political consequences of the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, city leaders in north Orange County, who generally favor an airport, are 
expected to square off against South County officials who fear a commercial 
airport will ruin their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle lines have clearly been drawn between those who advocate a 
rational, analytical approach and those who have predetermined El Toro's use 
and who are interested in furthering their financial gains," said Laguna Hills 
Councilwoman Melody Carruth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carruth conceded there is no evidence that the business leaders involved in 
the initiative will personally gain from development at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign for the ballot measure will be funded through a group called 
Committee for 21,000 New Jobs, a reference to the expansion in the local 
economy that petition organizers believe will occur if a passenger and cargo 
airport is built at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed initiative asks voters to approve an amendment to the county's 
General Plan that would require a civilian airport on about 2,000 acres of the 
4,700-acre base, and seeks interim use of the runways by air cargo carriers 
while the Marine Corps phases out its mission by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also proposes replacing the county's El Toro planning agency with 
a 13-member advisory commission that would make redevelopment recommendations 
to the county supervisors, who would then have final decision-making authority 
over the remaining land not used for an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ballot measure is approved, it cannot be changed unless another public 
vote is held. But the sponsors acknowledge that the development of an airport 
is a complex process and are offering some flexibility, allowing the measure to 
be amended if a federal or state agency denies airport use, or under other 
specific conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-page proposal contains the arguments the airport proponents are 
expected to use during the campaign, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * An airport at El Toro would create 21,000 "high paying new jobs" and 
increase business revenue in Orange County by about $1.7 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * An estimated 375,000 tons of air cargo business is lost every year to Los 
Angeles International Airport and Ontario International Airport because the 
county's facility, John Wayne Airport, cannot accommodate the air cargo 
industry. Also, about 4 million passengers go to other airports each year 
because John Wayne is legally limited, because of size and as part of a federal 
court settlement, to 8.4 million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Toro's existing runways can be made available in times of national 
emergency or for natural disaster preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has lost more than 122,000 jobs since 1990. Our construction 
industry is flat, real estate is depressed, our aerospace industry is suffering 
from severe defense-related cutbacks," according to Argyros' statement. "To 
turn this trend around and provide a strong economy for future generations, we 
must seize upon the opportunity that El Toro presents." 
</P>
<P>
 But Riley responded that the county also is looking to create new jobs. "Do 
they think that what we are going to do won't do that?" Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors rejected the idea of an initiative last week, arguing it 
would be premature to hold an election before an El Toro planning agency has 
time to study the redevelopment options for the base. The agency consists of 
the supervisors, three Irvine council members and a Lake Forest council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Carruth agreed with Riley. "Do they think it's the intention of the (planning 
agency) to establish a 4,700-acre park?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to the head of the Lincoln Club, Assemblyman Bill Morrow 
(R-Oceanside) also argued against the airport campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow said "it would be disheartening to see so much effort and so many 
dollars diverted" away from the club's traditional goal of electing a 
Republican majority to the state Legislature.

TWO SENIORS HIT, KILLED BY PICKUP TRUCK; TRAGEDY: COSTA MESA HAD PLANS FOR 
TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT BUSY CROSSWALK WHERE ACCIDENT HAPPENED, BUT OTHER JOBS HAD 
PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Two senior citizens were killed early Tuesday when a pickup truck plowed into 
them as they crossed a busy intersection that was slated for a traffic signal a 
year ago but has yet to receive one. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 6:20 a.m. at the troublesome T-intersection at 
Meyer Place and West 19th Street, where a 25-year-old woman was seriously 
injured by a car in October, 1990. That accident resulted in a $400,000 lawsuit 
against the city, which is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they had been planning to install a traffic signal at the 
junction but had not done so because of other higher priority projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's tragedy happened as Fred B. Young and Patricia E. Crowell, both 78, 
and their friend Madeleine Baebler), 87, were returning home to Bethel Towers 
retirement center after their morning breakfast ritual -- hot cakes and sausage 
at McDonald's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 They stepped into the marked crosswalk apparently unseen by a 25-year-old 
driver, who was driving east on West 19th Street in a pickup truck, police 
said. According to investigators, he had moved into the fast lane to pass a car 
that had slowed down at the approach to the crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't even see the pedestrians because the sun was in his eyes," 
said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Jim Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact knocked Crowell out of her white tennis shoes, propelling her about 
50 feet. Young was flung about 70 feet. Both suffered massive internal injuries 
and were taken to local hospitals, where they were pronounced dead soon after 
arrival. Baebler, who had crossed ahead of them, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrella Bugarin, 51, of Costa Mesa, who was working at the drive-through 
window at McDonald's, called 911 when she saw what had happened. "I almost 
cried," she said. "Every morning they were here. . . . They were very, very 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are not sure how fast the driver, who was on his way to work, 
was traveling in the 35-m.p.h. zone. There were no skid marks, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver was questioned and released, Costa Mesa police spokesman George 
Wilson said, adding that the case will be referred to the district attorney's 
office to determine whether misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter charges should 
be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Baebler, who said she met Young and Crowell in the Bethel Towers lobby each 
morning at 5:45 a.m. for their walk to McDonald's, was in a state of shock 
after the accident. "All I can see is them lying there," she said. "Everybody 
thinks it's a miracle that I got over." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident weighed heavy on the minds of residents of the 18-story Bethel 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were family, they were loved members," said Judith Weatherspoon, Bethel 
Towers administrator. "It affects us deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends described Young as a "perfect gentleman" who was quick to help female 
friends down curbs and accompany them on errands to make sure they would be 
safe.  
</P>
<P>
 Young's daughter, Cassandra Randall of Fountain Valley, said her father, a 
quiet man, often reminisced about the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just loved the days when everything was going smooth, before it became 
chaotic," Randall said tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father was a prizefighter for 15 years in the 1930s, said Randall. His 
fights would take him to San Bernardino and to Oakland and other towns in the 
Bay Area, where he later lived with his wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young was the oldest of 21 children and helped paint the Golden Gate Bridge 
when it was constructed in the mid-1930s, Randall said. He was also a 
self-taught cook and had worked at the prestigious Mark Hopkins Hotel in San 
Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 Randall said her father worked a lot of side jobs, but his favorite was as a 
chef. She recalled him telling stories of how he worked at the Bohemian Grove, 
where he said he once cooked for the President and other dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Services for Young will be held at the San Bruno Funeral Home in San Bruno, 
Calif., on Thursday, Randall said. He will be buried beside his wife at Olivet 
Memorial Park in Colma. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell, known fondly as "Cookie," had worked part time at Mother's Market and 
Kitchen in Costa Mesa for the last 12 years. She was a shareholder in the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just loved Mother's and she would tell us so many times that she would 
pay us to work here," said Jill Ricker, manager of the market's restaurant. 
"She was the easiest person to love. I'm just devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of her husband many years ago and the deaths of other loved ones had 
taken a toll on Crowell. But colleagues said she was a strong person, "young at 
heart," and always had a hug and kiss for friends. In a recent biography for a 
Mother's Market photo album, she described herself as "vibrant and very 
friendly" and said she liked to attend "self-help seminars, go to movies and 
eat at great restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was our senior mother," said Bruce Macgurn, chief executive officer of 
the market. "She had so many friends. She was such a great ambassador for 
Mother's." 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements for Crowell were pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Bethel Towers said they have been asking the city to put a 
stoplight at the Meyer Place-19th Street intersection for several years. Some 
residents said they are afraid to cross the busy street as they try to reach 
the nearby Costa Mesa Senior Center, restaurants and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last May approved $140,000 to install a traffic light at the 
intersection, but the project was not scheduled to get under way until July of 
this year because of a lack of funds and other, more pressing priorities, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they could not immediately provide a list of injury 
accidents at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 However, according to court records, Consuelo Acevez of Costa Mesa was hit by 
a car in the crosswalk after eating at McDonald's in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Acevez remained in a coma for nearly three weeks, according to her attorney, 
Kevin Hayden. She filed suit against the city, alleging that the crosswalk was 
poorly marked, resulting in a dangerous condition. 
</P>
<P>
 City transportation director Peter Naghavi said the intersection is on a list 
of a dozen that need stop lights because of heavy traffic. However, he said, 
until recently the city did not have the money to erect a signal light at Meyer 
Place, near Costa Mesa's state Department of Motor Vehicles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the money was finally approved by the council, he said, officials had 
not yet put the project out for bid because of the lengthy state and local 
approval process and a heavy workload. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tons of other projects that we are going through with," Naghavi said. 
"This isn't the only one. Each one has its own priorities and process that we 
go through." Fatal Crosswalk The Costa Mesa crosswalk where an elderly couple 
were fatally struck by a pickup truck Tuesday has no traffic signals or stop 
signs. The City Council recently approved the installation of a signal for this 
crossing.

BOWLING ALLEY MAY FADE INTO MEMORY; SPORTS: CORBIN BOWL COULD REOPEN IF QUAKE 
REPAIRS ARE MADE. OTHER LANES ALSO FACE PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 Tuesday was the day to pick up a pink bowling ball at the Corbin Bowl, a San 
Fernando Valley landmark and movie industry hangout since the Eisenhower era, 
which suffered structural damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With the future of the bowling alley on Ventura Boulevard in Tarzana 
uncertain, its operator, Allen Shaw, took leave of the business for good 
Tuesday, giving employees farewell hugs and auctioning off the 1950s-era 
jukeboxes, pink bowling balls and light fixtures he has collected since he 
leased the place in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he was unable to reach agreement with the building's owner on the 
higher rent the owner says is needed to pay for $250,000 in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure exemplified problems affecting local bowling alleys, strained by 
the triple threat of earthquake damage, rising real estate values and what some 
say is a decline in interest in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corbin Bowl opened in 1959. Over the years, it was used as a set for 
television shows, including episodes of "Quincy" and "Moonlighting," and was 
popular for cast parties, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The business has always been a good one, he said. But after the structure 
sagged in the quake, he was unable to negotiate a new lease with the building's 
owner, Jack Calig, who said Shaw's rent was too low, even before the need for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he is heading for Hawaii to begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 Calig said he hopes to get the building repaired and reopened for bowling by 
summer, but added that if he gets a good offer to sell the property, the lanes 
may close for good. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, the Corbin Bowl will become one of many bowling alleys in the 
region that have faded into memory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, scores of bowling lanes have been lost in the San Fernando 
Valley as establishments in Encino, Panorama City and elsewhere shut down, 
Calig said. Industry experts say the problem is that bowling is a comparatively 
low-rent enterprise easily nudged out by more profitable retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think bowling alleys make a lot of money, but it's a high-expense 
industry," said Warren Flanigan, regional vice president of Brunswick 
Recreation Centers, a bowling center chain. "Per square foot, a grocery store 
is worth much more." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake was another blow to bowling. The temblor damaged most of the 13 
bowling centers in the San Fernando, Simi and Santa Clarita valleys, and 
resulted in the temporary closure of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Christi, general manager of The Sports Center in Studio City, who came to 
watch the bidding on Corbin Bowl artifacts, estimated that the earthquake 
deprived about 5,000 league bowlers of their usual haunts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of those people will stop bowling," he predicted glumly. 
</P>
<P>
 There are signs that the number of bowlers was already in decline before the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the San Fernando Valley Women's Bowling Assn. and the Los Angeles Bowling 
Assn., which has mostly male members, report dwindling membership numbers in 
recent years, followed by an especially sharp dive after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can't afford it, or their children have other activities," said 
Charlene Eton, secretary of the women's association, which is down to about 
7,000 members, a drop of 1,000 since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan of Brunswick said bowling industry leaders have struggled for years 
with the question of how to revive their industry as a staple of middle-class 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Their soul-searching has produced the newest image-revision for the sport: No 
longer are their businesses "bowling alleys." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got a very negative connotation," Flanigan said. "Ask someone what a 
bowling alley is and they will say it's dark and dingy, with people spitting on 
the floors." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bowling center" -- or better yet, the prim "recreation/entertainment center" 
-- are now preferred, said Shaw of the Corbin Bowl. Bowling company executives 
hope the promise of better lighting, less smoking and a more family oriented 
atmosphere will help keep the sport on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Calig said he still has high hopes he can restore the Corbin Bowl facility for 
use as a bowling center. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is for lease, and a new bowling alley operator might be able to 
move in by June, Calig said. He is even considering operating the bowling alley 
himself, perhaps employing a Las Vegas-style decor. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other bowling alley owners managed to clean out the remains of 
Shaw's business. 
</P>
<P>
 In brisk succession, the auctioneer sold the Wurlitzer jukebox for $3,000, a 
1950s-era Coke machine for $950 and a gasoline pump for $900. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale saddened some bowlers, though 1950s nostalgia didn't seem to be the 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Eton of the women's association said she would miss the unique lane 
surface at the Corbin Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed the people that worked there, I will miss them," she added.

BUILDING OWNERS GET REPAIR NOTICES; CONSTRUCTION: CITY CAN DEMOLISH THE MOST 
SEVERELY DAMAGED 'RED-TAGGED' SITES IF WORK ISN'T DONE IN 30 DAYS. MOST ARE IN 
VALLEY.

<P>
 The owners of buildings severely damaged in the Northridge quake have been 
sent notices that repairs must be completed in 30 days or the city of Los 
Angeles may demolish the building, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Building and Safety Department has issued 361 "emergency abatement" 
notices since March 7, requiring the owners of the most severely damaged 
"red-tagged" buildings to obtain repair permits within 10 days and complete 
repairs within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 A city official said about 60% of those red-tagged buildings are located in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has the authority to demolish a building that is deemed a 
public hazard, Phil Kaainoa, assistant bureau chief for community safety, said 
that property owners will be given an opportunity to request an extension on 
the deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, hearings are automatically scheduled before building and safety 
officials 15 days after the notices are mailed to give property owners a chance 
to discuss any problems they have in meeting the deadlines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The length of these extensions are decided on a case-by-case basis, Kaainoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city demolishes a building, the cost will either be paid by the 
property owner's insurance or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Faller, president of the Apartment Owners Assn. of Southern California, 
said the deadline seemed too short, but so far he has heard no complaints from 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 David Fleming, a member of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., said he has 
heard some grumbling from business owners about the 30-day deadline but expects 
that the complaints will grow louder as the deadline approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is in the process of sending out repair notices to owners of other 
"red-tagged" buildings that do not pose an immediate threat to public safety. 
Those buildings must have repair permits within 30 days and repairs completed 
within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a team of about 50 building inspectors began to re-evaluate those 
damaged buildings that were "yellow-tagged" or restricted to limited entry. 
Kaainoa said it is likely that some "yellow-tagged" buildings will be declared 
unsafe and issued a "red tag" after the reinspection, but others may be 
declared safe and issued a "green tag."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CHP TO LOOK AT SHERIFF'S UNIT CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities are investigating a collision Tuesday morning) between an Orange 
County sheriff's patrol unit that was on its way to an accident and a vehicle 
driven by an 86-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sheriff's Sgt. Jerry Carlsen and Laguna Hills resident Dorothy England 
were sent to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, treated 
for minor bruises and cuts, then released shortly after the accident, which 
occurred at the busy intersection of Alicia and Moulton parkways at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both got off with bumps and bruises," said sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan 
Martini."They're going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsen, who is assigned to the city of Mission Viejo, was on his way to an 
accident scene when the collision took place. 
</P>
<P>
 As routinely occurs when a sheriff's vehicle is involved in an accident, the 
California Highway Patrol has been asked to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokesman Bruce Lian said initial reports indicate that England may have 
run a red light and hit the patrol car on the passenger side. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "our reports are still very preliminary," Lian said. "We're still 
looking into the cause of the accident." FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; POLICE ROUSE SUSPECT AFTER CAR CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man suspected of stealing a car was arrested early Tuesday after SWAT team 
members had to rouse him after a car chase that began in Hawthorne, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Patrick Gildea said he doesn't know if the suspect, Michael R. 
Randall, 36, fell asleep when he stopped the car on the 18000 block of 
Patterson Lane about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Gildea said Randall refused to step out of the car or even to speak to 
pursuing officers.Assuming the suspect had a weapon, the officers summoned the 
SWAT team, which had no luck communicating with the suspect either, the 
lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the guy was unconscious or something because we didn't get a 
response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SWAT team threw two "flash" grenades at the car, hoping to get the 
suspect's attention, Gildea said. Randall finally opened the passenger door for 
the officers and he was arrested on suspicion of auto theft, evading arrest and 
drunk driving, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the CHP, the car chase started in Hawthorne, went through West 
Los Angeles and the South Bay before entering Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The car had been reported stolen in Huntington Beach on Feb. 21, Gildea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall was taken to Pacifica Community Hospital for evaluation and later 
booked at the Huntington Beach city jail, he said.FERNANDO ROMERO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; IN THIS COURT, TEEN-AGERS ARE JUDGED BY PEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody understands a teen-ager quite like a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the philosophy 17-year-old Jaime B. embraced after being arrested last 
month for breaking windows while skipping school. The Sylmar teen-ager chose 
Teen Court over Juvenile Court, agreeing to allow a jury of her peers to 
determine her fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened with a heavy sentence -- including 150 hours of community service, an 
assignment to write a one-page essay and instructions to check in with a 
counselor at school every day -- Jaime walked out of the wood-paneled courtroom 
at James Monroe High School on Tuesday, still convinced she made the right 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to talk to teen-agers than adults," Jaime said. "I'd rather go 
through this than (Juvenile Court). They probably have friends that went 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a program begun last year at Wilson High School in Los Angeles, 
Jaime was one of four first-time juvenile criminal offenders to face their 
peers in the courtroom at Monroe's law and government magnet program Tuesday. 
The school has hosted the proceedings about every other week since February. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury of six students listened to each defendant's testimony, asked 
questions, then handed down a punishment they deemed appropriate, which then 
had to be approved by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Jaime R. Corral, who started Teen Court in Los Angeles 
County, said he hopes to expand it to two more schools this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an educational process for everyone," Corral said. "It's a form of peer 
counseling and peer pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in Odessa, Tex., in 1983, Teen Court has expanded to at least 10 
states, including California. It is the subject for a television program set up 
by Group W Television, a division of the Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., which 
videotaped a pilot for a proposed show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think like each other," said Robin Ramey, 16, who was the jury forewoman 
in Jamie's case. "We know how people get out of things and into things. We are 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Under what is called diversion assigned by her peers, if Jamie adheres to the 
punishment, stays in school and out of trouble for six months, her record will 
be clean. A sentence handed down by a Juvenile Court usually remains on the 
offender's record. SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; ATTENDANCE UP AT YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attendance at Monterey High School -- for students and teachers -- has 
improved so much since a year-round schedule began a year ago that officials 
want to continue the experiment for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, district officials say they are still not sure whether the new 
schedule -- in which nine weeks of school are followed by three weeks off -- 
has hurt or helped student performance.Preliminary information shows that the 
amount of work that students at the continuation high school finish had fallen 
short of expectations in November, Monterey Principal Pamela Feix said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey High School is for students who fall in a variety of at-risk 
categories, including pregnant teen-agers and teen-age parents, and others who 
have trouble coping with larger school populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest complaint we had from this year's students was they were out too 
long at Christmas, which was for four weeks," Feix said, explaining that the 
students appreciate having the school open because it helps them with a wide 
range of the problems they have in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other students seem to appreciate having something to do in the summer," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new schedule has helped with faculty attendance because the schedule 
provides routine breaks that can relieve stress for teachers, who work 
one-on-one with the students instead of in a traditional classroom, Feix said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; BAR SUSPENDS LAWYER CONVICTED OF FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Bar of California has temporarily suspended a Canoga Park attorney 
who was convicted on criminal racketeering and mail fraud charges after 
spending months in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Boyd Stites, 49, was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison Jan. 13 
for masterminding "the Alliance" insurance fraud, which ended in the conviction 
of 13 lawyers in one of the largest such prosecutions in U. S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Bar will consider permanent disciplinary measures against Stites 
within three to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Canoga Park lawyer was convicted of embezzlement and a dozen counts 
of mail fraud for violations including illegally manipulating cases in which 
his clients received legal fees from insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was indicted, Stites went into hiding for more than 2 1/2 years. 
During that period, he proposed to two women under assumed names and spent 
large amounts of cash on ski vacations and yacht purchases. He was caught in an 
Illinois speed trap in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bar also temporarily suspended James Steven Carroll, 42, who admitted to 
the nation's largest-ever embezzlement of legal services funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll was sentenced to 21 months in prison on Dec. 14, after stealing more 
than $260,000 from the San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services, where 
he was the director, to sustain a gambling habit. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned from the Pacoima center in July, 1992, after admitting to bilking 
the 26-year-old agency that serves about 12,000 poor people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Bar may prohibit lawyers from practicing if they have been convicted 
of crimes involving "moral turpitude," said spokeswoman Kim McCready. The Bar's 
own legal panel will decide the cases of Stites and Carroll within three to 
eight months, she said. KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY SUES TO BAR NUDE THEATER, TOPLESS BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has filed a lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction against the 
owner of Paddy Murphy's topless bar in Santa Ana, who wants to open a similar 
bar in Newport Beach near John Wayne Airport.  
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court seeks to stop An Nguyen from 
opening a topless bar because it will include private theaters where customers 
can watch nude dancing.Theaters are barred from that area under the local 
zoning code, said city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 On that basis, the City Council last month voted to reject Nguyen's 
application for a live entertainment permit for the establishment, which would 
be called Mermaids and would serve alcohol and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that vote, Nguyen has continued renovating the business. His attorney, 
Ron Talmo, said Nguyen does indeed plan to open the club despite the city's 
objections. Talmo also said his client will challenge the city's rejection of 
the permits.  
</P>
<P>
 Talmo has maintained that city officials can't prevent the opening of Mermaids 
just because they don't want an adult entertainment business in the city. As 
long as Mermaids is in compliance with local ordinances, it has a right to do 
business, Talmo has said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent meeting with city officials, Nguyen has agreed not to open the 
club before the March 29 court hearing date.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; EARTH FIRST! ACTIVISTS PROTEST FOR MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earth First! demonstrators took their continuing protest against toll road 
construction to South Municipal Court on Monday as a fellow activist pleaded 
not guilty to charges stemming from a demonstration last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Walter Beneville, 27, of Santa Ana was arrested Friday more than 24 
hours after climbing atop a 200-foot-high crane at a Foothill tollway 
construction site in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneville, whom demonstrators dubbed a "political prisoner," pleaded not 
guilty to misdemeanor charges of trespassing, tampering with a vehicle and 
obstructing an arrest. He had been held in custody on $10,000 bail, but was 
released on his own recognizance after the arraignment, according to a court 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courthouse on Crown Valley Parkway, about 20 activists 
demonstrated peacefully in support of Beneville and against the three tollways 
planned by the Transportation Corridor Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists say the toll roads planned by the Transportation Corridor Agencies 
threaten to destroy endangered ecosystems and Native American cultural sites. 
They demanded that the state attorney general investigate the TCA. 
</P>
<P>
 TCA spokeswoman Lisa Telles had no comment to the demonstrators' demand for an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The action last week was the second time in little more than a month that 
Earth First! activists disrupted operations along the Foothill tollway, which 
is set to run through eastern Orange County between the Riverside Freeway and 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 In late September, eight activists were arrested on suspicion of trespassing 
when they chained themselves to bulldozers at a San Joaquin Hills tollway 
construction site in Laguna Niguel. The San Joaquin Hills project is scheduled 
to connect Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano to the Corona del Mar freeway in 
Newport Beach by March, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Trials are still pending from the San Joaquin Hills demonstration. Beneville 
faces a trial on April 19. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY DELAYS VOTE ON WATER DISTRICT SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A divided City Council has voted to delay for six months a decision on whether 
to break off from the Los Alamitos County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's 3-2 vote means that an application to the Local Agency Formation 
Commission, which would have started the process of separating from the water 
district, will not be considered by the council again until October, officials 
said. Under that plan, the city government would take over sewer services 
within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm puzzled and frustrated," said Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi, who wanted to 
file the application immediately. "Nothing will change in six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Charles E. Sylvia, whose wife, Carolyn, began the effort to 
persuade the council to break away from the water district, also voted to file 
the application right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of a separate sewer system say that it would save taxpayers money 
and increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 But a council majority insisted that water district officials be given time to 
present a long-term plan for repairs and replacement of the 54 miles of sewer 
lines that link households in Los Alamitos, Rossmoor and portions of Seal Beach 
and Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is heated right now," said Councilman Ronald Bates, adding that 
the issue of breaking away from the water district after 42 years has divided 
the community. "We need to step back and give the (water district) board the 
courtesy to devise a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Alice Jempsa and Robert P. Wahlstrom joined Bates in voting to 
delay the LAFCO application, which would allow the district to consider ways of 
operating at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome the council's action," said Jack Rosenthal, president of the 
five-member water district board. "I think it's going to save taxpayers money. 
It would be extremely costly to go through what they were planning to do." 
</P>
<P>
 An application to LAFCO would cost the city $5,000. In addition, there would 
be legal and other expenses in preparing the applications, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal said that the current system runs efficiently and at a reasonable 
cost. But he said that in the next six months, the water district will examine 
its operations, seeking ways to raise more money for future replacement and 
repair of aging sewer lines. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY STRIKES DEAL ON ANIMAL CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who wish to report lost or stray pets or animal cruelty or who have 
questions about dog licenses can now call La Habra Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of La Habra has begun providing Buena Park with animal control 
services instead of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 However, stray pets will continue to be delivered to the Orange County Animal 
Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Buena Park resident suspects that their stray pet may have been picked up 
by animal-control officers, they should first call La Habra Animal Control. La 
Habra Animal Control will be able to confirm if the pet is in their care.  
</P>
<P>
 The city decided to contract with La Habra as a cost-saving measure.  
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Animal Control can be reached at (714) 562-3647.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; BOARD VOTES 3 TO 2 TO DEMOLISH STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank Parks and Recreation Board has voted to tear down Olive Memorial 
Stadium, a 47-year-old baseball stadium once used for the St. Louis Browns' 
tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Terre Hirsch, an advocate for the stadium, voted against the 
board action because it gave no provision for replacing the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member John Dominguez also dissented in the 3-2 vote, which was taken 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A special committee had recommended that the city tear down the facility and 
replace it with a modern one better suited to meet the needs of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium has been closed in recent years for safety reasons, and while city 
officials have long considered tearing it down, there has been some opposition 
from the public, especially those who remember the heyday of the building when 
major league legends such as Satchel Paige, Bobby Thompson and others once 
played there. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the site of professional football tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to get rid of it because it doesn't look good, is not a good reason to 
demolish it," Hirsch said. "The problem was that it didn't meet the full needs 
of the parks and recreation program." 
</P>
<P>
 As a baseball facility in a city that had a growing interest in softball, the 
usefulness of the stadium had declined in recent years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hirsch had fought for the stadium because of what it had meant to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be a lot of people who will be saddened to see a piece of 
Burbank history disappear by the way of a wrecking ball," Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the stadium will ultimately be determined by a vote of the City 
Council, which has not been scheduled yet. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DEPUTIES, COUNTY REACH WAGE ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies Tuesday reached a tentative labor agreement 
with the county, perhaps ending an eight-month-long contract dispute over wages 
and benefits that was marked by two "blue-flu" demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, details of which were not immediately disclosed, must be 
ratified in a vote of the 1,300-member Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Association General Manager Robert MacLeod said a vote would be scheduled for 
either Friday or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bout of "flu" had been set for Thursday at the Intake/Release Center 
and James A. Musick Branch Jail, but MacLeod said those protests would be 
canceled because of the tentative agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither MacLeod nor county negotiators would discuss contract details, 
although deputies had been asking for a three-year pact, with 3.5% pay 
increases for the second and third years. The association was not seeking a 
raise in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county reportedly had offered 3% raises for the second and third years, 
and was not sufficiently funding medical and other types of benefits for the 
officers, the association general manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this for 20 years and at some point during each negotiation 
all of it comes together," MacLeod said. "But I'm never happy until it's 
ratified." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies have been working without a contract since last October and 
negotiators from the county and association have been meeting since Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Davis, county chief of employee relations, acknowledged the negotiations 
were lengthy, but that is not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every reason to expect that it will be ratified," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Tuesday, association officials had promised to stage protests, with 
deputies calling in sick each week until the county improved its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 36 deputies called in sick for their various assignments at the 
Central Men's Jail and at the department's professional standards division. 
Before that, 20 officers participated in a "blue-flu" during a day shift at the 
department's North Division, which includes the communities of Rossmoor, Midway 
City and Lemon Heights. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; INNOVATIVE SCHOOL OFFICIAL HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To improve the schools in the Brea Olinda Unified School District, Supt. Edgar 
Z. Seal has always been willing to take bold steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after being hired in 1982, he shook up the administration at Brea 
Junior High School, replacing the principal and two counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, though he faced opposition from employees, Seal changed the 
counseling system at Brea Olinda High School, assigning the disciplining of 
students to the same counselors who already were advising the youths on 
personal and academic issues. Most teachers and counselors who once opposed the 
plan now favor it. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal, 59, was also the major force behind creating an Orange County region of 
the California Interscholastic Federation, or CIF. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal, who is retiring in June, has now been recognized by his county 
colleagues for his achievements. The local chapter of the Assn. of California 
School Administrators unanimously voted earlier this year to name him Orange 
County's "Superintendent of the Year." He is also a contender for California's 
"Superintendent of the Year," which will be announced sometime in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Unified School District Supt. David L. Andrews, chairman of an ACSA 
committee that nominated Seal for the award, called him "a respected leader 
who's not afraid to do what needs to be done to help kids because he cares 
about kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Seal transformed the district during his 12-year career. Before he came, 
teachers and principals didn't pitch innovative ideas for fear of losing their 
jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morale and trust was very low because there was little if any support from 
the district office," Seal recalled. "That distrust permeated throughout the 
community and parents were threatening to take their kids to private schools, 
so I had to make" dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be a risk-taker to be successful," he said. "If you're not taking 
a risk to help kids improve, then you're not doing your job." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he took over the district's top post, Seal implemented the Business 
Education Task Force. Among other things, the task force -- mostly composed of 
Brea Chamber of Commerce members -- provides schools with books, computers and 
other badly needed classroom equipment. In addition, the committee sends 
professionals to campus career fairs to talk about their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has helped develop programs to improve the district's curriculum, such 
as a computer system being installed at Brea Olinda High that allows students 
to tap into nationwide information networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal has always pushed innovation and experimentation. Several years ago, 
teachers at Brea Junior High started a program of team teaching that has proved 
so successful it is now done districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, Laurel Elementary School Principal Tim Harvey was given 
permission to test a program to teach all students conversational Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every innovative or new idea, (Seal) has always been encouraging," Harvey 
said.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TEEN'S GUN, WOMAN'S DEATH MAY BE LINKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are investigating the possibility that a teen-age boy arrested Monday 
afternoon for threatening an officer with a gun may be linked to the weekend 
slaying of a 55-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified 15-year-old boy was arrested about 4:30 p.m. after a police 
officer involved in a narcotics investigation questioned him at a shopping 
center in the 400 block of West 17th Street. The youth's name is being withheld 
because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is about four blocks north of the apartment complex in the 300 block 
of West Washington Avenue where Valentina Roque was shot once in the chest 
Sunday night as she watched the street from a balcony of the second-floor 
apartment she occupied with her son and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy took a gun out of his waistband and pointed it at the officer, who 
grabbed the weapon and wrestled the boy to the ground. Police Sgt. Bob Clark 
said the boy's gun, which is the same small-caliber handgun as the one used in 
the shooting, aroused suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said investigators want to know if the gun and the boy were involved in the 
shooting. Clark declined to specify the gun's caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth is being held at Juvenile Hall on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon and brandishing a weapon, Sgt. Clark said. No hearing has been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive has been established for Roque's slaying, which police are 
continuing to investigate. Neighbors have said the area around the complex is 
frequented by drug dealers and gang members and speculated that the victim 
might have witnessed a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the woman, who had moved here from Mexico just eight months ago, 
gathered Tuesday at her apartment to grieve. Her body, said the woman's son, 
Santos Alvarez Roque, will be released by the county coroner's office Thursday 
or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Alvarez said, the family is organizing her funeral. Alvarez 
said he is preparing to move his wife and small child out of the apartment 
where his mother was killed.  
</P>
<P>
 "This apartment will bring me only memories of her, and I find that 
unbearable," he said. "We have to move away, perhaps to back to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez said he had been informed of the boy's arrest Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's the killer, I don't want to see his face. I am a Catholic and believe 
that whomever did this will pay before God," he said. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; STUDENT LOSES BID TO RE-ENTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Anaheim Hills boy who was forced to leave Canyon High School for 
distributing an underground newspaper was denied a chance Tuesday to return to 
school while awaiting trial next month on a lawsuit challenging his 
"involuntary transfer." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Dennis S. Choate refused to grant an order 
allowing 12th-grader Raihan Kadri to re-enroll at Canyon High. Instead, Kadri, 
who was scheduled to graduate in June, must now find another school, said his 
father, Dr. Zain Kadri, a plastic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Choate said the case raises critical issues regarding the First and 14th 
Amendments. However, he disagreed with claims made by Kadri's attorney, Jack A. 
Fleischli of Irvine, that the boy would suffer "irreparable harm" to his 
academic progress if he were to attend another school so late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Kadri, an honor student, created and distributed 400 copies of 
"The Exploited," a six-page newspaper that school administrators said made 
"obscene" and "defamatory" remarks about school employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadri was suspended for three days for "distribution and possession of a 
slanderous publication" and later forced to transfer after a disciplinary board 
ruled that his presence on campus would "disrupt the educational process," a 
district spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadri was told he could transfer to Orange High. Instead, he filed suit 
against the Orange Unified School District in an effort to get back to Canyon 
High. He has not attended school since. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon High Principal Ralph Jameson said the newspaper launched "slanderous 
and obscene" attacks against five teachers and administrators. One cartoon 
depicts writing on a bathroom wall about a teacher's sexuality. In another 
case, a teacher's weight was made fun of and a male teacher was referred to as 
a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written apology in which he quoted Henry David Thoreau, Kadri said he 
"never tried to cause problems or encourage bad things." His reason for 
creating the newspaper, he said, was to elevate the "repressed" and 
"convoluted" minds at the school by expressing new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's hearing, Fleischli told the judge that the "continuity" of 
his client's education would be disrupted. He said Kadri is enrolled in four 
advanced placement courses and two special international programs offered only 
at Canyon.  
</P>
<P>
 To be away from his teachers would jeopardize Kadri's final exam performance 
in two months, Fleischli argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said high school students transfer every day for various 
reasons, and though it might be inconvenient, a transfer does not mean his 
education will be ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Choate will hear evidence to determine if Kadri should be 
permanently barred from Canyon High. E.J. GONG JR.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COMMISSION HONORS BURN CENTER DIRECTOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Fire Commissioners on Tuesday honored the director of 
the Sherman Oaks Burn Center for helping save the lives of five firefighters 
during last fall's blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely comforting to know that that center is there with all the most 
up-to-date equipment and expertise," said Fire Commission President Beth 
Lowe."They deserve our thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission presented Burn Center President Dr. Richard Grossman with a 
plaque at its regular meeting Tuesday morning at Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman was quick to praise his staff of 53 nurses, as well as the 
firefighters of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "These firefighters are out there protecting human lives every day," he said. 
"It's wonderful to be able to do something in return." KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: METROLINK CUTS FARE FOR BURBANK TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metrolink officials Tuesday announced fare reductions beginning next month for 
Burbank-bound passengers from the western San Fernando Valley and Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Burbank stop has turned out to be a destination point second only 
to Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles, officials said they would shift 
Burbank into a closer fare zone for passengers from the west, bringing down the 
price of monthly passes by $32 across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank was viewed as a boarding station, not a destination. It's right on 
the edge of the zone, so (initially) we said we'd leave it grouped with 
Glendale and Los Angeles," said Metrolink spokesman Brendan Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the consistent use of Burbank as a final stop for many riders, 
Metrolink officials decided to cut prices by grouping Burbank and the Van Nuys 
station in the same zone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the fare reductions on monthly passes, which go on sale Monday, 
prices have also been scaled back on single tickets and 10-trip tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares between Burbank and Los Angeles will remain the same. HENRY CHU

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHADOW HILLS; LOST IGUANA IS REUNITED WITH RIGHTFUL OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She did not belong to the inmate who called from county jail. Nor was she the 
stolen property of a Van Nuys man. She was simply a gift who wandered away from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 After a frustrating three-week search for the rightful owner, the mystery of 
the missing iguana was solved Tuesday by a teen-age boy who was reunited with 
his long-lost pal. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been gone for about three months," said Jeff Gullickson, 17, as he 
picked up his pet of 9 years, "Izzy," from Tierra del Sol School in Shadow 
Hills, where the lizard was discovered. "She was my Christmas present." 
</P>
<P>
 The school for developmentally disabled adults had placed ads and sifted 
through more than 40 phone inquiries about the lizard since it was found in a 
pasture on the school's 7 1/2-acre facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the animals can be worth up to $500, school officials were careful to 
make callers identify the creature's scars. Until Friday, however, no one had 
come close, including the woman who called from jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Gullickson's friend called him at his Lake View Terrace home and said 
they saw the reptile's face on television. Pictures showing the scars were 
rushed to the school and, on Tuesday, Gullickson showed up to claim his pet. 
</P>
<P>
 One look at the pair and it was apparent that this was the correct match. The 
three-foot-long lizard clung to Gullickson's shirt like a favorite necktie, 
with nary a scratch from his quarter-inch claws. In return, Gullickson gently 
pulled the dead skin off of Izzy's sun-scorched back. 
</P>
<P>
 The only mystery remaining was how the lizard, which was suffering from 
dehydration and starvation, survived for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went through the window at home and then through the back yard," said 
Gullickson. "She probably swam across the river, jammed over here, and hunted 
bugs and mealworms." 
</P>
<P>
 Because many of the students had grown attached to Izzy, whom they nicknamed 
Jade, the school has acquired another iguana to replace her. Izzy had been 
cared for in a classroom where students are given vocational training in 
dealing with animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gullickson will try and keep an eye on his reptilian playmate, 
which he often takes to school and keeps in his room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second time she's run away," Gullickson said, smiling. The last 
time, he said, she fattened herself up for three months eating plants in a 
neighbor's back yard. This time, she got so far away "it was like she was on a 
mission." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; POLITICS FUELS DEBATE OVER BURST PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dispute that both sides say is motivated by the upcoming San Fernando 
City Council elections, council members have been tussling with members of the 
city's Transportation and Safety Commission over whether the commission can 
influence city policy regarding the right to address the ruptured Four Corners 
Oil Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The 130-mile pipeline burst and caught fire next to O'Melveny Elementary 
School, just outside of the San Fernando city limits, during the Northridge 
earthquake, seriously burning one man and charring 17 cars and a house. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the commission or the council has the right to hold 
hearings and recommend policy regarding the future of the line. Two members of 
the safety commission, Ed Guzman and John Becker, have charged that the City 
Council has prevented them from addressing the ruptured pipeline to keep them 
from gaining public attention. Both are running for City Council seats in the 
April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at our duties and powers, safety is part of our responsibility, 
and this is a safety issue," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council members, three of whom are running for reelection, have said 
that the safety commission is overstepping its boundaries by trying to address 
the pipeline issue, and they are considering narrowing the commission's scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps they don't understand what their duties are as commissioners," said 
Mayor Dan Acuna, who is seeking his third consecutive term. "Or perhaps they, 
as candidates for office, are trying to stir something up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fire occurred outside the city and the pipeline only passes 
through about one mile of San Fernando, it has ignited a fierce debate, 
becoming the hottest issue in the City Council campaign. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; PROSTITUTION SWEEP LEADS TO 68 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said Tuesday they arrested 68 people late last week during an 
anti-prostitution sweep centered at Beach Boulevard and Ball Road, near Knott's 
Berry Farm and several residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Michael Patterson, head of the city's vice detail, said police swept the 
area Thursday and Friday, after officers noticed a recent influx of 
prostitutes.Undercover officers posed as both prostitutes and potential 
customers to conduct the sweep, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-six women were arrested on suspicion of prostitution and 32 men were 
arrested on suspicion of soliciting prostitution. Ten others were arrested on 
suspicion of various offenses, including drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The northwest corner of the intersection "has really been a mess for us," 
Patterson said. "I feel sorry for the residents of the neighborhood. A lot of 
the prostitutes drive with a guy into the neighborhood, do their thing and then 
throw the used condoms on the street or in the yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said the youngest women picked up on prostitution charges were 17. 
During a sweep of the same neighborhood last year, a 12-year-old girl was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arresting a 17-year-old for prostitution is not that uncommon," he said. 
"There are a lot of 17-year-old runaways walking the streets." TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL BOARD SAYS FINANCIAL HEALTH OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite lukewarm support from its chief fiscal officer, the Orange Unified 
School District has unanimously approved a positive financial ranking for the 
cash-strapped school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking, which will be forwarded to state and county education officials, 
means the district believes it will be in sound financial shape for the next 
three fiscal years.If it had filed a "qualified" or "negative" ranking, the 
district might have seen its credit ratings damaged and closer scrutiny of its 
budget process by county education officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of a board delay in December in eliminating about 35 classified 
employee positions, Chief Fiscal Officer Joyce Capelle said, the district needs 
to come up with another $135,000 to balance its $107-million 1993-94 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capelle is banking on current negotiations with classified employees union 
to yield at least $135,000 in savings, thus keeping the district in good 
financial shape, she said. While admitting she may not "sleep well" until union 
negotiations are concluded, Capelle said the positive financial ranking can be 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe I would put my name on a report that I couldn't back up," 
Capelle told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the job eliminations, about half of which are layoffs, the 
school board also moved to cut expense accounts for administrators and to 
reduce its own benefits package to balance its budget this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by financial difficulties during the 1980s, only in the last three years 
has the district regained a solid monetary footing. In the last three years, 
the district has cut $11.5 million from its budget, which resulted in layoffs 
for teachers and classified employees. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; SCHOOL DISTRICT GETS $16,728 REBATE CHECK 
</P>

<P>
 Garden Grove Unified School District officials say that conservation pays, and 
they have got rebate checks totaling almost $17,000 to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief presentation earlier this month, officials described the 
district's electricity conservation efforts and how they expect to save $65,000 
a year.On top of that, they said, the district has received rebate checks from 
Southern California Edison totaling $16,728 for their cooperation in reducing 
energy consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presentation, officials from Southern California Edison awarded 
plaques for each of the 10 district sites that installed energy-saving 
equipment including more efficient air conditioning and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Calkins, assistant superintendent for administrative services, said that 
the district would use the money from the rebates and savings to pay for more 
energy conservation measures. 
</P>
<P>
 He said: "We're going to do as much of this as we can now that we know how to 
do it." JON NALICK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; NEW NAME PROPOSED FOR LA TUNA CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of La Tuna Canyon have started a petition drive in recent weeks to 
rename their community Rancho La Tuna Canyon, divorcing themselves from Sun 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always referred to our area as La Tuna Canyon," said Vickie Chemleski, 
a resident who has been a leader in the drive for the name change. "Now we'd 
like to make it official." 
</P>
<P>
 The new community would run along La Tuna Canyon from Sunland Boulevard to the 
Foothill Freeway at Tujunga and the Los Angeles border with Glendale. It would 
be bordered on the north by Shadow Hills, with Burbank on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so very different from the rest of Sun Valley," Chemleski said. The La 
Tuna Canyon area is an equestrian neighborhood with a rural feel, whose 450 
homes are spread throughout the area. Outside of La Tuna Canyon, Sun Valley is 
more commercialized and densely populated. But not everyone in Sun Valley wants 
to see La Tuna Canyon leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the first-class passengers renaming their deck of the Titanic," 
said Jan Liptak, president of the Sun Valley Residents Assn. "I feel that as a 
society we rise and sink together." 
</P>
<P>
 Liptak said she had hoped the residents of the La Tuna Canyon area would be 
more interested in helping Sun Valley than to secede from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemleski said she hoped the new name would give residents more leverage in 
preserving the equestrian nature of La Tuna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Tuna Canyon is not a throwaway community," Chemleski said, adding she 
wanted the residents who own horses to band together to keep development out. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents started lobbying for the name change about three years ago, inspired 
by the success Sepulveda had in changing its name to North Hills, said Arline 
DeSanctis, chief field deputy for Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors began pushing harder for the change in the last few months after 
learning that the city was planning to redraw city maps that show community 
boundaries, Chemleski said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSanctis said she has met with community representatives about the name 
change. But she said Wachs has not yet decided whether to support it. His 
decision, she said, will depend on the impact of the change on planning and 
zoning issues. ED BOND

FATAL STABBING OF ATHLETE IS CALLED SELF-DEFENSE; HEARING: LAWYERS CONTEND 
THEIR CLIENT, 14, WAS OUTMATCHED BY 2 ADULTS AND 2 JUVENILES. PROSECUTORS SAY 
THE ATTACK WAS 'ONE-SIDED.' 
</P>

<P>
 Attorneys for a 14-year-old accused of stabbing a high school football star to 
death said at a juvenile court hearing Tuesday that the youth was acting in 
self-defense during a street fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Bailey, co-counsel for Gregory Allen Callison, contended that his 
client was outnumbered during a street confrontation in which Moudka 
Chounlamany, a star running back for Rancho Alamitos High School, was killed on 
a Garden Grove street March 8. The fight arose after a misunderstanding over a 
dune buggy, police have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a 14-year-old is attacked by an 18-year-old football player, he 
certainly can be expected to defend himself," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey and attorney Joshua Stein formally denied the murder accusation against 
Callison at a detention hearing in Orange County Juvenile Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko would not discuss the case in detail, but 
disputed the self-defense claim in an interview outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we have the facts to support a murder," Molko said. "We believe the 
facts will show that the attack was one-sided." 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation began earlier in the evening when the victim's younger 
brother and some friends who live in an apartment complex in the 12700 block of 
Louise Street congregated around the dune buggy, which Stein said belongs to 
Callison's uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Callison believed that the group was going to steal the 
vehicle and ran out into the street to confront them. The group left, but 
returned a short time later in a vehicle driven by Chounlamany, who was 
dropping off the teen-agers, who live on the street, police said. They were 
again confronted by Callison, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two adults and two juveniles coming back to the scene of a fight, and 
it was four on one," Stein said. "You've got four guys coming out a car all 
bigger than you in an area known for gang activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Chounlamany was stabbed as he got out of the vehicle, police said. "We think 
(Callison) was the aggressor in both incidents," Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Callison was arrested several hours after the 9 p.m. attack. He initially fled 
but returned several hours later and turned himself over to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Callison's family filled two rows inside the courtroom during the 
brief hearing. Orange County Juvenile Court Commissioner Robert H. Keefe denied 
a request by the defense that the teen-ager be released to the custody of his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court's greatest concern is that the minor apparently has a history of 
compulsive violent behavior," said Keefe, who ordered that Callison remain in 
Juvenile Hall until his trial. The judge did not refer to any specific episodes 
of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Callison will undergo a psychiatric evaluation before a pretrial hearing 
scheduled May 6. His trial has been set for May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his age, Callison will be tried as a juvenile. If convicted, he 
could be sentenced to the California Youth Authority, where state law would 
require that he be released by the age of 25, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, defendants must be 16 or older before prosecutors can seek to 
try them as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 people attended funeral services Saturday for Chounlamany, a 
5-foot-6-inch, 150-pound running back who led Rancho Alamitos to a sectional 
football championship last December.

MAN, 27, CONVICTED OF EXECUTION-STYLE MURDER OF GUARD; COURT: JURY RULES SEAN 
DARNELL SLADE KILLED THE MAN DURING A 1992 ROBBERY. HE COULD FACE THE DEATH 
PENALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a verdict that could lead to the death penalty, a jury on Tuesday convicted 
Sean Darnell Slade of the execution-style murder of a guard during an armed 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, 27, was found guilty of murdering Edwin Maldonado, a 26-year-old 
employee of Sectran Security Transportation, who was gunned down July 29, 1992, 
during a robbery at a Home Depot store in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm jumping for joy, I'm just so happy," said Maldonado's best friend, Andy 
Marreno who also works in the security industry. "I'm sure his mom will feel 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury, which heard the bulk of the case in Van 
Nuys because of earthquake damage to the San Fernando courthouse, deliberated 
three days before convicting Slade of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased with the verdict in this case," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Cynthia L. Ulfig. "I originally saw this case when it was carried by the news . 
. . and I knew it was a case I wanted to be involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 Slade was "visibly upset by the verdict and somewhat confused," said defense 
attorney Bruce Hill. Slade's niece, Mia Thomas, quietly cried in the gallery 
during the short proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury of seven men and five women determined that Maldonado was killed 
during a robbery and while Slade was lying in wait. The convictions on those 
two special circumstance allegations mean Judge Ronald S. Coen has only two 
sentencing options -- the death penalty or life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Coen will decide after the jury makes its recommendation. The panel will 
reassemble March 28 for the penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "His past history will come out, obviously, as part of the penalty phase," 
Ulfig said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Slade admitted that he was paroled only 25 days before the 
killing, after serving about four years in a manslaughter case. Prosecutors 
said the jury will soon learn how in that case Slade emptied his gun while the 
victim was seated in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 That killing came 2 1/2 months after Slade escaped from a California Youth 
Authority prison, Ulfig said. He was serving a term for an armed robbery at a 
restaurant when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
 During the penalty phase, jurors will also hear about Maldonado, his family 
and his tenure with the Pasadena Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade has maintained his innocence, claiming mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying on his own behalf, Slade told the jury that he was visiting with 
friends and picking up his wife from work when the guard was shot. The defense 
had claimed Slade was set up by Elizabeth Floyd, the mother of the man Slade 
killed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulfig suggested the identifications of two eyewitnesses convinced the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 A 27-year-old Home Depot employee, who was standing about five feet away when 
Maldonado was shot, positively identified Slade as the gunman, which both 
attorneys agreed was key to the case. "He was a good witness, obviously, a very 
sincere young man," Hill admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the only question asked by the jury concerned the testimony of 
another man who said he saw Slade sitting in a car in the Home Depot parking 
lot about four hours before the crime.

EX-OFFICER PLEADS GUILTY TO CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles County probation officer from Canyon Country has pleaded 
guilty to federal child pornography charges, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In pleading guilty to six counts of producing child pornography, Glenn Alan 
Nelson, 46, admitted that in November, 1991, he had traveled to Bangkok, 
Thailand, to engage in "sexually explicit conduct" with boys under the age of 
18, according to Assistant U. S. Atty.Patricia Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said Nelson -- who was assigned to Camp Scudder, a juvenile probation 
camp in Saugus at the time -- had hired four boys in Bangkok and Pattaya, 
Thailand, to perform sexual acts by themselves, with each other and with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies had conducted a search of Nelson's home on June 2, 1992, 
and found camera and film processing equipment, the photographs of Nelson with 
the boys and other child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Nelson could be formally charged, he fled. An arrest warrant was 
issued for Nelson in connection with a 29-count federal indictment for child 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, Nelson was arrested last month in Joplin, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who entered his plea late Monday, is scheduled to be sentenced May 16.

MAN ADMITS TAKING DOWN ROBERTI'S CAMPAIGN SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys businessman has admitted to police that he removed two dozen of 
state Sen. David Roberti's campaign signs and became embroiled in a dispute 
with a Roberti aide but denied he was acting in concert with the senator's 
political foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Schwartz told Van Nuys Division LAPD detectives that he and his three 
sons, ages 11, 14 and 16, took down the signs in his neighborhood on Feb. 27 
and brought them to the home of Shirley Wechsler, Roberti's campaign treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, 44, said he removed the signs because they were ugly "political 
graffiti" and because he disagrees with Roberti's views about the efficacy of 
gun control in preventing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti (D-Van Nuys) is the target of a recall campaign largely led by gun 
rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Wechsler's husband, Arthur Forcier, a college professor, had filed a police 
report complaining that the people involved in the sign incident warned him "to 
stay away from the window" and nearly struck him with their car when they drove 
away from his Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles Police Department had the car's license plate number, 
it was Schwartz who stepped forward to contact the police, Officer Doug Tanaka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to give his side of the story," Tanaka said.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz has denied he nearly struck Forcier with his car and said he only 
made threatening remarks to Forcier after the 63-year-old political science 
professor threatened one of Schwartz's sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Forcier has decided not to pursue the matter, the case is now closed, 
Tanaka said.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he now regrets removing the signs because he said it embroiled 
him in a "cheap political trick" in which the Roberti camp was made to look 
like the victim of "political thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti aides contacted the media about the incident at Wechsler's home and 
suggested that it was part of the ongoing campaign of intimidation being waged 
against the senator. Roberti has repeatedly characterized his recall opponents 
as "bully boys" who are trying to oust him because of his authorship of a 1989 
law banning military-style, semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "With me at 142 pounds and my three young sons, I don't think we could be 
confused with thugs," said Schwartz, who says he enjoys sport shooting with his 
sons and is a member of the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Schwartz said, it was Forcier who acted badly. Schwartz, who owns a 
skylight manufacturing concern in Anaheim, said Forcier denounced him and his 
sons as "(expletive) Nazis" after they knocked on the door and explained that 
they were returning the signs to Wechsler, whose name and home address appeared 
on them.

MAN FACES TRIAL IN WOMAN'S KILLING; COURTS: DAVID CONDRY ALSO IS CHARGED WITH 
USING A HATCHET IN AN ATTEMPT TO SLAY HIS BENEFACTOR'S GRANDSON. 
</P>

 A loner with a large collection of books on satanic practices planned in 
advance the murder of his 89-year-old benefactor, according to court testimony 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the evidence, a judge ordered David Condry, 30, to stand trial 
in the Feb. 8 slaying of Josephine Adinolfi and the attempted hatchet murder of 
her grandson, Augie Pisano, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The new evidence of premeditation, contained in Condry's confession to police, 
could lead prosecutors to seek the death penalty, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Condry pleaded not guilty to all charges on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Police Officer John McKillop testified that Condry also said he 
thought about killing Pisano and had planned to steal Pisano's car after the 
attack and drive it to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant told police he decided to use a hatchet to kill Pisano because 
he thought it would give him a "greater advantage," McKillop said.  
</P>
<P>
 Condry and Pisano lived with Adinolfi at 703 Salem St. in Glendale where 
Condry kept a collection of objects related to satanism including a photo 
bearing the words "Human Sacrifice Would Open Up The Gates of Hell," according 
to court records and Pisano.  
</P>
<P>
 Pisano said the relationship between Adinolfi and Condry deteriorated after 
Adinolfi found a book with the word Satan inscribed on its cover in Condry's 
bedroom. A subsequent search by Adinolfi, who was a Roman Catholic, of the 
guest house produced more than 100 books on various satanic practices, Pisano 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Adinolfi allowed Condry to live in the guest house behind her home for more 
than seven years because she regarded him as "like another grandson." Condry 
repaid her by doing odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 McKillop testified that Condry asked to speak with detectives on Feb. 9, 
saying Condry wanted to discuss the events that led up to Adinolfi's death. 
Condry told police that he and Adinolfi argued early in the afternoon of Feb. 8 
because she wanted to take the car out alone while he insisted on driving her, 
McKillop said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Adinolfi went into her bedroom after the argument, McKillop testified, 
Condry said he grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her in the chest. 
Adinolfi suffered one puncture wound to the chest and two slash-type wounds 
above her stomach, McKillop said.

CLERICS CAST FOR STRATEGIES ON STEMMING VIOLENCE; RELIGION: JEWISH, CHRISTIAN 
AND MUSLIM MEMBERS OF INTERFAITH GROUP HOLD IDEA SESSIONS AT CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Using flip charts and red felt-tip markers, church leaders from across the 
country sat on folding chairs at the Crystal Cathedral on Monday night and 
Tuesday, deliberating on nationwide causes and cures for violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders, working in groups of 10, came up with 
lists of thoughts and ideas. One of the working groups topped its list of 
causes with "lack of values." Other groups sat inside the cathedral's arboretum 
and outside on the grass, making similar lists and sharing their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80 clerics who attended the meeting are members of Churches Uniting in 
Global Mission, a coalition formed three years ago to involve religious leaders 
in seeking ways to halt the escalation of violence in modern society. Now it 
includes about 200 pastors in the United States and Canada who want to reach 
out to those disenfranchised by society and the church -- those who are often 
responsible for violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is the first of its kind in the history of Christianity, according 
to its executive director, the Rev. David Tyler Scoates. But like other leaders 
who spoke at a press conference Tuesday morning about the group's goals, he did 
not have answers to the problem, saying he had come with questions and an open 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoates, who has been a United Methodist minister for 36 years, said most of 
the conference would be devoted to listening to speakers and exchanging ideas. 
"We know some people are doing a job . . . in combatting violence," he said, 
adding that he hopes to put some of their ideas into a national clearinghouse 
that all members of the group can tap into. 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal is to reach those responsible for violence. "We're not just 
talking about, 'We're going to (preach) Sunday morning,' " said Robert Brown, a 
public relations executive from North Carolina who came up with the plan to 
meet. "We have to reach out to people and go to the highways and byways," 
visiting those disaffected by religious teachings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a member of the Crystal Cathedral's board, came up with the suggestion 
that the interfaith group be formed three years ago, after approaching Crystal 
Cathedral leader Robert Schuller to find out how religion could help stop black 
men from killing each other. Schuller then hired Scoates, who recruited other 
pastors in the United States and Canada, and is recruiting in Russian churches 
as well, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Scoates called the need to curb violence an emergency, and said that most 
people he knew had family members who had been affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller says there are no ready answers. "The Roman Catholic Church is not 
going to solve the violence problem. Robert Schuller is not going to solve 
(it). The Jews can't solve it. The Muslims can't solve it," he said. "We are 
trying to convert people from coalition to coalition, not from one faith to 
another. . . . We're not trying to replace anybody. We're just trying to do 
what needs to be done."

VALLEY BRIEFING: SQUEEZED OUT; REMEMBERING THE VALLEY'S ORANGE EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the housing tracts, malls and freeways, the San Fernando Valley was 
home to a thriving citrus industry that in its heyday covered 15,000 acres. 
From the early 1920s to the late 1950s, oranges were grown and packed in 
harvested for local consumption as well as the rest of the country. Packing 
houses located in San Fernando, Pacoima, Reseda and Owensmouth (which was later 
renamed Canoga Park), processed the local oranges, mostly Valencias. 
</P>
<P>
 Oranges in California date back two centuries to the Spanish missionaries who 
first brought the seeds. The first California orchard was planted at the San 
Gabriel Mission in 1804, followed in 1840 by the first commercial orange grove 
in what is now downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, the stage was set with the opening of the Owens 
Valley Aqueduct in 1913, which made it possible to grow irrigated crops. in the 
San Fernando Valley. In addition to oranges, Valley farmers also grew walnuts, 
beans, strawberries, tomatoes, alfalfa and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The citrus industry in the Valley hit its peak in the 1930s. By the end of 
World War II, the housing boom began squeeze out the orange groves . New 
homeowners, while fond of the fragrant scent of the orange blossoms, did not 
appreciate the manure and tractors that went along with the groves. As a result 
of infringing development, yields declined while the asfarmland became more 
valuable as residential housing. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1970s, only 350 acres of orange groves remained. Today, only a 
handful of groves are left, totaling about 40 acres. Labeling the crates 
Created by artists and graphic designers, colorful paper labels were slapped on 
orange crates to catch the attention of prospective buyers. The artwork is 
divided into three periods, providing a glimpse of the social as well as 
commercial art history of California from the 1880s through the mid-1950s. The 
labels, no longer used after cardboard boxes replaced wooden crates in the 
mid-1950s, are now collectibles. Survivng development A drive has begun to 
preserve the historic seven-acre grove at Cal State Northridge, at the corner 
of Nordhoff Street and Zelzah Avenue. Last year, the grove was rededicated at a 
ceremony in conjunction with a "Feeling Grovey Festival" to raise money for a 
new irrigation system. Sunkist Growers Inc. donated 150 trees to the project to 
replace those in the 500-tree grove that were dead or dying. Sources:

TEACHER WON'T FACE CHARGES FOR CLASH OUTSIDE GAY SUPPORT CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Charges will not be filed against a Fountain Valley High School teacher who a 
17-year-old student said assaulted him while trying to prevent him from 
attending a meeting of a support group for gay students on campus, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, whose name was not released, filed an assault-and-battery report 
with the Police Department on the evening of the Feb. 17 incident, which 
allegedly occurred as the Student Alliance was about to begin a meeting after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Dann Bean, who investigated the complaint, said that the Orange 
County district attorney's office will not be pursuing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney's office did not feel it was a case for the criminal 
justice system," Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student alleged that the unidentified teacher tried to keep him out of the 
meeting and that he was hit in the face by the teacher's forearm. The sergeant 
said the student pushed his way into the meeting, then claimed he was struck by 
the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to prove a willfulness on the teacher's part to actually injure the 
student, and it's not believed by the district attorney or the police that the 
teacher tried to injure the student in this case," Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Alliance has been the center of a politically charged debate 
between supporters of the group and those opposed to allowing it to meet on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the Huntington Beach Union High School District Board of Trustees 
voted to keep a district policy that allows student groups not related to the 
curriculum to meeting on campus.

DANA POINT DOWNSCALES HEADLANDS PROJECT; DEVELOPMENT: RESIDENTIAL PLAN GOES 
FROM 394 HOMES TO 370. AREA HAS BEEN FOCUS OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL TUG OF WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversial plans for a $500-million luxury hotel and residential resort on 
one of Orange County's last large undeveloped coastal properties were 
downscaled Tuesday night from 394 homes to 370. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, which reduced the maximum number of homes which may be 
built, delayed final action on the overall plan until its meeting on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowners propose to build a 400-room hotel, two commercial centers and 
the 370 homes on a 121-acre peninsula called the Headlands, which overlooks 
Dana Point Harbor to the south and Dana Strand Beach and Monarch Bay to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of its prime coastal location, the plan has been the focus of 
a bitter fight between environmentalists who want to save the peninsula as a 
natural resource and the landowners who have planned to develop the property 
since buying it in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal sage scrub thrives throughout the undisturbed portions of the 
bluff-top peninsula, and it is home to 120 species of plants and several 
threatened species, including the California gnatcatcher and the Pacific pocket 
mouse. On Feb. 1, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service placed the hamster-like 
pocket mouse on the emergency endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 But the support the plan received from the council and city staff is based 
largely on concessions the landowner has made and the $2.5 million in annual 
revenues it is expected to generate for Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowner also has agreed to dedicate 66 acres of park space to the city, 
has promised to spend $2.8 million for park improvements and will offer to sell 
the city 2.7 acres of prime land fronting Pacific Coast Highway at a 
less-than-fair-market price for a civic center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the state's history of raiding local government's treasuries, it is 
critical that we do whatever we can to protect our ability to provide services 
for our residents," Councilman Mike Eggers said Tuesday. "Annual revenues of 
$2.5 million are a significant piece of change." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the land are Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. and Chandis 
Securities Co. (Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings 
of the Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the plan, it then must be approved by the California 
Coastal Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the plan, which include the South Coast Audubon Society and a 
local Sierra Club chapter, said this week they will continue to fight for more 
open space from the landowners.  
</P>
<P>
 Celia Kutcher, a spokeswoman for the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy, a 
grass-roots group dedicated to buying some of the Headlands property to save it 
from development, said her members will take their efforts to the city planning 
commission immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning commission tonight will begin its review of the plan's 
development agreement, a legal contract that will lock in the city approval for 
at least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kutcher said her group is "looking for ways to fund purchase of the land. We 
feel as much of the project as possible should be left as open space that is 
accessible to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels of Laguna Beach, the president of M.H. Sherman Co., said he 
would listen to any offer to buy some of the Headlands property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are more than happy to talk to them about buying some part of the property 
when they are in a position to buy it," said Daniels, adding that it would 
depend on which portion of the Headlands the group wanted. "I don't think we 
would want a parcel purchased in the middle of our development." 
</P>
<P>
 A major obstacle could be the listing of the Pacific pocket mouse. The mice, 
once thought to be extinct, were found on a four-acre section of the Headlands 
during a survey of the property last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will hold a public hearing on the pocket 
mouse from 6 to 8 p.m. on March 24 at Casa Clemente Resort in San Clemente.

DWP FAVORS ABANDONING HIGHER SUMMER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the recommendation of a panel appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan, 
the Department of Water and Power board voted Tuesday in favor of a proposal to 
abandon higher summer utility rates -- which set off howls of protests from San 
Fernando Valley homeowners whose water bills skyrocketed under the plan 
implemented last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure must still be approved by the City Council and the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the temporary fix, customers who were affected by the summer rate 
surcharge can expect to see a reduction of 20% in their water bills this 
summer, compared to last year, a DWP spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, under winter prices, customers pay a base rate of $2.33 for 748 
gallons of water. Under the summer rates, which applied to those using more 
than 20,944 gallons a month, the price rose to $2.98.  
</P>
<P>
 The two-tier pricing system was inaugurated at the suggestion of a previous 
study panel, which intended it to reduce home water use during the years of 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was two-month DWP bills last summer of $700 to $1,000 and more for 
many homeowners, especially in the Valley, which is hotter than the rest of the 
city during the summer. Valley homeowners said they were being unfairly 
penalized for having large lots and expensive landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Following widespread protests, Riordan appointed a committee to look into the 
rate system.

SEX MISCONDUCT BY DOCTOR ALLEGED; COMPLAINT: MEDICAL BOARD SAYS PHYSICIAN 
FONDLED AND LATER HAD SEX WITH PATIENT. IT SEEKS TO REVOKE LICENSE TO PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The California Medical Board has moved to revoke the license of a doctor, one 
of the first in Orange County to treat AIDS patients, for alleged sexual 
misconduct and gross negligence involving a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint, the board accuses Newport Beach physician Charles A. Robertson 
of sexually assaulting a patient in his office, then having sex with him later 
in a motel. The board also charges Robertson with failing to conduct a complete 
medical examination before prescribing drugs over the telephone to the same 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should never happen. It's completely inappropriate," Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Sherry Ledakis, who will prosecute the case, said of the purported sexual 
misconduct. "He's taking advantage of a fiduciary relationship with someone in 
a position of less power. He's just taking advantage of a vulnerable person." 
</P>
<P>
 James Morgan, the Newport Beach attorney who will represent Robertson when the 
matter is heard before an administrative judge, said Tuesday the allegations 
are false. 
</P>
<P>
 "He expects to be totally and fully exonerated when we have a full hearing on 
the merits," Morgan said. "Dr. Robertson is familiar with the facts and, of 
course, he just obviously denies the allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, 42, who lives on Lido Isle, declined to comment, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor has 30 days to reply to the formal accusation. Once his response is 
filed, a hearing will be scheduled, and an administrative judge will decide 
whether to revoke his license. In the meantime, Robertson is allowed to 
practice medicine as usual, Ledakis said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the board's complaint, the sexual misconduct began during an 
office visit in December, 1989, when Robertson allegedly fondled the patient's 
genitalia, then pinned the patient down on the examination table and 
masturbated. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint said the doctor told the patient: "I have only had six or seven 
indiscretions like this during my entire career." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, the patient, who wasn't identified in the complaint, 
threatened to report Robertson to the American Medical Assn., and asked 
Robertson to take an AIDS test and to refrain from examining patients for one 
year, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later that day (Robertson and the patient) drove to a motel where they 
engaged in sexual relations," according to the complaint, which added that the 
patient "cried following this encounter, became quite depressed and attempted 
suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago in 
1978, Robertson became a licensed California doctor in 1979. He is well-known 
in the local medical community for treating people with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, and the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Medical Board disciplined 18 physicians for sexual misconduct, 
which it considers among its most serious offenses, spokeswoman Candis Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see cases dealing with negligence and incompetence, but sexual misconduct 
is worse because it is willful, it could be prevented," Cohen said. "It 
involves such a violation of trust that goes to the heart of the doctor-patient 
relationship. It's illegal and unethical. The Medical Board takes these 
complaints very seriously."

1ST CASE UNDER NEW STATE LAW IS FILED AGAINST THEFT SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors Tuesday filed the first criminal case under recently 
enhanced state punishment guidelines against a 33-year-old Rosemead man accused 
of stealing clothes from a Mervyn's store in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Manuel Vincent Juarez does not qualify him for the mandatory 
life sentence for three-time losers under the "three-strikes" provisions.But 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Brent F. Romney said Juarez's one previous felony 
conviction makes him a "two-strike" defendant facing double the minimum 
punishment if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of 16 months in prison, Romney said a judge would be forced to 
sentence Juarez to at least 32 months if the man were found guilty of the March 
12 second-degree burglary at the Harbor Boulevard department store. 
</P>
<P>
 Romney said Juarez is accused of taking about $300 in clothing from the store 
Sunday, and has a 1986 robbery conviction from Los Angeles County.

PARENTS ENTER NOT-GUILTY PLEA IN ABDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A married couple accused of kidnaping their 4-year-old son from his foster 
home pleaded not guilty Tuesday during their arraignment in South Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaser and Deborah Jayyusi are charged with one count of felony child abduction 
for allegedly taking their son, Taj, from a Rancho Santa Margarita foster home 
Feb. 12, said Kelly MacEachern, a deputy district attorney.The couple were 
arrested in Cerritos Feb. 18 as Yaser Jayyusi tried to pick up his paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan White, Taj's foster mother, was awarded custody of Taj on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 If found guilty, they both could receive a maximum of three years in prison 
and a fine of $10,000, MacEachern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj was taken just days before a court hearing to determine whether his 
parents would be stripped of their parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj and a 2-year-old daughter entered foster care two years ago after being 
taken from the Jayyusis because of allegations of physical abuse, according to 
social services officials and court records. A preliminary hearing for both 
defendants has been set for April 9.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN PROSTITUTION LAWS DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday denied a motion by a Santa Clarita 
couple to overturn state prostitution laws that they say prohibit members of 
their church from practicing rituals that include having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Tracy, head of the Church of the Most High Goddess, sued Los 
Angeles Dist. Atty.Gil Garcetti last September in an effort to legalize 
meetings at her church by getting the laws overturned. A favorable ruling would 
have allowed Tracy to seek a court injunction barring Garcetti's office from 
enforcing the state laws in her case. Tracy had asked the court to declare the 
state laws unconstitutional as a result of the recent enactment of federal laws 
that bar the government from intruding on religions without a compelling 
reason, said Senior Deputy County Counsel Marion Douglas, who is representing 
Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Madeleine Flier denied Tracy's request, 
noting that many of the issues raised by Tracy in her lawsuit had been heard 
during her earlier criminal trial, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy, also known as Sabrina Aset, and her husband Will Tracy, were convicted 
in 1989 of pimping, pandering, prostitution and keeping a house of ill fame for 
activities related to their church. A judge sentenced Mary Ellen Tracy to a 
year in jail and Will Tracy to six months. The couple claimed to absolve the 
sins of male followers through sexual religious rites. Mary Ellen Tracy said 
that she had sex with more than 2,000 men, many of whom also gave monetary 
"sacrifices" to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tracys said they will ask the state court of appeals to stop Flier from 
signing an order finalizing her ruling. "If we teach our religion to a woman 
we're subject to a three-year mandatory prison sentence," Will Tracy said. 
"We're totally prohibited."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN TO BE ARRAIGNED IN BITING INCIDENT; 
COURTS: AUTHORITIES SAY THE SUSPECT ATTACKED A HOSPITAL DOCTOR AND LATER 
CLAIMED TO HAVE HIV.

 A Fillmore man who told authorities that he is infected with the virus that 
causes AIDS is scheduled to be arraigned today in Newhall Municipal Court for 
allegedly scratching, punching and attempting to bite an emergency room 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
 David Detoth, 45, remained in custody Tuesday in the jail ward of Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center in lieu of $20,000 bail. He was listed in stable 
condition after complaining of a variety of ailments, including a stomach 
ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Detoth will be arraigned on one count of assaulting a medical doctor, but 
could face an additional charge of assault with the intent to do great bodily 
injury if he tests positive for human immunodeficiency virus, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Detoth was brought to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital on Saturday night 
by a friend and was apparently crying out in pain, said Detective Howard 
Fairchild of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Detoth became enraged 
about 9:50 p.m. when the hospital staff refused to give him painkillers, the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got crazy and attacked the doctor," Fairchild said, adding that Detoth 
later "bragged, 'I've been HIV since 1983.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the scuffle, the doctor was scratched and punched several times about 
the head and face but fended off Detoth's attempts to bite him by pulling back 
on the attacker's hair, Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Stone said there was concern for the doctor's well-being after the 
alleged attack. "They were both scratched up and bleeding all over the place," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor's identity was not disclosed. Hospital spokeswoman Cathleen Lee 
said hospital policy prohibits releasing information about the doctor, the 
patient or the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Detoth would be asked during his arraignment to submit 
voluntarily to an HIV test. If he refuses, Stone said his office would request 
that the court order him to submit.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; QUAKE DAMAGE ESTIMATES DROP TO $244 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have downgraded damage estimates from the Northridge 
earthquake, saying new figures put the citywide destruction at $244 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That is $52 million lower than the original estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake is now placed at $244.4 million by city 
officials, one-sixth less than the February figures. The new figures were 
released after a closer inspection of public facilities, private property and 
other records. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest adjustment downward -- about $30 million -- came from a clerical 
error that inflated damages to local post offices. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials attribute the mistake to confusion after the earthquake, while 
city staffers worked around the clock in large tents in the City Hall parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Other revised estimates include lowering damage figures by $17 million for 
highways and bridges, by $5 million for public facilities and by $4 million for 
utility equipment. Estimates also show $3 million in damage to mobile homes, an 
area not previously recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the figures don't influence how the city is budgeting for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we had those numbers was to give people an idea of the 
magnitude of the damage we had," said Ken Pulskamp, assistant city manager. "It 
just doesn't have any impact on us." 
</P>
<P>
 The $52-million drop won't alter what Santa Clarita receives from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, said Finance Director Steve Stark. "When it gets 
to the point of being reimbursed by FEMA, it will be based on the cost of 
repairs," said Stark.

DRYWALL FIRMS INVESTIGATED FOR ILLEGAL WORKERS; EMPLOYMENT: MORE THAN HALF OF 
800 EMPLOYEES IN FIVE SOUTHLAND COMPANIES WERE FOUND TO BE IN U.S. ILLEGALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After finding that more than half the 800 workers employed by five Southern 
California drywall companies last year were illegal immigrants, the U.S. Border 
Patrol has begun investigating the hiring records of 46 additional drywall 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe, expected to last through mid-June, involves companies in Orange, 
Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego and San Bernardino counties that together 
employed about 3,000 residential drywall installers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the workers are members of Carpenters Union Local 2361 in Orange, but 
the union is not being targeted in the investigation, said David Garrett, 
supervising agent of the Border Patrol's employer sanctions unit in Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 If the probe results in barring hundreds of illegal workers from the industry, 
as Board Patrol officials intend, it could lead to labor shortages and 
construction slowdowns just as the Southern California housing industry begins 
recovering from four years of deep recession.  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation has angered several drywall companies. Their contract with 
the carpenters union calls for the union to screen workers and verify their 
legal employment status. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Hubbell, the drywall union contract administrator for the Southern 
California Conference of Carpenters, acknowledged that the pact calls for the 
union to screen workers. But he called the screening clause an effort by the 
union to assist employers -- not to assume their legal responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Drywall workers in Southern California's residential building industry 
conducted a five-month wildcat strike in 1992, complaining of exploitation by 
employers because they were not members of a union. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation of drywall -- an inexpensive and near universal replacement 
for plaster finishes on the interior walls of homes -- tends to draw 
undocumented workers because employment is transitory, the work is not highly 
skilled and knowledge of the English language is not a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carpenters Union agreed to represent the strikers and in November, 1992, 
most of Southern California's large residential drywall installation companies 
signed a master contract agreement. Garrett said federal law holds the employer 
responsible for verifying legal status. The contract between the drywall firms 
and the union is a civil contract and doesn't relieve the employers of their 
responsibility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, one of the five companies initially investigated by Garrett's 
agents -- SMR Drywall Inc. in Lake Elsinore -- is being fined $17,500 because 
it has not maintained worker eligibility records, called I-9 forms, since the 
union contract took effect in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 117 workers employed by the small company last year, the Border Patrol 
agents identified 26 as illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Duddy, SMR Drywall's chief executive, said he intends to file an 
administrative appeal of the fine.  
</P>
<P>
 The other four companies involved in the initial probe all had I-9s on file 
for their employees, Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those companies was Orange County Drywall in Tustin, a third was Cal 
West Drywall in Yorba Linda. Although most of the illegal workers used 
falsified papers to establish legal status, the employers are not required to 
detect forgeries and thus are not being held liable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Maag, president of Orange County Drywall and president of the Pacific 
Rim Drywall Contractors Assn., said the union's apparent failure to properly 
perform employee screening as called for in its bargaining agreement "could 
very well" become an issue when contract negotiations begin later this year. 
The present contract expires Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett of the Border Patrol also said that no arrests of workers or 
deportation hearings are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't that there is a lack of documentation for many of these 
people, but rather that a lot of it is falsified," he said.

HONDA PAYOLA WENT ON FOR YEARS, FBI SAYS; INQUIRY: OBSERVERS ASK HOW THE 
COMPANY COULD HAVE ALLOWED SUCH A WIDESPREAD ILLICIT ENTERPRISE TO CONTINUE FOR 
SO LONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long after Donald Carlton was picked to open a new Honda dealership in 
Puyallup, Wash., he traveled to Laguna Hills to personally thank S. James 
Cardiges, the company's senior vice president of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Carlton show his appreciation? According to the FBI, the men met at a 
Laguna Niguel hotel bar and Carlton handed a briefcase containing $250,000 to 
Cardiges, who stashed the cash in the attic of his $770,000 Laguna Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged bribe is one of many that Cardiges and other former Honda 
executives are accused of accepting over more than a decade in return for 
awarding hard-to-get Honda and Acura dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a federal grand jury in Concord, N.H., indicted Cardiges and four 
others on charges that they illegally pocketed more than $10 million in bribes 
and kickbacks from car dealers. Philip Israels, Cardiges' attorney, said 
Tuesday that his client "will be cleared" in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, eight other former Honda employees have entered guilty pleas 
to charges related to illegal payments. They are cooperating with investigators 
in return for leniency in sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This had been rumored for some time among dealers," said Maynard Gordon, the 
Detroit editor of Dealer Business, a trade magazine. "Payola was known to be 
par for the course." 
</P>
<P>
 Payment of bribes and kickbacks is not unknown in the auto industry -- 
particularly when demand arises for hot products. Toyota faced a similar 
scandal about two decades ago, and corruption hit some U.S. auto makers after 
World War II.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest scandal is a black mark for Honda, whose Accord was the 
best-selling car in America two years ago and whose vehicles and dealerships 
have had a squeaky-clean reputation for quality and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the company said it was "outraged and saddened" by the 
criminal activities and allegations. But officials declined to answer specific 
questions, citing the ongoing federal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many are asking how Honda could have allowed such a widespread illicit 
enterprise to go unchecked for so long. Further, the disclosures come at a time 
when Honda can least afford damage to its image. Like most other Japanese auto 
makers, it is losing market share to rebounding U.S. competitors.  
</P>
<P>
 A close-knit company known for going its own way, Honda has one of the 
leanest, lowest-paid staffs in the business. Cardiges earned $143,000 in 1992 
-- perhaps 25% below the industry average, consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys probably took credit for Honda's success and decided they were 
entitled to more compensation," said C.R. Brown, chief operating officer of Los 
Alamitos- based Daihatsu America. "And they evidently found an avenue to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of the scandal were sown in the early 1980s, when Japanese cars were 
riding a crest of popularity among baby boomers. The quality of Honda's Accord 
family sedan was considered to be so high that many buyers were willing to pay 
as much as $2,000 above the sticker price. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. trade policies fed the fever. The struggling Big Three auto makers sought 
trade protection from Japanese imports. In response, the Japanese assented to a 
voluntary restraint agreement, making buyer competition for the most popular 
cars even keener. 
</P>
<P>
 In that atmosphere, Honda dealerships became extremely valuable, and 
executives at American Honda Motor Co.'s headquarters in Torrance had the power 
to award them. That was John Billmyer's job from 1983 to 1988. The federal 
indictment charges Billmyer, 64, with conspiring with other Honda officials to 
accept bribes for granting Honda and Acura dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of charges revolve around Cardiges, 48, who worked for Honda from 
1977 to 1992. According to the indictment and other court filings, Cardiges, 
whose last post was senior vice president of sales, engaged in numerous illegal 
activities to enrich himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Israels, Cardiges' attorney, declined to comment on the case, other than to 
note that "we're working on posting the ($200,000) bail." 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who answered Cardiges' home telephone Tuesday said that the family had 
no comment. "I have nothing to say," the woman said. "I'm a relative here for 
support. I can't say any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges' arrest Friday shocked neighbors in the Nellie Gail subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were incredulous at first when we heard about it on Monday," said one 
neighbor who declined to give her name. "They came across as very nice, very 
warm, kind, gentle people. We're in shock. . . . I guess it shows that things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Public records show that Cardiges was involved with politics: During an 
18-month period ended June 30, 1992, he donated $15,400 to the Republican 
National Party. And, a search of property records showed that Cardiges was 
owner or part-owner of about a dozen pieces of property in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court affidavit, FBI special agent William Tidyman described the bribe 
Carlton allegedly paid Cardiges in exchange for his dealership in Washington 
state: 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton's wife, Judy, told the FBI that she traveled with her husband from 
their home in Tulsa, Okla., to Palm Springs in 1989 or 1990. While there, her 
husband received a box in the mail that contained between $200,000 and 
$250,000. Later, during a stay at an Orange County hotel, her husband handed 
Cardiges the briefcase with cash. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carlton later divorced his wife, she threatened to disclose the the 
alleged bribe. Cardiges then ordered Carlton to back out of the deal to start 
up the new dealership. Cardiges also prepared a "bogus promissory note" of 
$250,000, the affidavit alleges, to disguise the bribe paid for the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Cardiges also received kickbacks totaling 
$100,000 for steering Honda sales trainees to seminars with a particular 
training company. Cardiges also received kickbacks for directing advertising 
and direct-mail dealer contracts to a specified vendor, the indictment says.

QUAKE-RELATED CLAIMS RATTLE US FACILITIES' QUARTERLY PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 US Facilities Corp. said Tuesday that insurance claims from the January 
earthquake in Northridge will reduce the company's first-quarter earnings by 
about $1.4 million, or 23 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's first quarter, the company posted a profit of $1.9 million, or 
31 cents a share, on revenue of $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding company for reinsurance and other insurance-related firms does not 
expect the quake-related claims to have a significant effect on its financial 
health. The company did not disclose how much it faced in claims payouts from 
the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting earnings of $1.20 a share for the year, so this takes a 
good bit out," said Ellen S. Barzilai, an industry analyst at the New York 
office of the brokerage Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're expecting a lot of insurance companies in the first quarter to 
break even because of the quake in California and the winter freeze" on the 
East Coast, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement didn't dampen investor interest. US Facilities' stock rose 25 
cents a share to close at $9 a share in Tuesday's Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's property and casualty business, which covered a number of 
commercial buildings damaged by the quake, represents about 20% of its premium 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Its primary business, accounting for 72% of its premiums, is medical stop-loss 
reinsurance, which covers a certain amount of medical benefits for companies 
that assume a sizable amount of the initial benefit claims themselves.

PACIFICARE FORMING ITS OWN PREFERRED-PROVIDER UNIT TO CUT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., one of the state's largest health maintenance 
organizations, is wading into the insurance pool by forming its own network of 
independent physicians for its California members. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its PacifiCare of California subsidiary, the Cypress company said 
Tuesday that it is forming a preferred-provider organization to replace a 
costly PPO plan it has been leasing from another company. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost to employers will drop by 15%, while the number of physicians 
available to members will grow to 25,000, a 32% increase over the number in the 
current plan. The new plan also expects to sign up 250 hospitals statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, the new plan marks the company's effort to broaden its HMO 
image and position itself as a managed-care company, which it thinks it will 
need to do to remain competitive with other major health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 A PPO plan offers members a group of private physicians and hospitals from 
which to choose when seeking medical care. The physicians and hospitals agree 
to abide by fees established by the health-care provider. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare's switch to a wholly owned and managed PPO is a "direct response to 
customer demands for flexibility and freedom of choice in health care," said 
Jeff Folik, PacifiCare of California's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new PPO product, when combined with our list of PacifiCare products, 
provides brokers and employers with one-stop shopping for all their 
employee-benefit needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the plan will be available only to about 10,000 PacifiCare members 
in California. But 600,000 members eventually could join the plan if their 
employers pick up that option at their contract renewal dates with PacifiCare, 
spokesman Ben Singer said. The plan will not be available to 250,000 seniors 
already benefiting from Secure Horizons, PacifiCare's Medicare HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, the current leased network just hasn't been competitive. It is not 
priced well," Singer said. "It only has 700 members." 
</P>
<P>
 The savings under the new PPO will make it competitively priced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the new plan is aimed only for PacifiCare's California members, Singer 
said, it may eventually be expanded to the company's customers in Florida, 
Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare, which has 1.1 million members in six states, is the state's 
third-largest and the nation's eighth-largest HMO. It also offers other 
managed-care programs, including a dental and a vision plan.

NEW COSTA MESA CAR DEALERSHIP GETS HAWAIIAN PURIFICATION RITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The growth of Orange County's international business community not only 
expands trade, it also exposes executives and workers to new and different ways 
of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees of South Coast Acura in Costa Mesa received a lesson in cultural 
diversity Tuesday as they watched a traditional Hawaiian purification and 
blessing ceremony held to help ease the dealership's move into its new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast, formerly situated in Huntington Beach, is owned by Tony 
Management Group, a Honolulu-based company that has one other California 
dealership and four auto dealerships, a camper shell factory and an auto paint 
and body shop in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Masamitsu, company owner, said the ceremony is part of the Hawaiian 
culture and often is conducted in the islands in concert with religious 
blessing ceremonies at the opening of businesses owned by Japanese, Chinese or 
Korean investors. Masamitsu, accompanied by his wife, daughter and several 
associates, flew in from Honolulu for the brief ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Masamitsu asked David Nuuhiwa of Anaheim, an elder in the Mormon church and a 
native Hawaiian, to perform the purification rite at the Costa Mesa dealership, 
formerly the location of Norm Reeves Acura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nuuhiwa -- pronounced New-ew-HEE-vah -- began the ceremony with a prayer, in 
Hawaiian, asking that the business and all those working there be blessed with 
good things. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a white suit, symbol of purity, and a flowing lei of Mallee leaves 
from Hawaii, Nuuhiwa then slowly walked through the dealership's showroom, 
offices, service area and back lot, sprinkling salty water from the tips of a 
whisk made of Ti leaves. The bitter-tasting salt water, made from Hawaiian rock 
salt, is used to drive away evil and open the building to goodness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was interesting," said Mark Striggles, general sales manager for the 
dealership. "I've never seen this before, so I learned something."

will report directly to Irvine Co.Chairman Donald Bren. 
</P>
<P>
 "As our company continues to adjust to the dramatic changes in the real estate 
industry, I believe we will benefit greatly from Mike's wise counsel based on 
his substantial experience with publicly traded companies," Bren said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 McKee expects to resign his Latham post by mid-April. Latham, a large 
accounting firm, has not yet selected a replacement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer with a strong background in public stock offerings, McKee has been 
involved in real estate investment trusts since 1979. He worked on the initial 
public offering by Irvine Apartment Communities last year, which raised nearly 
$200 million, and has helped prepare stock offerings for such companies as 
Health Care Property Investors in Los Angeles, Sunrise Medical Inc. in 
Torrance, PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in Cypress and Salick Health Care Inc. 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 McKee's strong background in the public markets is another signal that the 
Irvine Co. continues to look in that direction for its growth capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is no secret there is a repositioning in the real estate 
industry toward public markets and the Irvine Co. is on record that they are 
exploring a lot of those avenues," McKee said. "I hope to help them continue 
looking at ways to access capital." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co.'s general counsel, Peter Zeughauser, was promoted to senior 
vice president and retains the title and responsibilities of general counsel. 
He will report to McKee.

FLUOR CONFIRMS THAT IT IS OPENING OFFICES IN VIETNAM; TRADE: COMPANY BECOMES 
THE FIRST MAJOR U.S. ENGINEERING FIRM TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY 
CLINTON'S ENDING OF EMBARGO. 
</P>

<P>
 In a widely expected move, Fluor Corp. on Tuesday confirmed that it will 
become the first major U.S. engineering company to open trade offices in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineering giant has already opened a small office in Hanoi. It will be 
followed by a similar one in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, in a few 
weeks, said company spokeswoman Deborah Land. The offices come after 
Irvine-based Fluor received licenses from the Vietnamese government March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really focusing initially at looking at the opportunities in the oil 
and gas industry," Land said. "That is one of our strengths. Vietnam has a 
great deal of those resources. That doesn't mean we're not open to other 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 While Fluor's preparing to conduct business in Vietnam may rankle those 
concerned about the Communist government's human rights violations or with 
lingering memories of the war, Land said the company feels that it "can be a 
better force for change inside a country than outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor closed at $50.75 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.375. In 
its most recent earnings report, Fluor said its first-quarter earnings 
increased 23% to $44 million on revenue of $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's entry into Vietnam was considered inevitable because of its 
engineering expertise in natural resources development, which Vietnam sorely 
needs. Company officials said in February that it considered Vietnam a new 
target for sales when President Clinton ordered the longstanding embargo of the 
Asian nation lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobil Oil Corp. discovered oil off Vietnam in 1975 just as the war was ending, 
and the country is considered to have some of the last large, unexplored oil 
tracts on earth. The East-West Institute, a think tank based in Hawaii, 
estimates that Vietnam has 1.7 billion barrels of oil reserves and that 
production could double to 350,000 barrels a day by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor is active throughout the Far East, with projects ranging from a chemical 
plant in Singapore to an oil refinery in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have expected American companies to pursue business in Vietnam for quite a 
while now," said John N. Simon, an analyst for the Seidler Cos. brokerage in 
Los Angeles. "For a company of the international status of Fluor, I would be 
surprised if they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon said Fluor might not search for oil itself but would benefit by 
"providing the infrastructure for companies looking for it." 
</P>
<P>
 George Fischer, publisher of the Fischer Report newsletter in Costa Mesa, 
which chronicles the awarding of foreign contracts, said the Fluor move "was as 
predictable as anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company will find a major new pool of business in Vietnam, though 
it may have to fight for its share of the work from rival Bechtel Corp. of San 
Francisco and foreign-based engineering companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a first-class company, probably the best-managed engineering company 
in the United States," Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bechtel spokeswoman, Christina Bruno, said her company won't immediately 
follow suit. "We see Vietnam as a potential for growth but as for now, I can't 
say we have any plans for an office."

 On the Board: In a recent study, the Washington-based watchdog organization 
Hispanic Assn. on Corporate Responsibility arrived at an eye-opening 
conclusion. Last year, Latinos held director positions at only 94 of the 1,000 
largest U.S. companies -- and none at Orange County's five Fortune 500 
companies. However, three of the county's Service 500 companies have Latinos in 
their boardrooms: drug distributor Bergen Brunswig in Orange; engineering firm 
Fluor Corp. in Irvine; and Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Newport Beach.

EDISON EXHIBITION HIGHLIGHTS BRIGHT IDEAS FOR SAVING ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cook seafood in eight minutes with no frying pans in an electric oven with 
recycled heat. Warm up a room with a flick of the wrist. Read by the light of a 
bulb that lasts 3,000 hours and go to sleep knowing your computer will turn 
itself down when you leave it unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 Such energy-saving techniques were showcased at Southern California Edison's 
energy convention and trade show Tuesday at the Long Beach Arena. Some 180 
exhibitors, including the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and dozens of 
Los Angeles and Orange County companies displayed products and services 
designed to push Southern California's industries into an energy-efficient 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 5,000 visitors are expected to attend the two-day convention, 
concluding today, which features 31 conference sessions on topics ranging from 
supermarket refrigerators to hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 As electric-powered carts glided around the building, scores of business 
people wandered through the exhibit hall looking for conservation ideas. Many 
said they were impressed by the examples of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taken aback. It's awesome," said Kevin Deeley, building engineer for 
Matsushita Co. in Cypress. He had taken note of the air-conditioning systems 
offered by various companies, where many rooms can be controlled by one single 
AC-heating unit called a "ventostat."  
</P>
<P>
 "The energy savings would be phenomenal," he said, adding that he was 
considering implementing it for his 73-room building. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Corbett, Cal State Fullerton's central plant and utilities manager, 
discussed the campus's recent $6-million lighting and temperature make-over as 
an example of what homes and businesses could do to save energy. 
</P>
<P>
 If homeowners did similar make-overs on their homes, they could apply for 
lending programs that allow the cost of such energy-efficiency devices to be 
added to the mortgage. Savings from lower energy use would go to pay back the 
loan, according to exhibitors of the California Home Energy Efficiency Rating 
System Inc., a nonprofit corporation of utility companies and consumer groups 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Wendy Lloyd said the program, which was introduced to California 
last year, has given out 30 mortgages and 12,000 free ratings in Northern 
California, where the program began. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the products offered, such as infrared cooking appliances, 
remote-controlled temperature gauges, computers and printers programmed to shut 
themselves down from 180 to five watts of power when unused, an electronic 
ballast that offer 10% brighter light than fluorescent lamps at half the 
wattage and refrigerators with less ozone-depleting fluorocarbons have been on 
the market for some time. But exhibits at this convention offered the latest 
and most sophisticated among those available, said Southern California Edison 
spokesman Bruce Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much about new technologies as about new applications of 
technologies," he said.

SHRINKING ARSENAL; IS CONSOLIDATION SLIPPING OUT OF DEFENSE INDUSTRY'S CONTROL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William Perry has said that the Pentagon wants an orderly 
consolidation of the defense industry in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Wall Street has in mind may be something much different: a fast-paced 
auction of weaker contractors, in which investment bankers and major investors 
will be calling many of the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 That became apparent last week when a $1.9-billion bid by Martin Marietta 
Corp. for Grumman Corp. prompted a rival $2-billion offer by Northrop Corp., 
creating a hostile battle of prime contractors. It marked the beginning of a 
fight that is likely to change the insulated and clubby defense business 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman had little apparent interest in forfeiting its independence last year 
when it quietly discussed a possible "merger of equals" with Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
 But the very discussions with Northrop put Grumman into play as an acquisition 
candidate, and its investment banker, Goldman Sachs, later put together the 
deal with Martin Marietta without any other bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Northrop officials admit they don't understand the swift turn of events 
and why they were not allowed to make a bid. "We don't know what happened," 
said James G. Roche, Northrop's vice president for advanced planning and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 One clear winner, however, is Goldman Sachs. It stands to earn huge fees -- 
estimated by one competitor at $20 million -- a far higher profit rate than 
what the Defense Department would typically pay a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fight for Grumman and past takeovers in other industries are any 
indication, the defense business is likely to quickly lose some control of its 
destiny. If so, the Pentagon has no guarantees that the consolidation would not 
leave gaping holes in its weapons suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one investment banker knowledgeable about the current takeover 
battle, Grumman executives never anticipated that their talks with Northrop 
would lead to an unwanted bidding war. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, Goldman approached Martin Marietta and negotiated a deal, 
without seeking a bid from Northrop -- prompting Northrop's hostile bid. A 
Goldman spokesman declined to comment on its role, or on its potential fees 
from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Northrop itself is now seen as vulnerable to a hostile takeover 
bid, whether it gets Grumman or not. Without Grumman, it lacks the scale to 
compete in the collapsing defense market; with Grumman, it would be a valuable 
breakup target with weak defenses, according to the investment banker.  
</P>
<P>
 If a hostile offer is made for Northrop, it could come from an industry 
outsider collaborating with Martin to break up the company along with Grumman 
and parcel out pieces to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a risk that steps you take down a path in a consolidation cannot be 
retraced," said John Harbison, an aerospace consultant at Booz Allen & 
Hamilton. "That fear has prevented a number of companies I am involved with 
from taking an initial step." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has paid scant attention to how this consolidation process would 
actually work, preferring so far to keep its hands off the process. Indeed, 
spokesmen for the department could not identify any officials or staff with 
direct responsibility for merger oversight or policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In congressional testimony, Perry allowed that the Pentagon "has an enormous 
interest in maintaining this (industrial) base in some sort of a healthy way" 
and projected that the consolidation would take three to four years to be 
completed. But he offered little insight into how government interests would be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Martin Chairman Norman Augustine warned the Pentagon last year 
that its indifference could have grave consequences for national security. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy speech to the American Bar Assn., Augustine said the Clinton 
Administration and Congress "must be involved in considering what policies 
should be brought to bear as we shrink America's defense industrial base. And 
as tempting as it may be, the U.S. government cannot simply step back from the 
fray and let the forces of the free-enterprise system solve the problem for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The potential problem envisioned by Augustine was that decision makers in 
private industry have no obligation or incentive to preserve an adequate 
industrial base to serve the Pentagon and that the stakes are so high for 
national security that the Pentagon should not leave such matters to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say that an acquisition of Grumman by Northrop would better serve 
the government, because Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa has placed a high value on 
Grumman's aircraft operations, while Augustine does not want to be an aircraft 
builder. 
</P>
<P>
 Another crucial issue in the consolidation is antitrust policy. So far, the 
federal government has accommodated all but one proposed merger.  
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission blocked a merger between Alliant Techsystems and 
Olin Ordnance in 1992 on grounds that it would leave the Pentagon with only one 
producer of artillery rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of that decision is that the Army is not procuring any artillery 
rounds currently and that both firms are struggling to maintain an adequate 
revenue base. The ammunition industry is also widely considered the weakest and 
most vulnerable part of the industrial base. 
</P>
<P>
 "One problem with allowing the market to determine the consolidation is that 
you reduce your ability to influence an end structure that most benefits the 
government," Harbison said. "There are certainly many industries where the 
winner of an acquisition battle ends up with so much baggage that they are 
seriously hurt in their ability to serve customers."

BANKER VANISHES; MEXICAN STOCKS FALL 67.85 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 The apparent kidnaping of the chairman of Mexico's largest bank caused Mexican 
stock prices -- which have been sliding since the New Year's Day rebellion in 
Southern Mexico -- to tumble again Tuesday as investors questioned the nation's 
potential as a model for Third World reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid official silence, Mexican newspapers reported that Alfredo Harp Helu, a 
billionaire financier who heads Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, was taken 
from his car Monday morning by armed men as he was driving near his home in the 
fashionable Mexico City suburb of Coyoacan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything appears to indicate that there was a kidnaping," said a Mexican 
law-enforcement official who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The news comes after the shock of the bloody peasant uprising in Chiapas and 
the possible rogue presidential candidacy of Chiapas peace envoy Manuel Camacho 
Solis. The prospect of a Camacho candidacy has troubled some investors worried 
both about his commitment to Salinas-style economic reforms and to political 
continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor problems also loom, notably a threatened strike by Aeromexico pilots 
scheduled to begin March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disappearance of Harp, 50, a rising star in Mexican business and 
closely identified with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's economic 
policies, was a particular blow to investors and a reminder of the risks still 
present in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa stock index closed down 67.85 points, or 2.8%, at 2,362.03. The 
Bolsa is down more than 9% since the start of the year, and the peso has been 
sliding against the dollar, chiefly due to concerns among foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Bello, a Latin American markets analyst with Morgan Stanley in New 
York, said the apparent kidnaping hurt the Mexican market because Harp is "a 
very visible businessman and associated with the group of Salinas. . . . It's 
another negative after Chiapas." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp's company is a financial services giant that operates Banco Nacional de 
Mexico, or Banamex, the nation's largest bank in terms of assets, with about 
$45 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unclear late Tuesday was whether the kidnaping was politically motivated 
or one of the growing number of abductions for ransom, a burgeoning industry in 
Mexico and a source of worry for Mexico's colony of foreign executives. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 businessmen were kidnaped in Mexico City alone last year, and scores 
of abductions were reported in other cities, including Tijuana, Chihuahua and 
Durango, according to published reports.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike U.S. law, victims' families are not required by Mexican law to report 
kidnapings and often negotiate secretly with abductors to pay ransoms totaling 
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Banamex officials nor the federal attorney general's office for the 
federal district of Mexico City would comment on the disappearance of Harp, 
except to quote from a three-paragraph news release issued by Banamex late 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The release confirmed the banker's disappearance but stated that the bank 
would have no further comment so as to protect Harp's physical safety. The bank 
also said it has asked that the government not intervene in Harp's 
disappearance, a common occurrence when families are negotiating with 
kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Federal Judicial Police have formed a special unit to investigate 
kidnapings in response to an increase in abductions for ransom during recent 
years.

 In another blow to the region's manufacturing sector and economy, Aluminum Co. 
of America said Tuesday that it will close a 56-year-old plant in Vernon, 
leading to the loss of 700 jobs there. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came after the world's largest aluminum producer failed to win wage 
concessions from 440 union employees. Alcoa said labor costs at the plant -- 
which supplies the declining aerospace industry with aircraft skins and 
skeletons -- are not competitive. The Pittsburgh-based company said production 
will be transferred to plants in Cleveland, Baltimore and Chandler, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa is the third major aluminum processor in Southern California to close 
over the last two years, a result of sharp cuts in the commercial aircraft 
industry. Taken with Alcoa, the closings of Aluminum Forge of Santa Ana and 
International Light Metals of Torrance account for the loss of about 2,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa said the plant, which employed 1,140 in 1990, will be gradually shut 
down over the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the Alcoa plant is especially a blow to Vernon, which has lost 
16,000 high-paying, skilled manufacturing jobs in the last decade as Alcoa 
scaled down and such industrial firms as Bethlehem Steel and Oscar Mayer pulled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned . . . we had no idea this was coming," said Vernon City 
Administrator Bruce Malkenhorst. He said the city is trying to come up with 
strategies to attract new jobs, including building a municipal gas pipeline 
system that would supply manufacturers more cheaply than Southern California 
Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturing in California is really taking a beating in this recession," 
said Adrian Sanchez, an economist with First Interstate Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say the bad news is far from over. The UCLA Business Forecasting 
Project recently projected that aerospace employment in California will drop to 
147,000 by the year 2002 -- down 56% from 1990 -- the result of defense 
cutbacks and weakness in the commercial aircraft business. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa said it moved to close the plant after union members -- to the shock of 
United Auto Workers leadership -- voted against discussing concessions with the 
company. Bruce Lee, UAW regional director, said he urged several hundred Alcoa 
union employees attending a meeting Saturday to at least hear Alcoa out, 
especially given Southern California's shaky economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I don't like to operate in the dark and that there is no risk in 
at least finding out what Alcoa wants. If they want $10 an hour, and we don't 
like it, then we can reject it," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said that every union member who spoke at the three-hour meeting opposed 
talks with Alcoa, even though the company had made it clear the plant would 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their (union members) position was that they had made enough sacrifices over 
the years and that they had gone as far as they were going," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 UAW negotiator Ned Scott said that over the last several years, union 
employees had forgone wage increases and had accepted less vacation, with the 
maximum reduced to four weeks from 10. Hourly wages at the plant ranged from $8 
to $15, according to the UAW. Alcoa said average hourly compensation for each 
employee -- a figure that includes the value of health insurance and other 
benefits -- was $23. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials estimated that from 30% to 40% its members at the plant are 
eligible for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa declined to say how much money it wanted to save through concessions at 
the plant, a major supplier to Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa's action also comes amid a worldwide slump in aluminum manufacturing, 
triggered by a sharp boost in exports from the former Soviet Union. Alcoa cut 
production by 25% last fall and another 10% in February in an attempt to help 
stabilize the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa said it will take a $50-million first-quarter charge for the cost of 
closing the plant, an amount expected to wipe out any earnings in the quarter 
for the company.

JAMES FLANIGAN: CLINTON'S GAME OF CHICKEN WITH CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sudden, extraordinary tension between the United States and China threatens to 
back President Clinton into a corner over the issue of renewing 
most-favored-nation trade status for China in June. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton doesn't renew MFN -- which allows Chinese goods into the U.S. 
market on terms accorded other trading partners -- U.S. business prospects in 
China, which is growing into one of the world's largest markets, could suffer a 
long-term body blow. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Clinton approves MFN without China's leadership making gestures to 
placate U.S. concerns on human rights, he will look weak -- like the proverbial 
"paper tiger" as Mao Tse-tung put it -- and that also could have major economic 
and political repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on and what's the likely outcome of a dispute that means a lot, 
in terms of business and global politics, for years and decades to come? 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in what looks like a high-stakes game of chicken, is pressing to both 
open markets and move Asia toward political democracy.  
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher went to Beijing last weekend to talk to 
China's leaders about political reform and improving their record on human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But his overtures were rudely rejected. Chinese Premier Li Peng said his 
country would never accept the U.S. "concept of human rights" and warned that 
U.S. business would lose out on the big China market to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In that tactic, Li was playing on the future prospects for China -- the 
country of 1.2 billion people that plans to add 100 million phone lines, build 
scores of electric power plants and buy hundreds of airplanes in the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the present, the leverage runs the other way: U.S.-China trade last 
year totaled almost $40 billion, with China taking $9 billion in U.S. exports 
of planes, computers, power generators and chemicals, and the United States 
buying almost $30 billion in Chinese exports of apparel, shoes and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 China thus ran a trade surplus of more than $20 billion. And some members of 
the U.S. Congress see that as a lever to force China's leadership to stop 
mistreating political dissidents and selling weapons to Iran, Pakistan and 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Access to our market is very valuable to them," says Rep. Nancy Pelosi, 
(D-San Francisco). "We're the only country that opens its market so freely to 
their products, and they depend on exports for the growth of their economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, (D-Me.), introduced 
legislation last year tying trade to human rights and that pushed President 
Clinton to make renewal of China's MFN status conditional on "substantial 
progress in human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Now China is calling his play, saying in effect America needs us more than we 
need America. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's bluffing? Both sides, in a way. Pelosi is right that the U.S. market is 
important to China, but she may be overestimating how important. Exports to the 
United States amount to 3% to 6% of China's total output, depending on 
estimates of China's economy, which is comparable to that of California. 
</P>
<P>
 China is growing very fast, especially in coastal areas such as Quangzhou and 
Shanghai. It bought 47 Boeing planes last year and will buy a comparable number 
this year; it has a joint venture building airplanes with McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 China knows it's a hot market and it's capable of applying object lessons. 
Recently, after disputes with Britain over Hong Kong, China handed valuable 
contracts for transit equipment to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But Germany had to kowtow. Chancellor Helmut Kohl flew into Beijing 
accompanied by top executives of 195 German companies, who stayed two weeks and 
tied up business. "Europeans don't care about human rights," mutters one U.S. 
businessman in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now China's leaders are pushing American companies to lobby the U.S. 
government. And U.S. business people seem a bit too ready to cooperate; some of 
them lectured Christopher at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, 
criticizing his emphasis on human rights, which was distasteful, disloyal and 
dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from morality, there is a good, economic reason for U.S. emphasis on 
democratic reforms and human rights. China's present leadership is a corrupt 
remnant left over from communism -- these are the wonderful folks who brought 
you Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically such governments get in the way of the emergence of what is the 
great hope of all poor nations and will be the strength of China: the 
development of a prosperous, growing middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States at its best strives to foster development of a middle class 
and movement toward democracy. Sometimes it succeeds. South Korea, under its 
new President Kim Young Sam, is a good example in Asia. Indonesia could be 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 But where U.S. policy worked patiently with those countries, it is imperative 
with China, which is bigger and much more ambitious to be a great power on its 
own. The result is the current tension, which presents a danger of 
miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States has so many issues with China -- regional peace, North 
Korea, Taiwan, the development of Southeast Asia, that we shouldn't concentrate 
everything on trade," says Michael Oksenberg, head of Honolulu's East-West 
Center for Asia Pacific research. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is likely to happen? A deal will be struck. China, still a poor 
country, needs America; it doesn't want to be totally dependent on Japan. In 
fact, China has recently concluded strategic military agreements with the 
United States. China will probably send olive branches between now and June -- 
"I tell them relations with America are a Chinese question, they must make the 
moves," says a Chinese banker in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clinton Administration likely will find evidence of human rights 
progress and renew MFN. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tactic really does move China toward political reform, it will be a 
success. If it only makes for another year of trade, there will be other, 
tougher battles to come. 
</P>

HONDA PAYOLA WENT ON FOR YEARS, FBI SAYS; INQUIRY: OBSERVERS ASK HOW THE 
COMPANY COULD HAVE ALLOWED SUCH A WIDESPREAD ILLICIT ENTERPRISE TO CONTINUE FOR 
SO LONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not long after Donald Carlton was picked to open a new Honda dealership in 
Puyallup, Wash., he traveled to Southern California to personally thank S. 
James Cardiges, the company's senior vice president of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Carlton show his appreciation? According to the FBI, the men met at a 
Laguna Niguel hotel bar and Carlton handed a briefcase containing $250,000 to 
Cardiges, who stashed the cash in the attic of his $770,000 Laguna Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged bribe is one of many that Cardiges and other former Honda 
executives are accused of accepting over more than a decade in return for 
awarding hard-to-get Honda and Acura dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a federal grand jury in Concord, N.H., indicted Cardiges and four 
others on charges that they illegally pocketed more than $10 million in bribes 
and kickbacks from car dealers. Philip Israels, Cardiges' attorney, said 
Tuesday that his client "will be cleared" in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, eight other former Honda employees have entered guilty pleas 
to charges related to illegal payments. They are cooperating with investigators 
in return for leniency in sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This had been rumored for some time among dealers," said Maynard Gordon, the 
Detroit editor of Dealer Business, a trade magazine. "Payola was known to be 
par for the course." 
</P>
<P>
 Payment of bribes and kickbacks is not unknown in the auto industry -- 
particularly when demand arises for hot products. Toyota faced a similar 
scandal about two decades ago, and corruption hit some U.S. auto makers after 
World War II.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest scandal is a black mark for Honda, whose Accord was the 
best-selling car in America two years ago and whose vehicles and dealerships 
have had a squeaky-clean reputation for quality and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the company said it was "outraged and saddened" by the 
criminal activities and allegations. But officials declined to answer specific 
questions, citing the ongoing federal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, many are asking how Honda could have allowed such a widespread illicit 
enterprise to go unchecked for so long. Further, the disclosures come at a time 
when Honda can least afford damage to its image. Like most other Japanese auto 
makers, it is losing market share to rebounding U.S. competitors.  
</P>
<P>
 A close-knit company known for going its own way, Honda has one of the 
leanest, lowest-paid staffs in the business. Cardiges earned $143,000 in 1992 
-- perhaps 25% below the industry average, consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys probably took credit for Honda's success and decided they were 
entitled to more compensation," said C.R. Brown, chief operating officer of Los 
Alamitos-based Daihatsu America. "And they evidently found an avenue to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of the scandal were sown in the early 1980s, when Japanese cars were 
riding a crest of popularity among baby boomers. The quality of Honda's Accord 
family sedan was considered to be so high that many buyers were willing to pay 
as much as $2,000 above the sticker price. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. trade policies fed the fever. The struggling Big Three auto makers sought 
trade protection from Japanese imports. In response, the Japanese assented to a 
voluntary restraint agreement, making buyer competition for the most popular 
cars even keener. 
</P>
<P>
 In that atmosphere, Honda dealerships became extremely valuable, and 
executives at American Honda Motor Co.'s headquarters in Torrance had the power 
to award them. That was John Billmyer's job from 1983 to 1988. The federal 
indictment charges Billmyer, 64, with conspiring with other Honda officials to 
accept bribes for granting Honda and Acura dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of charges revolve around Cardiges, 48, who worked for Honda from 
1977 to 1992. According to the indictment and other court filings, Cardiges, 
whose last post was senior vice president of sales, engaged in numerous illegal 
activities to enrich himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court affidavit, FBI special agent William Tidyman described the bribe 
Carlton allegedly paid Cardiges in exchange for his dealership in Washington 
state: 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton's wife, Judy, told the FBI that she traveled with her husband from 
their home in Tulsa, Okla., to Palm Springs in 1989 or 1990. While there, her 
husband received a box in the mail that contained between $200,000 and 
$250,000. Later, during a stay at an Orange County hotel, her husband handed 
Cardiges the briefcase with cash. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carlton later divorced his wife, she threatened to disclose the the 
alleged bribe. Cardiges then ordered Carlton to back out of the deal to start 
up the new dealership. Cardiges also prepared a "bogus promissory note" of 
$250,000, the affidavit alleges, to disguise the bribe paid for the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Cardiges also received kickbacks totaling 
$100,000 for steering Honda sales trainees to seminars with a particular 
training company. Cardiges also received kickbacks for directing advertising 
and direct-mail dealer contracts to a specified vendor, the indictment says.

agreement to merge in a stock swap valued at about $525 million. The deal is 
subject to numerous conditions, including approval by regulators and 
shareholders.The two companies dominate the market for personal computer 
programs that let people create documents, such as newsletters. John Warnock, 
chairman and chief executive of Adobe, would lead the merged company, which 
would be based in Adobe's hometown of Mountain View, Calif. Paul Brainerd, 
president and founder of Seattle-based Aldus, would become a member of the new 
company's board. Aldus climbed 75 cents to $26.25 on Nasdaq, while Adobe, also 
on Nasdaq, fell $1.25 to $32.50. The deal was announced after the market 
closed.

EDISON DEAL SEEKS TO AVOID POWER AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move to stave off a disputed power-purchase auction mandated by 
state regulators, Southern California Edison Co. reached a separate agreement 
Tuesday to buy power from one of the bidders: Kenetech Corp., a wind energy 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison has asked the state Public Utilities Commission, which is due to 
consider the controversial auction at a San Francisco meeting today, to approve 
its preliminary agreement to buy 500 megawatts of power from San 
Francisco-based Kenetech and throw out the other bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the first 250 megawatts of power would be purchased only 
after Edison customers -- perhaps by polling -- approved paying higher rates 
for the energy. The second half would be bought later than the auction 
requires. In all, Edison would be buying just 60% of the energy that was to be 
purchased at the auction. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Edison petitioned the commission to free it entirely from the 
auction, mandated under a PUC requirement that the state's major investor-owned 
utilities meet part of their future needs with electricity from wind, solar, 
geothermal or biomass sources. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. had disputed other 
aspects of the bidding process. But Edison contended that it did not need the 
extra power -- it already buys more than 23% of its electricity from renewable 
sources -- and that buying it under the terms of the auction would increase 
ratepayers' costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC auction could cost Edison customers as much as $500 million more, said 
Vikram Budhraja, an Edison vice president.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the agreement, Kenetech was a strong critic of Edison's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have done is negotiated an agreement with Edison that goes beyond 
what we would have been awarded" under the preliminary rankings in the bidding, 
said Clarence Grebey, Kenetech spokesman. "The pricing is different than would 
be required under the (PUC) formula." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold F. Koegler, president of San Rafael-based FloWind Corp, a rival wind 
energy firm, said his company will petition the PUC to require that FloWind be 
included in the negotiations. "We are shocked by this last-minute activity to 
try to do an end run," he said.

IMMIGRATION STATUS OF DRYWALL WORKERS PROBED; LABOR: BORDER PATROL EXPANDS ITS 
INQUIRY AFTER FINDING HUNDREDS EMPLOYED ILLEGALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After finding that more than half the 800 workers employed by five Southern 
California drywall companies last year were illegal immigrants, the U.S. Border 
Patrol has begun investigating the hiring records of 46 more drywall companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, expected to last through mid-June, involves companies in Orange, 
Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego and San Bernardino counties that together 
employed about 3,000 residential drywall installers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the workers are members of Carpenters Union Local 2361 in Orange, but 
the union is not being targeted in the investigation, said David Garrett, 
supervising agent of the Border Patrol's employer sanctions unit in Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 If the inquiry leads to the barring of hundreds of illegal immigrants from the 
industry, as Border Patrol officials intend, labor shortages and construction 
slowdowns could occur just as the Southern California housing industry is 
beginning to recover from four years of deep recession.  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation has angered several drywall companies. Their contract with 
the carpenters union calls for the union to screen workers and verify their 
eligibility to work legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Hubbell, the drywall union contract administrator for the Southern 
California Conference of Carpenters, acknowledged that the pact calls for the 
union to screen workers. But he called the screening clause an effort by the 
union to assist employers and not something that means the union will assume 
their legal responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Drywall workers in Southern California's residential building industry, 
complaining of exploitation by employers because they were not members of a 
union, conducted a five-month wildcat strike in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation of drywall -- an inexpensive and near-universal replacement 
for plaster finishes on the interior walls of homes -- tends to draw illegal 
immigrants because the work is transitory and does not require much training or 
knowledge of English. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett said federal law holds employers responsible for verifying legal 
status. The contract between the drywall companies and the union is a civil 
contract and does not relieve employers of their responsibility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the five companies initially investigated by Garrett's agents, SMR 
Drywall Inc. in Lake Elsinore, is being fined $17,500 because it has not 
maintained worker eligibility records since the union contract took effect in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 117 workers employed by the small company last year, the Border Patrol 
agents identified 26 as illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Duddy, SMR Drywall's chief executive, said he intends to file an 
administrative appeal of the fine.  
</P>
<P>
 The Border Patrol said the investigation began in December when agents in 
Temecula arrested a suspected illegal immigrant and found payroll stubs from 
five drywall companies in Riverside and Orange counties.

ALASKA AIRLINES MAKES TICKETS REFUNDABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alaska Airlines said Tuesday that it has made all of its tickets -- including 
those sold at a discount -- refundable, becoming the most recent carrier to 
reduce restrictions on cheap air fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as consumers are concerned . . . it's a win," said Donald S. Garvett, 
an airline consultant at Simat, Helliesen & Eichner in New York. "It removes 
what could be burdensome and possibly expensive restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Southwest Airlines changed its discount fare policy, making all 
tickets fully refundable and eliminating other conditions that limited the use 
of discount tickets. Several of Southwest's rivals, such as United Airlines, 
also adopted the changes on competing routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska Airlines said its revisions are aimed at simplifying often complex fare 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, only Alaska customers who bought full-price coach or first-class 
tickets were eligible for refunds. But during fare wars, the Seattle-based 
airline also made discount tickets refundable -- sometimes. And sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mess," company spokesman Lou Cancelmi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, Alaska's discount tickets are refundable -- minus a $35 
fee. The fee also applies to customers who need to change their itinerary after 
purchasing tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refundability factor makes it attractive for someone to come to Alaska," 
Cancelmi said.  
</P>
<P>
 United said Tuesday that it will also offer refundable discount tickets on 
routes that compete with Alaska, while American Airlines said it is still 
studying the option. Delta Air Lines will not match the offer, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska's revisions do not go as far as Southwest's. On discount fares 
purchased 14 days in advance of travel, Southwest also eliminated a restriction 
that has rankled budget-minded business travelers: the Saturday night 
stay-over. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most business travelers want to return home in time for the weekend, 
few wanted to meet that requirement and, as a result, paid full price.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the new fares are flexible enough for both leisure and business 
travelers," Southwest spokeswoman Linda Burke said. (On fares purchased seven 
days in advance, Southwest still requires a one-night stay, but it can be any 
night of the week.) 
</P>
<P>
 The first significant move to simplify fare rules came about two years ago 
when American launched its ill-fated Value Pricing program, which reduced the 
thousands of different fares and related restrictions. The only feature of 
Value Pricing that has survived allows discount passengers to reuse their 
tickets at a later date for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite potential financial risks, airlines are expected to continue easing 
fare restrictions. For example, by eliminating Saturday night stay 
requirements, an airline might end up selling fewer full-fare tickets to 
business travelers. That could add financial stress to carriers, which have 
long used such barriers to boost revenue, Garvett said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to make it up somewhere," Garvett said. "They might have to charge 
more in the long run."

ROCKWELL NAMES NEW PRESIDENT OF STRUGGLING ROCKETDYNE DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. on Tuesday named Paul B. Smith president of its 
Rocketdyne division, the space shuttle's engine builder that has struggled with 
budget cuts and quality problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith succeeds Robert D. Paster, who was reassigned as president of one of 
Rockwell's defense electronics units after 4 1/2 years as head of the Canoga 
Park-based Rocketdyne operation.The company described the transfer as routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 53, has been Rockwell's senior vice president for operations and 
earlier headed its tactical missile programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Paster, 53, becomes head of the Autonetics Electronic Systems division in 
Anaheim, which makes guidance and control equipment for missiles and ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, a Seal Beach-based concern that also has interests in auto parts, 
industrial automation and telecommunications, said the changes reflect its 
"practice of rounding out members of our top management team" with varying job 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes do not reflect dissatisfaction with Paster's performance at 
Rocketdyne, spokesman William Mellon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paster nonetheless is handing Rocketdyne's reins to Smith at a difficult 
period for the subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being the renowned builder of engines for the shuttle and the Atlas 
and Delta launch rockets, Rocketdyne has been hurt by spending cuts in U.S. 
space programs, including the proposed space station, whose power system is 
being developed by Rocketdyne. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Rocketdyne has pared its work force to about 6,900 today from 
9,500 in late 1989.

 Court Holds Fund Operators in Contempt: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission's Los Angeles office said U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi issued 
a contempt order against Jack Nicholes D'Uva, Mark Thomas Taggatz and Alliance 
Global Asset Management for violating previous court orders.The defendants were 
charged a year ago with the fraudulent offering and sale of partnership units 
in nine non-existent mutual funds. The SEC contends that the defendants "have 
continued to fraudulently operate Alliance as an unregistered investment 
adviser," soliciting investors via cold calls and falsely stating that the 
company has a successful three-year operating history. Alliance Global is 
unrelated to the New York-based Alliance Capital fund group.

 Powerine Oil Co. to Pay $104,315 in EPA Case: The U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency said the company will pay that amount to settle alleged 
violations of the federal Clean Air Act at its Santa Fe Springs refinery. Part 
of the act requires refineries to install and operate continuous emissions 
monitoring systems at sulfur recovery plants by Oct. 2, 1991, an EPA 
spokeswoman said, and Powerine installed it in April 1993. In a civil 
complaint, the agency alleged that Powerine also failed to submit semiannual 
reports or to operate and maintain its refinery in a manner consistent with 
good air-pollution control practices.

 NASA to Keep Shuttle Work in Palmdale: About 300 employees of Rockwell 
International will continue modifying the nation's space shuttles under a 
decision by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The space agency 
had considered shifting the work -- in which the shuttles undergo months-long 
changes for upcoming missions -- to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 
Rockwell workers are currently modifying the shuttle Atlantis and are scheduled 
to work on Columbia and Discovery during the next two years, NASA said.

made by the auto maker as part of a program to get 33,000 1987-90 fire-prone 
Nissan XE and GXE vans off the road.The amount owners will receive from the

announced, said Ralph Hoar & Associates, a vehicle safety research firm in 
Arlington, Va. Nissan had no immediate comment from its offices in Gardena on 
the settlement. The coupons are good toward the purchase of a new Nissan 
vehicle.

 Japan's Trade Surplus Up 3.3%: The surplus, measured as goods that have passed 
customs but before seasonal factors have been accounted for, was $10.91 billion 
in February, up from $10.57 billion in the previous month, the finance ministry 
said.The news came as U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told a House 
subcommittee that the United States' second-biggest trading partner must be 
"dramatically more forthcoming" in its efforts to bring that surplus to heel. 
But the surplus with the United States, which represents nearly 40% of the 
total imbalance, declined 0.9% to $4.34 billion, from $4.38 billion a year 
earlier for the first drop in nine months. The decline follows a rise of 7.0% 
in January and 17% in December.

 Chinese Exec Sentenced to Death in Bond Scandal: Shen Taifu, who headed the 
Great Wall Machinery & Electronics Group, was convicted of bribery and 
corruption, Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin said.Li Xiaoshi, a 
former vice minister at the state science and technology commission, received a 
20-year jail term for taking bribes from Shen, Ren said. Ren said the sentences 
were handed down March 4 by a Beijing court, but he did not say whether the 
death sentence has already been carried out. Great Wall attracted thousands of 
small-time investors by offering bonds with far higher yields than 
government-approved issues. After the company collapsed, angry investors 
demanded government compensation for about $115 million.

 JAL to Deepen Pay Cuts: Financially ailing Japan Airlines said it is adding to 
the deeper cuts for its 36 full-time executives. The carrier, which announced 
in January that it would cut 5,000 jobs over the next four years, said the 
executive pay cuts -- effective April 1 -- show JAL's determination to share 
the airline's difficulties with its 22,000 employees.A company statement said 
pay cuts for JAL's chairman and president will be widened to 30% from the 
current 20%, and those of other executives will be expanded by five percentage 
points, to levels ranging from 13% to 25%. The airline suffered a pretax loss 
of $512 million in fiscal 1992 and is expected to suffer a $286-million loss in 
fiscal 1993, which ends March 31.

 Mexico to Take Bids to Operate 16 Cargo Terminals: The government will begin 
taking the bids within two months as part of an effort to privatize the 
country's ports, according to Port Authority President Jaime Corredor. The 
concessions are for six major cargo terminals on Mexico's Pacific Coast and 10 
terminals along the Gulf Coast, Corredor told reporters at a privatization 
conference.Corredor said Mexico is targeting private international port service 
companies with either the expertise, technology or capital to operate the 
terminals. Foreign or domestic companies that have the know-how but little 
capital will have access to "enhanced credit" standing either through loan 
guarantees or other financial assistance from the Nacional Financiera, a 
development bank, said Jose Angel Gurria, the bank's chief executive.

A SHARPER RECEPTION; 'MEDIA LITERACY' CLASSES AIM TO MAKE KIDS MORE FOOLPROOF

 When 16-year-old John Newman plops down in front of the tube, he resents 
what's about to happen. "I know it's a vampire sucking my life away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably, he loses awareness until the flickering images have reduced him to 
a stupor. "I'm an addict," he said. "I can't quit." 
</P>
<P>
 But as a student of media literacy at Studio City's Harvard-Westlake School, 
he's learning he doesn't have to quit. Rather, as his teacher Cheri Gaulke 
tells the students in her yearlong video class, they can pay close attention to 
what's on the screen, evaluate it, and manipulate it before it manipulates 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 What drives media literacy teachers, a growing and passionate breed, is the 
same concern of many other children's advocates: that children mindlessly 
accept as real whatever the commercially based mass media place before them, 
from news broadcasts and Saturday morning "splattertoons" to video games and 
billboards. While newspapers and magazines are scrutinized, too, concern is 
centered on television, most recently on tabloid news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Educators want them to understand that what they're seeing is the result of a 
system, it's completely constructed, that television is not and never will be a 
window on the world. When they finally get that, they have a different 
reality," said Patrick Scott, project coordinator for the Los Angeles-based 
National Alliance for Media Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, aims to identify and 
organize media literacy practitioners in the United States, estimated 
conservatively at 3,500. Scott said recent announcements of the project's 
purpose has resulted in a deluge of calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates comprise a divergent group, from iconoclastic media artists such as 
Gaulke to volunteer parent groups and conservative religious leaders. Many are 
frustrated over high levels of violence or commercial manipulation in the media 
and skeptical of self-regulation by the industry, but are repulsed by efforts 
at censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers focus on news, others on entertainment or advertising. Some 
include video production. Others prefer to teach media literacy as part of 
health or social studies classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate media literacy class at Roosevelt High School in East Los 
Angeles, Susan Boyle has been teaching her students that some Disney animated 
films create stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually what Disney does is take the young woman and render her powerless.... 
The adult woman is usually divided into two roles: the numskull, the chubby 
fairy with a good heart, or the strong woman, like Cruella De Vil, is the witch 
figure. She's also the most interesting, most powerful, and exciting and fun. 
In 'Cinderella,' the prince is almost a nonentity." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaulke points out to her students how newscasters usually lead into a 
commercial with "happy" news. Her students make videos, focusing on deception 
in commercials. In one, "Be All That You Can Be" ads for the U.S. Army are 
spliced with war footage from the film "Jacob's Ladder."  
</P>
<P>
 At Jefferson High, Gina Lamb said her students are often upset at how 
minorities have been portrayed or left out of news and entertainment programs.  
</P>
<P>
 The class "opened my eyes," said Marisela Gomez, 18. She noticed that the 
images of violence aired during the riots made her friends and family afraid of 
their community long afterward. She also noticed that news crews arrived to 
cover riot clean-up efforts in her neighborhood only when actor Edward James 
Olmos came -- not when she and her friends volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the teacher's guidance, Gomez created programs the way she wanted to see 
them. One altered a newscast to delete references to criminal suspects' race. 
Another, titled "Jefferson, 90011," showed her friends displacing the all-white 
cast of "Beverly Hills, 90210."  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have a whole TV perspective," Gomez said. "I want to change TV. I want 
to become a film director to change it." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents agree that it is counterproductive to preach to kids about 
television.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you try to teach that TV is bad for you, or TV is trash, kids reject 
that. It isn't trash to them. It's their culture," said Renee Hobbs, director 
of Harvard University's Institute on Media Education, which trains teachers in 
media literacy.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the quality of the TV that matters," Hobbs added. "It's the quality 
of the skills of the person who uses the TV."  
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists have argued that popular culture has no place in the classroom 
and that students are better off applying critical thinking skills to 
literature. Some students have also complained that the teachers' are trying to 
instill their own form of political correctness.  
</P>
<P>
 But others, impressed by predictions that today's children will have spent 
seven years watching TV by the time they are 70, see the mass media as part of 
an inevitable redefinition of literacy . 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Daley, dean of the USC School of Cinema-Television, said she sees 
media literacy as central to a future liberal arts education. "I don't know how 
you can live in the society we live in and not have some command of film and 
television," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Over 70% of the information we get is from TV or something other than 
straight print. If we look at news and if we don't have any sense of the effect 
of shot sequencing, editing or the sourcing of news, who's taping it, who's 
actually editing it, then we have no way of evaluating what we've seen. We've 
ceased to be literate," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, children's advocates have criticized violence in the news. A 
national survey by Children Now reported that 65% of children 11 to 17 read or 
watch the news and half are left feeling "sad, angry or depressed." More 
studies show that younger children get their information from quasi-news shows 
and "it's increasingly difficult for them to know the difference between news 
and entertainment," said Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Washington, 
D.C.-based Center for Media Education.  
</P>
<P>
 In a speech delivered by television earlier this month to Children Now, First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton also lambasted news violence, saying repeated 
images of children being murdered or molested distorts children's view of 
reality, destroys their faith in authority and institutions and prevents them 
from becoming functioning citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 Debate continues over whether children copy antisocial behavior they see in 
the media. Last year, one teen-ager died after apparently imitating a scene in 
which two characters lie down in the middle of a highway in the film, "The 
Program." Also last year, a toddler died in a fire set by a 5-year-old whose 
mother claimed he was imitating the cartoon series "Beavis and Butt-head." 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School 
of Communications have identified a "mean world syndrome," experienced by 
people who watched more than four hours daily of television. More than light 
viewers, those people tended to assume crime is rising, regardless of the facts 
in their area, and bought more locks, watchdogs and guns for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the debate, the 20-year-old international media literacy movement is now 
picking up speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church in particular, frustrated by news stories about priests 
accused of molesting children, has invested in a national effort to help 
families "decipher a message when they see it," said Ramon Rodriguez, national 
director of Catholic Connections to Media Literacy. His office has commissioned 
Elizabeth Thoman, a Los Angeles nun whose Los Angeles-based Center for Media 
and Values is the largest distributor of media literacy materials in the United 
States, to develop media literacy kits for every school, parish and diocese in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some states, including North Carolina and New Mexico, have moved 
toward media literacy requirements, there is as yet no standard curriculum and 
little funding for training. Meanwhile, some teachers are measuring their 
success in small, subtle increments.  
</P>
<P>
 "My students have said I ruined TV for them," said Harvard-Westlake School's 
Gaulke. "That's the highest compliment."

FIRST PERSON / DAVID SHAW: JUST CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe I'm strange -- various people have suggested that (and worse) over the 
years -- but I've actually enjoyed driving in post-earthquake Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I've lived in Southern California since 1946 and I've driven here since 1959. 
For most of that time, I've been telling out-of-town visitors -- especially 
those smug, if benighted, souls from New York -- that Los Angeles is the most 
manageable big city in the country, if not the world. 
</P>
<P>
 No need for snow tires or topcoats in winter. No need to shower twice a day in 
summer. No standing on the corner, waving futilely at taxis. No bombardment by 
constant noise and hordes of people -- most of them growling like angry bears 
-- as you try to walk down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one feature that made life in Los Angeles most manageable was the very 
feature that outsiders grumbled about the most: the spread-cum-sprawl of the 
city. In L.A, until a few years ago anyway, you were rarely caught in a New 
York-style (or Chicago-, San Francisco-, Paris-, Jerusalem-, Mexico City-style) 
traffic jam -- the vehicular equivalent of Sartre's "No Exit." 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, if you're going to Kennedy Airport, say, and you get stuck in 
traffic on one of the bridges or expressways, you stay stuck in traffic; 
there's no reasonable alternative. But in Los Angeles, you could always find an 
alternate route. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, I've had to find many alternate, non-freeway routes. And 
-- surprise! -- I get where I'm going almost as quickly, sometimes more 
quickly, and with less uncertainty and less stress than I did on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be the first to admit that my daily commute is infinitely easier than 
most. I work Downtown and live 12 minutes away (15 if there's heavy traffic). 
But my wife and I go out several nights a week -- to Santa Monica, Pasadena, 
Beverly Hills, the Valley, everywhere -- and I've been delighted to find that 
driving has generally been, well, a breeze, even during evening rush-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 We used to take the Santa Monica Freeway for most of our trips to the 
Westside. Now I usually stick to surface streets, at least during the week. 
Beverly Boulevard (or Third Street) all the way to Doheny, south to Olympic or 
Pico, then west if I'm going to Beverly Hills or Santa Monica, for example.  
</P>
<P>
 I've gone door-to-door in less than 40 minutes a dozen times since the quake 
-- without the uncertainty I've encountered in recent years on the freeway: 
Would I have clear sailing or inexplicable congestion? In pre-quake days, I 
routinely refused -- except in extraordinary circumstances -- to leave home for 
the Westside before 7:30 on weeknights. Now I leave as early as 5 or 6 o'clock, 
and if I do hit a traffic jam, I take special pleasure in dodging it by 
instantly zigzagging through surrounding residential streets. It adds a new 
dimension to my driving pleasure, without significantly expanding my 
drive-time. 
</P>
<P>
 About a month after the earthquake, I finally decided to try the Santa Monica 
Freeway again. It was a weekend and my wife Lucy was with me, and the car pool 
lanes had us jumping off and back on the freeway quicker than you could say 
"Adriana Gianturco." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus emboldened, I tried to take the Santa Monica Freeway from Downtown to 
West L.A. one weeknight when I had to work late. I left the office a little 
after 8 o'clock. The freeway detour as a solo driver was noticeably longer, but 
it still only added about 10 minutes to my ride. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, who commutes to Century City for work, tells me it now takes her 
10-15 minutes longer each way. I sympathize with her. I sympathize even more 
with the people who now spend an hour or two getting to and from work. But a 
recent story in The Times said that while the earthquake had "adversely 
affected the daily commutes of about 1 million motorists, it has improved the 
drive for about 200,000 others."  
</P>
<P>
 Why? Car pools. Car pool lanes. Mass transit. Flexible work hours. Fewer 
drivers using the freeways.  
</P>
<P>
 One night last week, I undertook the ultimate challenge: I left Downtown at 
5:20 p.m. -- the teeth of rush hour -- bound for Beverly Hills. I cruised west 
on Beverly Boulevard until I approached Vermont. Spotting a bottleneck ahead, I 
hung a quick left and doglegged down to Third Street. Approaching Western, I 
spotted another bottleneck and hung a quick left to Sixth Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But I breezed along Sixth -- one of the great "unknown" east-west arteries in 
town -- until I got to San Vicente. There I encountered my first truly horrific 
traffic jam of my post-quake era: As I approached La Cienega, the left lane was 
blocked by a stalled truck, the right lane was closed for repairs and the 
traffic lights were out in every direction. I had no choice but to inch along 
for what seemed an eternity. But I only had to go one long block; I still 
managed to make the trip in 39 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That drive confirmed what I continue to think is the best feature of driving 
in Los Angeles -- post-quake even more than pre-quake: the ever-popular 
alternate route, a fixture of the Los Angeles road system for so long that it 
once fostered a song ("Take an alternate route, take an alternate route. It's a 
lovely day for an alternate route . . .") 
</P>
<P>
 From where I live, for example, the best way to go to South-Central Los 
Angeles is to take the Hollywood Freeway south to the Harbor Freeway; after the 
earthquake, when I heard a report (erroneous, as it turned out) that the 
Harbor/Santa Monica Freeway connector was damaged, I just took Rampart 
Boulevard to Hoover to Washington to Figueroa to Vernon and hopped back on the 
Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, when I heard a report (accurate this time) that there was a 
problem at the juncture of the Ventura and Hollywood freeways, I just got off 
the Ventura two exits before the problem, zipped along Olive Avenue to Barham 
Boulevard and picked up the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these detours occasioned only a minor delay. For all I know, they 
might have been faster than the freeway, where -- in recent years -- I've 
encountered traffic jams at virtually any time of the day or night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I miss the old days, the days when if you just avoided rush hour, you could 
race down the freeway as fast as you were willing to drive. I love the sense of 
speed and freedom on the freeway, and in those days, traffic jams were so rare 
-- and I drove the freeways so much -- that I prided myself on being able to 
instantly determine, from the flow of traffic, precisely why a freeway was 
suddenly jammed at a given moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Accident? In the traffic lanes? Off to the side? Or was there a big football 
game nearby? Or was it just the looky-loo phenomenon?  
</P>
<P>
 I once stunned an out-of-town visitor by saying, in the midst of a San Diego 
Freeway traffic jam on a warm summer afternoon, "I bet we'll find a 
good-looking woman standing by the side of the freeway with an overheated car 
about a mile ahead, with every guy slowing to look -- but not to help." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 I got cocky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Center divider. Red dress. Blue car," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 I was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Except the car was green. 
</P>
<P>
 I always jump off the freeway the instant I sense a serious traffic problem. 
Life is too short to spend any of it in traffic jams. Especially in Los 
Angeles, a city with even more alternate routes than would-be screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I often skip the freeway altogether. And driving is again as relaxing as 
it was back in the '60s, 70s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra few minutes that some trips now take just make it easier to finish 
smoking my cigar before I get home from dinner.

FAMILY; MAKE A LIST FOR TALK WITH TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN O. RYAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents and teachers share a responsibility in nurturing a child's education. 
Parent-teacher conferences help ensure that both are pushing in the same 
direction to ease a child's progress and difficulties at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how to make these meetings better: 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss the conference ahead of time with your child and take a written list 
of concerns you both have. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, both parents should attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go to the conference open-minded regarding suggestions and observations made 
by the teacher. Be a good listener. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be an advocate for your child. You know your child better than anyone else. 
Share with the teacher information from the home front that may affect your 
child's schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let your child attend with you. This helps resolve conflicting viewpoints 
between teachers and students and keeps things open and honest. It also lets 
your child play a role in problem-solving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out the teacher's attitudes about homework and share your own beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your child experiences difficulties in school, ask the teacher for a 
weekly report and agree to a follow-up conference within six weeks to 
re-evaluate the situation. KATHLEEN O. RYAN

ROBIN ABCARIAN: DESPITE GIGGLES AND LEERS, IT'S SEXISM STRIPPED BARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's unclear why the construction worker in that new Diet Coke commercial has 
to strip off his shirt before downing his drink, but all I can say is, honey, 
it works for me . 
</P>
<P>
 I happen to be very fond of that silly spot. You know the one: Female office 
workers get up from their desks for what you think is their morning break, only 
it turns out it's the gorgeous hunk's morning break, and they want to be at the 
window to witness his every rippling, Coke-hoisting muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can blame them? 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck as they are at their work stations, in the heart of a pink-collar 
ghetto, taking home a fraction of what the thirsty construction worker earns, 
they need a little fantasy to liven their dreary workaday lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So off they trot to the window each morning, staring lustily at the object of 
desire down below. 
</P>
<P>
 And all I can think is: Wouldn't it be nice if we had some construction going 
on outside our offices? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial has caused a fuss, which, of course, is exactly the point. As 
my friend the ad man has taught me, "You're nobody till somebody hates you." 
Likewise, your commercial is nothing till somebody starts hollering about it. 
And voices are rising over this one. 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard women object on the basis that it's pure male fantasy that women 
leer at men the way men do at women. 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard men cluck about "reverse sexism" and ask how anyone who calls 
herself a feminist -- how anyone who thought the Swedish Bikini Team was a new 
low in beer flogging -- can approve of this sort of exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy, I say. 
</P>
<P>
 On a superficial level, the commercial works precisely for the reason some 
people object. It turns sexism on its head. Which makes it funny, because in 
the context of the rigid gender roles of television advertising, you don't 
expect a lot of mousy little secretaries to have any sexuality at all, let 
alone a leering, ooh-baby-ooh daily ritual of communal lust. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the easy part, the part that makes some of us feminists chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 What doesn't make us laugh -- but what should hearten folks who object to this 
role reversal -- is what's happening on a deeper level. Far from being an 
example of reverse sexism (a false concept anyhow, to be addressed in a 
moment), the commercial is business as usual: plain old-fashioned sexism in a 
new wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
 It patronizes women by keeping them in their place. First off, the ogling 
women are clerical workers, toilers unleashed from their desks during 
pre-appointed 10-minute breaks. Second, they do their fantasizing in secret, 
from afar. Women are not allowed the boisterous expression of sexuality allowed 
construction workers (we know what nasty labels await the ones who violate this 
social taboo). Women are to be unseen and unheard, like children at the top of 
the stairs, looking down at Mommy and Daddy's dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one advertising agency's creative director in a Newsweek story about the 
commercial: "These women are ogling secretly; they have a distance that 
separates them. It's not a glass ceiling but a glass window." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty perceptive. For a man. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a sexist joke. But it wasn't reverse sexism. I don't believe in the 
concept, and even if I did, it isn't present in this commercial. Reverse sexism 
implies there is a parallel world where women control the economy and the 
government, where men are expected to serve biology -- their highest calling 
being stay-at-home father -- as they fight for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Diet Coke spot were based on reverse sexism, the man would have to be 
working for a woman-owned company, in which women consistently out-earned the 
men. The men would have to be frustrated by the lack of men at the top. They 
would have to bemoan the fact that a huge chunk of their paycheck goes for 
child care and that every time their kid gets sick, they have to take time off 
from work or arrange for special care. The male middle managers would have to 
feel they just had nowhere to go but sideways after reaching a certain level of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Down at the bottom rungs, the construction worker would have to feel that he 
was hired only because his physical package is so perfect, and that pounding 
nails better than all the gals wasn't enough to get promoted; that taking his 
shirt off was the only sure way to get noticed by his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 To really drive home the point, our bare-chested young man would have to be 
just a tiny bit nervous as he walked purposefully to his car every night, 
looking straight ahead, wondering if one of those leering ladies from next door 
might be capable of actually harming him. 
</P>
<P>
 An impossibly silly scenario, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 But, honey, it works for me.

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: CONNECTICUT HAIKU GOES HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: New Yorker magazine editor Tina Brown's dinner Monday at the Hotel 
Bel-Air celebrating a special issue, "The New Yorker Goes to the Movies." On 
newsstands this week, it's devoted entirely to film. Gore Vidal thought the 
issue was a good idea because, "Movies are really the only thing the world 
knows anything about. So if you're going to cover the world this is what 
everyone knows about. Forget the other arts, alas." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Subtext to the evening: The old line about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, 
"She gave him sex appeal, he gave her class," applies equally well to the New 
Yorker/Hollywood fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Mega-turnout. It's not often a guest list ranges from Robin 
Williams to Lassie. Among the 250 guests were Brown and husband Harold Evans, 
Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, Barbra Streisand, Whoopi Goldberg, Steven 
Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, Rosie Perez, Glenn Close, Michael and Jane Eisner, 
Lee Radziwill, Mike Medavoy, William Friedkin and Sherry Lansing, Dominick 
Dunne, Arianna Huffington, Betty and Richard Koshalek, Ed Ruscha, John Lithgow, 
Doug Cramer, Roddy McDowall, Bobby Short, Al Ruddy, Joel Silver, Oliver Stone, 
Raquel Welch, Billy Wilder and CAA's Mike Ovitz, who is referred to in one New 
Yorker article as "lord high suzerain of the entertainment universe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of the Room: Mostly they talked about who was there. "It's sort of 
interesting seeing people from different worlds and who makes the cut," said 
writer Lynn Hirschberg. Talent agent Joan Hyler said it was, "an extremely 
diva-laden evening." Those who'd read the issue loved it. Those who were in the 
issue loved it even more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why Lassie: He (yes, Lassie is a he), the eighth generation of his noble line 
to play the role, has a book out celebrating the 50th anniversary of Lassie in 
film. He also has a training video, a movie, plush dolls, watches, etc. Even 
dogs have to do promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Setting: The party design was done by New York's Aero Studio with two 
adjoining tents at the hotel's entrance. The reception and after-party were 
held under red canvas done in an Oriental/fantasy motif -- "Cocteau meets Dr. 
Seuss at Grauman's Chinese," co-designer William Sofield called it. It opened 
onto the dining area, a 50-foot-by-80-foot diaphanous white tent hung with 500 
paper lanterns. The overall effect was dazzling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "This issue is not about Hollywood glitz at all," said Brown. "That, 
in fact, is exactly what we planned not to do. It's about the creative process 
of film. It's about the life, rather than the lifestyle. It's about the work 
rather than the money. We're celebrating the work with this issue, not the 
money, not the lifestyle, not the planes, not the limos. " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also Quoted: Asked what he had learned from the Paramount takeover battle, 
Barry Diller said, "I had a great lesson in things I was not overly educated 
about -- Wall Street and a certain kind of base human kind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Program: After an erudite introduction by Vidal, Brown spoke about the 
special issue. They were both topped by Robin Williams, who took the mike for a 
10-minute performance. At one point he assumed a telethon host voice and said, 
"I think that's why we're here this evening -- to help raise money for the New 
Yorker. You can't sell a magazine with just literature and Connecticut haiku."

 The Setup: Seeking to gain control of the company by putting an idiot in the 
president's office, Hudsucker Industries honcho Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul 
Newman) nabs mail-room nerd Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins). Newspaper reporter 
Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh, pictured with Robbins) wants the story. The 
film is directed by Joel Coen and written with his brother Ethan (who also 
produced) and Sam Raimi. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Richard Hornung, whose credits include "This Boy's 
Life," "Miller's Crossing," "Raising Arizona," "The Grifters" and "Sleeping 
With the Enemy." He received an Academy Award nomination for the Coen brothers' 
"Barton Fink," and could receive another for "Proxy" next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: High-styled and wacky, precisely constructed with fashion sight 
gags. Costume history buffs will surely frown at the loose approach to 
late-'50s fashion. The battle for Hudsucker's control is set in 1958 and '59, 
but Hornung "really did 1952" -- and earlier, he said. "Otherwise, it would 
look like 'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.' " In fact, 
early-'50s lines -- fat lapels for men, skinny skirts for women -- just look 
funnier. 
</P>
<P>
 No character has been overlooked. Working with a gray-navy-silver-brown 
palette that lends the film a black-and-white quality, Hornung dresses 
Hudsucker's vast, all-male board of directors in suits of varying shades of 
dull. Some sort of bow is affixed to all of the frightening-looking company 
secretaries. "It was my idea of woman, totally pre-liberation, as something to 
be opened," explains the designer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: The use of stripes to indicate status. The higher one's position, the 
wider the suit's pin-stripes. By the time Robbins' Norville Barnes is 
president, he's wearing chalk stripes. For graphic punch, neckties are also 
striped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Amy Archer's divine pinched-waist suits and dresses -- in the Barbara 
Stanwyck-Katharine Hepburn mode -- are enhanced by an "all-in-one," a 
combination bra and mid-thigh corset popular from the '20s through the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: The movie "The Big Clock" and Esquire and Vogue magazines dating 
from 1948 to 1952. Also, for Amy Archer, Irving Penn's photos of Jean Patchett, 
and a chevron-striped suit worn by Rosalind Russell in "His Girl Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "It's a very designed movie. The only color is the Hula Hoops," 
Hornung says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sources: Barnes' and Mussburger's suits were custom-made at Vincent Costumes 
in New York. Their neckties are from Hornung's personal collection of about 
1,500 period ties. Amy Archer's wardrobe was custom-made by Dale Wibben, 
including undergarments, in Los Angeles.

FIRE DISRUPTS PHONES IN L.A., O.C. BUSINESSES; COMMUNICATIONS: AT ONE COSTA 
MESA ACCOUNTING FIRM, EMPLOYEES TURNED TO CELLULAR TELEPHONES.

<P>
 A fire at a Downtown Los Angeles Pacific Bell switching facility crippled the 
city's phone service early Tuesday, blocking millions of calls, knocking out 
many appeals for emergency service, disrupting businesses and shutting down 
automated teller machines throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 With no 911 calls getting through in areas of the San Fernando Valley, 
helicopters and fire trucks patrolled neighborhoods to search for smoke or 
flames, and extra police cars cruised the streets in case residents needed 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12:47 a.m. fire caused widespread inconvenience, with phone trouble 
reported from the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys to South Los Angeles, 
from West Los Angeles to Downtown. But there were no reports of injury or death 
caused by a delay in emergency response. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, some businesses with offices in Los Angeles were 
inconvenienced. Accounting firms, in the midst of the tax season, were 
especially hard-pressed. At Deloitte & Touche, internal tie-lines, computer 
lines and facsimile lines were down all morning, sending accountants to the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have cellular phones, so we went to our cars to call L.A.," said Chris 
Massey, managing partner of the firm's Costa Mesa office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of things with our L.A. office -- coordinating proposals and so 
forth -- so we literally have to stay in touch," he said. "The faxes wouldn't 
go back and forth either, and in today's world, we live by faxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, he said, telephone and facsimile lines were restored by midday. 
Internal tie-lines were out all day, however, so workers called each other long 
distance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "March 15 is the last day for corporate tax returns to get in, so it would 
have been a big problem if it lasted all day," Massey said. "As it turned out, 
it was not nearly as disruptive as the earthquake was." 
</P>
<P>
 Tie-lines also were down most of the day at First American Financial Corp. in 
Santa Ana. Customers calling about title insurance matters couldn't be 
transferred from one county to the other and had to be given the company's 
toll-free number, thus swamping the firm's operators, said spokeswoman Kathy 
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies appeared to have problems only for a few hours. At Psomas & 
Associates civil engineering firm, all communication between its Santa Monica 
headquarters and its major office in Costa Mesa was lost for two hours, said 
Joey Drucker, manager of computer operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't use our computers, and we rely on E-mail a lot," she said. The 
connections were restored quickly enough that the company didn't have to send 
messengers back and forth, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 International calls also became a problem for some operations. The Costa Mesa 
office of Latham & Watkins has to go through its Los Angeles headquarters to 
send the electronic mail by computer to its offices in London and Moscow, said 
Juanita Luna, the law firm's Orange County office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could make (international telephone) calls, but no E-mail," she said. By 
2:20 p.m., however, the firm was "up and running" as that and other phone 
problems were fixed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Britton, a PacBell spokesman based in San Diego, said, "People in Orange 
County who were trying to call into the affected area or make long-distance 
calls that went through that area might have been impacted." 
</P>
<P>
 He said such delays may have included automatic teller machines and other 
electronic devices that use telephone lines that could be switched through Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency phone service was restored about 9 a.m. Tuesday, with regular phone 
service back in operation by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The early morning fire at the Bunker Hill office tower, started by an 
electrical malfunction, caused more damage to the area's phone systems than the 
January earthquake. The switching facility, the largest west of the 
Mississippi, is a critical Southern California telecommunications hub. 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread breakdown was one of the worst in the recent history of 
Southern California phone problems, said Bill Chubb, a regional manager for 
PacBell. 
</P>
<P>
 And the problem went well beyond phones. Because phone lines connect 
computers, an electronic lifeline was severed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fax machines were idled. Stockbrokers could not call New York. Gas station 
customers at many of Arco's PayPoint terminals were confronted with the 
message: "Use cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Even lottery players were out of luck. The fire made it difficult for many to 
buy tickets or get their winnings. Bob Taylor, a California lottery spokesman, 
said that 1,200 of the state's 22,000 terminals were down early Tuesday 
morning. By midmorning, the machines were back on line. 
</P>
<P>
 Different neighborhoods had different problems. In the San Fernando and San 
Gabriel valleys and part of West Los Angeles, many residents could not get 
through when they called 911, and had difficulty dialing out of their area 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Downtown Los Angeles, more than 150,000 customers, cut off from the 
outside world, could barely function without their phones and modem-equipped 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pacific Stock Exchange did not shut down, stockbrokers throughout 
Downtown had a long morning. Tae Chor, a broker at Olde Discount Corp., could 
not connect with the New York offices through phones or computers until late 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did half the business we'd normally do today," Chor said. "We have no 
business when the phones go off." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those with working phones were inconvenienced. Wells Fargo Bank reported 
that 700 of its 1,800 automated teller machines were disabled Tuesday morning. 
At Bank of America, service to 1,500 of 2,100 ATMs was affected. But by late 
afternoon, almost all the ATMs were back in service, bank officials said. ATMs 
-- like lottery outlets -- were affected because they use phone lines to 
connect to central computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miki Kobayashi, travel consultant at Kuroneko Yamato Travel Agency, said the 
company is so computer- and phone-dependent that it no longer uses printed 
airline schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even sign in," she said Tuesday morning. "I can't get in to make 
reservations for our clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Teklu, who runs an Arco gas station in San Bernardino, said the station's 
PayPoint service was out of order all day. The system allows customers to pay 
for gas with an automated teller card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers were really angry," Teklu said. "Some of them have no cash; they 
can't buy anything without the card." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's fire was not the first at a Downtown PacBell switching facility. A 
1983 fire caused the evacuation of 1,700 workers and interrupted long-distance 
service for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's owners were under orders to comply with a new sprinkler law 
approved after the First Interstate Bank fire in 1988. Although the work was 
nearly complete, sprinklers had not been installed in the area where Tuesday's 
fire occurred. The company did not meet a December, 1991, deadline to finish 
the work, and was granted an extension until to July, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything wrong," said city Fire Inspector Neal Reitzell. "They 
were not in violation of any codes. They have sprinklers in most of the areas 
and are in the process of installing the remaining ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors, who had visited the building in recent months, said they were 
pleased that the building had its sprinklers about 85% installed and was making 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 City building officials issue extensions if building owners have hardships 
that make compliance difficult. Inspectors granted the extension to PacBell 
because all the electronic machinery in the building had slowed installation of 
the sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out on the 13th floor of the 17-story building, one of three 
high-rises at Pacific Bell's Grand Complex. It took about 80 firefighters less 
than 90 minutes to extinguish the blaze. The cause of the fire was under 
investigation, but officials said it appears to have started as A T & T 
subcontractors installed new equipment to power the phone company's fiber-optic 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire severed the main power source to the switching station.

GUILTY VERDICT IN MANISCALCO TRIAL; COURTS: LONGEST CRIMINAL CASE IN O.C. 
HISTORY ENDS IN SECOND-DEGREE MURDER CONVICTION FOR 1980 TRIPLE KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years to the day after his arrest, a Westminster attorney who co-founded 
the Hessians motorcycle gang was convicted Tuesday of second-degree murder for 
ordering the executions of three people, ending Orange County's longest-running 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second trial for Thomas F. Maniscalco, 49, who authorities say 
plotted the killings in a dispute over counterfeit money and drug profits 
skimmed from his gang. The victims were another biker gang member, along with 
his girlfriend and the biker's bodyguard, who were shot repeatedly in a 
Westminster ranch home on Memorial Day, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand the verdicts. It's very bizarre," Maniscalco whispered to 
his attorney as the verdicts were read. He joked with the bailiff and chuckled 
loudly as he was led from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated 24 days -- two days short of matching the 
state record set by Maniscalco's previous jury in 1990 -- before finding him 
guilty of three counts of second-degree murder. More than a week ago, jurors 
had indicated they were deadlocked, but the judge ordered them to resume 
deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just delighted that the jury reached a verdict," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Rick King, who has been assigned to the case since 1988. "This case has been a 
nightmare for the criminal justice system -- the length of the proceedings, the 
numbers of trial, the delays." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, however, countered with an emotional condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is a wonderful system, but innocent men are arrested, innocent men are 
convicted, and innocent men are executed. . . . But I still believe in the 
system," said attorney Joanne Harrold, one of Maniscalco's former law 
professors, who has defended him for free. "He's innocent and (the verdict) 
will never be right to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, who holds the record for the longest stay in the Orange County 
Men's Central Jail, has denied any involvement in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces a possible prison sentence of 16 years to life for each count. Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary is scheduled to set a 
sentencing date today. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution alleged that Maniscalco ordered the deaths of Richard (Rabbit) 
Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28, and Rizzone's girlfriend, 
Rena Miley, 19. They were shot repeatedly in Rizzone's Westminster home. Miley 
-- the daughter of a now-retired Los Alamitos police officer -- also was raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Maniscalco, as co-founder of the biker gang, ordered Rizzone 
killed because he suspected Rizzone was skimming proceeds from the Hessians' 
drug and counterfeiting business. Monahan and Miley were killed to eliminate 
witnesses, prosecutors believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys say Maniscalco was framed by an admitted gunman who stole 
drugs and money from the victims and then tried to finger Maniscalco in 
exchange for immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that he is innocent. I will always assist and do what I can," Harrold 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco's mother, who has stood firmly by her son, expressed horror when 
she learned of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no! Oh my God! How could they have done that?" said Grace Maniscalco, a 
72-year-old retiree from Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrold, a former Westminster municipal judge, said the fact that Maniscalco 
has sat behind bars for a decade biased jurors against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you believe in the system, it is very difficult to believe in an innocent 
man who has been held for 10 years. There is an automatic bias -- if a person 
is in custody he must have done something wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution had urged first-degree murder convictions, alleging that the 
killings were premeditated. Jurors began hearing testimony in November and 
started their deliberations Feb. 7. They logged 15 days behind closed doors 
before indicating to the judge they were having trouble reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of tension, trying to convince other jurors we were right," 
said juror June Hunter, 71. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a reasonable doubt. On first degree, you have to be positive. It 
wasn't difficult at all to go with second degree," she added. "I don't think he 
should spend the rest of his life in jail because he wasn't there, but he was 
involved. We finally got down to that, that he was involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said the jury was first deadlocked 9-3 in favor of conviction, then 
10-2, then 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much involved. It was the most difficult thing I've ever been a 
part of," she said. "We had 102 pages of jury instructions." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said she has "a lot of empathy" for Maniscalco. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked about his childhood. He made me think of him in a different way. 
He's a real-life person . . . not just an object," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another juror, who identified himself only as juror No. 6, praised the group 
as "12 wonderful people with open minds." 
</P>
<P>
 During breaks, and on their lunch hour, jurors played cards -- crazy eights 
and king's corners -- to try and maintain an air of normalcy and sanity, he 
said. But the deliberations were far from harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put 12 people in a room for 24 days -- nobody threw punches, but there 
were ups and there were downs," juror No. 6 said. "Sometimes I felt that we 
could have used a break. We could have used a day or two off." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors took a long time weighing whether Maniscalco was part of a conspiracy 
to kill, the juror said. Once everyone agreed on that, they then moved on to 
decide whether to convict him of first- or second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some discomfort" about the verdict, the juror said. "I was one of 
the people who took a longer time to come to a decision. I felt in my heart and 
in my mind that I hadn't turned over every rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with myself that I went through every piece of evidence . . . but 
if there was more evidence, something that could have taken me down a different 
road, maybe it would have." 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco co-founded a group of motorcyclists who called themselves the 
Hessians -- alternatively described as a biker gang by prosecutors and a biker 
club by Maniscalco's defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of the victims were found one week after the murders in 1980. 
Maniscalco and fellow biker Daniel M. Duffy of Long Beach were considered key 
suspects from the start, but investigators said it took four years to gather 
enough evidence to charge them. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors determined to bring Maniscalco and Duffy to justice offered Robert 
Robbins, an admitted accomplice to the murders, immunity in exchange for his 
testimony that Maniscalco had organized the killings and was in Rizzone's home 
the night of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement became a rallying point for defense attorneys, who argued that 
Robbins would have implicated anyone to save his own skin. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate jury in 1992 convicted Duffy of the slayings, but could not reach a 
unanimous verdict on whether Duffy should be sentenced to death for his crimes. 
Prosecutors decided to drop the death penalty against Duffy rather than retry 
the penalty portion of the trial, and also stopped seeking a death sentence for 
Maniscalco. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco's first trial lasted 17 months and was followed by jury 
deliberations that spanned 26 days -- a state record -- before jurors 
deadlocked 10-2 for conviction in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Maniscalco and Duffy has proved among the costliest in Orange 
County history, although a financial breakdown is not available, said Alan 
Slater, chief administrative officer of the Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Maniscalco has become an advocate for inmate rights, filing 
lawsuits to improve jail conditions. "Wherever Tom Maniscalco is, he's going to 
be a positive influence. He's demonstrated that in his 10 years in County 
Jail," said defense attorney Curt Livesay. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's disappointed (with the verdict)," Livesay said of his client. "But he's 
been in pretrial confinement for 10 years, and it's remarkable that anyone 
who's been in Orange County jail conditions for 10 years would show any emotion 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon legal drama has been dogged by so many legal maneuverings, delays 
and freak mishaps that the case has overshadowed the crimes themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, both prosecutors and defense attorneys have blamed each other 
for postponements in Maniscalco's case. At one point last year, King, who is 
the county's top homicide prosecutor, and defense attorney Livesay questioned 
each other on the witness stand to lay blame for case delays. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, King praised district attorney's investigator Don Null who he said 
"kept this case together" since 1981. "The credit to this finality goes to 
him," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people involved in this case -- the judges, the prosecutors, the 
witnesses, and even the defendant himself -- can go on and do other things in 
their lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Brian Ray Ballou and Rene Lynch contributed to this 
report. After 14 Years, a Guilty Verdict 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's longest-running criminal case ended Tuesday with the 
conviction of attorney Thomas F. Maniscalco, a biker-gang founder charged with

the killings. Charges later dropped because statute of limitations had run out. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 30, 1984: Defense files motions that lead to dismissal of Maniscalco and 
Duffy indictments because of errors in court transcripts. Prosecution later 
obtains new indictments; case bogs down with complex defense motions, appeals, 
changes in attorneys and judges and granting of separate trials. 
</P>

WOMAN'S RAPE, DEATH NOT TIED, O.C. JURY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Stanton dishwasher accused of "killing the spirit" of an ailing 79-year-old 
woman was acquitted of murder Tuesday, but found guilty of rape and other 
sexual assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating three days, a Superior Court jury unanimously rejected a 
novel prosecution theory that Jose Alonso Garcia, 20, was responsible for the 
death of Mary Ward, who died a month after Garcia raped her in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contended that the rape sapped Ward's will to live and 
hastened her death. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense called the case "voodoo" and an attorney for the Mexican 
government protested that Garcia was being used as a guinea pig for an 
experimental murder theory because he is an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they were horrified by the attack on an elderly woman, but they 
could not find a link between the rape and her death a month later. Testimony 
in the trial showed that Ward was sick with cancer and other ailments before 
the attack. "We all pretty much agreed her cancer was terminal. The rape did 
not cause the cancer or her death," Juror Myra Duvall, a Fullerton saleswoman, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Marcia Last said, "We're all very sure the rape affected her mentally in 
a very bad way, but we couldn't find how her mental state caused her death." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found Garcia guilty of rape, along with five counts of sexual 
assault. He faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced May 10 by 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco P. Briseno. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia bowed his head as the verdict was read. He showed no emotion when an 
interpreter translated the verdict into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. LaBahn expressed disappointment with the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a 79-year-old woman who is raped and dies a month later and the 
doctors say it contributed to her death. I thought we had a good case," LaBahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender David Biggs said he was pleased with the verdict 
because jurors were able to wade through reams of medical documents to discover 
there was no proof of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs said the prosecution's assertion that Ward died from the loss of a will 
to live was "about 10 to 15 years ahead of its time. There's just not enough 
medical proof for this type of thing in the legal arena yet. Maybe one day, but 
not today." 
</P>
<P>
 Duvall said she, too, questioned how the case ever got past the Orange County 
Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually surprised it ever made it this far. Maybe it's because everyone 
is up in arms about crime, they wanted to try this case as a murder," Duvall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution sought to prove during the monthlong trial that Garcia's 
attack murdered Ward by killing her desire to live. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, Ward, a widow who lived alone, heard someone swimming in the 
pool at her Stanton apartment at 2:30 a.m. She told Garcia to leave but instead 
he followed her into her house. Garcia, who was drunk at the time, has admitted 
to raping Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ward had lung cancer at the time of the rape, and the official cause 
of death was congenital heart failure, prosecutors said the assault triggered 
humiliation, depression and "post-traumatic stress" that worsened Ward's health 
and contributed to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1992 attack, Ward was a "feisty and energetic" woman who helped 
manage an apartment building, LaBahn said. Afterward, she became withdrawn and 
despondent and "lost her desire to live." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was slammed as "voodoo" by defense attorneys and criticized as racist 
by a Mexican government official, who accused prosecutors of turning Garcia 
into a legal "guinea pig" because he is Latino and an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia had argued that the prosecution could 
never prove the connection between the rape and the death. Instead, Gumlia told 
jurors, the prosecution overwhelmed jurors with the horror of the rape by 
repeatedly playing Ward's frantic 911 call, relied on testimony of doctors who 
had no knowledge of Ward's medical history, and then glossed over the specifics 
of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben J. L. Salgado, a lawyer who represented the Mexican Consulate at the 
trial, said he was pleased with the verdict and the message it sent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Mr. Garcia is an undocumented alien from Mexico who can't speak 
English doesn't mean he can be used as a guinea pig in a new legal theory," 
Salgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salgado said Garcia "felt very good" about the verdict. "He's still very 
remorseful about it," Salgado said. "He still says he doesn't remember what 
happened on the night of the rape."

MTA PLANS LAYOFFS AND CUTS IN PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a capital and operating shortfall of nearly $300 million next year, 
the county Metropolitan Transportation Authority will eliminate about 250 
positions -- triggering perhaps 200 layoffs -- in coming months and scale back 
some of its transit projects, officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the cuts are expected to shave $100 million from the combined 
deficit -- enough to make a dent in the daunting task of balancing the agency's 
$3.4-billion budget, but not enough to prevent further cost-cutting measures in 
the fiscal year beginning July 1, including possible reductions in bus service 
and increases in fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no alternative but to make hard, painful decisions because of the 
projected operating shortfall we face this year and next," said Franklin E. 
White, the MTA's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus service, which accounts for nearly 90% of the MTA's operating budget, will 
not be affected by the cuts announced Tuesday, White said. Among the 
cost-cutting measures is the closure of a bus depot in Pomona, to be 
consolidated with a facility in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing here that will change the level of bus service," he said. "On 
the other hand . . . there will be a point down the road where I expect the 
(MTA) board to make reductions in our bus service." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors next week is expected to schedule a public hearing for 
the end of April to discuss fare increases and service reductions on the MTA's 
vast network of bus and rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only one-fourth of the $100 million will be saved through reducing 
operating costs, officials said the lion's share of layoffs will come from the 
agency's operations unit, including transportation supervisors, schedule 
checkers and other support staff. About 230 positions are to be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency plans to eliminate 20 jobs in the planning and programming unit. 
However, programming cuts, along with the staff reductions in that unit, should 
result in capital and operating savings of $63 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear which of the MTA's many projects would be most affected by the 
new round of cutbacks. But officials said the Red Line subway system and the 
Green Line light-rail project would not be touched. The extension of the Blue 
Line train to Pasadena was dealt a blow last year when officials decided to 
delay the project for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement of reductions in the MTA's 9,100-person staff comes 
less than six months after the MTA slashed 246 positions in its opening round 
of cost-cutting measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the positions cut last October were in administration, where scores of 
jobs were considered superfluous after the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission and the Rapid Transit District merged to create one super-agency. 
However, there were no layoffs because of a voluntary buyout program. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, as many as 200 employees could lose their jobs as officials begin 
deciding next month which positions to jettison. The remaining slots are vacant 
because of a hiring freeze imposed in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to impact the lowest number of employees possible," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the agency's bus operation, an outside audit released last month 
recommended cutbacks in weekend service and along routes running parallel to 
trolley and subway lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also recommended that the MTA slash salaries and benefits of 
thousands of employees, certain to be a flash point issue during negotiations 
scheduled to get under way soon between the agency and its three major unions, 
including those representing bus drivers and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Director Mel Wilson said the agency must look at the operating side and 
capital expenditures to bridge the budget gaps -- about $126 million in the 
operating budget and $170 million in the capital budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to take a look at the projects we have on line," he said. 
"We will this week be revisiting our long-range plan." 
</P>
<P>
 But another high-ranking MTA official who asked not to be identified said the 
operations unit had already borne its share of cutbacks, and suggested that the 
planning and programming unit should come under greater scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nowhere near aggressive enough," he said of the effort to slash 20 
planning and programming positions.

ROSTENKOWSKI EASILY WINS BID TO STAY IN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overcoming allegations of corruption with the aid of President Clinton and a 
rejuvenated city Democratic machine, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), powerful 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, easily won renomination Tuesday 
night after the toughest race in his long political career. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial congressman defeated four challengers in the Democratic 
primary, virtually assuring his reelection in the heavily Democratic 5th 
Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 With 87% of the ballots in the district counted, Rostenkowski had 50% of the 
vote. His chief rival, State Sen. John J. Cullerton, had 31%. Former Chicago 
alderman Dick Simpson had 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics is not a profession that rewards purity or perfection," Rostenkowski 
said as he claimed victory. "I've made mistakes. I hope I'll learn from them 
and do better in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Rostenkowski indicated that the grueling 1994 campaign may be his 
last hurrah. When a supporter shouted "four more years," he responded: "I don't 
know about four but I know about two!" 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman pledged that he would go back to Washington and help the 
President enact a health care program to cover every American. He won the 
primary despite a two-year-old federal grand jury investigation centering on 
allegations that he converted $22,000 in postage stamps from accounts of his 
office to cash for personal use. The inquiry is in its "final stages," 
according to the U.S. attorney in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is indicted, the 35-year House veteran would have to step down as 
chairman of Ways and Means, the panel that will play a major role in welfare as 
well as health care reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, 66, waged a come-from-behind campaign that brought him back 
almost from the political grave a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Low turnout and a massive show of electoral force by an estimated 6,000 loyal 
Democratic precinct workers mobilized by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and 
remnants of the still-powerful Democratic organization here helped Rostenkowski 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski credited Clinton's campaign visit at a "pivotal moment" two weeks 
ago with sparking a comeback in a race that was considered too close to call 
even on election eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Cullerton, a 45-year-old attorney with 15 years of experience in the state 
Legislature, conceded defeat Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Alderman Bernard Hansen, a Cullerton adviser, said that a turnout of 55% of 
the district's voters would have been needed to achieve an upset victory over 
Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simpson's the spoiler," Hansen told a reporter, referring to the candidate 
who ran third in the five-way contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rostenkowski was winning more votes than both Cullerton and Simpson. Two 
other candidates trailed badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Banks, an alderman and leader of the 36th ward on the Northwest side of 
the city that helped ensure Rostenkowski's victory, said that he had more than 
1,000 precinct workers making sure that supporters of the Ways and Means 
chairman went to the polls. Rostenkowski carried every precinct in his ward 
except one, Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jubilant winner, who clearly disliked his campaign role, said that he 
would be working hard even for those voters who did not support him. But he 
gave much of the credit to Clinton, who risked criticism for virtually 
endorsing Rostenkowski while he was under suspicion of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to be a soldier in the President's march for change," he said. "I 
hope to help President Clinton write a (health care) bill that will help people 
who need the help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a public servant who is pleased that the voters have renewed his 
contract." 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain, former House Postmaster Robert Rota pleaded guilty last 
year to corruption charges, citing "Congressman A" as a member of the House who 
had been part of a scheme to convert stamps to cash. It was clear from Rota's 
description, that Rostenkowski was intended to be Congressman A. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski has denied wrongdoing. The investigation is reported to have been 
expanded to include possible "ghost" employees, who were paid but did not work, 
and misuse of office funds.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHINA TRIP UNDERSCORES U.S. POLICY CONTRADICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher's just-completed human rights mission to 
Beijing was aimed at making China a less sensitive issue on the Clinton 
Administration's foreign policy agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Christopher's lack of results and the avalanche of vitriol that the 
trip inspired from both sides have done the reverse: They have catapulted China 
to the top of the list of America's problems overseas, creating dilemmas for 
which there will be no easy solutions. And they have underlined seeming 
contradictions in the Administration policy toward China. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (trip) now raises the amount of political capital that an already 
weakened President will have to spend to keep this China issue from spilling 
over," Douglas Paal, an Asia specialist and former George Bush Administration 
official, said Tuesday. Clinton "is eventually going to have to go to Congress 
to hold the China policy together." 
</P>
<P>
 With China, the Administration's foreign policy team does not face the sort of 
problems that have plagued it elsewhere -- in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia and 
Haiti. The question in those disputes has been to what extent, and for what 
sorts of missions, America should commit its troops abroad in an era of limited 
resources at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for American foreign policy and the Administration's own future, China is 
likely to be more important than any of those trouble spots. The issues 
confronting the Administration in China are broader than the use of force. 
China is, after all, Asia's emerging superpower and one of the most important 
countries in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, and to what extent, should America confront China over human rights 
abuses that violate what Christopher calls America's "core values"? What 
tactics best achieve this goal? Should the Administration encourage or cool the 
ardor of an American business community that, rightly or wrongly, views the 
China market as its version of nirvana? 
</P>
<P>
 Should the United States accommodate a regime that, less than five years ago, 
used live ammunition against citizens on the streets of its capital? Beijing 
has voiced no regrets for doing so and has changed few of its top personnel 
since then. It still imprisons some democracy advocates and during 
Christopher's trip continued to detain more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days and more than 20,000 miles ago, when Christopher was leaving 
Washington for Asia, reporters asked him why he was traveling to Beijing. Only 
hours before, Chinese officials had initiated a series of roundups, detentions 
and interrogations of dissidents that would continue up to and during the 
secretary's visit to China last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Christopher's schedule had been fixed, and he showed no interest in 
changing it to adapt to changing circumstances. "These events only underscore 
the importance of being able to make human rights points at the highest level," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the wake of Christopher's trip, the question has to be asked: What 
went wrong? And why did he go in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and his aides argued that, while in Beijing, the secretary 
delivered a tough message to the Chinese regime, one that Premier Li Peng and 
President Jiang Zemin needed to hear. China, he said, must do more to retain 
its low-tariff trade benefits in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whatever Christopher said, the Chinese leaders probably got a different 
message. They saw that Christopher had come talking about the need for a 
broader relationship between Washington and Beijing -- even as the Chinese 
regime was showing its people and the rest of Asia that it has the power to do 
whatever it wants to suppress peaceful opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clinton Administration wanted only to deliver a tough message to 
Beijing about its human rights policies, which the Chinese leadership would 
have understood without ambiguity, in retrospect canceling the trip might been 
a more effective way of making the point. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other purposes for Christopher's visit that could not have been 
achieved that way. The truth is the Administration also wanted, through this 
trip, to improve its ties to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The American business community -- fearing losing out to such foreign 
competitors as the French and Japanese, whose prime ministers will soon visit 
Beijing -- wants to smooth over the human rights disputes to ensure there will 
be continued trade with China. And the Pentagon wants to work more closely with 
China on important issues, including North Korea and non-proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 These factors help explain why Christopher chose not to cancel his visit. But 
they also underscore the mixed message the Administration is sending to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese have a favorite concept that can be applied to the American 
policy: It is a maodun , or contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chinese terms, it is a maodun for the Administration to want to confront 
China head-on over human rights abuses while improving ties with it to benefit 
the business community and the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 To Chinese Marxists, in particular, a maodun is something to be exploited. And 
Beijing is certainly showing it knows how to exploit underlying contradictions 
of American policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The American business community, for example, has been so well courted that it 
is leading the charge in criticizing Clinton's policy toward China. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Administration get into this mess? To understand America's China 
policy, one must look to the common factor in the personalities of the three 
men who serve as its principal architects -- President Clinton, Christopher and 
Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asia. All three have 
records of strongly supporting human rights. Yet all are instinctive balancers, 
better at trying to accommodate all points of view than at making hard choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, the politician, has made a career out of appealing to different 
factions within the Democratic Party without alienating any of them. It has 
worked often in the White House, most recently in his successful campaign on 
behalf of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, the lawyer, had his most memorable success when, as deputy 
secretary of state, he patiently negotiated the deal with Iran that allowed the 
release of American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, a foreign policy specialist who began his career as a Republican 
appointee but now works for the Democrats, is a cautious man who likes to 
borrow from both sides of any argument. That worked well on Vietnam policy, 
when he led the way in taking seriously the issue of missing U.S. servicemen 
while slowly building political support for a lifting of the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 But can the Administration mediate, balance or accommodate all the competing 
interests on China? 
</P>
<P>
 For a short time, the problem might be fudged. If China follows past patterns, 
it may soon release a few dissidents from jail or let families of dissidents 
leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Christopher's trip, Clinton is now in a situation where he may 
be forced to inflate the significance of cosmetic gestures if he is to extend 
China's trading benefits after they expire in July. Ultimately, the President 
may find that he must impose discipline on his Administration's China policy, 
making hard choices among the separate, conflicting agendas of human rights, 
commerce and military strategy.

PRINCIPAL'S RACE COMMENTS SPUR SMALL-TOWN UPROAR; BIAS: ALABAMIAN SUSPENDED IN 
FUROR OVER INTERRACIAL DATING AND PROM. HE CALLED MIXED-RACE GIRL A 'MISTAKE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is a bucolic little town, nestled amid the foothills of eastern Alabama. 
There is one traffic light, one drugstore and one high school, which Tuesday 
sat empty, testament to the silent power of forces that roil beneath Wedowee's 
placid surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are jumpy. The kids are jumpy," said Dale McKay, the superintendent. 
He ordered the school closed after the school board, in a raucous, jam-packed 
meeting, suspended the principal Monday night. "We have to look out for the 
safety of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 What got things stirred up was the collision of race and sex at the high 
school. In the South this has always been a combustible mixture. What is 
happening in Wedowee shows that it has lost none of its flammability. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, school principal Hulond Humphries called an assembly and, 
according to students, asked if anyone planned to attend the April 23 prom with 
a date of a different race. 
</P>
<P>
 "A majority raised their hands," said Karen Parker, a 16-year-old junior. 
"They really weren't going to go with who they said they were going with," she 
said. "We just wanted to see what he was going to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who attended the assembly say Humphries declared that he would cancel 
the prom rather than allow mixed couples to attend. One student, ReVonda Bowen, 
whose mother is black but whose father is white, stood up and asked what race 
her date should be. She broke into tears when Humphries reportedly said his 
edict was designed to keep more "mistakes" like her from happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries reversed himself the next day and said the prom could go on, but by 
then civil rights organizations were calling for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 800 people live in Wedowee (pronounced Wuh-DOW-wee), which sits amid 
forested hills and lakes near Alabama's border with Georgia. But more than 500 
people packed the school's auditorium Monday night for the long-anticipated 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member school board voted in favor of suspending Humphries with pay 
pending an investigation after the school district's attorney advised that they 
had little choice. Although everyone seemed more or less satisfied with the 
board's action, it only postponed a decision that is bound to split the 
community -- whether Humphries should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, who has worked at the school for 25 years, has strong support among 
whites in the county, who form the majority of its 20,000 population. The 
Randolph County High School has a student body of 680 that is 62% white. 
Earlier Monday, one white member of the board, which contains only one black 
member, said he believed that the majority of the board supported the 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay, the superintendent, said he also is "in sympathy" with Humphries. McKay 
said the principal wanted to cancel the prom because he had been concerned 
about recent racial tensions in the school. Humphries had blamed racial 
problems for at least one fight between students. The principal, who has 
refused to comment since the incident, feared fighting might break out if there 
was interracial dating at the prom, McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had talked with him about the possibility of not having a prom," said 
McKay, who indicated that he supported the decision. "I didn't realize he was 
going to tell them the way he told them, if he did tell them that way." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time Humphries has gotten into controversy over civil 
rights issues. A report by the U.S. Education Department's civil rights office 
admonished him in 1989 for, among other things, encouraging black and white 
students to ride separate buses to the county vocational school, disciplining 
disproportionate numbers of black students and disciplining blacks more harshly 
than whites for the same offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 He was cited for using suspensions as the punishment of first resort for black 
students while white students were often punished by paddling, which kept them 
from missing days in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board promised to end the discriminatory practices, but local 
blacks say the acts continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending Monday's school board meeting were the Rev. Joseph 
Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Atlanta, 
and Earl Shinhoster, Southeastern regional director of the NAACP. They praised 
the board's decision to suspend Humphries and said their organizations would 
monitor the board's investigation of complaints against the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is expected to last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the meeting, surrounded by a handful of burly followers, was Nathan 
Thomaston, who said he was a great titan of the Ku Klux Klan from Georgia. 
"We're here to stay," he said belligerently to a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Humphries) said it, I think he was sticking up for the Bible," Thomaston 
said of the principal's short-lived ban on interracial dating. "The Bible 
teaches against things like that, from Genesis all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 McKay said he fears the entrance of outside groups could polarize the 
community and incite violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is concerned whenever people on either the far right or the far 
left come in," he said. ". . . it's the radicals that cause the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying the Ku Klux Klan is radical, but you know they're known for 
their beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 While audience members were mostly well-behaved at Monday's meeting, security 
was tight, with police, county deputies and state patrol officers stationed 
around the school and patrolling the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal detectors screened everyone entering the building for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay said there had been a bomb threat at the school earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was arrested when he left the building and then tried to re-enter 
through a side door with a .25-caliber automatic handgun, said Randolph County 
Sheriff Larry Colley. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Colley pronounced the meeting "peaceful, very disciplined. Everyone 
left happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience largely segregated itself by race. Whites, who were outnumbered 2 
to 1, were mostly supporters of Humphries. One woman presented the school board 
with a petition bearing the signatures of 1,800 Humphries supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the whites present had been among those who formed a 100-car motorcade 
Saturday through downtown to show their support. The cars bore signs saying: 
"Go Hulond," "Humphries for Governor" and "Humphries for President." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Humphries' supporters said he tried to ban interracial dating because 
he feared racial violence, several black students said whites and blacks at the 
school generally got along well. 
</P>
<P>
 Shay Holloway, a 17-year-old black junior who was involved in the fight with a 
white girl that school officials cite as evidence of racial trouble, insisted 
Tuesday that race had nothing to do with the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the principal is the main cause of racial troubles at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some racial tension," she said, "but not as much as there is now."

WORLD VISION CHARITY TO LEAVE L.A. FOR SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new twist on Southern California businesses finding the climate 
friendlier elsewhere, the poverty-fighting charity World Vision U.S. on Tuesday 
said it will save millions by selling its 11 buildings in the San Gabriel 
Valley and moving to Seattle next year, perhaps with many of its 525 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision U.S., which spent $1.2 million to fight poverty in Los Angeles 
after the 1992 riots and more than $6 million in other U.S. relief programs 
during 1993, says it can save $5 million a year by making the move. Robert A. 
Seiple, the organization's president, cited higher medical insurance premiums, 
salaries and too much government regulation as factors making the company's 
expenses high in Southern California. For example, he said, the organization 
must spend about $100,000 a year for a ride-share program to comply with 
regional regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that (the regulation) is going to break anyone's back, but when you 
put all these things together, the arithmetic goes in the wrong direction," 
Seiple said. "When you put what our costs are here relative to other states, it 
makes California look bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that one of Los Angeles County's largest charities plans to 
relocate could be another blow to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "For small and large charities alike, there may come a point where they may 
either fold or leave the (area)," said Ron Farina, associate manager of the Los 
Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross. "That reduces the total strength of 
our network of nonprofits within the community." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent in-house survey, about half of World Vision U.S.'s 
employees -- about 260 people -- indicated that they would make the move to 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The charity hopes to have a staff of about 400 in Seattle. Officials said 
salaries will be frozen for two years as a cost-saving measure because of lower 
salaries in the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiple said the organization has not selected a site in Washington but plans 
to cut costs by centralizing operations in one building rather than the sprawl 
of 11 it acquired in the San Gabriel Valley over three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The charity will not cut back on its assistance to the Los Angeles area, 
Seiple said. In fact, it will be better able to help Los Angeles, where World 
Vision operates programs for homeless families and for Latino parents, by 
moving someplace cheaper and stretching its available funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said World Vision helped more than 46 million people in 1993. The 
charity operated more than 5,500 projects in 97 countries last year, fighting 
poverty, hunger and homelessness, and helping victims of natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Morrison, a demographer for RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, said the 
announcement may be thought of "as an instance that illustrates how certain 
footloose industries that don't need to be tied to a certain location are 
picking up and leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by Southern California Edison showed that 700 businesses and 
100,000 jobs were lost from the state over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision's departure, planned for September, 1995, is a reminder that 
charities have to make tough bottom-line decisions, as do other businesses, 
said Jon P. Goodman, director of USC's Entrepreneur Program, which works with 
growing companies, including nonprofit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The really good news is that it's about time that not-for-profits look at 
their bottom line," Goodman said. "I don't think this is the beginning of a new 
movement of nonprofits leaving town. What one is really looking at is the 
continuing realization in the nonprofit sector that there is a new pressure for 
efficiency for organizations that don't have a real strategic need to be in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Charities are in a particular bind, said Robert Wright, a professor of 
organization and management at Pepperdine University. In a tough economy, costs 
go up, whereas income -- or donations -- go down. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision's international umbrella office in Monrovia, from which it has 
operated since 1965, will remain, as will up to 20 employees staffing a local 
office in a site to be selected. World Vision U.S. is a subsidiary of the 
international World Vision charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees who had received word of the move were weighing their options 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Thornton, 58, a 15-year employee, said she is uncertain about leaving 
California and feels saddened by the charity's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think California is in a real crisis," she said. "It worries me when I see 
all the companies leaving without the consideration of being a part of the 
solution in California, as opposed to just running from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other employees said they were anticipating moving their households to the 
Northwest. "I'm excited about the move," said Brian Sellers-Peterson, 37, 
director of church relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The charity hopes to raise about $11 million by selling the 11 buildings in 
Monrovia, Duarte and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision is among Monrovia's top three employers, City Manager Rod Gould 
said. It is exempt from property taxes, but its employees spend money in shops 
and restaurants, and the organization draws conference participants to local 
hotels. The loss will be a blow to the city, Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a prestigious employer," he said. "Everyone's aware of the good work 
World Vision does all over the world for people in distress." 
</P>
<P>
 The charity's board of directors has been weighing a move for 16 months and 
considered 14 cities. In December, 1993, the board members decided against 
moving, Seiple said, but changed their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Monrovia Mayor Bob Bartlett said he is saddened by the decision. He said the 
city could not comply with a request that the charity had made for a 30-acre 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had the 30-acre site they wanted, we would have got it for them, but 
we're completely built-out," he said.

FIRE DISRUPTS L.A. PHONES, SERVICES; COMMUNICATIONS: MILLIONS OF CALLS, 
INCLUDING MANY TO 911, CANNOT GO THROUGH. PACBELL SAYS BLAZE AT SWITCHING 
FACILITY CAUSED LENGTHY INTERRUPTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 A fire at a Downtown Los Angeles Pacific Bell switching facility crippled the 
city's phone service early Tuesday, blocking millions of calls, knocking out 
many appeals for emergency service, disrupting businesses and shutting down 
automated teller machines throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 With no 911 calls getting through in areas of the San Fernando Valley, 
helicopters and fire trucks patrolled neighborhoods to search for smoke or 
flames, and extra police cars cruised the streets in case residents needed 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12:47 a.m. fire caused widespread inconvenience, with phone trouble 
reported from the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys to South Los Angeles, 
from West Los Angeles to Downtown. But there were no reports of injury or death 
caused by a delay in emergency response. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency phone service was restored about 9 a.m. Tuesday, with regular phone 
service back in operation by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The early morning fire at the Bunker Hill office tower, started by an 
electrical malfunction, caused more damage to the area's phone systems than the 
January earthquake. The switching facility, the largest west of the 
Mississippi, is a critical Southern California telecommunications hub. 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread breakdown was one of the worst in the recent history of 
Southern California phone problems, said Bill Chubb, a regional manager for 
PacBell. 
</P>
<P>
 And the problem went well beyond phones. Because phone lines connect 
computers, an electronic lifeline was severed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fax machines were idled. Stockbrokers could not call New York. Gas station 
customers at many of Arco's PayPoint terminals were confronted with the 
message: "Use cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Even lottery players were out of luck. The fire made it difficult for many to 
buy tickets or get their winnings. Bob Taylor, a California lottery spokesman, 
said that 1,200 of the state's 22,000 terminals were down early Tuesday 
morning. By midmorning, the machines were back on line. 
</P>
<P>
 Different neighborhoods had different problems. In the San Fernando and San 
Gabriel valleys and part of West Los Angeles, many residents could not get 
through when they called 911, and had difficulty dialing out of their area 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Downtown Los Angeles, more than 150,000 customers, cut off from the 
outside world, could barely function without their phones and modem-equipped 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pacific Stock Exchange did not shut down, stockbrokers throughout 
Downtown had a long morning. Tae Chor, a broker at Olde Discount Corp., could 
not connect with the New York offices through phones or computers until late 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did half the business we'd normally do today," Chor said. "We have no 
business when the phones go off." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those with working phones were inconvenienced. Wells Fargo Bank reported 
that 700 of its 1,800 automated teller machines were disabled Tuesday morning. 
At Bank of America, service to 1,500 of 2,100 ATMs was affected. But by late 
afternoon, almost all the ATMs were back in service, bank officials said. ATMs 
-- like lottery outlets -- were affected because they use phone lines to 
connect to central computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miki Kobayashi, travel consultant at Kuroneko Yamato Travel Agency, said the 
company is so computer- and phone-dependent that it no longer uses printed 
airline schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even sign in," she said Tuesday morning. "I can't get in to make 
reservations for our clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Teklu, who runs an Arco gas station in San Bernardino, said the station's 
PayPoint service was out of order all day. The system allows customers to pay 
for gas with an automated teller card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers were really angry," Teklu said. "Some of them have no cash; they 
can't buy anything without the card." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's fire was not the first at a Downtown PacBell switching facility. A 
1983 fire caused the evacuation of 1,700 workers and interrupted long-distance 
service for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's owners were under orders to comply with a new sprinkler law 
approved after the First Interstate Bank fire in 1988. Although the work was 
nearly complete, sprinklers had not been installed in the area where Tuesday's 
fire occurred. The company did not meet a December, 1991, deadline to finish 
the work, and was granted an extension until to July, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything wrong," said city Fire Inspector Neal Reitzell. "They 
were not in violation of any codes. They have sprinklers in most of the areas 
and are in the process of installing the remaining ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors, who had visited the building in recent months, said they were 
pleased that the building had its sprinklers about 85% installed and was making 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 City building officials issue extensions if building owners have hardships 
that make compliance difficult. Inspectors granted the extension to PacBell 
because all the electronic machinery in the building had slowed installation of 
the sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out on the 13th floor of the 17-story building, one of three 
high-rises at Pacific Bell's Grand Complex. It took about 80 firefighters less 
than 90 minutes to extinguish the blaze. The cause of the fire was under 
investigation, but officials said it appears to have started as A T & T 
subcontractors installed new equipment to power the phone company's fiber-optic 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire severed the main power source to the switching station. With the 
power gone, PacBell could not transfer traffic to another switching office as 
was done during the earthquake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people were evacuated from the facility and three workers were 
hospitalized for minor smoke inhalation, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's outage appeared to have been the largest in the United States since 
a 1991 New York City phone breakdown, said Pete Hoffman, a spokesman for the 
Washington-based Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions, which 
represents local and long-distance companies. The New York City breakdown was 
caused when human error at an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. switching 
station disrupted long-distance phone service and cut air traffic controller 
links, grounding all departures and severely limiting arrivals at three major 
airports in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
 There was much confusion Tuesday morning when residents awoke and discovered 
they had difficulty making calls across town. At scores of Los Angeles public 
schools, teachers found it impossible to call in sick Tuesday, prompting a 
scramble when principals realized some classes had no teacher. Making matters 
worse, principals could not call Downtown offices to order substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 By about 9:30 a.m. Supt. Sid Thompson turned to broadcast news stations, 
asking them to air an announcement directing principals to find substitute 
teachers on their own, rather than requesting help through central offices. In 
many cases, teachers could not be found until 11 a.m., prompting schools to 
double up classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, officials determined that the early morning fire was not as serious 
as it could have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was fortunate because there is such light telephone traffic Downtown at 
that time," said Chubb of PacBell. "If the outage had occurred at 12:47 p.m. 
instead, it would have been an entirely different story." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Amy Harmon, Linus Chua, Stephanie Chavez, Marc Lacey and 
Chau Lam contributed to this story. Communications Breakdown 
</P>
<P>
 A fire at a Downtown Pacific Bell crippled telephone service early Tuesday. 
Here is a look at the system and how it was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 1. A call goes to a local switching center. If the call is within a local 
area, that office sends the call on to its destination. 
</P>
<P>
 2. If the call is outside the local area, it is sent to the Bunker Hill 
facility -- which handles up to 3 million calls an hour -- or one of one of two 
other Pacific Bell "gateway switches" in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 3. After fire breaks out, one of several power sources to the switching 
station shuts down the fiber optic "trunks" that route incoming calls to their 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where the outages occurred: Throughout the 213, 310 and 818 area codes. For 
911 service, the San Fernando Valley and the Westside were affected most. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who was affected: Up to 20,000 calls each second were blocked immediately 
after the fire. More than 150,000 Downtown customers were unable to make calls 
out of the area. Many data networks such as automatic teller machines that use 
phone services to link terminals to central computers were down for much of the 
day. By late morning, most phone service was restored.

TRUST IN MEDIA HIGH, BUT CURBS FAVORED, POLL FINDS; NEWS: TIMES MIRROR STUDY 
EXAMINES EIGHT NATIONS. MANY RATE PAPERS, TV MORE BELIEVABLE THAN CHURCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Americans and West Europeans trust newspapers and television news so 
much that many readers and listeners pronounce the media more believable as an 
institution than even their churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite this trust, substantial majorities would like to restrict press 
freedom to protect military secrets, stamp out terrorism and cut down stories 
dripping with sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 These contradictory attitudes surfaced as a major finding of the Times Mirror 
Center for the People & the Press in a comprehensive survey of opinion about 
the media in eight nations: the United States, Canada, Mexico, Britain, France, 
Germany, Spain and Italy. The poll, released in New York on Tuesday, collated 
the views of a sample of more than 10,000 Europeans and North Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * More people get their news from television than from any other medium. 
Substantial majorities watch TV news in all eight countries, but only in 
Germany, Britain and Canada did more than 50% of those polled say they had read 
a newspaper the day before. (It was 49% in the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Majorities in most countries believe TV and newspapers are unfair and 
one-sided in the way they cover the news and that the media tend to invade 
people's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yet huge majorities believe the media keep politicians honest, help 
democracy and are a good influence on society. 
</P>
<P>
 * Americans know less about current events than any of the nationalities 
polled; asked a series of five questions, 37% of the Americans polled got all 
five wrong, while only 3% of the Germans, who did best on the test, failed all 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 Many trends echoed throughout the eight countries. Andrew Kohut, director of 
the Times Mirror Center, told a news conference: "We were expecting to see 
major differences in the way Europeans and North Americans viewed the press. 
But we were disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet intriguing differences did appear, rooted in local tradition. The gap in 
trust between TV news and newspapers, for example, was greatest in Britain -- 
an obvious reflection of the prestige of British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) 
broadcasts and low regard for London's strident mass-circulation tabloids. 
Spaniards, living in a country that emerged from dictatorship less than two 
decades ago, were less enthusiastic about press restrictions than almost all 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Majorities in each country found TV news and newspapers believable, in most 
cases more so than churches and their country's leader. The only exception was 
Mexico, where the church and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari are about as 
believable. 
</P>
<P>
 Without exception, heavy majorities said they did not find government 
officials, legislators and advertisers believable. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings were not as high, yet still mainly positive, when those polled 
were asked if they felt newspapers and TV have a good influence on society. In 
most countries, majorities thought that both have such sway. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 38% of the British and 37% of the Italians looked on newspapers as a 
good influence. Majorities in both, however, thought that TV news is a good 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 As an institution, the church did not fare so well. Attitudes toward the 
church lined up differently on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Only in the 
United States, Mexico and Canada did majorities believe the church is a good 
influence on society. And only in Mexico was the church rated higher in this 
respect than newspapers and TV news. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was much harping about the press. Most people complained that 
newspapers and TV news unnecessarily invade privacy. The exceptions were the 
Spaniards and Mexicans. The Italians believed that newspapers invade privacy 
but TV news does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those polled in all eight countries also did not believe newspapers 
deal fairly with all sides in reporting social and political issues. All except 
the British had the same low opinion of TV news. 
</P>
<P>
 When pollsters asked people what they liked least about the press, Canadians, 
Germans and Mexicans complained of sensationalism; the French and British 
complained of invasion of privacy; the Italians, Spanish and Americans 
complained of lack of objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 In principle, majorities everywhere opposed censorship. Those opposed to 
"putting restrictions on what newspapers and TV news programs can report" 
ranged from 73% in Spain, which experienced censorship only 20 years ago, to 
52% in Britain, where the popular press is held in such low regard. 
</P>
<P>
 But this mood changed when those polled were asked about restrictions in 
specific cases, such as protecting military secrets, discouraging terrorism and 
restricting portrayals of explicit sex and unnecessary violence. Here the Times 
Mirror Center found what it called "alarming levels of public support for 
government restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Majorities in all eight countries supported censorship of stories of 
"unnecessary violence." Majorities in all except Italy supported censorship to 
"discourage terrorism." Strong majorities in all except Italy and Spain 
supported censorship to protect military secrets and to restrict "portrayals of 
explicit sex." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror Center is run by the Times Mirror Co., which owns the Los 
Angeles Times. The center conducted the poll -- which it said has a margin of 
error of 3 percentage points in most of the countries -- in cooperation with 
four foreign newspapers: El Pais of Spain, Liberation of France, La Repubblica 
of Italy and El Norte of Mexico. Media Under the Microscope

 The media remained more credible than religious institutions and national 
leaders, a survey found.

 It comes as a bittersweet surprise to the dwindling percentage of Americans 
who hunt for sport: They have become, of all things, the unintended 
beneficiaries of the national debate over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 This occurs at a time when hunters have organized as never before against the 
forces besieging them -- the animal protection movement, the federal and state 
budget-cutters and, quite often, the environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, hunters stand more powerful, voice stronger resolve and command 
greater prestige in Washington than at any time in at least two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40% of the lawmakers in the House and Senate belong to the 
Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus. Started five years ago to safeguard the 
interests of sports hunters and anglers, the caucus is among the largest on 
Capitol Hill. And didn't President Clinton go bird shooting with a caucus 
leader this winter to show his allegiance? 
</P>
<P>
 There are few in Congress who oppose all forms of hunting. And it's hard to 
find a Clinton Administration official who doesn't see the need to woo hunters 
more energetically -- even as the government seeks to control the firearms of 
urban violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But just what do the hunters intend to do with their newfound political clout? 
</P>
<P>
 On issues coming before Congress beginning this week, the Sportsmen's Caucus 
aims to have its say on everything from the trophy hunting of polar bears to 
the "multiple use" of forests, wetlands and grazing lands. The caucus wants 
changes in the Endangered Species and the Marine Mammals Protection acts. It is 
pushing a so-called "hunter's bill of rights," and is determined to maintain 
hunting privileges in the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all this bravado in Washington, these are days of foment for America's 
everyday hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 By region, by generation and by gender, the nation is divided over hunting -- 
often deeply. The rifts widen because hunters' typically conservative political 
leanings have separated them from their more liberal, erstwhile friends in the 
environmental movement -- despite the common desire for healthy wildlife 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 And while many game species are thriving in America, the places to hunt them 
unfettered have not expanded. Some have shrunk or grown more controlled under 
the pressures of human population growth, suburban sprawl and public backlash 
over the recklessness of some hunters. The share of Americans who actively hunt 
is shrinking, too, leaving many feeling isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the growing might of the animal protectionists. When asked 
about the most important animal rights fight of the future, veteran activist 
Cleveland Amory responds: "To get rid of this dreadful hunting." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters, it seems, began taking him dreadfully seriously a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sportsmen's Caucus was established in 1989, two years after the Brady Bill 
was introduced in Congress to require a waiting period for handgun purchases. 
True-blue hunters and anglers formed the core, but they enlisted colleagues not 
previously as concerned with sportsmen's issues. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least some recruits, caucus membership was a way to demonstrate that 
gun control could be unyoked from the interests of, as they say in Washington, 
"legitimate sportsmen." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, it represented recognition that hunters back home were becoming 
more politically active. 
</P>
<P>
 So as the government undertook the first national firearms legislation in a 
generation, hunters found themselves wrapped in a reassuring political embrace. 
Members of Congress did not just have to oppose the National Rifle Assn., they 
could also support the Sportsmen's Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say we're in better shape than we've been in in a while," 
allowed Rep. Bill Brewster, a two-term Oklahoma Democrat who has created a 
niche for himself in Congress as a voice of hunters and co-chairman of the 
Sportsmen's Caucus. Currently, the caucus roster lists 185 House members and 35 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton signed the Brady Bill in December, the President joined Brewster 
for a morning of hunting on the Maryland shore. The take was a single duck; the 
symbolism, though, was received by millions of people. Gun control, the 
President said, "doesn't have anything to do with hunting." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's point man on the hunting issue is Kenneth L. Smith, former 
governor's assistant in Arkansas and now deputy director of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. The Administration, Smith said, does not aim merely to 
support hunters, but to recruit them and maintain their "heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say I believe it is important for the (Fish and Wildlife) service, 
state agencies and the hunting community as a whole to engage in outreach to 
promote hunting among the young and those who live in urban areas," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new political energy of hunters extends way beyond Washington. In the last 
two years, sportsmen's caucuses have been organized in all 49 state 
legislatures, except Hawaii's. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to argue their case, hunters say something that may surprise some: 
They are the nation's original conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there were unfortunate episodes in America's past where wanton hunting 
wiped out the passenger pigeon and drove the bison to near extinction. But 
pioneer conservationist-hunters like Teddy Roosevelt and Wilderness Society 
founder Aldo Leopold conceived a logic for a nation that had outgrown its 
frontiers: Managing game populations and habitat was in the hunter's long-term 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, hunters have come to pay for -- and almost wholly shape -- the 
nation's wildlife management efforts. The private Safari Club notes with pride 
that in this century, white-tailed deer have increased their numbers fiftyfold, 
elk eighteenfold, antelope two-hundredfold and wild turkeys have rebounded from 
a small few to 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it should be noted that predators who compete with humans for game -- 
notably the grizzly bear, wolf and panther -- have not done as well. 
</P>
<P>
 And neither have the hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1955 to 1975, about 10% of Americans counted themselves as hunters, 
according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. There has been a steady drop-off 
since: 9.1% in 1980, 8.4% in 1985 and 7.5% in 1991. Today, the number of 
hunting licenses issued nationwide is about 15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the number of licenses has decreased since 1972, from 651,091 
to 299,416. 
</P>
<P>
 And the future? Among themselves, sportsmen and women are divided as perhaps 
never before, unsure about allies old and new. 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that the Sportsmen's Caucus represents hunters, the battle is 
less about Roosevelt-style land conservation and more about land use and budget 
allocations: The inviolable rights of private property owners; the multiple use 
of lands to include not only hunting but grazing and logging and mining; a deep 
suspicion of government land regulation, and a nostalgic resistance to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the League of Conservation Voters, an independent group that rates 
Congress on environmental votes, scores the members of the Sportsmen's Caucus 
poorly. In 1993, the league said, the caucus contained only three environmental 
"heroes," those who voted pro-environment 80% of the time, and 84 environmental 
"zeros." Overall, the caucus was ranked significantly lower than Congress as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, the caucus is terrible. They're the kind that put on plaid shirts 
on Election Day and pretend they're environmentalists, then go back to 
Washington and vote against the environment the rest of the time," said Peter 
L. Kelley, the league's communications director. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most stinging charges against the caucus is that its leaders are 
elitists in the mold of the modern European sporting gentry -- they hunt in 
exotic locales and private preserves beyond the reach of all but a few, and 
come to represent less the interests of ordinary hunters than of the chummy 
clique of their outdoor pals in the development, ranching, mining, oil and 
chemical businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Financing for caucus activities, for everything from its hunting trips to its 
educational programs and summer camps for youths, comes largely from just these 
kinds of interests -- oil and timber companies, tobacco and cattlemen's 
associations. But there also is backing from ammunition and fishing tackle 
manufacturers and publishers of sporting magazines, including Times Mirror 
Magazines, publisher of Outdoor Life and a subsidiary of the company that owns 
the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Members acknowledge their caucus is partly fraternal. But no more so, they 
insist, than other special-interest congressional caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster said that he is unfazed by the caucus' low environmental ratings -- 
he scored 45% on the League of Conservation Voters 1993 report. "Some of these 
environmental groups are too heavily influenced by the animal rights types," 
Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his own life may illustrate something more fundamental at work. By 
occupation, Brewster is a rancher and a land owner. Hunting is his hobby. When 
a bill to raise grazing fees is proposed as a conservation step, or when 
wetlands reform threatens to restrict agricultural land use, Brewster finds 
himself solidly with the land use status quo -- and in opposition to 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1994, the Sportsmen's Caucus has seven specific goals beyond its general 
call to protect the interests of hunters and anglers. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Passage of a bill to forbid protesters to interfere with hunting on federal 
lands. Such an amendment has passed the Senate and is pending in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amendment of pending legislation to create a national park in the Mojave 
Desert. The caucus wants hunting rights preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 * Significant revision of the Endangered Species Act to benefit hunters and 
landowners. The caucus calls these "common sense amendments." Environmentalists 
say they are an all-out assault on this longstanding conservation law. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintenance of agricultural subsidies that pay farmers to keep some land 
fallow. These lands have become important wildlife habitat. Clinton has 
proposed cutting the financing in half. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prevention of budget raids on the license fees paid by hunters for wildlife 
management. Some in Congress would like to divert some of these funds or charge 
hunters extra for anti-crime programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amendment of the pending reauthorization of the Marine Mammals Protection 
Act so that hunters can legally import polar bear "trophies." These bears are 
protected in the United States, but some hunting is allowed in Canada and 
proposed in Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defend the rearing and release of captive ducks at private shooting clubs. 
Some biologists fear these birds will spread disease and weaken natural flocks. 
The caucus leadership vows to oppose regulation unless these fears can be 
proved. 
</P>
<P>
 A good number of hunters say that the caucus' agenda does not represent the 
desires of all sportsmen and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the "greening" of the outdoor sporting community. Some hunters say 
this is an instance of Congress lagging behind the people. Here and there, 
evidence points to hunters loosening their rigid arm-lock with the gun lobby 
and reaching to their former allies in the conservation movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've begun to include them more in things," said Kevin Sweeney, chief 
spokesman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. "It was a mistake not to 
involve them from the start in the initiatives we've undertaken. . . . What 
we're trying to do here is provide more habitat. And if you're interesting in 
hunting and fishing, you should be our natural allies." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Parsons, government affairs counsel for the Safari Club -- which 
represents hunters with international concerns -- partly agrees: 
</P>
<P>
 "With environmentalists, our goals are and should be exactly the same. 
Wildlife that has a value to someone is more likely to be preserved than 
wildlife that doesn't. We support sustainable use." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who read sportsmen's publications vouch for a new environmental tone 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sport fishing magazines have become downright rabid in supporting the 
cause. Writing in Fly Rod & Reel, outdoor journalist Ted Williams disowned 
those land-use traditionalists who presume to speak for sportsmen in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The congressional Sportsmen's Caucus is a front for politicians pushing the 
agenda of air and water polluters, clear cutters, oil and gas extractors, 
agribusiness habitat wreckers and wetlands developers," Williams wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 If this bridging of the gap between hunters and environmentalists is indeed 
genuine, it will be bad news for the animal rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll in December found 54% of respondents opposed sport 
hunting. The strongest opposition came from women, young people, blacks and 
Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps sentiment in Congress is so lopsided for the other side because 
hunting is regarded as a culture and animal rights as a movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Lantos is a congressional volunteer and staff director of the 
Congressional Friends of Animals Caucus, chaired by her husband, Rep. Tom 
Lantos (D-Burlingame). She said the caucus has a membership of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are they? "Well, we don't disclose our members," she said. "It's not quite 
acceptable yet. We'll lose them." Even at that, the Friends of Animals Caucus 
says that it is not openly anti-hunting. "We've learned that you cannot 
legislate morality. Ours is an educational effort," Annette Lantos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Pacelle, national director of the Fund for Animals, acknowledges being 
on the defensive in Washington like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 "When historians sit down to write, they will say that this marked the 
pinnacle of hunter strength in Congress," Pacelle said. "But on Capitol Hill, 
their power is really the product of the good old boy network. The Sportsmen's 
Caucus may have 40% membership in Congress, but its agenda couldn't claim 10% 
support among the public." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, animal protectionists continue to claim a strong alliance with 
mainstream environmental groups, and have taken their anti-hunting campaigns 
around Congress directly to voters. Their strategy is to confront, state by 
state, those types of hunting that arouse the most controversy. Two ballot 
initiatives have been successful: A 1990 California measure that outlawed 
hunting mountain lions and a 1992 Colorado proposition outlawing baiting and 
dog hunting of bears. 
</P>
<P>
 In elections this year, Pacelle's group and others are focusing on bear and 
cougar hunting in Oregon and trapping in Arizona. Some activists are itching to 
target one state and try for an all-out hunting ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a more lasting battleground will be America's youth. Animal 
protectionists have campaigned hard, and by many indications successfully, for 
the attention of children. Hunting activists say they are fighting back with 
youth camps, fishing derbies and shooting safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a heritage that is passed down from one generation to another," 
Brewster said. "Eventually, if there aren't young people to hunt, it will die 
out."

PANEL OKS KEY PIECE OF CLINTON HEALTH PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY and MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first congressional subcommittee to consider sweeping health legislation 
handed President Clinton a victory Tuesday as it endorsed by the narrowest of 
margins the most controversial piece of the Administration plan -- the proposal 
that employers be required to pay 80% of health insurance costs for their 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the first vote by the Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on health, 
the battle over health care reform finally moved from rhetoric to action. The 
significance of Tuesday's session was underscored by the presence of about two 
dozen Administration officials in the first two rows of seats in the hearing 
room and the crowd of lobbyists standing in the rear and lining the hallway 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee's early votes are important primarily as tests of sentiment. 
The overall shape of the legislation that finally emerges from its work will 
not become apparent until later this week, when individual members begin 
offering alternatives to the draft put together by Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), 
who chairs the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the subcommittee's efforts represent only a single, early step in 
the long road to health reform. Other committees and subcommittees also will 
have their say, as will the full House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the White House was jubilant after the panel voted, 6 to 5, to 
defeat an amendment proposed by Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) that would have 
stripped Stark's bill of its requirement that employers pay 80% of their 
workers' health care premiums -- one of the elements that the Stark plan shares 
with Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 In other votes, the subcommittee also brushed aside efforts to restrict the 
unlimited tax deductions that businesses now enjoy in exchange for their 
expenditures on employee health benefits. Some critics of the Clinton plan have 
contended that putting such limits on deductions would be a more efficient way 
of bringing health care costs under control than the government-imposed caps on 
premiums proposed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Although business interests strenuously oppose the employer mandate, saying 
that it would destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs, Clinton's allies in 
Congress say that they see no other way to achieve the President's goal of 
providing health coverage for every American. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one Democrat, Rep. Michael A. Andrews of Texas, defected from party ranks 
to side with Republicans, who were united in their effort to delete the 
employer mandate from the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that they considered the vote a major victory, 
significant both because the mandate is the single most important element of 
their plan and because the House committees have proved more hostile territory 
to the Clinton plan than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also dodged a bullet with the vote. A defeat likely would 
have been portrayed as proof that Clinton's bill was moribund. 
</P>
<P>
 While the White House still expects some bruising votes on its plan -- 
probably including some in Stark's subcommittee later this week -- officials 
have taken encouragement from signs that key Senate committees may be moving 
toward some kind of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will still be tons of votes along the way, and health reform will be 
declared dead a dozen times," said one Administration official. In the end, 
however, "common sense will win out." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an analysis by the influential health care consulting firm 
Lewin-VHI for the conservative Heritage Foundation found that the employer 
mandate proposed by the Clinton Administration's health reform package would 
reduce employees' wages in those firms that do not now provide insurance, and 
eliminate between 155,000 and 349,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, released during a Senate Finance Committee hearing by Stuart M. 
Butler, vice president of the foundation, showed that an estimated 88% of the 
cost of the employer mandate would be passed on to workers through wage cuts, 
resulting in total earnings losses of an estimated $20.6 billion during the 
first year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1998, average yearly wages would be about $189 less per employee than they 
otherwise would be, among all full- and part-time workers, the report said. 
Wages of employees in firms that now offer coverage would be about $400 more on 
average annually than they otherwise would be, while those of workers in firms 
that do not now offer coverage would be about $1,243 less, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some firms who already provide health insurance coverage to their 
employees, health care costs may remain unchanged, or decline," the report 
said. "For other firms, particularly those who currently do not offer health 
insurance to their employees, costs will rise, substantially in some cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the report said that the Clinton health proposal would result in 
a decrease in household expenditures for health care, compared to no health 
reform at all -- although the amounts would vary greatly when wage reductions 
were taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorrie McHugh, a White House health care spokeswoman, said that several 
analyses by independent health care consulting firms have shown that the 
Clinton plan would result in job creation and that a study conducted by the 
Congressional Budget Office showed that the Clinton proposal would have a 
"negligible" impact on employment. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Louis, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her campaign for 
health reform, speaking to about 2,000 members of the Washington University 
community. As she did in Colorado on Monday, Mrs. Clinton described the 
Administration's plan only in broad outlines.

UNOCAL TO PAY $1.5 MILLION FOR PETROLEUM LEAK; COURTS: COMPANY ADMITS 
DISCHARGING UP TO 8.5 MILLION GALLONS OF DIESEL-LIKE LIQUID OVER 40 YEARS. 
EXECUTIVES APOLOGIZE AND SAY THEY WILL SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO CLEAN UP 
STATE'S LARGEST SPILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Unocal Corp. was found guilty Tuesday on three criminal pollution charges and 
ordered to pay $1.5 million for its massive leak of petroleum thinner into the 
ocean and ground water at its Guadalupe oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 The court action, based on Unocal's plea of no contest to the three counts, 
puts an end to the criminal case against the oil company for negligence in 
discharging up to 8.5 million gallons of the diesel-like liquid and failing to 
report the spills as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal Executive Vice President John F. Imle Jr. apologized for the leaks, 
which he said occurred over four decades. He pledged that the company will 
spend whatever it takes -- potentially tens of millions of dollars -- to clean 
up the spill, the largest in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious condition," Imle said after the court hearing. "It's one 
we regret. It's one that should not have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 San Luis Obispo Dist. Atty. Barry LaBarbera, who dropped 33 misdemeanor 
charges as part of a plea agreement with Unocal, rejected criticism that his 
office had been too soft on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning for Unocal," LaBarbera said. "That's basically all 
we could accomplish at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
 With the resolution of the criminal case, Unocal faces fines of up to $170 
million in a civil suit to be filed soon by the state's Office of Oil Spill 
Prevention and Response. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Southern Pacific railroad and three other companies agreed Monday 
to pay $40 million in penalties for spilling 19,000 gallons of weed killer in 
1991 into the Upper Sacramento River near Dunsmuir. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Guadalupe oil field 20 miles south of San Luis Obispo, diluent has long 
been used to thin the heavy crude oil so it can be pumped out more easily. 
Since Unocal took over the field in 1953, it has used 1.2 billion gallons of 
the petroleum thinner, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipeline breaks and other diluent leaks have occurred periodically over 40 
years, Imle said. State investigators have collected evidence of discharges at 
the site since 1978 and have accused the company of attempting to cover up the 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until 1990 that Unocal admitted that diluent seeping from the sand 
at Guadalupe Beach and entering the ocean had come from the Guadalupe oil 
field. At that point, the company recognized that the leaks were a serious 
problem, stopped using the diluent and built a beach wall in the hopes of 
holding back the underground flow of fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been able to determine how much diluent has flowed into the ocean, 
but recovery wells on the beach have pulled up more than 650,000 gallons of the 
liquid since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say most of the leaked diluent has seeped into the ground 
below the oil field. The company estimated last week that 4.6 million gallons 
to 8.5 million gallons of the fluid have contaminated ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly an offense to the environment to have that stuff at any time 
touch the (ocean)," Imle said. "A sheen on the water of a few gallons may not 
be a disaster but it's certainly not acceptable and it's not something we want 
to be associated with." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Imle said, "the presence of diluent on the ground water, even 
though the ground water is not potable, is not acceptable." Under the plea 
agreement, Unocal pleaded no contest to depositing a petroleum product where it 
could pass into state waters, negligently failing to report petroleum product 
discharge into navigable waters, and failing to report a discharge into state 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge James D. Ream accepted the pleas and found Unocal guilty on 
the three counts, dismissing the other charges against the company and six 
present and former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the plea agreement, Ream ordered Unocal to pay $1.5 million, 
including $300,000 to be spent on environmental and recreational projects in 
San Luis Obispo County. The judge also sentenced the company to three years 
probation, requiring it to clean up the site and give environmental education 
to employees at the Guadalupe field. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters, Imle denied that Unocal attempted to cover up the 
spills but acknowledged that employees did not follow their responsibility to 
report all leaks. "There was a failure in what we thought was a 
well-established procedure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the company has become increasingly conscious of 
environmental concerns, he said. It has set up hot lines so employees and 
community members can make anonymous reports of any leaks in the Guadalupe 
area. Unocal Spill

 Unocal Corp. has leaked up to 8.5 million gallons of petroleum thinner at its 
oil field near San Luis Obispo.

BROWN REPLACES HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER, PICKS VETERAN REILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shaking up her campaign apparatus amid increasingly vocal criticism of her 
candidacy for governor, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown on Tuesday reached into 
the hierarchy of California's Democratic political consultants and picked 
veteran operative Clint Reilly to run her bid for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly, who last year marshaled the campaign of Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan, replaced Teresa Vilmain, whose leadership of the Brown effort had 
marked her first foray into California politics. The change was effective 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Vilmain, an Iowa native who has run numerous campaigns around the 
country and is renowned for her organizational skills, was perceived as not 
being up to the strategic intricacies deemed necessary to defeat Republican 
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly's hiring served as tacit acknowledgment of the concerns voiced more 
openly in recent weeks by Democrats statewide -- that Brown's campaign, 
although very successful in its fund-raising efforts, needed a sharper focus in 
order to sell its candidate to California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco-based Reilly is respected for his ability to carve a 
candidate's image through television and mail advertising. Moreover, in his 
most recent campaigns -- Riordan's and that of Mayor Frank Jordan of San 
Francisco -- Reilly has successfully run Establishment insiders as political 
"outsiders" bent against the status quo. Strategically, Brown's campaign is 
likely to follow that blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were two very successful campaigns which I plan on emulating," Brown 
told reporters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown would not publicly address the broader murmurs of concern about her 
candidacy, saying only that Reilly's hiring was part of her buildup to the 
November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really looking, focusing my attention on beating Pete Wilson in the fall, 
and the addition of Clint Reilly adds a great strength from a strategic and 
organizational perspective that I think will ensure victory," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly said his hiring was part of Brown's desire to "refocus her campaign" 
toward a contest with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Others familiar with the campaign said the appointment of Reilly was seen as a 
solution to some of the campaign's internal problems, namely a cumbersome 
committee-like approach to decision-making and a blurry sense of how to 
introduce Brown to California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Reilly is seen as a volatile character whose appointment 
could force a broader realignment of Brown's staff as it faces off against two 
feisty opponents for the Democratic nomination, state Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many, many Democratic leaders in this state have been petitioning her and 
beseeching her to make a change in her campaign based upon their belief that 
she was going to have to run a very tough campaign against Wilson and they 
weren't seeing that coming out of her strategic team," said one California 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another person close to the Brown campaign said that Vilmain deserved credit 
for Brown's successful fund raising and her lead in recent polls. But, he 
added, "she didn't know the state, she didn't know the key players and strategy 
was not a strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Vilmain could not be reached for comment, but sources said she is expected to 
leave the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's first attempt to secure a new manager came two months ago when she 
asked Bill Carrick, who led Dianne Feinstein's 1990 governor's race and her 
1992 U.S. Senate campaign, to come aboard. Sources said that effort was quashed 
by Feinstein, who was concerned that Carrick would be spending too much time 
away from her reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown then turned to Reilly -- a move that ironically underscored the small 
world of California politics. It was Reilly who, as Feinstein's campaign 
manager in the early days of her run for governor, nearly scuttled her 
candidacy by quitting with an acid broadside that Feinstein lacked the 
commitment to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein went on to hire Carrick and his partner Hank Morris, won the 
Democratic nomination and then lost the gubernatorial race to Wilson by a 
three-point margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, spokesmen for Garamendi and Wilson said Reilly had inquired 
months ago about joining their campaigns, but nothing came of the discussions. 
Reilly could not be reached for comment about those statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Both opponents were only too happy to tweak Brown for shaking up her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown's problem isn't that she had the wrong campaign manager," said 
Dan Schnur, Wilson's spokesman. "Her problem is that she's soft on crime, weak 
on illegal immigration, doesn't have a jobs policy and frankly doesn't have 
much of an idea as to why she's running for governor in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's campaign manager, Darry Sragow, said: "There is a deep dark secret 
in politics and that is that voters choose from candidates not from 
consultants. Until Kathleen Brown figures out why she is running for governor 
and can justify her candidacy to the voters, her campaign will continue to be 
in serious trouble."

IN HIS ELEMENT; SEABORGIUM IS NAMED FOR ONE OF ITS DISCOVERERS, GLENN SEABORG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years after its creation in a Berkeley laboratory, the 106th known 
element has finally received a name -- seaborgium, after Glenn T. Seaborg, the 
Berkeley Nobel laureate who helped make it and nine other heavy elements. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time an element has been named after a living person. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg, 81, is a former chancellor of UC Berkeley and chairman of the Atomic 
Energy Commission (the forerunner of today's Department of Energy) under 
Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. He burst into 
prominence in 1941 when he was the prime mover in the discovery of plutonium, 
the radioactive element that is best known as a key component of atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 His team subsequently discovered a series of so-called transuranium elements, 
which are heavier than uranium, the heaviest naturally occurring element. These 
elements are too short-lived to be found in nature and must be created in 
nuclear accelerators by firing beams of particles and nuclei at heavy elements 
such as uranium. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg's team at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory was at the forefront in creating elements from the 1940s through the 
1960s, including neptunium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, 
einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and the element known for 20 years 
simply as element 106. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the newly discovered elements are too fleeting for practical 
applications, plutonium is used as a fuel in some nuclear power plants and 
americium is used in fire detectors. All their discoveries have revealed 
insights into the nature of matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg received the 1951 Nobel Prize in physics for his role in the 
discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Names for new elements are generally provided by the element's discoverers, 
but element 106 was claimed by both the California group and a Russian team at 
the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. For 20 years, neither team 
was able to reproduce their discovery, in large part because element 106 is 
extremely mercurial, disappearing from physicists' detectors in a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, last fall, a team headed by physicists Ken Gregorich and Darlene 
Hoffman at Berkeley succeeded in once more producing it, nailing down 
Berkeley's claim for its discovery and at last freeing the group to name it. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-member team discussed naming the element after either Sir Isaac 
Newton or the late Berkeley physicist Luis Alvarez, who played a key role in 
formulating the theory that dinosaurs were killed off by the impact of a comet. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the other seven members recently met in Seaborg's absence and decided 
to name it after him, he said. "This is an extraordinary honor for me. Future 
students of chemistry, in learning about the periodic table, may have reason to 
ask why the element was named for me, and thereby learn more about my work," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new name was announced at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Berkeley's last discovery in 1974, the creation of new elements has been 
led by a team in Darmstadt, Germany, which has discovered elements 107, 108 and 
109. They have been named nielsbohrium (for the Finnish physicist), hassia (for 
the German state of Hesse) and meitnerium (for the German fission pioneer Lise 
Meitner).

QUAKE, EDUCATION BONDS BILL SIGNED; FINANCES: WILSON SEEKS VOTER APPROVAL JUNE 
7 TO BORROW $4 BILLION FOR TEMBLOR REPAIR AND NEW SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. HE ALSO 
SIGNS TWO CAMPUS MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday asked the voters in the June 7 election to approve 
almost $4 billion worth of bond-issue borrowing to pay the costs of earthquake 
rebuilding and finance education construction. 
</P>
<P>
 At a ceremony two days short of two months since the devastating Northridge 
earthquake, Wilson signed legislation committing $1 billion to quake recovery 
costs and allocating another $1 billion to seismically strengthen endangered 
highway bridges statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor predicted that voters would approve the earthquake bonds, but he 
refused to discuss alternatives if they lose. Neither the governor nor the 
Legislature has identified any other source of funds to pay for retrofitting 
bridges or Northridge quake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, the state will have to make a different response, but it will 
not be as good a response," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, the governor signed two other bond issues for education -- 
$1 billion for public school construction and remodeling and $900 million for 
construction at campuses of community colleges, University of California and 
the California State university system. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also signed a bill by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) that 
authorizes the suspension of building permit deadlines so that highway 
retrofitting contracts can be awarded swiftly. Similar emergency procedures 
were taken to quickly begin repairs on the quake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed a tax relief bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) that 
enables individuals who suffered economic damage in the Northridge earthquake 
to carry forward all their losses on income tax returns for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition to the June ballot of the bond issues enacted by the Legislature 
and signed by the Republican governor will make the total the most expensive 
yet for one election, $6 billion. Previously, a $2-billion parks and recreation 
bond measure qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who is seeking reelection, insisted on bonds -- a long-term form of 
borrowing -- to finance the state's share of quake costs rather than 
temporarily increasing the sales tax as Democrats favored. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the bond proposal more attractive to voters outside the Los Angeles 
region, Wilson and legislative leaders added funds to pay for speeded-up 
retrofitting of quake-threatened highway structures throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 That part of the borrowing plan for a time threatened a North-South fight when 
the San Francisco Bay Area toll bridges were allotted a majority of the $950 
million total. However, in the final bill, the majority of the money was 
shifted to Southern California, where most of the retrofit work is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 As for alternatives should voters reject the earthquake bonds, Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who abandoned his temporary sales tax 
increase bill in order to reach a compromise with Wilson, said he may have to 
rekindle the tax proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats previously voiced concern that potentially massive cuts in health 
and welfare services would be virtually the only option if the bonds failed. 
Likewise, Republicans and Democrats have warned that if the highway seismic 
safety funds are defeated, the retrofitting work on hundreds of at-risk bridges 
could proceed only by appropriating funds committed for regular highway 
construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, a temporary quarter-cent 
sales tax was enacted for recovery purposes. But Wilson said times have changed 
and taxpayers cannot endure even a temporary increase as the state fights its 
way out of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the long-term interest rates of bonds will be costly to taxpayers 
for the next couple of decades, Wilson defended such financing. "It is a 
perfectly proper thing for those who will use these same bridges 30 years from 
now to have the opportunity to help pay for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most borrowing that state voters have been asked to approve in one year 
was $10.7 billion, in 1990, when $6.24 billion in new debt was authorized in 
two elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In June of that year, the voters passed all seven bond measures that were on 
the ballot. The money -- $5.14 billion -- went for schools, prisons, 
transportation, housing and earthquake safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But voters recoiled in the November election later in 1990, when they were 
asked to consider another $5.6 billion in bond issues. They rejected a dozen 
measures and adopted just two, for veterans' housing and schools. Since then, 
lawmakers have placed five bond measures on the ballot; three succeeded and two 
were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the key Northridge bond issue bill by Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), $950 million would be spent for seismic retrofitting of highway bridges 
statewide, with about 60% allocated to Southern California; $575 million for 
supplementing federal housing relief for Northridge victims; $265 million for 
repairing public buildings; $145 million for reconstructing Los Angeles area 
transportation systems, and $65 million to strengthen public buildings against 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the bond money targeted to the Northridge earthquake would 
provide the state's match for the nearly $10 billion in emergency aid rushed 
earlier to California by the Clinton Administration and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-billion bond issue for public kindergarten through high schools, 
carried by Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), would finance construction and 
modernization of facilities hard-pressed to accommodate the growing population 
of schoolchildren. The Wilson Administration has estimated that it would cost 
$35 billion over the next 10 years to keep pace with the need. 
</P>
<P>
 The $900-million bond issue for higher education was carried by Sen. Gary K. 
Hart (D-Santa Barbara), chairman of the Senate Education Committee. The funds 
would be targeted for construction and remodeling. The legislative analyst 
estimates that more than $6.5 billion would be needed over the next five years 
to meet higher education building demands.

STATE'S CRIME RATE FELL IN 1993 AS PUBLIC'S FEAR ROSE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: ONLY 
HOMICIDES INCREASED. ONE RESEARCHER SAYS REDUCTIONS MAY REFLECT DIFFICULTY IN 
REPORTING LESS SERIOUS OFFENSES TO UNDERSTAFFED POLICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Amid rising public concern about crime, the number of reported criminal 
offenses in California nevertheless fell last year, state Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exception to the decline was homicide, which rose 5% in 1993, Lungren 
said, citing preliminary statistics that included an estimated two-thirds of 
all reported crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said the general decline -- in violent and property crimes -- was a 
reflection of the state's tougher approach to criminals in recent years, but he 
argued that there was still no cause for complacency. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the increase in murders to what he called "the culture of 
violence" -- the glamorizing of violent behavior in movies, music, video games 
and professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the numbers run contrary to the public perception that crime in 
California is on the rise -- a view that prompted speedy approval of the "three 
strikes and you're out" legislation. The bill, signed into law this month, 
increases prison time for felons -- most dramatically for those with repeat 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Greenwood, acting director of the RAND Corp.'s criminal justice program, 
said it is not surprising that crime is declining, even though "the fact 
contradicts the national hysteria that we're in the midst of a crime wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime rates have been falling nationwide, with California lagging somewhat 
behind the trend, Greenwood said. "The population is getting older and that 
means crime goes down." But he also wondered whether the figures on reported 
crime reflect the difficulty in reporting less serious crimes to understaffed 
police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general pointed out that in recent years the overall crime rate 
has been well below that of 1980, when it reached its peak in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures released Tuesday are from the 63 largest law enforcement 
jurisdictions in the state -- all representing populations of 100,000 or more. 
These agencies typically account for 65% of all reported crimes in the state. A 
more complete report for 1993 will be released later this year -- one that 
takes into account increases in population. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary findings show declines in the same 63 jurisdictions for the 
following crimes: forcible rape, 8.1%; robbery, 3.7%; aggravated assault, 4%; 
burglary, 5.2%, and vehicle theft, 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities, including the city and county of Los Angeles, reported sharp 
decreases in crime in 1993, while others, such as the city and county of 
Riverside, showed marked increases.

$12-MILLION LOTTO TICKET IN LIMBO AS 2 PURSUE OWNERSHIP CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Will the real $12-million winner of the California lottery please stand up? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what those who have been following the Chae vs. Kim Super Lotto scandal 
want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the rightful Lotto winner the Riverside liquor store owner who claims he 
was robbed of the ticket by two of his employees? Or is it one of the store 
workers, who says his boss threatened to have him deported as an illegal 
immigrant if he didn't hand over his winnings? 
</P>
<P>
 Since the local Korean news media began to report the story last week, Korean 
Americans throughout Southern California have been debating the merits of each 
side, trying to figure out who is the innocent victim and who is the bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says the story is unbelievable and shocking," said Jong Hoon Lee, a 
reporter who has been covering the story for the Korea Central Daily. "People 
say it's like a story out of a cartoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, until the legal battle is resolved, the $12-million jackpot is 
staying in state hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unusual to have a winning ticket being held up because of the 
uncertainty of its owner," said Bob Taylor, a spokesman for the California 
State Lottery in Sacramento. "Our security agents have looked into it 
carefully, and we will not declare a winner until the situation is resolved 
legally." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 29, store owner Soo Jang Chae bought a lotto ticket for the California 
Super Lotto drawing later that night and placed it in the store's cash register 
for safekeeping. He was not at the store when the results of the drawing were 
announced, according to a lawsuit filed by Chae and his attorney, Jae Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, according to the lawsuit, two store employees, Dong Pil Kim 
and Kihyun Park, found a scrap of paper listing Chae's selections for the 
drawing. After realizing that their boss held a winning ticket, they took the 
ticket from the store's cash register and conspired to steal it and claim it as 
their own, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Kim told Chae he had won the lottery and offered to give Chae 
half of his earnings to repay him for his generosity. Kim's sister, Eun Ahn, 
signed the ticket for her brother because Kim is not a legal resident of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim and Chae met the next day, and "Kim confessed to Chae that it was really 
his ticket," Lee said. "But Kim made himself out as a hero by saying that he 
saved the ticket from being stolen by Park." Chae contacted Ahn and her 
husband, Hyung Kuk Ahn, and they agreed to surrender another 10% of the 
winnings they were sharing with Kim, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 After changing the ticket ownership to 60% for Chae and 40% for Kim, Park 
learned that he was being cut out of the deal and told his boss that Kim was a 
key conspirator in the plot to steal the ticket, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial agreement was that Kim and I would split the money," said Park, 
who has agreed to testify on Chae's behalf, although he is a defendant in 
Chae's lawsuit. "I decided to testify for Chae because I was so angry that Mr. 
Kim betrayed me. He was trying to make me out as the only bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 After Park's confession, Chae confronted the Ahn couple, and they threatened 
to burn down his liquor store, Lee said. Chae offered them $1 million to settle 
the matter but they refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The store owner then filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court, 
claiming he was a victim of fraud, conspiracy, conversion and trespass. He also 
filed a report with Riverside police, who are investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the same high school in Korea as Mr. Ahn," said Chae, who came to 
the United States in 1981. "I gave Mr. Kim a job and treated him like a real 
brother. I'm very disappointed because they're so greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kim and his lawyer, Richard Song-Uk Kim, are preparing a lawsuit of 
their own. Attorney Kim said his client is the real victim because his boss 
threatened to have him deported unless he agreed to share his lottery earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chae was present, Kim said his client purchased the winning lottery 
ticket on his own. After winning the jackpot, he said, Kim agreed to give his 
boss half of his earnings even though there was no agreement that they would 
split the prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client is a very generous guy," Kim said. "He offered to split the money 
out of a humanitarian gesture." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kim said Chae became more greedy as time passed and pressured his 
client into giving up 60% of his winnings by threatening to turn him in to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service if he objected. Kim said his client has 
applied for permanent residency status but has not received his green card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Kim wanted to settle it amicably, so he agreed to give up 10% more," 
Richard Kim said. "For someone without a green card, whenever someone makes a 
threat to have you deported, that's very scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said his client was at the mercy of an "unscrupulous employer who abused 
his human rights," and is seeking sole ownership of the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're suffering from serious emotional distress," Richard Kim said of Kim 
and the Ahns. "They're having trouble sleeping at night because of the damage 
to their reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Chae is also feeling burned by the media attention and is in hiding until the 
case is resolved in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend told me that he overheard some people talking about the case and 
they said they thought the store owner was a greedy, bad man," Chae said. "My 
family and I are very unhappy now." 
</P>
<P>
 Chae attributes his current situation to bad luck. 
</P>
<P>

NIXON HEARS OUT ZHIRINOVSKY AT CLOSE OF MOSCOW TRIP; RUSSIA: RADICAL LEADER 
REPEATS DUBIOUS IDEAS. THE EX-PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY SAYS HIS IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN 
OVERBLOWN. 
</P>

 Richard Nixon, the former American President, wound up an 11-day 
"fact-finding" mission to Moscow on Tuesday by hearing out Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, the Russian master of hyperbole. In 80 minutes, Nixon got an 
earful. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dubious assertions Zhirinovsky made in their closed-door meeting 
were: 
</P>
<P>
 * 300 million Muslims are massing on Russia's southern border and could take 
over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zhirinovsky, who is determined to stop them, is so popular that he is 
certain to win Russia's 1996 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 * Radical democrats, who have fallen from power in the Russian government, are 
determined to stop him. With American support, they are plotting a military 
coup to shut down Parliament, in which Zhirinovsky is a leading figure, and 
install a dictatorship under President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 This was vintage Zhirinovsky, from the blowhard jingoist who ranted on 
television last fall, appealing to Russians' fears of economic and ethnic 
turmoil and capturing the biggest vote for any party in December's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time he was speaking to a former U.S. President, an influential 
figure who will convey impressions about Russia to President Clinton and other 
Western leaders who are concerned, even alarmed, that Zhirinovsky's rise means 
Russia is slipping back into the enemy camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointedly snubbed by Clinton during a summit with Yeltsin here two months ago, 
Zhirinovsky arrived at Nixon's hotel suite determined to fix that impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by the American, Zhirinovsky tried to sound "benign and 
responsible," Nixon spokesman Dmitri Simes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky disavowed past statements that espoused fascist, anti-Semitic and 
imperialist views. He handed Nixon a copy of his autobiography, "The Last Dash 
South," to deliver to Clinton, with a handwritten message inside the cover: "I 
don't want to be misunderstood by you." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like Mr. Clinton not to be afraid of me and my party," Zhirinovsky 
explained to reporters afterward. "We are not a fascist party. We are not an 
anti-Semitic party. . . . We are the party that is against any violence, and we 
are ready to prove our superiority through elections." 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton reads the book, he might be forgiven for viewing Zhirinovsky as an 
imperialist. It ends with a vision, glorious to the author, of Russian soldiers 
advancing to the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 In his meeting with Nixon, Zhirinovsky could not help sounding like the racist 
he said he is not. "He did say that the greatest threat to mankind is the 
Muslim threat," Simes recalled. "He said, 'But how would you react if Negroes 
took over major white cities in the United States?' . . . He said that is like 
what is happening in Russia, that people from the Caucasus, the southern mafia, 
are everywhere, and that upsets the Russian people a great deal, and we have to 
respond to this sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, making his 10th visit to Russia, sought audiences across the political 
spectrum but set a condition for receiving Zhirinovsky -- there would be no 
joint appearance in public. The elder statesman said nothing to reporters after 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, he described Zhirinovsky as "a brilliant political tactician" 
who "pushes hot-button issues that are totally irresponsible." He added, "I 
would seriously doubt that the Russians, who are very serious people, would 
consider him" as their next president. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Zhirinovsky, a Nixon aide said: "He's smart, articulate and unburdened by 
an excessive concern for the truth. He confronted his past statements by 
denying he ever made them or explaining them in a different light. He's not a 
devoted anti-Semite but an opportunist. He speaks to the mood of his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Nixon confirmed his impression that Zhirinovsky is a serious player 
whose importance is overblown in the United States," the aide added. 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment seems to be confirmed by recent defections of three leading 
members of Zhirinovsky's party, which could undermine its strength in the Duma, 
or lower house of Parliament. Among them are Viktor Kobelev, its No. 2 deputy 
there, and Anatoly Kaspirovsky, a TV hypnotist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kobelev said last month that he was quitting to protest Zhirinovsky's 
friendship with German neo-fascist leader Gerhard Frey and his threats to wage 
war on the West if it launches air strikes against Bosnian Serbs, to create 
nuclear holocaust in Germany and to blockade Japan.

TAILHOOK HELPED STEER NAVY TO NEW COURSE ON SEX ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Navy begins to close its books on the Tailhook scandal -- with 
seemingly little to show for it in terms of formal prosecutions and punishments 
-- critics are asking whether the worst such episode in modern naval history 
was all for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the initial investigation concluded that 83 women had been assaulted 
or molested -- and more than 140 officers had engaged in misconduct -- at the 
now-infamous Las Vegas convention of naval aviators in 1991, none of the 
resulting trials has produced a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lt. Paula Coughlin, the Navy pilot whose complaints helped thrust the 
scandal onto the nation's front pages, has resigned in despair, saying she has 
been subjected to "covert and overt attacks" from colleagues ever since she 
reported the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But a closer look suggests that the Tailhook scandal has indeed had a profound 
impact on the status of women in the Navy and is likely to prove a watershed in 
prodding the Navy to reverse course on the issue of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the low score card on courts-martial convictions -- the result of a 
variety of legal difficulties -- the Tailhook affair has ended hopes for 
promotion (and thus ruined the careers) of dozens of officers -- a signal that, 
in Navy terms, is as clear as a court-martial conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its initial hesitation, the Navy hierarchy has moved quickly to 
change attitudes within the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's widely publicized Navy sensitivity training detailing red, orange 
and green zones for proper behavior was ridiculed by civilians, but officials 
say it has worked reasonably well to help sailors define what constitutes 
sexual harassment under the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Navy has opened up a plethora of jobs -- such as combat aviation -- to 
women. On orders from Navy Secretary John H. Dalton, the admirals are 
scrambling to integrate women into the crews of aircraft carriers and 
destroyers -- some of them eventually as skippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with female officers and sailors over the last few months suggest 
that the changes have been so fundamental that they qualify as something of a 
social revolution in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Deborah Branson, a veteran naval aviator who had been frustrated over 
the treatment of Navy women, calls the changes stunning and credits the impact 
of Tailhook for bringing them about so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women today are out there doing the job," she says, referring to the recent 
decision by the top Navy leadership to accept women in career-enhancing combat 
assignments. Without Tailhook, she contends, "it wouldn't have happened as 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence J. Korb, a Brookings Institution analyst who served as assistant 
secretary of defense for manpower issues, agrees. "I think women in the Navy 
came out ahead because of Tailhook," Korb asserts. "I don't think the Navy 
would have acted as quickly without it." 
</P>
<P>
 Korb argues that change in the sea service often follows a pattern: initial 
recalcitrance, followed by a striking turnaround in policy. It did the same on 
such issues as integrating blacks, closing unneeded naval bases and devising a 
strategy for the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Navy has not eliminated bias against women in its ranks. They 
still are prohibited from serving on certain vessels -- such as submarines. And 
everyone is not fully on board when it comes to accepting women as equals. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, women in all 
four armed services told of instances in which they were subjected to sexual 
harassment, only to find that they -- rather than the offenders -- were 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sign of the Navy's altered course, Assistant Secretary of Defense 
Edwin Dorn apologized immediately after the women testified, admitting that 
"some egregious cases of sexual harassment have been handled incompetently."

FROM DEFENSIVE STRATEGY TO FRONT LINE IN WAR ON AIDS; DR. WILLIAM PAUL LEAVES 
IMMUNOLOGY LAB TO COORDINATE RESEARCH, BUDGETING ON THE DISEASE BECAUSE OF 
'OBLIGATION TO DO OUR BEST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why would a bench scientist -- an internationally known immunologist regarded 
as one of the best in his field -- leave his laboratory to work in a hornet's 
nest? 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, why would anyone who has dedicated virtually his entire 
career to research willingly give most of that up to take on a job where he 
must juggle the competing interests of policy-makers, members of Congress, 
activists and researchers all involved in the battle against AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrible disease," Dr. William Paul says. "We all have some 
obligation to do our best. We all ought to get involved. I am motivated by a 
genuine wish to make whatever contribution I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, 57, who now heads the Laboratory of Immunology at the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- part of the National Institutes of Health 
-- is about to become director of the newly transformed Office of AIDS Research 
at NIH and NIH's associate director for AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been associated with NIH for more than 30 years and has headed the 
infectious disease agency's immunology lab since 1970. He is an expert in the 
workings of cytokines -- a family of chemicals produced by the immune system -- 
and is the discoverer of one of them, interleukin-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of AIDS Research was given new powers by Congress last year and is 
expected to wield considerable clout in deciding how the federal government 
will use its $1.3 billion in AIDS funding. Its responsibilities include 
developing a strategic plan for the NIH-wide AIDS research program, 
coordinating AIDS research activities across NIH and developing consolidated 
budget estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 It also will develop a budget for fighting AIDS, similar to the National 
Cancer Institute's budget, which will be directly submitted to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul also will oversee a soon-to-be-established national advisory council and 
administer a discretionary fund for exploring unanticipated scientific 
opportunities and unexpected public health crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul says he intends to listen to all voices in the AIDS community, from 
researchers to activists, but does not believe that the nation is ready to 
launch a "Manhattan Project" against AIDS, as some activists have advocated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to invest our money in a crash program, we would have to be very 
wise in choosing, because we could easily make the wrong decision," he says. 
"The consequence of (choosing wrongly) is that we would fall behind. It's not 
yet clear where the great push should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't understand that most of the things scientists do don't 
work. Those of us who have done it our whole lives know that. Others are not 
completely attuned to that -- they don't understand the frustration of trying 
something and not getting it quite right. That's why a Manhattan Project won't 
work. We could end up not doing things where the greater opportunities lie." 
</P>
<P>
 His approach will be to "take a broader view of what needs to be done, to plan 
things to avoid duplication and seize the opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process has to be put in place where we put the best of our science and 
clinical investigation to work against this disease," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe that Paul's lack of prior involvement in AIDS research will be a 
strength, rather than a weakness, that he can assume his new duties 
unencumbered by activities or alliances that could color his thinking. If there 
are critics of his appointment, they have chosen to remain silent for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Paul is a highly accomplished and respected immunologist who brings the 
intellect of a world-class scientist, a commitment to biomedical research and a 
thorough knowledge of the organization and operations of the NIH to this vital 
position," said Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, president of the American Foundation 
for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul comes from the institute that has become known as the government's lead 
institute on AIDS research. It is the same institute headed by Dr. Anthony S. 
Fauci, who ran the Office of AIDS Research before it was reconstituted. Fauci, 
who is deeply involved in his own AIDS research, long has served as the 
government's leading spokesman for its AIDS research activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who supported the legislation that moved AIDS research and funding 
decisions into the new office had come to believe, whether true or not, that 
Fauci's dual roles were a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fauci calls Paul "a very distinguished immunologist" and says: "I look forward 
to working with him. . . . I've known him for 25 years. He's a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul says he intends to try to continue to spend some time in his lab because 
"my work gives me pleasure," although he acknowledges that "there will be days 
where that will be impossible."

RABIN REJECTS PLO TERMS FOR NEW TALKS; ISRAEL: ADDRESSING U.S. JEWISH LEADERS, 
PREMIER RULES OUT REMOVAL OF SETTLERS FROM TERRITORIES. HE MEETS WITH CLINTON 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Although he predicted final agreement soon on the first phase of Palestinian 
self-rule, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday ruled out the sort 
of concessions that the Palestine Liberation Organization has demanded before 
it will resume peace talks with his government. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks came in an uncompromising speech to his government's strongest 
U.S. supporters, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, who meets President Clinton at the White House today, said his 
government is unwilling to reopen issues that were decided before the PLO 
suspended negotiations after an Israeli settler massacred about 30 Palestinian 
worshipers at the Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 He rejected the PLO call for removing Jewish settlements from the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, saying Palestinians and Jews are destined to live together 
forever both in Israel and the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is trying to broker a means to restart talks over 
details left unsettled when Israel and the PLO signed an agreement Sept. 13 on 
the White House lawn calling for Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank town of Jericho. Rabin and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher discussed the matter for an hour or so Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To help restart the negotiations, Christopher urged Rabin to consider PLO 
proposals that would put Hebron under the control of a Palestinian police 
force, according to the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Israel nor the PLO has given any public indication that it is ready to 
soften its conditions for resuming talks. After the massacre in the West Bank 
town of Hebron, the PLO said it would not continue talks without new measures 
to protect Palestinian civilians. Israel condemned the killings but said it 
will not risk its own security to satisfy PLO demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the seeming deadlock, Israeli and Palestinian officials both predicted 
that the talks will resume eventually. U.S. mediators expressed similar 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Rabin asserted: "We are near the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho 
stage in the negotiations for peace. We already see the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin said Israel will not allow the Hebron massacre to erode its own 
security. "I must clarify to our Palestinian partners: The feeling of loss and 
sorrow in the wake of the Hebron tragedy will not change our fundamental 
positions regarding the security of the state of Israel and its citizens, 
including the Jewish residents of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip," he said. 
"We have no intention of compromising on any security matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "As horrendous as the murder in Hebron was, there can be no departure from the 
course of negotiation with the Palestinians," he added. "It is time to get back 
to the negotiating table." 
</P>
<P>
 In public, at least, Administration officials have said Israel has done enough 
to meet the Palestinians' legitimate concerns. They have urged the PLO to 
restart the talks without insisting on more concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration is trying to negotiate a deal with Arafat in which the 
PLO would promise to resume the talks in exchange for a U.N. Security Council 
resolution condemning the Hebron killings. The American government has blocked 
action on the resolution while negotiating with Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel objects strongly to the resolution because it refers to East Jerusalem, 
which was under Jordanian control before the 1967 Middle East War, as "occupied 
territory." Although Washington has generally resisted such phrasing, officials 
have hinted that Washington might be willing to accept that concept if it 
results in an early resumption of the negotiations.

ISRAEL PRESSES ITS DRIVE AGAINST EXTREMISTS; MIDEAST: LEADER OF HEBRON SETTLERS 
IS ARRAIGNED ON OLD CHARGES. BUT HE VOWS TO REMAIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Pressing their campaign against extremist Jewish groups in the occupied West 
Bank, Israeli authorities on Tuesday brought the leader of the 450 Jewish 
settlers in Hebron into court here on a 2-year-old charge, symbolizing the 
political shift now under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Moshe Levinger, spiritual father of the Israeli settlers movement in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, was charged with interfering with the troops policing 
Hebron, where the little community of Jews living among 70,000 Palestinians has 
long been a flash point of tension. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge was relatively minor and the incident far from threatening, even at 
the time. But Levinger was arraigned in Jerusalem district court and will go on 
trial next month to make clear the government's determination to halt settler 
attacks on Palestinians. The maximum sentence is six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinger, however, replied at a right-wing rally in Tel Aviv on Tuesday 
evening that he and other settlers are equally determined to remain in Hebron 
and elsewhere in their communities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be moved, and I believe fully that nothing bad will happen to the 
Jews in Hebron," Levinger said to the cheers of an estimated 30,000 supporters 
at one of Tel Aviv's largest political rallies in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the opposition Likud Party, told the rally, 
"If we don't have the right to live in Hebron, we don't have the right to live 
anywhere in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "A government like this must be brought down. . . , " Netanyahu said of Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's center-left coalition. "We will fight for the heart of 
our land." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, a few toting rifles, marched from the Square of the Kings of 
Israel in the center of Tel Aviv to the nearby Defense Ministry. Pushing baby 
carriages, carrying torches and waving Israeli flags, they chanted slogans 
against Rabin and his "leftist government." Four people were reported arrested 
in scuffles with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Israeli security forces were on high alert to foil suicide attacks 
threatened by Muslim fundamentalists on Jewish settlers in revenge for a 
settler's massacre of about 30 Palestinians as they prayed in a Hebron mosque 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northern Gaza Strip, an Israeli police undercover squad opened fire on 
a car whose occupants had just shot at an Israeli army patrol, said a military 
spokesman; two Palestinians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on government orders, police closed the offices of Kach and Kahane 
Chai, two extremist Jewish groups outlawed on Sunday. Dr. Baruch Goldstein, the 
U.S.-born settler who carried out the Hebron attack before being beaten to 
death, belonged to Kach; members of both groups are believed responsible for 
other attacks on Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem charged in a hard-hitting report 
Tuesday that, over the years, the army and police have allowed settlers to 
attack Palestinians "with virtual impunity," rarely intervening to halt armed 
assaults and even more rarely prosecuting those responsible, even when 
Palestinians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eitan Fellner, a B'Tselem researcher, said Israeli military authorities have 
come to view settlers, "despite of or because of" the attacks on Palestinians, 
as "a contribution to security and the maintenance of public order" in the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli military and police spokesmen had no immediate comment on the B'Tselem 
report, but the army issued a statement saying Israeli troops are authorized to 
shoot at settlers if they endanger other lives. Police and army officers 
testifying before a commission investigating the Hebron massacre said last week 
that standing orders prohibited firing at settlers in any circumstances.

 Seven crewmen who died when a U.S. gunship crashed off Kenya might have tried 
to parachute too late. Rescue teams searched the waters offshore Tuesday for a 
missing crewman who reportedly jumped clear of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Mike Gannon, speaking from the scene, said six crewmen survived, 
including three who stayed in the plane when it ditched in the Indian Ocean 
late Monday 75 miles north of Mombasa. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead crewmen's parachutes were deployed, indicating they might have 
attempted to jump when the aircraft was too low. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary indications pointed to engine failure as the cause of the crash, 
an official said. The plane and its crew were from the Air Force's 16th Special 
Operations Squadron, based in Florida.

 Knife-brandishing inmates overpowered guards and seized Cardinal Aloisio 
Lorscheider, a cleric who was once regarded as a candidate for the papacy, in a 
prison uprising Tuesday in Fortaleza, a city on Brazil's northeastern coast, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two inmates died in a shootout during the hostage-taking, and at least two 
prison guards were wounded, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 hours of tense negotiations, police agreed to provide weapons and a 
getaway car and turn off the lights outside the prison in exchange for the 
release of most of their 12 hostages, including Lorscheider. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 11 inmates left only one hostage -- a wounded prison guard -- behind 
when they departed the maximum-security Paulo Sallasate Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cardinal and the other hostages are in great danger," said police Sgt. 
Luis Gonzaga da Costa Neto by telephone from Fortaleza. "These men are heavily 
armed and have broken their word." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the trouble began around 11:45 a.m. Tuesday when the inmates 
jumped prison guards, wrestled away their weapons and grabbed Lorscheider and 
others who were visiting the prison at the invitation of a church commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brazilian television crew filming the visit showed one prisoner pouncing on 
Lorscheider. He held a knife to his neck, then threw him to the ground, while 
others overpowered guards and took hostages. Besides Lorscheider, the prisoners 
were holding two auxiliary bishops, a federal legislator, Roman Catholic lay 
workers, a policeman and two photojournalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities feared for the health of the cardinal, who is 69 and has undergone 
cardiac bypass operations. Despite the initial scuffle and hours of 
tension-filled negotiations that followed, he was unharmed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though uprisings are frequent in Brazil's troubled prison system, rarely has 
there been such an illustrious hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorscheider, one of five active Brazilian cardinals, has long been an 
important voice in the Brazilian Conference of Bishops; he twice has served as 
president of the group, which is the largest in the Catholic world with 373 
bishops. He is now archbishop of Fortaleza, a city of 1.8 million and the 
capital of Ceara state. 
</P>
<P>
 A powerfully built man with a surprisingly soft voice and snow-white hair, 
Lorscheider, of Brazilian-German descent, became a bishop in 1962 and was named 
cardinal in 1976. He was widely regarded as a strong candidate for Pope in 1978 
after the death of Paul VI. But Lorscheider was excluded then because of his 
fragile health, and John Paul I succeeded Paul VI. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorscheider rose to prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s when he spoke 
against the hard-line military regime that ruled Brazil. A champion of the poor 
and a critic of the dictatorship, he received several death threats and was 
briefly jailed by the military in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorscheider was visiting the Fortaleza prison in part to investigate reports 
of abuse against several of its 485 inmates.

PARTICIPANTS DUB GLOBAL JOBS CONFERENCE A 'FIRST STEP'; ECONOMY: FIRST SUCH G-7 
MEETING PRODUCES FEW LESSONS. EUROPEANS SHOW NO WILLINGNESS TO END SAFETY NETS 
FOR UNEMPLOYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Officials from the leading industrial democracies completed their first jobs 
conference Tuesday, agreeing on the need to improve education, training and 
worker skills to combat unemployment but failing to bridge a crucial gap 
between the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 European delegations showed no sign that they are willing to take the 
politically risky step of reducing their traditional, expensive support for 
social safety nets -- which in many cases make a lifetime on government 
unemployment benefits more financially attractive than work on the lowest rung 
of the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials could point to few specific lessons they learned in the day 
and a half of meetings in the heart of America's Rust Belt that would shift 
Clinton Administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the officials -- from the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Japan and Italy -- left here on an upbeat note. 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed in a final statement read by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that 
they had taken "an important first step, very frankly trading ideas, learning 
from one another" about what has worked, as they try to pull their nations out 
of the troubling unemployment that has dogged them even as other economic 
conditions begin to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed that there is no single solution, no one idea or action that will 
work for every country," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, officials went out of their way to portray the meeting as an 
informal discussion of the difficulty they have encountered in trying to bring 
down unemployment rates that have reached as high as nearly 12%, almost twice 
that in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of their common effort was the belief that growth in one nation 
can help fuel growth in the others. Thus, with modest goals, conference 
participants -- ministers of finance, economics, commerce and labor or their 
deputies -- could proclaim the meeting a success; they emerged from their 
private sessions citing support they had gained for existing policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the Cabinet-level meeting had placed the question of providing jobs 
firmly on the agenda of the heads of government of the Group of Seven nations. 
They are to meet next in Naples, Italy, this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said the officials could "tell where they blew it" in some programs 
and mentioned one country, which he did not identify, that confessed mistakes 
in funding an early retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
 As for specific lessons learned, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of President 
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said she wants to study further a 
French program that helps the unemployed start small businesses. She also 
expressed interest in a Japanese program that helps companies maintain work 
forces during dire economic times. "That's something the United States should 
look at," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said European nations have "developed some 
restrictions on the ability of individual nations to lure jobs, lure factories" 
from their neighbors. This, he said, may offer valuable lessons for America, 
where states offer lower taxes and other enticements to lure companies from 
their neighbors -- thereby raising unemployment in those states. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the center of the conference were the different approaches that have 
developed in America, Canada, Europe and Japan to employment questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the United States, and to some degree in Canada, workplace "flexibility" 
-- economists' code word to denote a lack of rules prohibiting companies from 
firing workers and moving operations -- is seen as a key difference from 
Europe, where ossified job rules protect workers at the expense of business. 
</P>
<P>
 * European nations offer an extensive network of social services that protect 
unemployed workers, train high school students for factory jobs and provide 
enviable health and vacation benefits compared to those generally available in 
America. These benefits set European workers, businesses and governments apart 
from the United States -- and have been blamed for making the cost of creating 
jobs and hiring workers to fill them increasingly expensive. To shift from this 
course, said Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's chief economist, "is a very 
big psychological change." 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said there was disagreement over the 
correct government role in providing such services and "whether or not existing 
plans are impediments or not to the flexibility of job creation." 
</P>
<P>
 America is "far more flexible and resilient" in private companies' abilities 
to shift in response to economic trends, Reich said, "but in terms of 
investment in human capital (social service and worker training programs), we 
lag behind."

MOST ARE AGAINST CENSORSHIP -- WITH SOME MAJOR EXCEPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Europeans and North Americans oppose the idea of press censorship in 
principle, but their mood changes when they contemplate restricting sensational 
or troublesome news stories or telecasts that bother them. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey released Tuesday by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the 
Press revealed a surprising sentiment for restrictions on media among 
Americans, Canadians, Mexicans, Britons, French, Germans, Italians and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found the most sentiment for censorship in Britain and France, the 
least in Italy and Spain. Atop this, East Germans, only recently living under 
communism, favored censorship more than West Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Substantial majorities in six countries -- ranging to 80% in Britain -- 
favored restrictions on the press to protect military secrets. Such moves were 
favored by 69% of Americans. A plurality opted for restrictions in Spain. Only 
the Italians rejected them. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every country favored censorship to discourage terrorism. The majority 
in the United States was 60%. Again, only the Italians rejected such 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Italians joined all the others in favoring restrictions on news of 
unnecessary violence. The majorities ranged from 52% in the United States to 
83% in France. The Italian willingness to support censorship on this issue 
evidently stemmed from the feeling by many Italians that media attention to the 
violence of the Red Brigades fed egos in the terrorist group and thus 
encouraged their attacks in the 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority or plurality in almost every country, reaching a high of 77% in 
Mexico, favored censorship to restrict portrayals of explicit sex. The Italians 
were once more the only exception. In the United States, such censorship was 
advocated by 59%. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when asked if they favored restrictions on what newspapers and television 
report in general, heavy majorities disagreed. The loudest opposition -- 73% -- 
came from Spain, which emerged from four decades of fascist dictatorship less 
than 20 years ago. In the United States, 65% opposed restrictions.

AMERICANS GET NO GOLD STARS FOR CURRENT EVENTS ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The test did not seem difficult. Anyone who keeps up with the news ought to 
know that Boris N. Yeltsin is president of Russia and Boutros Boutros-Ghali is 
secretary general of the United Nations, right? 
</P>
<P>
 But Americans failed badly, faring far worse than their neighbors and West 
European allies in a survey of eight countries released Tuesday by the Times 
Mirror Center for the People & the Press. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its survey of how the world regards newspaper and television news 
coverage, the center asked five current events questions in the United States, 
Canada, Mexico, Britain, France, Spain, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans did best. But the results offer a bleak picture of American 
knowledge of current events, as the center reported that an astounding 37% of 
Americans polled answered all five questions incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are how some of the groups fared: 
</P>
<P>
 * 94% of Germans correctly named Yeltsin as Russia's president. The right 
answer was given by 76% of Italians, 65% of Spaniards, 63% of British, 61% of 
the French, 59% of the Canadians, 50% of the Americans and 42% of the Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 58% of the Germans knew Boutros-Ghali is U.N. secretary general. The 
question was answered correctly by 43% of the Italians, 32% of the French, 26% 
of the Canadians, 22% of the British, 15% of the Spaniards, 14% of the Mexicans 
and 13% of the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 79% of Germans knew that the Palestinians are the people with whom the 
Israelis recently reached a peace accord. The question was answered correctly 
by 60% of the French, 59% of the British, 56% of the Italians, 51% of the 
Canadians, 40% of the Americans, 29% of the Spaniards and 21% of the Mexicans.

 U.N. nuclear inspectors left North Korea without checking everything they 
wanted, and the Pyongyang regime threatened to halt inspections over a dispute 
with Washington. South Korean news reports said the inspectors were denied 
access to a radio chemical laboratory suspected of being used to extract 
plutonium, a key component of nuclear warheads. The North Koreans have denied 
working on atomic weapons.

ARKANSAS TIES A DRAWBACK FOR NOMINEES; WHITE HOUSE: OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING FOR 
CANDIDATES TO REPLACE HUBBELL AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BUT WANT TO AVOID THE 
APPEARANCE OF CRONYISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after Associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell's surprise resignation, 
Administration officials Tuesday began searching for a replacement who lacks a 
certain credential that a year ago might have won the job: home-state ties to 
the President and First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid Hubbell's departure on ethics accusations and the uproar over the 
Whitewater affair, Administration officials virtually ruled out candidates who 
might reinforce accusations that the Clintons had sought to run Washington with 
a core of Arkansas friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes without saying that anything that smells of cronyism is out of the 
question," one Justice Department source said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the search began, it was also clear that the choice for the department's 
No. 3 post would have special significance. The back-to-back resignations of 
Hubbell and Bernard Nussbaum, the White House counsel, amid allegations of 
ethics violations have made it imperative that the replacement underscore the 
Administration's commitment to choosing officials of unquestioned integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is also significant because of the unusually important political 
role the Justice Department has played in an Administration that has sought to 
appeal to a broad spectrum of Americans on such issues as crime, civil rights, 
immigration and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Reno's top lieutenants must be prepared to take on extra 
managerial duties because Reno, an unusually high-profile attorney general, is 
so often out of town. "This is a delicate job in a crucial agency," one 
Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration cannot waste time on the choice. The Justice Department has 
been hobbled since the beginning of Clinton's presidency by a lack of top-level 
appointees. Only now is it getting in place its deputy attorney general and its 
assistant attorney general for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno will "want to fill it promptly so the department is not criticized for 
failing to fill yet another key post," one Justice official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbell, with close personal and professional ties to the Clintons, announced 
Monday that he would leave because a fight with former law firm partners over 
disputed billing practices was distracting him from his job. 
</P>
<P>
 While the search for his replacement is still in its earliest stages, 
Administration officials said they expect the candidates to include some within 
Justice. Among the insiders, officials said, would be Jo Ann Harris, the former 
New York attorney and professor who heads the department's criminal division, 
and Charles F. C. Ruff, who has held positions as a Watergate prosecutor, U.S. 
attorney and senior Justice Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment now may be less crucial in assuring that the often more 
moderate White House viewpoint is heard when the outspoken attorney general 
strays from the Administration text. White House officials believe that they 
have managerial skill and political acumen with the appointment of Ronald A. 
Klain, a former White House lawyer who last month become counselor to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, 60, was in private practice in New York City and a law professor at 
Pace University School of Law before she was nominated last September to head 
the criminal division. She was a journalist for 14 years, then worked at the 
Justice Department from 1974 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruff, 54, worked for the Justice Department in a series of posts from 1973 to 
1982, including acting deputy attorney general and U.S. attorney for the 
District of Columbia. He went into private practice in 1982 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) on Tuesday became the first 
Democrat to call for congressional hearings on Whitewater, saying public 
exposure of "all the facts" is probably the only way now that the White House 
can clear up the perception that "it may be holding back information."

ANGINA HOSPITALIZATION GUIDELINES EASED; MEDICINE: LOW-RISK HEART OUTPATIENTS 
ADVISED TO SEE THEIR DOCTOR WITHIN 72 HOURS AFTER INITIAL INCIDENT FOR 
DETERMINATION OF FOLLOW-UP TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Patients with unstable angina do not necessarily have to be hospitalized if 
they are otherwise at low risk for heart attacks and are seen by doctors again 
within 72 hours, federal health officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They issued guidelines for the condition that are intended to help doctors 
quickly determine the appropriate treatment for patients, including whether 
they should be admitted to hospitals or treated as outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficulty in diagnosing the condition and evaluating the degree of risk often 
have led to unnecessary hospital admissions, said Harvard University 
cardiologist Eugene Braunwald, who chaired the panel that drew up the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Unstable angina is caused by underlying coronary heart disease and differs 
from stable angina in that it strikes at unexpected times, such as when an 
individual is sleeping or at rest. It occurs when the heart does not receive 
sufficient oxygen, usually as a result of clogged coronary arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition is often difficult to diagnose because it can be confused with 
other medical problems. Many persons suffering from unstable angina are unaware 
that they have heart disease, the leading killer of American adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines, released in Atlanta at the annual meeting of the American 
College of Cardiology, were developed by a panel of 19 private sector experts 
in a process managed by Duke University Medical Center and co-sponsored by the 
agency and by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute -- a branch of the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the guidelines, only about half of all cases of unstable angina 
require hospitalization, while the rest can be treated on an outpatient basis. 
Patients, however, must be accurately evaluated in the emergency room before 
being sent home to be certain that they are at no immediate risk of a heart 
attack, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those patients can be treated with aspirin or other blood thinners and 
released, as long as they are again evaluated within 72 hours, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accurate diagnosis of unstable angina is very important for patients in the 
hospital emergency room," said Dr. J. Jarrett Clinton, administrator of the 
agency. "It ensures that patients at risk of heart attack are admitted and 
placed in coronary care units where appropriate care is available. Accurate 
diagnosis also steers low-risk patients -- those not in imminent danger -- into 
outpatient care." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the guidelines stressed that anyone experiencing chest pains of 
"unusual character, severity or duration" should go immediately to a hospital 
emergency room for evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Admissions to hospitals for unstable angina rose more than fourfold between 
1983 and 1991, from 130,000 to 570,000, totaling 3.1 million hospital days, 
according to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, part of the U.S. 
Public Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines also recommended that: 
</P>
<P>
 * All patients believed to have unstable angina should be evaluated initially 
with a physical exam and electrocardiogram. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drugs for initial treatment should include aspirin, nitroglycerin, beta 
blockers and heparin and calcium channel blockers should not be the first-line 
approach, although they are frequently administered first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patients believed to be at intermediate or high risk of heart attack or 
death should be admitted to a coronary care unit and should include individuals 
who have suffered more than 20 minutes of pain at rest, those with fluid on the 
lungs, heart murmurs or low blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patients who do not respond to treatment within 30 minutes should be 
considered candidates for catheterization, that is, placement of a tube into 
the heart to detect blockages. Bypass surgery or angioplasty ultimately should 
be considered.

MICHIGAN VOTERS HIKE SALES TAX TO FINANCE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michigan voters overwhelmingly chose a higher sales tax over an income tax 
increase Tuesday to generate $10.2 billion for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposal A, which will raise the sales tax from 4% to 6%, was the only measure 
on the special statewide ballot.If voters had rejected it, a law passed by the 
Legislature would have required the income tax to be raised from 4.6% to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 With 88% of the precincts counted, 1,441,224 voters were in favor of the 
measure and 624,041 had voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The election marked the end of a saga that began in July, when lawmakers and 
Gov. John Engler ended the use of property taxes for school operations without 
having any replacement money in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 That wiped out about $7 billion that had been used for educating Michigan's 
1.6 million schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales tax increase was backed by Engler, a first-term Republican who 
campaigned in 1990 on a promise to cut property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Engler said the challenge was to get voters to understand their choices. "When 
they understood, they agreed with me that the sales tax was a better way to 
go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters had rejected five sales tax increases since 1978 and had turned down 
seven other plans dealing with school finances or property taxes since 1972.

THE CONTINUING CHARACTERS IN LONG-RUNNING COURTROOM DRAMA; PROFILES: CASE HAS 
CONSUMED DEFENDER AND PROSECUTOR, KEPT THE WOUNDS RAW FOR VICTIM'S FATHER AND 
ACCUSED'S MOTHER. FOR A LAWYER ON TRIAL, IT'S BEEN THE ULTIMATE TEST.

 Over the years, memories have faded and witnesses have vanished. At least 17 
judges have handled the case, including one who committed suicide while 
presiding over jury selection. Indictments were once thrown out because a court 
reporter typed so many errors into transcripts. One trial ended with a hung 
jury, shattering local and state records for its longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 As the People vs. Thomas Maniscalco case appeared in jeopardy of a second 
mistrial, the long-running legal drama ended abruptly on Tuesday with the 
Westminster lawyer's conviction of ordering the executions of three people. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict came 10 years to the day since Maniscalco's arrest, nearly 14 
years since two men and a young woman were found executed in a Westminster 
ranch home over Memorial Day weekend in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 For a retired Los Alamitos police officer, the grief remains as raw as the day 
he learned that his daughter had been raped and shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
 For a former judge, the case has consumed her for nearly a decade. She says 
she is so convinced that Maniscalco -- her former law student and friend -- is 
innocent that she is defending him for free. 
</P>
<P>
 For a veteran prosecutor, time became an enemy in an unrelenting mission to 
send Maniscalco to the gas chamber -- or at least state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 For Maniscalco, the case has been the ultimate legal test for a lawyer who has 
steadfastly protested his innocence and has talked about one day picking up 
where he left off -- representing bikers and drug defendants. All these years 
he has kept up his California Bar dues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case has a life of its own, an absolute life of its own," said defense 
attorney Joanne Harrold, who befriended Maniscalco as his former law school 
professor and has represented him for a decade. "Everything that could have 
gone wrong in this case has; things that no one could ever imagine happening, 
has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Capt. Barry Price, who assisted with the original 
investigation, offers a more sinister view: "This case is like a curse." The 
Defense Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Harrold met Thomas Maniscalco and his dad, John, when they were her 
students at Glendale University College of Law in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 She was struck by the close relationship between the two men, and their 
determination to start a law practice together. She remembers that they stood 
out in her class: John Maniscalco was a retired New York police sergeant and 
his son was a co-founder of the Hessian motorcycle gang eager to become a 
lawyer to defend other bikers from police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrold recalled Thomas Maniscalco as a gentleman who had to study hard 
because the law didn't come easily for him. She gave him private tutoring, and 
over the years the two became friends. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no surprise a few years later that Maniscalco turned to Harrold, a 
former Westminster municipal judge, for help after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 She was appointed to Maniscalco's case in 1984, but had legal problems of her 
own: She had been removed from the bench and charged with a misdemeanor count 
of lying about her residence to qualify for a 1982 judicial ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, courthouse wags were taking bets on who would go to trial first, 
Maniscalco or his attorney. Those wagering on Maniscalco won. Harrold was 
convicted in March, 1992, and her case is now being reviewed by the State Bar, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maniscalco's court-appointed attorney, Harrold was paid by the taxpayers 
and the prosecution criticized her as riding the "gravy train" with delaying 
tactics -- a charge she denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrold, 50, was replaced as lead counsel in the fall of 1991 after a judge 
raised concerns that Harrold's back problems would cause further trial delays. 
Harrold objected and continues to sit as co-counsel -- without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, she said she spends 60 hours a week minimum on the 
case, working alongside defense attorney Curt Livesay, formerly the No. 3 
prosecutor in the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. More than 100 
boxes of documents are stacked at her home, along with dozens of large 
multicolored binders filled with evidence. She's taken to writing on both sides 
of each sheet to save paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dedication has taken its toll on her private practice and her family. The 
Christmas holidays -- which came during the middle of Maniscalco's second trial 
-- were a blur. She finds herself dreaming about legal strategies and thinking 
about the case at stop lights and when she's grocery shopping for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Some friends think she's crazy. She says she's lucky to have a supportive 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me this isn't a job," Harrold says. "If I walked away, I couldn't look at 
myself in the mirror. I know he is not guilty. It is not possible that he 
committed these crimes." The Prosecutor 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Maniscalco and his co-defendant, Daniel Duffy, has generated 
more than 100,000 pages of evidence and court transcripts spanning 14 years. 
But prosecutor Rick King recites key dates and witness testimony like most 
people rattle off their phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 King has been on the case since 1988, and has taken Maniscalco to trial twice 
and Duffy to trial once in separate proceedings. Each trial lasted more than 
six months, with Maniscalco's first trial spanning a marathon 17 months and 
breaking state records as jurors deliberated for 26 days before declaring 
themselves deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has conspired against the prosecution. With each new hearing, each trial, 
witnesses' memories have blurred and testimony about critical details is 
forgotten on the witness stand. It's been up to King to comb through years-old 
documents to ferret out key points that can make all the difference to a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should know this all inside and out -- I've tried this case three times," 
said King, 46, head of the homicide unit of the Orange County district 
attorney's office. The case has become so emblazoned in his mind that he now 
recalls once-popular songs by their release at different phases of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 King's courtroom style is normally cool, methodical, reserved. But the 
Maniscalco case has sent his temper flaring over the years, especially when he 
has accused the defense team of manipulating the case. In the first trial, for 
example, the defense team filed 200 pretrial motions. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor has blasted defense delays and once called Harrold a liar 
before a judge, saying that if she were Pinocchio, her nose would stretch out 
the courtroom doors and down the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 King thought he had seen everything in the case, but was outraged all over 
again last year when the defense sought to persuade a separate jury that 
Maniscalco was mentally incompetent to stand trial. The prosecutor pointed out 
the defendant was preparing legal documents for fellow inmates during the same 
time he was supposedly suffering from mental impairment due to his long stay in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor won that fight, although he has been disappointed in other key 
battles. In 1992, he reluctantly dropped his effort to send Maniscalco to the 
gas chamber. And when jurors in Maniscalco's first trial deadlocked 10-2 for 
conviction, King was forced to start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case dragged on, King said, the memory of 19-year-old rape-murder 
victim Rena Miley has fueled his determination to bring Maniscalco to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she went through in the last half-hour, last 45 minutes of her life was 
just pure terror," he said. "She knew she was going to die, that she would be 
murdered." The Mother 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Maniscalco is admittedly bitter about the triple murder case. She said 
it cost her both her son and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after her son's 1984 arrest, her husband, John, discovered he had lung 
cancer. The retired policeman died a few months later, and Grace Maniscalco 
said she believes the stress of seeing his son behind bars hastened his death. 
</P>
<P>
 A 72-year-old retiree from Woodland Hills, Grace Maniscalco prays constantly 
to St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. She writes to her son each day -- 
sometimes twice a day -- and visits when a friend can manage the long drive. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she dreams of the day her son will be released. On Tuesday, she 
choked back tears as she learned of his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh God," she said, over and over. The Victims 
</P>
<P>
 Rena Miley was 19, the daughter of a Los Alamitos police officer. She was 
flirting with rebellion when she began dating Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36, a 
Hessian biker, in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the years of legal wrangling that characterize the case has 
overshadowed the brutal crime itself: Miley, Rizzone and his bodyguard, Thomas 
Monahan, 28, were repeatedly shot in Rizzone's Westminster ranch home, their 
bodies scattered across the house until Rizzone's brother found them several 
days later. Miley had also been raped. 
</P>
<P>
 During closing arguments in Maniscalco's second trial, the prosecutor pointed 
to a blurry photograph of Miley and lamented that the time that has lapsed 
during the case has relegated the victims to "historical figures." 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzone and Monahan were willing participants in a lifestyle that included 
danger, fast times and drugs, but prosecutors say they do not believe Miley was 
involved in illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time," said King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you one thing right now, you never forget something like this, you 
live with it every single day," said her father, Gary Miley, said in a recent 
interview. The Defendant 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco sees himself as a martyr to the "counterculture" cause. He insists 
the charges against him are part of a law enforcement conspiracy to nail a 
former Hessian and attorney whose practice consisted of defending bikers and 
those accused of drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's said to me that this is the kind of thing that got him interested in the 
law in the first place," said Harrold, who notes that at the time of the 
killings, Maniscalco was urging the state attorney general, the Orange County 
Grand Jury and others to investigate allegations into police misconduct in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In custody he has made a name for himself as an advocate for inmates' rights, 
filing lawsuits complaining about poor jail conditions, prisoner abuse and the 
lack of Mexican food served in the grub line. 
</P>
<P>
 He occupies a single cell and has access to law books, typewriters and other 
items, and provides legal assistance to fellow inmates. He has talked with hope 
about his future and wants to continue fighting the kind of abuse that led to 
his own incarceration, Harrold said. It's why Maniscalco keeps renewing his law 
license each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 10 years, Tom has been on an emotional roller coaster ride to hell," 
Harrold said. "When you think about it, they've taken all his 40s. He turned 40 
about the time of the arrest, and just turned 49 in jail. Are they going to 
take his 50s, too?"

PATIENT ANGELENOS DEAL WITH A NEW CALL WAITING; COMMUNICATIONS: CALLS FROM THE 
EAST COULDN'T GET THROUGH, WHILE SOME IN L.A. RESORTED TO WALKIE-TALKIES. AND 
GETTING LOTTERY TICKETS WAS NO SURE BET.

 What's that sound? 
</P>
<P>
 It's the phone not ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city with three area codes, a city where people can be spotted walking 
down neighborhood streets squiring a dog on a leash in one hand and carrying a 
cellular telephone in the other, the silence was almost operatic in scope. The 
morning for many Angelenos got short-circuited when fire knocked out service at 
a Downtown Pacific Bell switching facility for several hours Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Downtown office of Travel Service International, the clients from the 
East Coast who usually call early in the morning could not get through and the 
agents' computers that connect them to the airlines were not working anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't pull up anything, we couldn't do anything," said travel agent 
Julie Neilson, who arrived at 7:30 a.m. "We couldn't even get hold of the 
airlines on the phone because the 800 numbers were down." She busied herself 
with correspondence. "You get stressed out because you don't know how long it's 
going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 When KBIG listener lines went down, so did the 6:15 a.m. and 7:40 a.m. trivia 
questions, dashing chances to win a Little Caesar's pizza party pack or a $100 
T.J. Maxx gift certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 And depending on where you were, you could forget about cashing in that 
winning lottery ticket -- or buying one. 
</P>
<P>
 And although phones did not go down everywhere, some fantasized about what it 
would be like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they were down," sighed one harried phone answerer at the Screen 
Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were oblivious. 
</P>
<P>
 "What phones are down?" asked an emergency room nurse at Holy Cross Medical 
Center in the San Fernando Valley, where there was no phone fallout. Despite 
the fact that 911 service was temporarily disrupted, no one reported any deaths 
or injuries because of the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the brokerage firm of Smith Barney Shearson in Century City, one 
stockbroker said: "Somebody got sick in the office and we couldn't get through 
to 911." Paramedics eventually arrived and treated the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Others may have been jumping to conclusions. "On my way into work, I couldn't 
get a signal on my (cellular) phone," said one Downtown lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell him to check his battery," quipped one wise Angeleno. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses are simply prepared for phone problems. "As part of our 
preparation for disasters and earthquakes, our reporters have alternative ways 
of getting on the air," KNX radio news director Bob Sims said. "All reporters 
have two-way walkie-talkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims did note that a special high-quality circuit into their City Hall bureau 
went down. Instead, they got through on a regular telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Most simply waited. 
</P>
<P>
 In the City Hall office of Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the phones went dead 
for 45 minutes. It is not unusual for every one of the seven lines to be lit 
up. "I hate having dead phones," said Katharine Macdonald, press secretary to 
Yaroslavsky. "I love talking on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only were a significant number of lottery outlets affected because their 
computer data lines are hooked up to Sacramento via telephone, the Van Nuys 
office manager of the California Lottery was personally affected. When Deborah 
Smith first heard about the phone problems, she tried calling Sacramento from 
her house -- in the 818 area code -- to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 When she arrived at her office, her problems continued: "We couldn't get 
through to Sacramento, we couldn't get through on our WATS line." And she had 
no way of knowing how many of the 2,300 outlets she manages were suffering 
difficulties because none could call her either. 
</P>
<P>
 But forget about Angelenos being shocked by this lack of phone service. "The 
closest thing I could compare this to?" she mused. "The type of disconnection 
we had with the earthquake -- circuits were busy. You couldn't reach 
personnel." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Stock Exchange reported no problems. It works on a computer system 
that is separate from the phone system. Although trading proceeded at a normal 
pace Tuesday, some traders had intermittent problems placing phone calls to 
clients and offices in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 "But persistence won out," said Karen Sulker-Hall, secretary to the director 
of floor operations. "One person said it was the challenge of the day."

<P>
 The killing of three workers and wounding of two others at the Extron 
Electronics company in Santa Fe Springs was the latest in a series of 
workplace-related shootings in California in recent years. Following are 
similar shootings in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 2: A La Habra janitor, enraged over a late $150 paycheck, poured 
gasoline on a bookkeeper and set her afire, then calmly walked away as the 
woman became engulfed in flames that fatally burned her. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 20: A former employee casually took up a position across the street 
from MCA World Headquarters in Universal City and pumped bullets into the 
15-story "Black Tower" building. Terminated from the company in 1986 and unable 
to get a job, he wounded two employees, while five others were cut by flying 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 6: A former postal worker, after stabbing his mother to death, walked 
into the Dana Point post office and killed a former co-worker. Five others were 
wounded in a bloody two-day rampage. He had been fired for stalking a female 
co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 2: A mortgage broker, blaming a law firm for his financial trouble, 
rampaged through three floors of a San Francisco high-rise, killing eight 
people and wounding six others, then killing himself as police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 8: A one-time ranch hand who was said to have a hot temper and a 
personal grudge against some of his family members killed his sister-in-law and 
another employee in a shooting spree at a Fountain Valley embroidery store. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 3: Fueled by chronic unemployment, a former Northrop Corp. computer 
systems engineer went on a shooting spree at an Oxnard unemployment office, 
killing four people before being shot and killed by police. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

10-YEAR MURDER CASE ENDS WITH LAWYER'S CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY and DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years to the day after his arrest, a Westminster attorney was convicted 
Tuesday of second-degree murder for ordering the executions of three people, 
ending Orange County's longest murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second trial for Thomas F. Maniscalco, 49, who holds the record 
for the longest stay in the Orange County Men's Central Jail, where he has 
gained recognition as an inmate rights advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand the verdicts. It's very bizarre," Maniscalco whispered to 
his attorney as they were read. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated for 24 days -- two days short of matching 
Maniscalco's previous jury in 1990 -- before finding him guilty of three counts 
of second-degree murder. More than a week ago, jurors had indicated they were 
deadlocked, but the judge ordered them to resume deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary is scheduled to set a 
sentencing date today. Maniscalco faces a possible term of 16 years to life for 
each count. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution alleged that Maniscalco ordered the deaths of biker Richard 
(Rabbit) Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28, and Rizzone's 
girlfriend, Rena Miley, 19. They were shot repeatedly in Rizzone's Westminster 
home on Memorial Day, 1980. Miley, the daughter of a now-retired Los Alamitos 
police officer, also was raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Maniscalco, co-founder of the Hessians biker gang, ordered 
Rizzone killed because he suspected that Rizzone was skimming proceeds from the 
gang's alleged drug and counterfeiting business. Monahan and Miley were killed 
to eliminate witnesses, prosecutors contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said Maniscalco is innocent and was framed by an admitted 
gunman who stole drugs and money from the victims and then tried to finger 
Maniscalco in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

STATE SCHOOLS CHIEF RACE STARTS EARLY; ELECTIONS: PASADENA'S WILBERT SMITH, A 
SUPPORTER OF THE VOUCHER INITIATIVE, JOINS THE FRAY. TEACHERS UNION HOLDS 
INTERVIEWS TO DECIDE WHOM IT WILL ENDORSE. 
</P>

<P>
 The official list of candidates has not been finalized, but the contest to 
head California's 5.2-million-student public school system is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely viewed in its early stages as a battle between two leaders of the 
state's education Establishment, the race for the nonpartisan superintendent of 
public instruction has attracted several other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a black community college instructor and businessman whose support 
for the school voucher initiative helped cost him his seat on the Pasadena 
Board of Education returned to his South-Central Los Angeles elementary school 
to launch his campaign as the ultimate outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbert Smith, whose cousin died in a classroom shooting at Fairfax High 
School last year, said he is the only candidate to have personally experienced 
the effects of school violence. He promised to give parents and students a 
larger voice in which campuses they attend and how they are run. His advocacy 
of the voucher initiative, which would have provided tax money for parents to 
spend on public or private schools, sets him apart from most other educators, 
who fought the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's announcement came as the California Teachers Assn. prepared to settle 
on its candidate. This week, the board of the state's largest teachers union 
recommended that the endorsement be given to Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin, a 
Fremont Democrat who heads the Assembly Education Committee. The organization, 
one of the biggest political fund-raisers in the state, will make its 
endorsement decision at its state council meeting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among several other candidates interviewed by the teachers union was Maureen 
DiMarco, another Democrat, who is Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for 
child development and education. DiMarco, a former Garden Grove school board 
member, and Eastin are considered the front-runners. 
</P>
<P>
 If no candidate wins a majority of the votes in June, the top two vote-getters 
will compete in a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of DiMarco's and Eastin's competitors are hoping that voters will view 
the two women as essentially similar cogs in the state's public education 
system, a system they say needs to be overhauled by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing period closed Friday, but because the secretary of state's office 
must compile a roster from the counties, it does not expect to have a complete 
list of candidates until the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several campaigns have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Carrabino, a fiscally conservative, outspoken former president of the 
State Board of Education, who often clashed with former schools chief Bill 
Honig, opened a campaign office in Brentwood this week and hired 
Sacramento-based consultant Sal Russo to oversee his race. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrabino, who plans to announce his candidacy in a few days, said his 
experience as a business consultant and former teacher at UCLA's management 
school makes him qualified to improve efficiency and cut waste. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he favors school choice systems that include private school vouchers 
but opposed the voucher initiative on last fall's ballot because it "was done 
too hastily and had logistical problems." Carrabino also wants decision-making 
authority regarding textbooks and curricula returned to local school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first to begin campaigning was Gloria Matta Tuchman, an Orange 
County teacher and school board president who has long led efforts to overturn 
the state's system of bilingual education for the growing numbers of students 
who speak little or no English. Tuchman began her quest for the office in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most iconoclastic of all is Smith, a Republican who spent four years 
on the Pasadena school board before being defeated last spring by an opponent 
who made an issue of his lead role in the pro-voucher campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside Lenecia B. Weemes School, surrounded by his wife and 
children, who attend Pasadena public schools, Smith offered himself as an 
up-by-the-bootstraps candidate who can relate to the thousands of poor, 
minority students who struggle in California classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest of 10 children, abandoned by his father while a teen-ager, Smith 
graduated from Los Angeles' Fremont High School and worked his way through Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. He holds a master's degree in special education, has 
taught business courses at Pasadena City College and was appointed by then-Gov. 
George Deukmejian to the board that oversees the state's 107-campus system of 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am running because the politicians and the bureaucrats have not 
demonstrated the leadership or the courage to improve our schools," Smith said.

CANCER STUDY CALLED VALID DESPITE FRAUD; MEDICINE: FINDINGS ON THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF LUMPECTOMIES RATHER THAN MASTECTOMIES ARE UPHELD EVEN THOUGH 
ONE RESEARCHER FALSIFIED DATA, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials and cancer experts worked quickly to reassure American women 
that despite reports of fraud by one researcher in a major breast cancer study, 
the findings -- that lumpectomy is often just as effective as complete 
mastectomy in early cancer cases -- are still valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials also expressed astonishment that the fraud, revealed nine 
months ago, has now triggered a public controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case is a year old and closed out for some time," said Lyle Bivens, head 
of the Office of Research Integrity at the Department of Health and Human 
Services, which released its report on the incident in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 An article on the report in Sunday's editions of the Chicago Tribune cast 
doubt on the credibility of the study findings, published in the New England 
Journal of Medicine in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the National Cancer Institute said Monday that when the 
researcher's data is removed from the overall study the conclusions are the 
same: Lumpectomy is as effective as more disfiguring radical mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breast conservation can be used with confidence," said Joann Schellenbach, a 
spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society. The landmark National Surgical 
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, headed by Pittsburgh surgeon Bernard Fisher, 
involved 5,000 patients at nearly 500 medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 One researcher, Roger Poisson of St. Luc's Hospital in Montreal, has admitted 
to falsifying records concerning more than 100 patients to make them eligible 
for inclusion in the study. Poisson has been barred from receiving any U.S. 
research grants for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Poisson's work accounted for about 16% of the patients in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put him out of business real quick," said Don McLaren, deputy associate 
commissioner for public affairs for the Food and Drug Administration, which 
regulates the experimental drug tamoxifen, which was used in some of Poisson's 
studies. In an agreement signed May 15, 1991, Poisson admitted that he had 
violated FDA regulations governing the use of investigational drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bivens said that when his report was released, his staff recommended that the 
researchers notify scientific journals of the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud investigators expected to see a quick correction from the Pittsburgh 
researchers. To date, none has been published or received by medical journals. 
"(We) were surprised to find that nothing had happened in a year," said Dorothy 
McFarland, who headed the Poisson investigation for the Office of Research 
Integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh researchers said that preparing a new paper based on a thorough 
reanalysis of their data has taken a great deal of time but that they are about 
to approach journals.

ROUTINE HIV PREGNANCY TESTS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More widespread HIV testing among the general public, but especially for 
pregnant women, was strongly advocated Tuesday by AIDS experts during the 
second day of an Orange County conference on the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "All HIV-infected people must be identified" so that they can be taught how to 
prevent the spread of the disease and be provided with medical and social 
services, said Dr. Don Francis, a longtime researcher of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alexandra Levine, professor of medicine at USC who is the principal 
investigator in a nationwide study of women with HIV infection, said she favors 
"testing of all pregnant women because the transmission rate of HIV (from 
mothers) to infants is 30% and can be significantly decreased" if the mothers 
take the antiviral drug AZT. 
</P>
<P>
 Both physicians gave their views on testing during longer presentations to a 
conference forum and in interviews later. However, neither they nor others at 
the annual AIDS conference held at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa called for 
mandatory testing, citing the fear and stigma that attaches to those who test 
positive for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Melvyn Sterling, president of the Orange County Medical Assn., endorsed 
the expansion of testing, saying society "should err on the side of testing 
more and not testing less." 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview at the conference, he too noted the problem of 
stigmatization. "There is tremendous fear out there," said Sterling, adding 
that the fear is reinforced by instances where people with HIV have lost jobs 
and medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there were no downside, we would test everyone," said Sterling, who 
instead advocates testing for those at high risk for the disease, including 
intravenous drug users, gay men with multiple partners and women who have sex 
with bisexual men. 
</P>
<P>
 In making her argument for routine testing of pregnant women, Levine pointed 
to a federally sponsored study that found that giving AZT to HIV-infected 
pregnant women can dramatically reduce the transmission of the disease to the 
fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand children have contracted AIDS since the epidemic began in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said she would go a step further, recommending women be tested when 
they are planning a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women do all kinds of things to be as healthy as possible when they are 
thinking of becoming pregnant, such as stopping smoking, cutting down on 
drinking alcohol and cutting down on medicines . . . and an HIV test would be 
part of that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine favors routine testing of pregnant women because the virus has spread 
beyond the high-risk groups. Research has found that if only pregnant women 
considered at high risk for AIDS are tested, half of the women with the virus 
will be missed, she said.

CIA TO REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES TO FILE FINANCIAL REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CIA Director R. James Woolsey, his agency and leadership under fire in the 
Aldrich H. Ames spy case, said Tuesday he plans to compel all agency employees 
to file detailed reports of their finances as one of several steps designed to 
catch agency "moles" at an earlier date. 
</P>
<P>
 At an unusual public briefing for several reporters in his office, Woolsey 
pledged "to get to the bottom of what happened" that caused Ames to go 
undetected for eight years while he sold national security secrets to the 
Russians for an estimated $2.5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said he will seek congressional legislation or voluntary waivers so 
that banking information can be used to investigate employees without the bank 
being required to notify them. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey also said he intends to freeze promotions for a small group of 
executives who may be at fault in the Ames case. His remarks follow closed-door 
congressional testimony last week that left some leading lawmakers angry and 
questioning his commitment to solving security problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said 
this week that Woolsey, who has been director for only 13 months, "is in danger 
of falling into the trap" of being perceived as an apologist for past CIA 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woolsey declared Tuesday: "We will do whatever needs to be done to get 
this system fixed, both in the long haul and the short term. There's nothing 
more important than that we learn the right lessons from the Ames case and make 
changes we need to get made." 
</P>
<P>
 Among criticisms leveled at the CIA were its alleged failure to follow up on 
sudden signs of wealth by Ames and his wife, Rosario, including purchase of a 
new home, a luxury automobile and more than $400,000 in credit card purchases. 
The lapses occurred despite currency reports his suburban Virginia bank filed 
with the Internal Revenue Service showing a series of cash deposits totaling 
tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA officials initially refused comment on the matter, but Woolsey said 
Tuesday that his agency sometimes has declined to act on such information 
because banks, by law, then are required to alert their customers of such 
official interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to conduct investigations without alerting the suspect," Woolsey 
said. But he conceded that generally "there has been a lack of attention to 
financial data." He said he hoped that could be corrected with the waiver 
requirement and new legislation "permitting the government to make inquiries 
whenever it wants to." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Woolsey said he believes such actions must be designed "to 
guarantee the privacy of government employees, so it will take some balancing 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that "obviously a spy may well lie" on his financial disclosure 
forms, he said interrogations must be tied into an improved use of lie 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to the planned freeze on promotions, Woolsey said the move would 
affect "a selected group of individuals" until the CIA inspector general, 
Frederick Hitz, finishes an inquiry aimed at assigning blame for the Ames 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is determined "that someone has performed poorly," that employee will be 
permanently frozen or dismissed, he explained. But if they are cleared of 
misconduct, promotions will be retroactive, Woolsey said. He refused to 
identify the targets, but lawmakers have questioned the recent promotions of 
Hugh E. (Ted) Price and Thomas Twetton, former senior officials in the CIA 
operations directorate who directly supervised Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said more long-term tasks will involve assessing the extent of damage 
caused by Ames, who rose to the rank of chief of Soviet counterintelligence in 
the CIA's Soviet-East European division. Officials have disclosed that he and 
his wife were arrested Feb. 21 on the eve of a government trip planned by Ames 
to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI had them under surveillance for nine months before that. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said a longer term study of CIA security will be studied by a special 
commission that will have independent advice from Brent Scowcroft, national 
security adviser to former President George Bush, and former Defense Secretary 
Harold Brown in the Jimmy Carter Administration.

FIXATIONS: BOTTLED TREASURE; COLLECTOR STRIKES IT RICH IN DUMPS, OUTHOUSES OF 
GHOST TOWNS. HIS BOOK GIVES PRICES FOR SUCH GEMS AS MOXIE NERVE FOOD 
CONTAINERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Michael Polak hits the bottle, it's usually with a metal rod. Polak has a 
collection of some 2,000 old bottles, and he got a great many of them by 
digging around ghost towns. He uses a rod shaped like a sprinkler key to poke 
around beneath the ground, and when he hears a suitable clunk, he starts 
digging. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm on a dig I always wonder if I'll find a body out there or 
something," Polak said of his excavation excursions. "I've dug up boots, spurs, 
old coffeepots, canteens, frying pans, spittoons, a 1900 Liberty Head nickel, 
interesting stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting, but secondary to his main interest. Twenty years ago a work-mate 
returned from a desert trip with similar souvenirs, as well as a couple of old 
whiskey and medicine bottles that caught Polak's eye. He trundled his family 
(he has since divorced, and his children are grown) off to the deserts of 
Nevada, where they unearthed some glassy gems of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was it. I've been hooked ever since," said the Cerritos resident. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite places to go looking are still in the rustic, scenic ghost towns 
of Nevada, where he finds the pickings extremely good at the sites of old dumps 
and outhouses. (You can bet we're going to ask him more about the latter.) He 
also maintains that old bottles can often be dug up closer to home, that 
redevelopment in towns such as Santa Ana, Anaheim and Whittier makes them 
fertile fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Polak added, "There have been some great bottle digs after earthquakes. In 
fact, some of the bottle clubs in L.A. have already gone to the construction 
companies (doing the rebuilding) and asked for permission." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottle clubs? Like seemingly every other item and idea in this country's 
history, a subculture has risen around bottle collecting, to the degree that 
there are more than 700 bottle-collecting clubs in the United States, 107 of 
them in California alone. The source of this information is Polak's 
just-published "Bottles, Identification and Price Guide" from Avon Books. 
</P>
<P>
 He does a lot of writing in his job doing finances and contracts with an 
aerospace firm. It's not the most satisfying of writing, though, and he 
enrolled in a writers workshop at Orange Coast College a few years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Write what you know about,' so I sent an article on bottle 
collecting to an antiques magazine," he said. "They ran it, and then I got a 
call on my message machine from an editor at Avon Books, asking if I'd be 
interested in writing a book." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a bad track record: Take a writing class in '92 and get a book 
published in '94. Polak is even doing book signings. There will be three in 
Orange County: Sunday at Waldenbooks in the Mall of Orange; March 26 at 
Brentano's South Coast Plaza and March 27 at Waldenbooks at MainPlace/Santa 
Ana. All of the signings will be from 1 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wonder how bottles were made in the First Century B.C.? Want to know where to 
dig for bottles? Wonder what that unearthed lime-green Moxie Nerve Food bottle 
from 1888 is worth, or that 1897 bottle of Dr. Liebig's German Invigorator? 
It's all in Polak's 493-page book. (Those bottles, should you happen across 
them, go for $125 to $175 and $50 to $100, respectively.) 
</P>
<P>
 He's learned a lot of things about bottles in his 20 years of collecting. For 
example, "You see the cowboy movies where they smash guys in the head with a 
bottle that breaks? You'd break a million heads before you'd break (a real) 
bottle," he said, handing over an old Busch beer bottle that hefted like cast 
iron. "I've dropped these bottles off a table onto a concrete floor and they 
don't break." 
</P>
<P>
 Western settlers didn't necessarily need to have the bottles broken over their 
heads to get the same effect. Polak brought out some medicine bottles he'd dug 
up in Nevada, stoppered and still containing some of their original 
ingredients. These, according to the labels, were concoctions such as "Sweet 
Spirit of Nitrate," bottled by the aptly named Cannon Drug and Jewelry Co., 
which operated out of a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at the alcohol content!" Polak exclaimed, noting that on most 
bottles it hovered around 92%. "You can imagine these old miners saying, 'I'm 
just taking my medicine.' If that was my medicine, I'd be taking it too." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't especially tempted to sample any of these old nostrums now. "I leave 
the corks in them. To open them would ruin the value and uniqueness of the 
bottle. And you have to worry about something that old with labels that say 
'40% alcohol, 40% codeine, 10% something else.' I've heard of people who do 
take the corks off, just smell the stuff and get sick." 
</P>
<P>
 There are others, though, who drink vintage Cokes in bottles such as the full 
late '40s ones Polak has, and say they are not only safe, but also better than 
the current stuff. Polak shook one of his bottles to show that it still fizzes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 25 of these and sold some of them off. One guy said, 'I'm going to open 
this and try it.' I said, 'Do me a favor. Don't open it around me.' To me that 
ruins it. You take the top off and drink it, and you just have a bottle. . . . 
I've been tempted, though," he said, gazing into the caramel liquid in the 
fluted bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He gets some of his glassware at bottle collector shows and sometimes finds 
them at local thrift shops and swap meets. One of his oldest pieces, an English 
ale bottle from around 1780 worth $500, was found at a La Mirada swap meet for 
25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest thrill still comes from digging bottles up in the desert, 
something he's scarcely had time to do in the two years it has taken to see his 
book into print. Sometimes he's dug as deep as six feet. He has found a 
surprising number of buried bottles, given that in most deserts the 
dirt-to-bottle ratio is formidable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that easy. You really have to do a bit of homework. You have to get 
the maps, find where there were old homes or buildings. Then you have to 
figure, well, here's where the house sat, they probably threw their trash maybe 
15 yards away, so you start pacing it off. Outhouses would be more like 25 or 
30 yards away. If you see a clump of bushes or grass growing, chances are 
that's where the outhouse was, because it was so fertilized over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Though travel magazines aren't likely to be running features titled "Outhouses 
of the Old West" anytime soon, Polak said digging for privies is increasingly 
popular among treasure hunters, and that there is actually a how-to book out on 
the subject. Unappealing as it sounds, Polak says such areas are considered 
safe after 20 or 30 years of disuse, and the ghost town ones he shovels in are 
typically 80 to 100 years old and basically just dirt. Dirt that's extra-rich 
in bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outhouses are a great digging spot because people would treat them as a trash 
reservoir as well. Also, because of people sitting down, coins would fall out," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of his favorite digging spots is the site of an old dump outside of 
Goldfield, between Las Vegas and Reno. He doesn't mind sharing such 
information, and says that generally bottle collectors are a friendly bunch who 
often steer others toward good digs. That's exceptionally neighborly, 
considering how hooked some collectors get on their bottles, not to mention 
their rarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these bottles are very beautiful," Polak said. "They've got purples 
and blues, greens, ambers. Some are very decorative, very neat. There's some 
very rare whiskey flasks from the 1700s with the likeness of Jefferson or 
Washington etched in them. It's like a piece of fine china or a painting. Then 
you unearth things with labels that say things like 'You can use for human 
consumption or treating your horses.' That's kinda fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Some ordinary bottles wind up looking special, after the sun bakes minerals 
from the surrounding earth into them for decades, lending some glass an 
iridescent sheen like fish skin.  
</P>
<P>
 The value of antique bottles varies greatly. An 1880s beer bottle may be so 
common as to only be worth $2, while 1700s bottles from the Pitkin or Henry 
Stiegel glassworks can command $50,000. Except for the rarest bottles, being 
cracked or broken all but destroys the collector value. 
</P>
<P>
 Polak still gets a thrill out of finding a rich lode of glass, but doesn't see 
bottles so much as an end in themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger interest for me now is how you meet some of the neatest people. 
I've sold at bottle shows, and it's not so much making money from the bottles, 
but the people I've met. Interesting, interesting people. When I first met my 
girlfriend, now my fiancee, when I first told her about the bottles, she said, 
'You're doing what ?' But when she went with me to a bottle show in Las Vegas 
two weeks ago she couldn't believe how many different, interesting people there 
were there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Polak also enjoys the detective work some bottles present.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I find a strange bottle, I'll spend countless hours searching it out. If 
there's a location on it, I'll call the chamber of commerce of that town. 
They'll lead me to something else, which leads me to something else. It might 
turn out that there was some guy in Tonopah who decided he was going to make 
soda pop. He might make a thousand bottles, and not make any money and go 
under, and that's the last you'd hear of it. I love history, and this is a neat 
way to go into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bottles stump him -- for a while at least. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one that just said 'Jake's Whiskey House' etched on it, and on the 
bottom it said 'Nevada,' and that was it. It took me about six months before I 
found it came from a guy in the 1880s in northern Nevada with a mom-and-pop 
kind of still operation for about a year." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as he loves finding such mysteries in old dumps, he opines that to 
collectors in the future today's trash will always just be trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our stuff is so mass-produced," he complained. "It's not unique. There's 
nothing special to it. It's just kind of like there . What I do imagine is 
people 75 or 100 years from now looking at it and going, 'Jeez, what kind of 
life did these people lead?' "

THE DEFIANT ONE HAS THE LAST LAUGH; MOVIES: BETTER KNOWN FOR HIS ROLES AS 
ANGRY, PASSIONATE HEROES, KIRK DOUGLAS IS TRYING SOMETHING NEW AT THE AGE OF 77 
-- COMEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Kirk Douglas' voice crackles like an iconoclastic beacon. "I don't think that 
people are ever completely who you think they are," says the 77-year-old actor 
ruefully. "Hedda Hopper once said to me: 'You know, Kirk, people say that ever 
since you did "Spartacus," you've become a sonovabitch.' I said: 'No, Hedda. 
You're wrong. I was a sonovabitch before "Spartacus" but you didn't notice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas knows all too well that after five decades of Hollywood stardom, he is 
assumed to be a combustible, bullish, tough-edged juggernaut whose indomitable 
will has fueled one of the most enduring careers in cinematic history. In more 
than 80 films, he has excelled at playing defiant, angry, passionate heroes, as 
his three Academy Award-nominated performances in "Champion," (1949), "The Bad 
and the Beautiful" (1952) and "Lust for Life" (1956) certainly attest. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas' often stormy personal life also reinforced an image as a stubborn and 
uncompromising maverick, Yet, in a recent interview from his Beverly Hills 
home, Douglas was a surprisingly effusive pussycat.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the lighter touch is in keeping with his new starring role in the 
comedy "Greedy," which opened earlier this month. Douglas portrays a 
manipulating millionaire whose relatives are chomping at the bit for him to die 
so they can divide the financial spoils. The role represents a striking 
departure for the actor who remains more known for his intensity than his 
ability to deliver a pithy one-liner. After "Greedy," that might change. He is 
unforgettable in an otherwise utterly forgettable comedy as he chews up the 
scenery, stealing virtually every scene he is in from comedy veterans Michael 
J. Fox, Ed Begley Jr., Phil Hartman and Coleen Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always played all these bigger-than-life characters," he observes. 
"Destroying Romans and Vikings and then the boxing and all of that. I loved the 
idea of playing comedy. To play comedy, you play the character -- you don't try 
to be funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Landing the role in "Greedy" over Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau and Anthony 
Quinn was apparently the result of a palpable connection between dimpled actor 
and character. "This is a guy who wants to know who really loves him," he says. 
"And that's the thing that people who are famous, people who have a lot of 
money, are always concerned about. Is there anyone who really loves them for 
themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 The actor's last appearance on the big screen (besides a brief cameo three 
years ago in "Oscar") was 1986's "Tough Guys," which teamed him for the seventh 
time with close friend Burt Lancaster, who is now ailing following a stroke. 
Some of Douglas' best work in recent years has been in made-for-TV movies 
including compelling performances in "Amos," "The Secret" and "Inherit the 
Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to work on a major motion picture was somewhat daunting for the 
actor. "The first day, I walked on the set, and everyone said: 'Oh, Mr. 
Douglas.' I said: 'Call me Kirk. You make me feel so old!' Later in the day, 
someone said to me: 'Well, you're a legend,' and I said: 'You sound like I'm 
dead!' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if a fountain of youth exists, it would appear Douglas slurps from it 
daily. He works out with a personal trainer and takes long walks near his 
Beverly Hills and Palm Springs homes where he is often accompanied by his wife, 
Anne. "Old age gives you wrinkles but the worst wrinkles are the wrinkles 
inside of you, the wrinkles on your soul," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had an accident about three years ago," he says quietly as if unaware of 
the worldwide headlines following the 1991 helicopter crash that killed two 
people and hospitalized him and left him with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. 
"Why am I alive when two young people were killed? I realized that I needed to 
get my house in order." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, Douglas has started a successful second career as an 
author. His candid 1988 autobiography, "The Ragman's Son," became a worldwide 
bestseller. He followed it with two novels, "Dance With the Devil" and "The 
Gift." His third novel, "The Last Tango in Brooklyn," is due from Warner Books 
in June. "I have become increasingly absorbed in writing novels," he says. "To 
be old is to shrivel up and do nothing. But to be young is to keep creating, to 
keep blooming, to do something." Next, he will write a nonfiction account of 
the helicopter tragedy and its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas wants to make a movie with his son Michael, one of his four sons. But 
the script would have to meet the creative needs of these two box-office stars 
of succeeding generations. "Hell, do you want to play second fiddle to a 
fantastic special effect?" 
</P>
<P>
 While "Greedy" is unlikely to go down in cinematic history as one of Douglas' 
most definitive films, it does give audiences a rare lesson in how one movie 
star can turn his legend into more than yet another tribute on the rubber 
chicken circuit. In fact, Douglas couldn't care less about being a legend.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that word," he growls. Perhaps he has good reason to reject it, with a 
bristling energy that many actors half his age would envy. "I think it's that 
spark that doing what you like gives you. I think it's the feeling that I have 
-- elan vital. " 
</P>
<P>
 Elan vital? "That," he says, "is the driving spirit within you."

MTV PRESSES THE FLESH; TELEVISION: 'SPRING BREAK' MOVES FROM DAYTONA TO SAN 
DIEGO -- AND TURNS 'BEAUTY AND THE BEACH' INTO A 'FAMILY' AFFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Where are all the single horny men?" the warm-up man, Mark Wolberg, yelled to 
some 3,000 of San Diego's young, restless and media-hungry gathered around the 
post-modern stage in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the moment of truth for MTV's 1994 "Spring Break" programming, taped 
for the first time on Mariner's Point in Mission Beach for seven days, ending 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time for "Beauty and the Beach: The Swimsuit Competition," the most 
controversial of MTV's special "Spring Break" shows and the final straw that 
landed the music cable channel on San Diego shores in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 During the eight years that MTV taped "Spring Break" in Daytona Beach, Fla., a 
longtime magnet for youth on the loose, the beauty pageant spoof had featured 
young women in sliver-sized bikinis bumping, grinding and gyrating on the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes and the repeated airing of MTV "Spring Break" programming 
throughout the year raised fears among Daytona officials that the city was 
gaining a reputation as a yearlong hotbed for hyperactive hormones, prompting 
families to spend tourist dollars elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Daytona and MTV couldn't reach an accord, so "Spring Break" exited and arrived 
in Mission Beach amid an atmosphere of excitement, novelty, skepticism, cloudy 
and sunny skies and question marks. Lots of question marks.  
</P>
<P>
 Would the San Diego site, which is not traditionally a major destination for 
the spring break masses, produce the same beach blanket bonkers that drew top 
ratings in the past? In Daytona, MTV covered spring break. In San Diego, it 
created it. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the event, held in a 2 1/2-acre bayside compound next to a 10-acre site 
reserved for food vendors and product promotions, bring gangs, drugs and fights 
into the area, which draws a substantial party-down contingent under normal 
circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
 How would the city, staid by nature but eager to shed its "sleepy little Navy 
town" image once and for all, end up being portrayed when MTV's "Spring Break" 
-- an amalgam of its regular shows, live concerts and special beach-based 
segments -- begins airing internationally, starting Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to the latter question -- pivotal to MTV and San Diego's future 
relationship -- became apparent when the "Beauty and the Beach" swimsuit 
contestants hit the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The young women pranced in bright, relatively modest bikinis, leaned down to 
slap hands, wiggled and left. The men, uniformly wearing checkered shorts, did 
basically the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "MTV provided us with the bathing suits. No thong bikinis were allowed," said 
Jaime Torres, a 22-year-old Colorado resident whose husband is a Marine 
stationed in San Diego. "We couldn't do certain dance moves. No grinding, no 
rump shaking. They kept saying they didn't want controversy. That this was 
family entertainment. They stressed family, family, over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Family entertainment? MTV? The media progenitors of "Beavis and Butt-head"? 
The station that prides itself as the one consistent television refuge from 
Mom, Dad and middle-class rules?  
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't keep ourselves in check, our advertisers and cable affiliates 
will," said executive producer Joel Stillerman.  
</P>
<P>
 Cloudy days and cool temperatures during the first few days of taping aided 
the cause -- perhaps too much so, keeping the mostly teen-age crowds sparse 
(about 10,000 a day throughout the area) and clothed. MTV crews had to prowl 
the grounds for nubiles willing to brave the elements in scanty clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 Compared to previous versions, this year's "Spring Break" may well seem less 
like "Animal House" in the sand and more how parents wish their teen-agers 
would spend their time -- alcohol-free, smiling, bouncing a beach ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene changed, however, when sunny weather and the weekend combined to 
bring 35,000 twentysomething partiers a day to the area. With them came 
problems: traffic jams, drinking (although MTV and the adjacent festival area 
were alcohol-free), gangs and, for some local businesses hoping for a financial 
boost, a decrease in receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rent kayaking and windsurfing equipment," said Kathy Puckett, owner of 
Windsport, located across the street from Mariner's Point. "But this wasn't a 
beach crowd. And with the traffic, our regular customers couldn't get to us. 
Bicycle rentals have been good, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrests were nonexistent until Saturday, said Beach Enforcement Officer Steve 
Molner of the San Diego Police Department. "Then, there were fights, a strong 
gang presence, drinking. There were no major incidents, because we worked our 
buns off. Saturday night was a zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Molner still thought "Spring Break" was good for San Diego. "Next time, we'll 
have more police officers. This was a learning year for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction among local residents was mixed, however -- some hoping MTV never 
returns, others asking for better planning and a possible change of site to 
nearby Fiesta Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime there's a large congregation of people, there's going to be 
congestion. We'll be checking with local organizations for reactions," said 
Carolyn Wormser, the city's special events administrator. "But most of the 
feedback I've received has been very positive, about both the taping and the 
event. I hope MTV will return." 
</P>
<P>
 Will it? "It's been a more pleasant experience than Daytona on every level," 
Stillerman said, although no agreement has been signed yet for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one more thing. The women participating in "Beauty and the Beach" in 
Daytona. Were they "professionals"? "Some were," Stillerman sighed. "You 
audition hundreds of people. You don't always think of things in advance. This 
year, we made a conscious effort to reject strippers." 
</P>
<P>
 * MTV's "Spring Break" programming begins Friday at 4 p.m. with an installment 
of "The Grind," followed by "Lip Service" at 4:30 p.m., "Beach Jam" at 5 p.m. 
and "Beauty and the Beach" at 6 p.m. It continues through March 27.

'SNOW' TO FALL FIRST IN LAGUNA; THEATER: FIVE-PLAY SEASON WILL BEGIN WITH 
STEPHEN METCALFE'S DRAMA. PLAYHOUSE ALSO ANNOUNCES SELECTION OF FIRM TO REMODEL 
BUILDING FOR USE AS SECOND STAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Laguna Playhouse will launch its 1994-95 subscription season in September 
with Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow," a drama about the reunion of two 
Vietnam War veterans, theater officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the five-play season at the Moulton Theatre will be a Christmas 
spoof ("Inspecting Carol"), a comedy about a pair of radio broadcasters 
("Breakfast With Les and Bess"), an 18th-Century Italian classic ("The Liar") 
and a musical about men and women on the job ("Working"). 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the 73-year-old community playhouse also announced the selection 
of a Newport Beach-based theater designer and architectural firm -- John von 
Szeliski and Associates -- to remodel a recently purchased bank building in 
South Laguna for use as a 250-seat Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse, which currently operates on a $1.2-million annual budget at the 
418-seat Moulton, is the county's largest theater company after South Coast 
Repertory. It has long sought to establish a smaller venue for professional 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that renovations will begin in June," executive director Richard 
Stein said. "It would be wonderful to open the second theater for the 
playhouse's 74th birthday on Oct. 22. But I don't think that will happen."' 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stein said the Second Stage opening is more likely to come "closer to the end 
of this year" or at the beginning of 1995. Its season is expected to comprise 
four plays and a musical and would add about $400,000 to the company's current 
operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse agreed in December to purchase the building, a former Bank of 
America branch at 32356 Coast Highway, and took title to the property on Feb. 
25. Stein would not divulge the purchase price but said the playhouse paid less 
than the initial asking price of $2.6 million. County records list the sale 
price at $880,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations are expected to cost at least $500,000 and will be financed from a 
fund of roughly $870,000 already raised by the playhouse. The playhouse also 
plans to raise at least $2 million more in a reinvigorated capital campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fund-raising goal could go higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're anticipating doing a new funding study," Stein noted. "It will help 
identify potential gifts from large donors who have already given to the 
playhouse and gifts from outside donors" as well as "any (fund-raising) needs 
that might go beyond our previous plans." 
</P>
<P>
 The Szeliski firm, one of two regional architects considered for the Second 
Stage renovation, worked on the Orange County Performing Arts Center and the 
recent renovation of Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton. THE LAGUNA PLAYHOUSE

COMMENTARY; ADDICTED TO THE 'PLACE'; THE SHAMEFUL LITTLE SECRET IS OUT: FANS OF 
'MELROSE' ARE REALLY COMING OUT OF HIDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest laugh in "Reality Bites," at least in some screenings, comes with 
a bit of (sorry, kids) Generation X gaggery so specific to the moment it's 
bound to leave future viewers bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
 Janeane Garofalo frets that she may be HIV-positive and that her funeral will 
be like a bad scene out of "Melrose Place," with everyone showing up to mourn 
in halters and chokers. This prompts best pal Winona Ryder to brighten her 
spirits with the assurance that she's not dying and, perhaps just as 
importantly, anyway, "Melrose Place" is "a really good show." 
</P>
<P>
 And the crowd goes wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The guffaw of recognition this throwaway gag gets means the shameful little 
secret is really out: The primordial soap has spoken and claimed its hold on a 
new crop of couch post-modernists who ought to know better and don't care. 
Uncloseted masses of twenty- and thirty-somethings and even a few elder boomers 
are coming out to declare, in rare unanimity with Dan Cortese, "I love this 
'Place'!" In the year and a half since its unpromising premiere, "Melrose" has 
gradually become the guilty pleasure du jour of a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is, tacitly, to say, we've all turned into our mothers, and what of it, 
buddy? 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of addiction are pretty much universal. Viewers start with a casual 
Wednesday night fix, just for, you know, recreational camp value. Soon they're 
hooked, protesting rather too much that they're still watching with all their 
ironic faculties intact and swearing they could quit the series any time they 
wanted. You nod, and know better -- realizing that they, like you, now view 
reality itself with a transparent "Fox" logo laid over life's lower-right-hand 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 And how weird, yet weirdly appropriate, that the series' sanitized and 
sensationalized version of young life in L.A. should enjoy a particularly 
devoted cult in the city where it's ostensibly but unrecognizably set. 
</P>
<P>
 Those crazy kids on "Melrose" have their problems, to be sure, but they live 
in a cozy apartment building where everyone knows their neighbors, convene 
regularly at the hip and friendly local tavern, and have sex lives of such 
rapid-fire serial monogamy in the AIDS era that Warren Beatty would turn 
pea-green with envy. Plus, of course, they regularly replace those cool halters 
and chokers on a yeoman's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 So this is the life we're leading. Thank God someone had the guts to show it 
back to us. (And please don't tip off all our cousins back in the Midwest that 
we experience this oversexed, under-crime-ridden land of plenty just as 
vicariously as they do.) 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon had its beginnings, of course, in "Beverly Hills, 90210," from 
which Aaron Spelling and Darren Star spun "Melrose Place" off. There was that 
time not long ago when perfectly literate pockets of grown-ups we knew would 
tune into "90210" each week just for the campy spectacle of seeing high school 
students played by gorgeous actors in their 20s and even 30s who'd clearly 
skipped a grade or eight. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the "90210" youth went off to university last year, the all-important 
camp quotient lessened considerably. And since the Fox network folks still feel 
some little (very little?) responsibility toward the show's primarily teen-aged 
viewership, the series tends to prudently focus as much on "issues" as on 
sleaze. 
</P>
<P>
 But over at the "Place," no such conscientious inhibitions are in place, and 
you can be sure no one's trying to figure out how to keep one of the characters 
a virgin. On a typical recent Wednesday, "90210's" Brenda and Donna wrestled 
with animal rights and whether to return a liberated pooch to the campus lab. 
Next hour, "Melrose's" sisters Jane and Sydney wrestled each other in the 
complex's pool, with psychotic Syd dressed in the wedding gown she'd just 
stolen from saintly Jane for her impending marriage-by-blackmail to the 
latter's wicked ex-husband. Yow! 
</P>
<P>
 "Melrose" wasn't always such a salacious place. Initially, the show arrived 
pre-embalmed as a yawningly sober TV encounter session about young-adult 
concerns like unemployment and sexual harassment in the workplace. Eventually, 
the producers wised up and made the show almost exclusively about the 
characters sexually harassing one another. This is nothing new under the TV-web 
sun, to be sure, but serves its purpose as a sort of shameless 
nostalgia-mongering for the Just Say Yes era. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the original cast was established as virtue personified, the 
sensationalizing and soaping-up of "Melrose" was accomplished twofold -- by 
turning Jane's (Josie Bissett's) faithful husband Michael (Thomas Calabro) into 
a lying, alcoholic, womanizing louse, and by adding two new vixen, Sydney and 
Amanda, to the incestuous brew. No wonder these three are the show's 
late-inning hits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Sydney, a guest character who became a leading lady, Laura Leighton has one 
of the best mouths in show business; playfully pursing her lips while trying to 
blackmail a guy into loving her -- that little minx! -- or widening them into a 
sexy, maniacal grin when she gets her way, you can see Sydney's clinically 
insane gears operating at all times. She's either the most misogynist-baiting 
black widow creation since Tokyo Rose or else a poor girl who just needs a 
Prozac prescription and a chance to really study the collected works of Melodie 
Beattie. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather "Be Thy Name" Locklear's stint as Amanda was also supposed to be (and 
is still billed as) a limited guest shot, but she so quickly became the toast 
of the show that the producers found her star salary worth the indefinite cost. 
The ex-"Dynasty" actress plays a "Dynasty"-style bitch, but more ambiguously -- 
as one who does the right thing almost as often as the wrong, a lovably 
self-serving powermonger who doesn't seem to even know she's committing a 
social faux pas when she walks up to Alison at her engagement party and blurts, 
"Billy didn't tell you? That when you were at the ranch, we slept together?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever her lack of a moral compass, you have to root for Amanda because 
she's the only character on the show to whom the writers have assigned even a 
whiff of intelligence. You've got Billy (Andrew Shue), the most open-mouthed, 
lunkheaded hunk of an alleged magazine editor who ever lived; Alison (Courtney 
Thorne-Smith), an imbecile just for digging him; Jo (Daphne Zuniga), no rocket 
scientist herself when it comes to picking criminals as boyfriends; even the 
token gay (Doug Savant), who has less sex life than anybody, has a libido where 
half a brain might normally go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melrose Place's" feature players are all as pretty as models and dumb as oxen 
-- allowing us to feel covetous and superior all at once, a pretty addictive 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there aren't occasional epiphanies or even humanizing moments of 
redemption for the shiftier characters (most likely in the annual Christmas 
episode). But "Melrose" gives all its characters the kind of moral short-term 
memory that ensures that, even after they've been chastened or learned a lesson 
at the conclusion of one story arc, they're witless enough to soon be making 
all the same mistakes over again with different partners and looking for love 
in all the wrong "Places." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the cyclical nature of a soap. That's high camp. Oddly enough, come to 
think of it, that's also life. Maybe this pleasure isn't quite so guilty after 
all.

ALL OF A SUDDEN, ALL-4-ONE'S A GROUP WITH A HIT SINGLE; POP MUSIC: THE ANTELOPE 
VALLEY VOCAL QUARTET WAS PUT TOGETHER TO RECORD A REMAKE OF 1963'S 'SO MUCH IN 
LOVE.' AN ALBUM IS IN THE WORKS. 
</P>

<P>
 Be careful with assumptions when talking about All-4-One, the Antelope Valley 
R&B vocal quartet whose dreamy recording of "So Much in Love" has leaped into 
the national Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, don't assume that All-4-One recorded the single as a tribute to 
such early doo-wop groups as the Tymes, which did the original single in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd never heard the song or knew anything about the Tymes before we did the 
single," says All-4-One's Jamie Jones, 19, during lunch in West Hollywood, 
where he's flanked by another member, Tony Borowiak, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been singing Boyz II Men songs for fun, and we like some other current 
vocal groups," he continues. "But old doo-wop is our parents' music. We'd hear 
this music around the house sometimes because of them. We like the Temptations 
and the Four Tops, but we didn't know a whole lot about doo-wop. A producer 
called us and asked us to record the single, which was all arranged. All we had 
to do was sing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another wrong assumption, the members say, is that their multi-ethnic makeup 
-- the group consists of a white (Borowiak) two blacks (Jones and Delious 
Kennedy) and one Mexican American (Alfred Nevarez) -- is part of a marketing 
strategy designed to appeal to various demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This 'United Nations' look wasn't planned," Jones insists. "We were just 
looking to put together the best vocal mix. Alfred is in the group because he 
has a strong bass voice that complements ours -- not because he's a Mexican who 
can attract Mexican fans." 
</P>
<P>
 But the singers do see a value in the diversity. Says Borowiak, "Having people 
of different backgrounds in the group, I think it makes us more interesting and 
more distinctive. It gives people something to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing the pop world is talking about is All-4-One's meteoric rise. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't even a group until they recorded "So Much in Love" last fall. None 
of the members -- all in their late teens or early 20s -- had any significant 
experience beyond singing in church choirs, amateur groups or talent shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a group we've just done one show," Borowiak points out. "Nothing we'd done 
before really prepared us for what we're doing now. We're on another level now. 
We've got a lot of work to do before we start performing on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Jones and Borowiak admit they'd never even done a media interview 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every area of this business, we're like babes in the woods -- or worse 
than that if it's possible," Jones cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, Borowiak and Nevarez were singing jingles for KAVS-FM in Antelope 
Valley when producer Gary St. Clair asked them to assemble a group to record 
"So Much in Love" last fall for Blitzz Records, a Chatsworth label affiliated 
with Atlantic Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to make it a quartet, they brought in Kennedy, whom they had met at a 
karaoke showcase last summer. Kennedy, originally from New York and the oldest 
member of the group at 23, had come to town looking for a break in show 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fourth voice was important," Jones explains. "When one guy is singing 
lead there's still three voices behind him with a three-part melody -- which 
sounds better. You also get a much fuller overall sound with four voices." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blitzz deal was just for a single, but since it became a hit, the group 
has been working furiously on its debut album, written by the members and 
co-produced by St. Clair and Blitzz president Tim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning as we go along," Jones explains. "It's really the tough way to 
do this. We're learning about each other too, since we've never worked together 
in this kind of situation. We're learning about writing and recording -- every 
phase of the business. None of us thought we'd be here right now in a group. 
It's been an incredible scramble these past few months." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Borowiak, clearly still awe-struck by it all, "All of sudden -- bam! -- 
we have a group, an album, a career. We're living the dream of every unknown 
singer and musician. All I can say is: Wow!" 
</P>
<P>
 Before doo-wop devotees get too excited about the group's first album, 
"All-4-One" -- due March 29 -- Borowiak had some bad news. Not only are there 
no other doo-wop remakes on the album, but only one other song sounds anything 
like "So Much in Love." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we did a whole album of that kind of music, people would think that's all 
we can do," he says. "When you come from out of nowhere like we have, people 
are ready to confine you in some category right away. We don't want that."

OUTLAW FINALLY GETS HIS TIMING RIGHT; COUNTRY MUSIC: BILLY JOE SHAVER IS 
PULLING IN GLOWING REVIEWS FOR HIS FIRST ALBUM IN SEVEN YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Great moments in career development, courtesy of Billy Joe Shaver: 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out at a CBS (Records) party, at the Opryland Hotel in Nashville," 
recalls the colorful country music veteran. "I got up on a rail there and 
threatened to jump down into the lobby if (they) didn't give me a recording 
contract. . . . There was a bunch of people trying to save me, but I almost 
fell off anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it, and it still didn't do no good, darn it. I did the best I could." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, CBS stayed in business after that early-'80s episode. Shaver's 
previous recording experiences had been with companies on the critical list. 
</P>
<P>
 "My timin' ain't been all that good," allows the 53-year-old singer. "When I 
first come up, my first album on Monument . . . it didn't get a chance to get 
out good, the company went and folded. Then Capricorn, . . . I went over and 
did two albums and closed them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that bad timing -- not to mention a rough upbringing, serious accidents 
and unruly behavior -- it's a miracle that he's around at all. But Shaver is 
not only still active, he's pulling in glowing reviews for his first album in 
seven years, "Tramp on Your Street." He'll be playing his first L.A. date in a 
decade on Friday at Jacks Sugar Shack. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fairly triumphant return of the lost outlaw -- a singer-songwriter who 
barreled into Nashville from his Waco home and eventually hooked up with Willie 
Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings -- the "outlaws" who were giving 
country music a face lift in the early '70s with their back-to-basics sound and 
ambitious lyrical range. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver, with his rough-and-tumble personality and simple, evocative imagery, 
was a perfect fit. Jennings' landmark 1973 album "Honky Tonk Heroes" featured 
11 of his tunes, and Kristofferson produced his debut album, "Old Five and 
Dimers Like Me." But while his colleagues went on to prosperous careers, Shaver 
stumbled. He made three albums in the '80s, and a few of his songs were turned 
into country hits, but respect for his work was always countered by his 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess maybe sometimes I had a little too much fun," says Shaver, who grew 
up dirt-poor in Corsicana, Tex., then lost two fingers in a sawmill accident 
before turning to music. "People think I'm unmanageable, which is not true. I 
don't look at myself as being that crazy. . . . It was mostly just fistfights. 
Everybody just blows my deal up, and I tried to get away from it, but it just 
would keep on comin'."  
</P>
<P>
 After his last album, 1987's "Salt of the Earth," Shaver (with his guitarist 
son Eddy leading his band) kept playing clubs and making demos, and he was 
finally signed by the offbeat Nashville label Praxis. The album marks something 
of an outlaw reunion -- Jennings sings with him on two of the songs, and Nelson 
has roped him in as opening act on a series of Willie and Waylon concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 How difficult was it for Shaver during the '70s and '80s to watch his pals 
thrive while he struggled? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the breaks," he says. "There's lots and lots of songs that I'm 
really fond of that more than likely I wouldn't have written if I hadn't gone 
down this hard road. And I wouldn't take anything for those songs. If I'd have 
went on and made a bunch of money and everything like that and seen somebody 
else writing songs like I'm writing, it would have broke my heart."

 Children can make 'em laugh and get into the act in a big way in "The Circus 
Is Coming to Town," Storybook Theatre's modest new musical interactive theater 
activity for preschoolers and early elementary school kids. Written by Lloyd J. 
Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Chris Gordon Wallace, the show has a simple 
plot: Ringmaster (Joe Lucas), Clown (Susan Cardillo) and Wild Animal Tamer 
(Erin Donavan) try to keep mean Mr. Grimble (Harris Shore) from stopping the 
circus to sell his yucky "spinachade." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the circus is made up of lots of audience volunteers who take the 
stage as circus animals, clowns and acrobats to persuade another spoilsport, 
Mrs. Ima Notfun (Shore again), that circuses can be fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Circus Is Coming to Town," Theatre West, 3333 Cahuenga Blvd. West, 
Saturdays at 1 p.m., indefinitely. $7; (818) 761-2203.
