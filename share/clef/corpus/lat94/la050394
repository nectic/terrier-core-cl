 No doubt he proposed in the diamond lane: We're a sucker for a true Southern 
California-type love story. Several months ago, you may recall, a sheriff's 
deputy and a California Highway Patrol officer were married after meeting at 
the scene of an accident in La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we hear that David (Dr. Roadmap) Rizzo, author of "Freeway Alternates," 
just got hitched. But let him tell you about it in this announcement to The 
Times, which was faxed, rather than engraved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be gone the first week of May for my honeymoon," it said in part. "I 
am marrying the commuter columnist for the Riverside Press-Enterprise. We met 
when she reviewed my book two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The bride is Holly Ocasio Remy, whose column on the groom's book was included 
in Rizzo's note to this newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect the couple chose May for its scenic delights. And, too, Dr. Roadmap 
no doubt felt he could take a break now that the Santa Monica Freeway had 
reopened and motorists will go back to ignoring every alternate route on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. and Mrs. Roadmap had already left on their honeymoon when we learned of 
their union, so we don't know where they're vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 But they'll probably make a stop at Chevron Island.

 Don't forget your galoshes: You could be excused for interpreting the sign 
over one liquor store in Long Beach as a warning to watch your step inside (see 
photo). Actually it dates back to the days when Long Beach was a major naval 
base -- and it was still a good idea to watch your step inside.

 Official L.A. city cover-up?Mike Stensvold of Westlake Village protested when 
he received a $55 parking ticket for docking near a partially covered sign (see 
photo) in West L.A. Stensvold pointed out that the 4 to 7 p.m. restriction had 
been obscured on several signs on Crescent Heights Boulevard. But the city 
ruled that "an on-site investigation . . . concluded that the signs were 
sufficiently clear and visible, and therefore, the citation must be considered 
valid." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the white covering, Stensvold was told that if it didn't bear "the 
words, 'Los Angeles City,' " it's "not official city covering." 
</P>
<P>
 If the city wasn't responsible, who was? "Anytime we hear about something like 
this near UCLA or USC we suspect college kids," said one official. 
</P>
<P>
 Stensvold's ticket came after Mayor Richard Riordan's recent announcement that 
parking enforcement would be stepped up on the Westside to generate additional 
revenue -- a coincidence, we're sure.

 Tough undress code: Stanley Levinson of Thousand Oaks and some other readers 
noticed that a strip joint called the 101 Cafe advertises "exotic female nude 
dancers" but adds "dress code strictly enforced." LAny:

 Sara Meric sent along the catalogue for the recent Whole Life Expo, whose 
Virtual Reality Workshop had scheduled "a cyber sex demonstration for all 
attendees over 18." We don't dare make a joke about computer joysticks.

AL MARTINEZ: A LITTLE GIRL AT THE CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The essayist Georges Bernanos wrote that hope is a risk that must be run, and 
I was running with it Sunday . . . and ducking. 
</P>
<P>
 I was running to get out of the way of a phalanx of cops who were clearing the 
crowds from L.A.'s Fiesta Broadway. They were trotting toward us with batons at 
the ready and it was either run or get trampled. 
</P>
<P>
 I was ducking at the same time to avoid the rocks and bottles that mindless 
cholos were hurling through the air all around us. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope was moving with me because I'd been hoping the whole thing might be 
different. Running from cops wasn't the kind of weekend I had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was thinking as I trotted across a parking lot that it all seemed so 
L.A.ish and if I didn't get bopped on the head by any of the participants it 
might make an offbeat kind of column. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an almost lightheartedness to the calamity, the essence of an 
adventure unfolding . . . until I saw the little girl at the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 She was maybe 8 years old, the age of my two granddaughters, and she was 
crying her eyes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds swirled around her at the corner of 2nd and Hill. Police in riot gear 
ran by, looking grim and otherworldly, a patrol car pushed through the mobs, a 
helicopter hovered overhead and sirens screamed in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her name was Christina. She had come to Broadway with her mother to celebrate 
Cinco de Mayo and had instead come face to face with the realities of a city in 
turmoil, and it terrified her. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiesta was over. Trouble was in the air. I wondered if she would ever stop 
crying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had a plan for the weekend that would show me L.A. was ready for hope. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a concert in the mountains. The Topanga Philharmonic Orchestra 
was helping to celebrate the end of a 16-year fight to save Summit Valley from 
becoming a sprawling country club for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Edelman, hope's best friend on the Board of Supervisors, had brokered a 
last-minute sale of the land to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, 
preserving 662 acres of green valleys and rolling hills for all time. 
</P>
<P>
 The music of Vivaldi and Respighi filled the air around Will Geer's oak-shaded 
Theatricum Botanicum in a classical salute to Edelman who, with his wife, 
joined the orchestra with cellos, side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 It was vintage Topanga, denims and divertissement, dogs and kids, and great 
melodies of the past winding through the trees and the hillside wildflowers 
like silver ribbons packaging a glorious day. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not only a community that had saved open space, but one that had 
survived fire, flood and earthquake; that was tough enough to face adversity 
with remarkable aplomb, and gentle enough to observe triumph with a mosaic of 
soft sounds laid against the mountains that absorbed them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to honoring Edelman, the concert was a fund-raiser for the Topanga 
Co-Op Preschool, and children were in abundance. 
</P>
<P>
 They danced before the stage, ran down the dirt pathways and sang to an 
orchestrated rendition of "This Old Man." Their laughter lingered like wind 
chimes in a wandering breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope existed that day among the oak trees of Topanga . . . but Topanga is a 
long way from Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here too was the essence of celebration, the heart of metropolis thrown open 
to its people, to observe both the special holiday of a neighboring nation and 
the hope of a city to rise to the height of its dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other Fiestas Broadway had gone by with a coalescence of spirit unique to 
Los Angeles, and there was no reason to believe this one would be any 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 Music was in the air here too, but it was played vivacissimo, with life and 
passion and speed, blending the sounds of two nations in the streets of one. 
</P>
<P>
 What a day it could have been. Hundreds of thousands of L.A.'s citizens turned 
out. Men, women and children filled an area of 40 square blocks and by their 
very presence made hope a viable factor for at least this one day. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't last. Optimism, like ice in sunlight, is a perishable commodity, 
and it melted Sunday under the heat of confrontation. The sequence of events 
was predictable: a canceled performance, a crowd's angry response, police 
involvement, gangbangers stirring trouble, a party ended. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as a weekend of reconciliation ended in chaos for L.A., but does 
that mean hope died too? I don't think so, but it's always in jeopardy, always 
running the risks Bernanos was talking about. We've got to try harder. 
</P>
<P>
 I keep seeing that little girl crying on a street corner, and pondering the 
disparity between her and the children of Topanga dancing in the mountains, and 
what they'll all grow up to think of one another when the crying and the 
dancing stop.

MEDI-CAL HMO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Uncertainties Face HMO Plan for Medi-Cal" (March 28): 
</P>
<P>
 Although any change can be unsettling, Gov. Pete Wilson's initiative to 
transform Medi-Cal to managed care makes sense -- both for beneficiaries and 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 By linking Medi-Cal beneficiaries to mainstream health plans and their network 
of providers, managed-care delivery systems will improve access to primary 
health-care services for poor mothers and their children.And through its 
emphasis on prevention, health education and early intervention, managed care 
will generate long-term savings for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 As California moves to transform Medi-Cal into a managed-care environment, we 
must do so in a way that recognizes the role played by traditional providers of 
care to Medi-Cal beneficiaries and the uninsured. That is why we've instituted 
a number of assurances to traditional providers to facilitate their 
participation in the Medi-Cal managed-care environment. 
</P>
<P>
 A few remaining issues still need to be resolved. But as we move forward with 
the program, rest assured that we will continue working with traditional 
providers of health care for low-income Californians, including county health 
departments and community clinics, to help them to affiliate with the new 
managed-care plans.

FRIEDAN ON HILLARY CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Betty Friedan's commentary, "Stop Pillorying Hillary," April 
26: 
</P>
<P>
 Let me remind Friedan of one of Harry Truman's more famous comments, "If you 
can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 The only double standard that I saw during Hillary Clinton's interview with 
the media was the gentle treatment she received. Not one reporter questioned 
her ability to translate learning how to read a stock table at her daddy's knee 
into speculating in commodities. There is no relationship. And her defense as 
to making investments for her family's welfare also does not stand up. Rank 
speculation in commodities can hardly be equated with investing for one's 
family's welfare. Quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Friedan's pillorying of the media for hypocrisy, double standard and 
immorality -- nonsense. Hillary received all the accolades for the universal 
health care plan she submitted with able assistance of Ira Magaziner and many 
others. She was received with adoration by Congress and the media when she 
presented her plan, despite its many flaws and ill-conceived notions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly there are more important problems than Whitewater and Hillary's still 
unexplained expertise in commodity trading facing the nation. If Friedan has 
not noticed, these problems are being addressed, perhaps not necessarily to her 
liking or perhaps not necessarily well, but they are being given full 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 DORIS ESTILL 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * While I have a great deal of respect for the work Friedan has done in the 
women's movement, I must take exception with her statement that " . . . the 
American people support Hillary Rodham Clinton as an equal partner of the 
President." The voters voted for the ticket of Bill Clinton and Al Gore, not 
Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. In personal matters and in family 
matters I'm sure she is an equal partner with her husband. In matters of 
government it is only Bill Clinton who was elected by the people of this 
country. The President of the United States has no equal partner. 
</P>

<P>
 * Strong intelligent women tend to arouse fear in insecure men and 
condemnation from those women who believe that women's role is to be 
subservient to their men. The stronger the woman, the greater the fury which is 
aroused.  
</P>
<P>
 The commodities market is high paced and volatile. Fortunes are made and lost 
in brief periods. The system is set up so small cash investments can bring 
large returns. It is not usually a place for amateurs although amateurs with 
good advice can get lucky at times. Why assume that because Mrs. Clinton made 
money in such a market, something must be wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The media make much of the Clintons' payment of taxes and interest on those 
taxes for previous years. They do not emphasize that these payments were 
voluntary as the statuary time for review had passed. How many of us still have 
returns from the '70s available and can remember details of income and 
deductions of those years? 
</P>
<P>
 Some letters to The Times have by implications assailed Mrs. Clinton's morals 
without any evidence to support their views. The media have become so invasive 
that they give prime-time exposure to juvenile questions relating to the kind 
of underwear President Clinton prefers. We have become addicted to the tabloid 
school of fake news. If lies are repeated often enough, we begin to believe 
them even though much of what we are exposed to is back-fence gossip and 
innuendo.  
</P>
<P>
 We are never going to have morally perfect people in public office (or in 
private life) so why not evaluate programs rather than personalities? Attack 
with vigor those ideas with which you disagree, but focus on the message rather 
than the messenger.

 * To invest and to gain, or win, is the ethos immanent in every citizen living 
in a capitalist-Christian civilization. What the Clintons did is appropriate 
behavior under the general rules of capitalist society. To say this is 
censurable betrays ignorance of the ethical infrastructure of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, to equate Whitewater with Reagan's dark years while in office is 
nonsense and false.

WORDS OF HOPE, NOT OF REVENGE; MANDELA FORESEES AN INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela joyfully anticipates his presidency without rancor, reassuring 
a world weary of intractable conflicts that the newly democratic South Africa 
will have room for everyone. There will be no oppression of the minority by the 
majority, he promises. There will be no punishment for centuries of stolen land 
and vile inequities. There will be no purges. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from interviews he gave to reporters, when Mandela takes office next 
week he won't follow the politician's traditional credo: To the victor goes the 
spoils. He won't unfairly favor his African National Congress, he indicates. 
Instead, he promises to fashion a national unity Cabinet that includes former 
political rivals.  
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk, who graciously conceded on Monday, is expected 
to become one of Mandela's deputy presidents by virtue of the National Party's 
impressive showing in the recent elections. The National Party, the white 
minority party that crafted the wicked apartheid system that legalized racial 
discrimination, was second in last week's voting.  
</P>
<P>
 Mandela even extends his hand to his fiercest rivals -- right-wing 
conservatives and supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Zulu-based 
Inkatha Freedom Party. Despite the threats of violence by white extremists and 
the thousands of South Africans killed in clashes between ANC and Inkatha 
supporters, elements of the right too belong in the new government -- not 
festering outside of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 A different kind of man would be bitter. Mandela, the lawyer and freedom 
fighter, lost 27 years of his life in prison. Locked away from family and 
friends during what should have been his most productive period, he continued 
to struggle against a vicious system that rationed the riches of his country on 
the basis of race. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the historic election that has vaulted Mandela to the presidency, the 
majority of black South Africans still live in abject poverty. They own no 
land. They lack decent housing. For millions, the brutality of apartheid has 
not eased. 
</P>
<P>
 A different kind of man would insist on revenge: Someone would pay for the 
years of privilege at the expense of blacks. But Mandela's words are those of 
hope, optimism and pragmatism. The nation's first black president appears 
poised to develop the promise of the world's newest democracy for all South 
Africans. There is, of course, no assurance that when Mandela is gone whoever 
succeeds him as national leader will possess this special vision and humanity. 
But for now, he is setting a remarkable standard, day by day, that will 
challenge the constructive energies of those who follow in his wake.

THE RAMS: GOING, GOING . . .; TEAM INVOKES CONTRACT ESCAPE CLAUSE IN PREPARING 
TO LEAVE ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some off-season football news: Today the Rams formally put their host city on 
notice that they will invoke an escape clause in the Anaheim Stadium lease that 
allows them to leave in 15 months. It now appears the team will go elsewhere, 
although it is not known yet just where.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there will be a tear or two shed if and when the Rams quit Anaheim, but 
the cold economic realities must be faced. It would be great if the team stayed 
beyond the coming season, but the powerful financing mechanisms of modern pro 
football argue against that. Of course, the game is ultimately about its 
economics. Sentiment alone cannot dictate where to put or keep a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Rams seem on their way out the door in Anaheim, CBS, which lost 
the television rights to the National Football Conference to the Fox network, 
has acknowledged having had some early discussion with a group of corporations 
about forming a new rival Sunday afternoon league. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad thing is that the Rams have a fine tradition in Southern California. 
But in Anaheim, the important intangibles of civic pride and winning ways never 
caught fire sufficiently, or for long enough, after the team's arrival from the 
Los Angeles Coliseum in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 However, more to the point, Anaheim was not able to offer anything like what 
cities such as Baltimore, St. Louis or Memphis might eventually put on the 
table. Anaheim's negotiators did make a mistake in allowing a contractual 
escape clause for the Rams, but that simply may have pushed the inevitable up 
on the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, incentives being offered around the country put teams with wanderlust 
in the driver's seat. Yet at the same time, we should hope that all those 
unsentimental, bottom-line considerations also serve as a reminder that 
Southern California remains a very attractive sports market. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a city like Anaheim cannot be held responsible for team performance. 
Wherever the team parlays its strong hand into a lucrative deal, it still will 
be accountable to its customers for what happens on Sunday afternoons.

OPTIMISTIC AND READY TO TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, sensing a "new, more substantive phase" 
developing in Israel-Syria relations, has hinted at a possible return visit to 
the two countries later this month in hopes of moving the peace process along. 
The only problem is that Israeli and Syrian officials seem to be decidedly less 
upbeat than Christopher about the chances for ending their long conflict. What 
accounts for this apparent gap in perceptions? Maybe nothing more complicated 
than some fairly expectable political role-playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's first responsibility, as representative of the chief sponsor of 
the Middle East peace process, is to keep negotiations active and productive. 
Among other things that means seizing on every sign of flexibility to claim 
progress and provide a basis for moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and Syria may be no less interested in breaking their stalemate; 
certainly Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's announced readiness to make major 
concessions indicates that he at least wants to do so. But for powerful 
political reasons neither Rabin nor Syrian President Hafez Assad can seem too 
eager to open a negotiation whose success ultimately depends on concessions 
from both sides. So where Christopher sees hopeful signs Israel and Syria each 
accuse the other of not being forthcoming enough. Note, however, that each side 
has also been very careful not to close the door on the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has apparently proposed a phased withdrawal of its army and settler 
population from the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 
war. In exchange it wants full peace. Syria apparently doesn't like the Israeli 
timetable for withdrawal and, at this point, seems unready to commit to the 
political conditions Jerusalem seeks. The resulting gap represents, of course, 
precisely the kind of challenge that diplomacy was invented to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 If Christopher sees any chance for an opening he will, quite properly, soon 
return to the Middle East to invest U.S. prestige in a crucial mediation 
effort. One key message he ought to drive home in Damascus is that Rabin, with 
his earlier offer to disband settlements on the Golan Heights, has already 
signaled a crucial willingness to give up Israeli claims to that strategic 
plateau. If Syria really wants the Golan back and really wants peace, it need 
only show it is ready to explore fully the significance of that offer.

CULTURE WATCH; CHERISHING CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Brave New World," Shakespeare's radiant phrase, became a category of modern 
thought thanks to Aldous Huxley, who made it the title of his 1932 novel. But 
the irony of the title is lost unless one hears behind it the joyful cry of the 
young Miranda in "The Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Huxley, 82, the writer's widow, has not forgotten Miranda. For the 
centenary of Huxley's birth, she organized a just-ended conference on 
"Children: Our Ultimate Investment," about which one might say, with equal 
justice, "only Huxley" and "only in Los Angeles." In whose name but his, and 
where else but here, would singer Kenny Loggins and tai chi master Chungliang 
Al Huang appear alongside anthropologist Ashley Montagu? 
</P>
<P>
 Aldous Huxley and his near-contemporary George Orwell have been seen as twin 
prophets, "Brave New World" and "1984" satirizing, respectively, the decadent 
Western World and the totalitarian East. Of the two, however, it was Huxley who 
looked further ahead. "Brave New World," set in the 25th Century and dealing 
with, among other ills, the drug culture and overpopulation, addresses a world 
that is more our own with each passing year. 
</P>
<P>
 But as this conference rightly reminds us, Huxley, more than Orwell, also 
retained an optimism that may partly explain why he made Los Angeles his home 
for the last third of his life. Behind the horror of drug abuse, he saw a 
thirst of the spirit. And he dreamed, in the shadow of overpopulation, of a 
world in which every child would be planned for and cherished as Prospero 
cherished Miranda.

PRESIDENT NIXON

<TEXT>

 * People often say former President Richard Nixon is the man who went to 
China, but the real meaning of that can be only comprehended by those who are 
Chinese. On that historical trip to China in early 1972, President Nixon put 
aside differences in ideology, replaced confrontation with reconciliation, 
struck for peace and most importantly showed love for all mankind.The impact of 
the trip is beyond words that can describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then China has never been the same; the country's economy took off for 
real and every individual, including myself, has been raised to a new ground 
where living can be tasted with sweetness, love is shared and peace has finally 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was a true leader of the world. There is an old Chinese saying, "People 
who drink the water from a well will never forget the person who dug the well." 
Nixon was the person whom a billion Chinese will remember forever.

A SEASONAL METAPHOR: THE JACARANDAS IN BLOOM; SPRING: THE BRILLIANT BUT BRIEF 
BURST OF PURPLE TREES BRINGS US BOTH HOPE AND REGRET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA VAN GELDER, Paula Van Gelder lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who say that Los Angeles offers no seasonal changes, I offer the 
jacarandas now blooming as proof that at least there is one very noticeable 
change that marks the passage of the year in this city. For several short 
weeks, these ordinarily green trees are transformed into objects of great 
beauty and delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bursting of the jacarandas' masses of purple buds always fills me with 
delight, exhilaration and hope. Sadly, the fleeting blossoming of the trees 
also brings me a certain sense of melancholy and brooding introspection. Even 
as I enjoy the purple blossoms on my block, they have already begun to 
disappear from trees on neighboring blocks, leaving lawns covered with 
windblown buds as the only memory of their yearly passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The life cycle of the jacaranda seems to bear a reminder of the nature of all 
life. The annual blossoming of these special trees makes me think of one of the 
most moving and meaningful Hebrew prayers: "Blessed art thou . . . King of the 
universe, who has granted us life and sustenance and permitted us to reach this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, after fires, floods and earthquakes, we have finally reached the 
season of long spring days, the renewal of our streets and gardens. Life goes 
on, beauty continues, and every day that we witness the good and the beautiful 
is a privilege and blessing. The memories of that beauty and goodness are meant 
to sustain us through the difficult times of rain, barren branches and sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 No living thing lasts forever. Perhaps the purpose of memory is to enable us 
to store up beauty, hope and sunshine for the times when we must call upon them 
to sustain us. 
</P>
<P>
 I am always disappointed that not all the jacarandas flower simultaneously. 
There is never any one day when all of them are in full bloom. Perhaps none of 
our wishes can be so easily gratified. Perhaps there is no time when absolute 
beauty is the only thing visible on life's horizon.  
</P>
<P>
 For now, I am satisfied. I have seen the jacarandas come to life again, 
renewing my spirit and filling me with hope. May we all find blessing and 
satisfaction in our own glimpses of the world, our own blossoms, our own 
jacarandas.

PERSPECTIVE ON DEFENSE; WE'RE NO. 1 IN THE ARMS BAZAAR; A VIGOROUS OVERSEAS 
SALES PROGRAM BENEFITS A SHAKY U.S. INDUSTRY, A SHAMEFUL SUBSTITUTE FOR 
CONVERSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE ALLEN and MICHAEL CLOSSON, Bruce Allen is director of communications 
for the Center for Economic Conversion in Mountain View, Calif. Michael Closson 
is the center's executive director. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ron Brown has become an aggressive advocate of overseas 
arms sales as a way to counter widening trade deficits and mild cuts in 
Pentagon spending. His rationale, in part, is the Clinton Administration's 
emphasis on "dual-use" technologies -- those with both military and civilian 
applications -- as a strategy for defense "conversion." As the dividing line 
between military and commercial technologies becomes ever more blurred, the 
Commerce Department becomes more involved in arms sales. Brown has made trips 
to Saudi Arabia and France to pitch defense products, and has stated that his 
goal is "to ensure that U.S. industries, including defense companies . . . are 
poised to take advantage of appropriate business opportunities worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department's aggressive support for overseas arms sales is just 
one part of a full-court press by the Administration to expand on the U.S. role 
as the world's largest arms dealer. The Pentagon plans to sell off billions of 
dollars worth of slightly used military equipment at cut-rate prices and use 
the money to buy new and improved weapons systems. The State Department has 
instructed American embassies to hawk more U.S. weapons overseas; this summer, 
U.S. firms will participate for the first time in Eurosatory, the world's 
largest arms bazaar. Clinton has approved a new Export Administration Act that 
will significantly roll back restrictions on the export of sensitive 
technologies, including those that could be used to build ballistic missiles 
and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy has already chalked up results: Last year, the United States 
accounted for nearly 60% of all arms sales to Third World countries, more than 
all other nations combined. Overall, U.S. arms sales in 1993 were more than $31 
billion, compared with just over $12 billion in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, Congress recently passed legislation that would increase 
the amount in loan guarantees -- now roughly $7 billion per year -- for arms 
exports. The bill's defense-industry backers originally tried to get the 
program funded with some of the $20 billion Clinton has earmarked for defense 
conversion over the next five years. The increase is still without funding; 
Clinton chose not to seek money for it this year, but Administration officials 
have hinted that he is likely to do so next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fixation on overseas arms sales reflects a harsh dual reality: After 
decades of lavish federal funding, military technology is one of our most 
exportable commodities; conversely, many defense firms, especially the 
aerospace behemoths, are ill-equipped for the competitive commercial 
marketplace. For these dinosaurs, selling abroad is their best hope for 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dangers of increased arms traffic far outweigh the benefits of 
retaining defense jobs. Such sales only serve to escalate regional arms races, 
posing greater threats to both American and global security. Government 
assurances that weapons will be sold only to "friendly" nations ignore the fact 
that doing so inevitably provokes the potential adversaries of those countries 
to engage in their own arms buildups. And our continued domination of the world 
weapons market seriously undermines our attempts to discourage others' sales to 
troublesome countries.  
</P>
<P>
 The most ironic aspect of all this is that the economic justifications don't 
hold much water. While a few defense firms will prosper, the taxpayer-supported 
subsidies greatly detract from the benefits to the nation as a whole. So do the 
now-standard "offset" agreements, in which defense firms shift some work -- 
jobs that Americans would have done -- to purchasing countries to help defray 
the costs of the weapons. We also lose some of our technological edge in these 
transfers. The Pentagon then demands higher defense spending in order to regain 
the edge and counter the threats to American security created by those very 
same arms sales. 
</P>
<P>
 This self-sustaining racket conspires to keep the bulk of our national wealth 
tied up in bloated defense budgets and away from the domestic technologies in 
which we so desperately need to invest, such as renewable energy development, 
mass transit and environmental restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect on developing nations is even worse. When impoverished nations 
spend their scarce resources on weapons -- which they are doing at an alarming 
rate, thanks to Uncle Sam -- their people go without food, clean water or 
medical care. Often those weapons are used against the people when they attempt 
to express their grievances; 90% of all U.S. arms sales are to non-elected 
governments and dictatorships, yet in polls, Americans are nearly unanimous in 
their opposition to selling weapons to such regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the pursuit of more arms sales abroad is a cynical policy and a 
costly substitute for genuine defense conversion. The Commerce Department has a 
key role to play in helping arms makers find new civilian products and 
missions, not merely new customers to take up the slack in Pentagon spending. 
It should focus more on its commendable Advanced Technology Program, which 
assists businesses in developing new, strictly commercial technology, rather 
than on propping up an outsized and outmoded military-industrial base by arming 
the world to the teeth.

O.C. ART REVIEWS; EXHIBITIONS WANDER THROUGH ONCE-TABOO TERRITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A postcard announces a new gallery specializing in "art of an intimate and 
personal nature: the beautiful and disturbing, art of the fantastic, oddities 
and grotesqueries." A press release heralds another show called "The New 
Degenerates." An envelope disgorges a catalogue for still another, titled 
"Nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloomy, peculiar and darkly provocative art has always been with us, but 
recently it seems to be surfacing more often in galleries -- both fringe and 
mainstream -- as well as in science-fiction comics, CD covers and youthful 
'zines. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, at least two Orange County art shows, both in Santa Ana, are 
poking around once-taboo territory. ("Nasty," at Stuart Katz's Loft in Laguna 
Beach, was reviewed previously.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the age of AIDS, it's tempting to draw parallels with the Middle Ages, when 
plague mowed down whole populations and grotesque demons and emaciated saints 
populated church carvings. Medieval flagellants tortured themselves with whips; 
today, youth culture has embraced piercings in private parts of the body, 
tattoos, scarification and even experiments in bondage. 
</P>
<P>
 The flagellants, who lived in a culture of material deprivation and short life 
spans, were asserting the Christian primacy of spirit over flesh. But today's 
self-torturers -- adrift in a vapid, undemanding culture and faced with 
diminished career and lifestyle expectations -- seem to welcome pain as proof 
of their ability to feel anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Variants of the same ironic, detached mood haunt heavy metal's apocalyptic 
scenarios, grunge's nihilistic, affectless rants and techno's hypnotic sound 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The art in "DarkVision," the inaugural show at Dark's Art Parlour in Santa Ana 
(through May 15), is heavily involved with intense views of sex, the occult, 
death, disease, mutilation, deformity and, yes, even loneliness. Despite some 
cynicism about commercial culture, this is utterly apolitical art, concerned 
with interior worlds of personal fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallery founders Rochelle Phister and Gomez Flores (who uses only his first 
name) chose the 95 works in the show -- by 80 artists from 20 states -- from 
submissions received from around the country. (To get the attention of 
fledgling artists who are out of the art-competition loop, Phister said, they 
also ran an ad in Mean Street, an alternative-music magazine.) 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed against black-painted walls, the paintings, photographs, prints, 
assemblages and sculptures are overwhelmingly introverted and, if not downright 
painful or gloomy, at least weird or wistful. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are fuzzily amateurish, while others (like K.D. Matheson's huge, 
eye-poppingly detailed painting, "Lord of the Flies") are technically 
accomplished but seem too naively wrapped up in monster lore. Still, a few 
works combine technical finesse with emotional resonance or irony. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Arden MacDonald poses herself in precarious positions within cavernous 
abandoned settings. One photograph, set in a vast barn, shows MacDonald 
swinging in a blurred, ecstatic arch from ropes binding her wrists. Flirting 
with self-inflicted pain, she appears to find a dream-like release. 
</P>
<P>
 In another image by MacDonald, an urban panorama is visible from within a huge 
garage that dwarfs the artist's nearly naked body, lying under a huge 
jagged-toothed contraption suspended from the ceiling. A "Perils of Pauline" 
quality somewhat undercuts the image, which seems implicitly to compare a 
self-induced horrific private encounter with the pervasive yet hidden threats 
of city life. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's a bunch of unclassifiable stuff: Jefferson Steele's photograph, 
"Terror-Eyes," a blurred, bug-eyed face that looks sort of like Howdy Doody in 
a terrorist mode; and Nancy Nainis Garguilo's "Jenny Craig on Ice," a toy pink 
refrigerator stocked with tiny jars filled with crumpled towels bearing images 
of the diet queen. 
</P>
<P>
 John Brooks Gray evokes the moody self-consciousness of the early 20th-Century 
Pictorialist photographers in "Prosthesis," a silver print of a nude, 
long-haired man plugged into a gleaming, unidentifiable metal contraption. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Stolzer takes a matter-of-fact view of the macabre in "Juggling Heads," 
a tiny box holding a painting of a headless figure with a tidy constellation of 
airborne heads. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deadpan vein, James Mitchell Clark proposes a singular messenger of death 
in "The Visitor," a silver print of a bloody-faced fellow in a pajama top who 
holds skeletons in both hands as he stands behind the seated figure of a 
stupefied elderly woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, perhaps the chief fascinations of Jacob Leonard's "Embryonic 
Death" -- a skeletal, distorted image of a woman crisscrossed by bloody 
entrails, is its seat-of-the-pants ingenuity in using wadded paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the extreme imagery in the show seems awkward, however, despite (or 
because of) its obvious earnestness. The most difficult thing, particularly for 
isolated, inexperienced artists, is finding an unhackneyed way to couch 
fantasies and fears. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, at the Caged Chameleon Gallery, "The New Degenerates" 
(through May 15) gathers 143 works from 18 Orange County artists. (The heavily 
ironic press release, which trumpeted the obligation of "responsible adults" to 
save themselves "from a future of subversive art, music, theater and thought," 
actually elicited a few phone calls from ultraconservatives eager to clean up 
the county's artistic profile, co-owner Richard Espinachio says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Compared with "DarkVision," this show is much less focused, encompassing 
Emigdio Vasquez's studiously realistic portraits of famous subversives 
(including Rosa Luxemburg, Malcolm X and Che Guevara) as well as Cornelius 
O'Leary's utterly absurd "Pubic's Cube," a Rubik's cube filled with snips of 
human hair. Once again, many seemingly earnest attempts rely on passe styles or 
are too overbearing or inchoate. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, there are a few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Veatch invokes a domestic world at war (Belfast? Belgrade?) in his 
oblique yet unnerving paintings of red-splotched figures with an oddly dated 
look -- a couple in their evening finery, a bunch of guys hanging out -- who 
appear to be under attack by sniper fire or bomb blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Bass' "Pottage" is a child's potty chair inscribed with a quotation 
from the Beatitudes ("Blessed are the meek . . . ") and outfitted with four 
ominous leather straps to encircle tiny wrists and ankles. (The title wickedly 
combines scatology with an allusion to the stew the Bible says Esau received in 
exchange for his birthright.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Bass' unusual commentaries on child abuse is a children's lamp she 
reworked so that the figure of a policeman directing a little boy and girl 
across the street sports a toy elephant trunk just above his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Phister's mixed-media piece on cotton, "Miscalculating the Cure," 
vividly portrays physical pain with an image of a man's nails raking bloody 
lines in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining the low-key effect of graphite (there's not a speck of color in 
the entire piece) with the demure physicality of lines sewn with a needle and 
thread, Phister gets away with the shock value of ramming a real fish hook 
through the man's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Other works stand out simply for their visual beguilements. Ken Ruzik's spiky, 
serpentine paintings of Tantric sex and other private rituals employ some of 
the linear effects of Indian miniature painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez's brightly colored, delicately linear, Surrealism-meets-pop culture 
paintings are delicious little treats. In "Song From Under the Floorboards," a 
diva with a pink head in the shape of a gas mask and tiny pointed teeth sings 
into an old-fashioned recording device, to which she is attached by a plastic 
cord bizarrely issuing from under her bouffant dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, this show is the final one in the Caged Chameleon's present 
location. In early July, it will move to a 2,500-square-foot site with a 
performance space and a courtyard, at 1519 Main St., a short walk from Dark's 
Art Parlour. 
</P>
<P>
 Both galleries are run as labors of love by artists who hold outside jobs. The 
owners keep sale prices and dealer commissions low enough to make up for the 
unknown and uneven quality of the art (mostly well below $1,000 at Dark's and 
less than $250 at the Caged Chameleon). 
</P>
<P>
 Espinachio says he views the proximity of both galleries as the beginning of a 
grass-roots Santa Ana art district. And that's exactly how such things happen: 
not by political fiat or marketing wizardry, but by people with a passion for 
art, pals who can donate plumbing and carpentry skills, and a dedication to 
serving the people in their own neighborhood, whatever their economic or social 
circumstances.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; VIOLENT INCIDENT DOESN'T COMPLETELY MAR 'FIESTA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was supposed to be the ultimate Cinco de Mayo celebration, but the isolated 
violence at Sunday's "L.A. Fiesta Broadway" not only raised questions about the 
future of the nation's largest Cinco de Mayo gathering but dampened an 
otherwise landmark triple header of Latin pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the hundreds of thousands at the "Fiesta" in Downtown Los 
Angeles may not have even seen the incident, the first outburst in the event's 
five-year history occurred around 3:30 p.m. Alleged gang members confronted 
police with rocks and bottles in front of the Power 106 FM stage after a 
performance scheduled to run until 6 p.m. was canceled due to a crowd pushing 
against security platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of the "Fiesta" could likely hinge on what happened in front of the 
Power 106 stage, overlooking the fact that performances continued for another 
two hours without incidents on the other eight stages. The day's combination of 
eclectic music and mostly good vibrations made the event a Southern California 
tradition worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like last year, salsa was the afternoon's most enjoyable sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the main "Fiesta" headliners, salseros Marc Anthony from New York and 
Colombia's Grupo Niche, turned in strong performances before large crowds on 
separate stages. 
</P>
<P>
 After making his debut last year singing to backing tracks, Marc Anthony 
finally brought his own band and confirmed his status as one of the most 
promising figures in Latin pop for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite impressive record sales and critical acclaim, the New York-born Puerto 
Rican singer was limited to just three numbers -- the same limit placed on 
Niche. 
</P>
<P>
 This uneven musical criteria -- some less worthy acts are given greater 
exposure -- is what makes "L.A. Fiesta Broadway" a social and commercial affair 
rather than a truly artistic-oriented event. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Fiesta" was one of three Los Angeles events on Sunday that together 
represented the largest showcase of Latin pop ever staged in the United States. 
The others: the banda and nortena "Primero de Mayo" festival on the grounds of 
the Sports Arena and another Cinco de Mayo fiesta at Whittier Narrows in South 
El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sports Arena program, organized by top-rated radio station KLAX (97.9 FM) 
and Fonovisa Records, was a near-perfect venture that almost duplicated last 
year's similar triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Tigres del Norte and Los Tiranos del Norte -- the masters and the new 
blood of nortena music, respectively -- headlined a list of 19 bandas and 
grupos before an estimated crowd of more than 100,000, most of which was 
composed of teen-agers and young adults, as opposed to the more family-oriented 
"L.A. Fiesta Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle of several quebradita fan clubs, each with their own dance style 
and dress code, was a feast for the eyes and a perfect companion for a 
well-organized event that is becoming arguably the most attractive music and 
social concert in Los Angeles . . . whether or not you are into this style of 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 KLVE's Cinco de Mayo event at Whittier Narrows, the underdog for Sunday's 
triple-header celebration, drew an impressive crowd of 50,000 despite the 
last-minute cancellation of its main headliner, Venezuela's Jose Luis Rodriguez 
"El Puma."

'STRINDBERG ON FILM' HITS PAY DIRT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 LACMA's "Strindberg on Film" series commences today in Bing Theater at 8 p.m. 
with "The Creditor," a 1987 filming of a stage production of a one-act 1888 
play updated to the '30s. So timeless is the material, so impeccable its 
ensemble playing and so deft is Stefan Bohm's direction that we soon forget 
we're watching that much-maligned form, the "filmed play." 
</P>
<P>
 The single setting is a resort hotel veranda where a dashing, virile 
middle-aged man, Gustav (Keve Hjelm), has come to wreak revenge on his former 
wife Tekla (Bibi Andersson) by turning her current husband, Adolf (Tomas 
Bolme), an ailing, unprepossessing-looking sculptor, against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Strindberg remains ever the master of ferocious, cruel and destructive 
love-hate relationships between men and women. All that Tekla has really done 
is to wound the vanity of her ex by depicting him as an idiot in her latest 
novel, but it's enough to unleash in Gustav the most diabolical tactics to 
undermine the jealous and naive Adolf. 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders if audiences a century ago were as sympathetic to Tekla as they 
are likely to be today. She does not appear until nearly halfway through the 
production, and as so beautifully played by Andersson, who appeared in so many 
Ingmar Bergman films, that she easily captivates us, not just by her elegance, 
but by her honesty and forthrightness. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson's Tekla is a liberated woman way ahead of her time, not pretending 
to be a saint but hardly deserving of what her ex-husband attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with "The Creditor" is Alf Sjoberg's classic 1951 film "Miss Julie," 
starring Anita Bjork. 
</P>
<P>
 LACMA is also launching this week, on Friday, another series, "Directed by 
Douglas Sirk," a homage to the stylish master at wringing meaning from heady 
melodrama.

MUSIC REVIEW; BABY-INSPIRED PREMIERE CONCLUDES SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The season finale of the chamber-music series Pacific Serenades featured a 
couple of ex-Californians, composer Larry Lipkis and violist Cynthia Phelps, in 
apparently happy, if brief, homecomings. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the circumstance, Sunday afternoon in the Emerald Room of the Biltmore 
Hotel, it seemed appropriate that Lipkis, now a professor and 
composer-in-residence at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pa., should celebrate 
some of the pleasures of home life in his new work, "Dancing in Her Sleep," 
commissioned for Pacific Serenades and given its world premiere on this 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly a piano quintet, but actually a miniconcerto or suite written with 
Phelps, principal violist of the New York Philharmonic, in mind, "Dancing" 
describes in six brief movements the nighttime twitterings and gyrations of the 
composer's sleeping baby daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The work makes its points gently and amusingly. Even when, as in the 
Fantasy-Caprice and Tarantella movements, the musical rhetoric gets more jagged 
and heated (though still accessible), the viola's lyrical flights -- mellow, 
nocturnal, Bartokian -- are never far away. Phelps delivered the work, 
fittingly, with warm elegance and effortless virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 The same quintet -- violins Margaret Batjer and Connie Kupka, cellist David 
Speltz, pianist Ayke Argus and Phelps -- got together after intermission for a 
poised yet dramatic reading of Brahms' Piano Quintet, Opus 34. Tautly executed 
and disciplined, the performance benefited from some especially subtle and 
sensitive playing by Argus and an intensity level that rose as the work 
proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Batjer and Phelps teamed to open the concert with Mozart's outwardly simple, 
inwardly sophisticated Duo, K. 423, in a reading of equal parts finesse and 
boldness.TIMOTHY MANGAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; PETER WOLF: STILL WIRED, IF A LITTLE TIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One can't quite picture Peter Wolf on a NordicTrac. Thin as a rail, scraggly 
black hair, pallid complexion, tiger-print shoes: No, this is the sort of 
fellow who, one senses, only stays in trim at the spotlight gym -- leaping, 
dancing, gyrating, pole-vaulting off a microphone stand, pumping glass in the 
form of a Cuervo bottle onstage night after night. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's understandable if Sunday night, after a 10-year hiatus from touring, 
the former J. Geils Band front man wasn't in peak condition. At the Coach 
House, the 46-year old singer still had the manic 
tobacco-auctioneer-cum-disc-jockey spiel, still had the post-Jagger dance 
moves, and still had the distinctive band saw of a voice, but all were in 
somewhat diminished quantity when compared to his efforts of the '70s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he easily was one of the best showmen in rock, bright but funky, 
commanding the stage with an abandoned kinetics and shouting soulfully through 
a decade when soul was in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps time is catching up with him; perhaps he'd blown himself out playing a 
party at Hollywood's House of Blues the evening previous; perhaps, as other 
aging stars have learned, he does need that exercise machine to keep up. In any 
event, percentages have caught up a bit with the man who once claimed to give 
110% of himself every night. 
</P>
<P>
 That's no great fault. Even at 90%, Wolf was giving more on Sunday than most 
performers bother to. It's just that in his case, he needs to push his meter 
into the red to really work properly. In his days with the Geils band, it was a 
wonder the way he'd overdrive his voice for hours a night, but it also, 
evidently, was a necessity: On the occasions Sunday when he didn't abuse his 
larynx, his voice sounded thin and blanched. 
</P>
<P>
 He might not have been in peak condition, but he certainly went the distance, 
performing for more than 2 1/4 hours. He and his new band, the Houseparty 5, 
covered all the bases, including the Geils band's hit and signature tunes, a 
respectable number of Wolf's own songs, a few unreleased numbers and a John Lee 
Hooker blues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he wasn't quite able to keep up with it, Wolf set a killer pace, 
driving from one song right into the next. Among the highlights along the way 
was the 1973 Geils tune "Give It to Me" (written, like most of the band's 
songs, by Wolf and keyboard player Seth Justman); it had much of the crowd up 
and dancing to its chunky, citified reggae pulse. The Geils arrangements of the 
Strangeloves' classic stomper "Night Time" and the Valentinos' "Looking for a 
Love" also caught Wolf at his howling finest. 
</P>
<P>
 Other old tunes included "Detroit Breakdown," "Must of Got Lost," "Love 
Stinks," the breakthrough hits "Freeze-Frame" and "Centerfold," and 
"Houseparty," which closed out the second encore of generous 27-song set. 
</P>
<P>
 Songs from Wolf's three post-Geils albums, spanning from 1984 to 1990, 
included "99 Worlds," "Go Wild," the ballad "Blue Avenue," "When Women Are 
Lonely" and the fratricidal "Run Silent, Run Deep." The only number that 
matched the spunk of his old outfit's, though, was the as-yet-unreleased "Romeo 
Is Dead, and Miss Juliet, She's Still Dyin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Wolf's flagging stamina, the other eventually wearying element of 
the show was his quintet. All are fine, hard-rocking players, especially drum 
dynamo Dave Stefanelli, but they lacked the personality and depth to remain 
engaging over so long a show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Geils guys might have played arena rock, but like ZZ Top, they also were 
well versed in traditional blues and R&B styles, and it colored their playing. 
Wolf's new musicians lacked that depth, as was painfully evident when they 
attempted Hooker's "Serve You Right to Suffer." Wolf prefaced the song by 
recalling how much he worshiped the boogie progenitor, and he recommended that 
fans check out Hooker's stark, powerful early solo work. And then the band flew 
entirely in the face of that, with an over-amped, overwrought parody of the 
blues, as if the audience deserved to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to be a rare show these days in which the opening act isn't something 
of an ordeal as well. Barrelhouse was a delightful exception. These guys from 
Seal Beach aim high -- at the electrifying sound of Memphis' Stax label artists 
-- and they don't fall embarrassingly short of their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike nearly every post-Commitments soul band, the musicians didn't overplay 
or show off but, instead, laid down a solid backing for singer Steave Ascasio. 
Since its self-released cassette "Blues on 10th 'n' Central," the group has 
added keyboards and horns, achieving the rich, warm sound of the Southern soul 
outfits. Such music either stands or falls with its singer, and Ascasio has a 
great set of pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrelhouse's seven songs all were solidly crafted originals, ranging from 
stage-burners of the Otis Redding "I Can't Turn You Loose" school to such soul 
ballads as the recently penned "Misery." 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamics and dramatics seemed a bit calculated in places, rather than 
emotionally necessary, but generally they held together, and Ascasio needs only 
a bit more abandon and experience in his singing to become headlining material.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ISAAC HAYES REHASHES THE OLD AT HIP NEW HOUSE OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his sex-drenched, foghorn voice, Isaac Hayes -- the 
singer-songwriter-producer best known for the "Theme From Shaft" -- was the 
Barry White of the early '70s. Decked out in chain shirts and shades, he played 
the supercool stud as he remade sappy hits such as "By the Time I Get to 
Phoenix" in an achingly slow, smoldering soul style. 
</P>
<P>
 These days Hayes is trading on the considerable nostalgia value of such oldies 
as "Don't Let Go" and "Never Can Say Goodbye." On Sunday Hayes, starring in the 
first public show at the new House of Blues club on the Sunset Strip, came on 
like a lounge act. Wearing a silly, glittery outfit and supported by a small 
band and three female singers, Hayes was well-received by the audience, but his 
big problem -- a lack of vocal range -- hasn't improved with age. 
</P>
<P>
 As a place to see a show, the House of Blues is mostly OK. If you happen to be 
sitting on the floor just in front of the stage, the sound is fine. At this 
packed show, the sound was just fair in other parts of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see fairly well from most places on the showroom level, though when 
it's crowded, the constant parade of people makes it tough to concentrate on 
the show. Right now the House of Blues is the hip new place in town, so many 
customers are more interested in checking out the place -- and being seen there 
-- than listening to music. DENNIS HUNT

TV REVIEW; THE STRUGGLE FOR A WOUNDED RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The history of Russia -- especially the most recent chapters starring 
communist Mikhail Gorbachev, reformer Boris Yeltsin and nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky -- is too complex to be summed up in a thought. But on the 
intensive two-hour "Frontline" report, "The Struggle for Russia," former 
Yeltsin press secretary Pavel Voshchanov, really does sum up what looks to the 
outside like a peculiar Russian drive for self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia," he says, "by nature or maybe by its communist experience, has a 
tendency toward maximalism -- it's not used to an evolutionary way of 
development. Our entire political mentality has been trained for constant 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Sherry Jones lucidly maps out the battle royal that has plagued 
Russia since the waning days of the old U.S.S.R. and Gorbachev's perestroika . 
(How charming that term now sounds.) From 1987 to the present, Yeltsin has 
stood at the center of the storm, either as the leader of democratic reform and 
revolution against the old Soviet regime, or as an increasingly besieged 
president of a chaotic nation-in-the-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Struggle for Russia," however, does not include any mention of Yeltsin's 
new book, a frank diary describing his deep despair during the violent October, 
1993, uprising by nationalist parliamentary officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, this blow-by-blow account probably needs no more despair; it is a 
kind of video autopsy of a dead empire and possibly dead national ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' report posits that the central struggle was between Gorbachev, overcome 
by the very kind of reforms he had long been promising, and Yeltsin, former 
party man and self-styled democrat who eventually dismantled both the U.S.S.R. 
and the subsequent Confederation of Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
 But what this story actually reveals is a country playing out a media-informed 
game of free-form capitalism without the cultural tradition to make democratic 
capitalism actually work. The popular face of new Russian enterprise may be 
McDonald's on the New Arbat, but the real face belongs to the young nightclub 
owner who looks into the camera and openly praises the reliability of the 
"protection" provided by the Russian Mafia while dismissing the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Struggle for Russia" skillfully balances the view from the street -- even 
the public bathhouse -- and from the parliamentary hallway, each increasingly 
resembling the other as forces for a romanticized past vie with forces for an 
undefined future. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle is a figure like Yegor Gaidar, architect of the "shock 
therapy" plan of privatization and the lifting of price controls. Prodded by 
Western nations to adopt extreme measures, Gaidar and Yeltsin had to face the 
ire of kopek-less voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the very idea of facing voters is still an alien concept, and for the 
voters the easy answer may lie with a demagogue like Zhirinovsky. The former 
closed society has become a giant gaping wound. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Struggle for Russia" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8 on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

 Treasury Bill Rates Up: The Treasury Department sold $11.4 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4%, up from 3.85% last week. 
Another $11.5 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 4.41%, up from 4.25%.The three-month bill rate was the highest since 
they sold for 4.08% on March 30, 1992. The six-month bill rate was the highest 
since they averaged 4.5% on Nov. 25, 1991. The new discount rates understate 
the actual return to investors -- 4.1% for three-month bills with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,898.90, and 4.57% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,777.10. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND KATHRYN HARRIS: COMPANY TOWN; VIACOM-BLOCKBUSTER DEAL 
NEAR DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on whom you believe, Viacom Inc.'s planned merger with Blockbuster 
Entertainment is now clinically dead, or so comatose that both sides have 
summoned the parish priest. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with the companies say discussions have moved in recent days 
from what can be done to save the deal to how to best dispose of its remains. 
Barring some resurrection of biblical magnitude, sources expect a formal 
announcement of the deal's demise within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 That complicates life for both companies, which agreed to wed earlier this 
year in support of Viacom's $10-billion acquisition of Paramount 
Communications. Without access to Blockbuster's $550 million in annual cash 
flow, Viacom will have a tougher time paying down its Paramount debt. 
Blockbuster, meanwhile, may have to find another new technology ally. 
</P>
<P>
 While both companies declined comment on the reports Monday, Viacom is 
expected to formally announce today that it is putting Madison Square Garden 
and its two professional sports teams -- basketball's New York Knicks and ice 
hockey's New York Rangers -- on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say Viacom expects to receive $1 billion or more for the Garden, the 
teams and the cable network that carries their games. Those same sources insist 
that the sale would have taken place regardless of the Blockbuster merger's 
status because the $30 million in annual cash flow they are said to generate is 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen & Co. will handle the sale for Viacom. That's an interesting turn of 
events because the New York investment banking firm represented rival QVC 
Network in the prolonged battle for Paramount. The plum assignment, however, is 
clearly intended to restore the relationship between the two companies. "War is 
over; peace is here," one Viacom insider said Monday. "There's nothing to be 
gained by being vengeful or retaliatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say there are plenty of companies interested in the Garden and the 
teams. Among the prospective bidders are Blockbuster, Cablevision Systems 
Corp., a group tied to the New York Yankees' George Steinbrenner and 
Tele-Communications' affiliate Liberty Media Corp., which already holds stakes 
in a number of regional sports networks. Liberty wants the network but would 
seek a buyer for the Garden and the teams, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster and Viacom have considered the possibility of swapping Madison 
Square Garden for some of Viacom's securities issued to Blockbuster earlier 
this year in a $1.85-billion transaction. But the depressed price of Viacom's 
shares would make it difficult for the two sides to unwind that deal -- just as 
it has made it difficult to proceed with the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent sign that the proposed marriage was in trouble came last week, 
when Viacom and Blockbuster missed a Tuesday deadline to mail proxy materials 
to shareholders for a vote on May 24. The companies have until Sept. 30 to 
complete the merger. But knowledgeable sources expect the deal to be abandoned 
much sooner because the downward spiral of Viacom's stock has cooled 
Blockbuster shareholders to the agreement, and Viacom is unwilling to sweeten 
the terms.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Viacom A stock added 62.5 cents to close at $25.625 Monday on the 
American Stock Exchange, and the B stock inched up 25 cents to $22.75, its 
shares have fallen to new 52-week lows since the Paramount deal was closed and 
are hovering just above those lows now. Blockbuster shares fell 62.5 cents to 
$26.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, after jumping $2.50 to $27.125 last 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster's gains were spurred by reports in Business Week that it might 
have a new suitor waiting in the wings, such as Walt Disney Co. or one of the 
regional telephone companies. But sources on Monday said there's no hard 
evidence that such a deal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of the Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles said 
Monday that acquiring Blockbuster makes sense for many companies because it's 
"obviously an important player in the filmed entertainment industrial complex." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida-based Blockbuster has recently moved into music retailing, movie 
production and other business areas. But Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga remains 
under pressure to further diversify beyond the company's core video rental 
business, since pay-per-vew is expected to eventually cannibalize the video

 Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone, meanwhile, is said to be considering the sale 
of other significant Paramount assets to pare down the nearly $8 billion in 
debt incurred in the acquisition. Sources say that one possibility is the sale 
of all or part of Paramount Publishing, which includes Simon & Schuster, 
although others have denied that.

 Paramount scores production deal: With several studios bidding for their 
services, Michael Douglas and Steven Reuther have decided to hang their shingle 
at Paramount Pictures. In a deal announced Monday, Douglas/Reuther Productions 
will deliver at least 12 movies to Paramount over the next four years. 
Competition for Douglas and Reuther was fierce, both for their former track 
records and their ability to bring independent financing to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the Paramount deal, Douglas and Reuther will have autonomy 
over what films are made. Douglas is also expected to star in some of the 
films.

DEALS: COMPANY TOWN

<TEXT>

 Music: International Creative Management on Monday announced that it has 
acquired Twin Towers Touring, a New York-based music agency that represents 
such cutting-edge acts as the Lemonheads, Dinosaur Jr., Mudhoney, the Dead 
Milkmen and Redd Kross, for an undisclosed sum. The deal, which has been in the 
works for several months, expands ICM's music roster and puts it in business 
with a company known for cultivating hot young bands.Bill Elson, who heads 
ICM's music division, called Twin Towers the "pre-eminent independent agency" 
of its kind in the business. At Twin Towers, executives put out a 
tongue-in-cheek statement that began: "Yes, it is true. We sold out." The 
company then invited clients to "give us a good swift kick in the pants or 
scream bloody murder into the phone" if the deal causes them to become 
arrogant. Elson said Twin Towers will operate as a free-standing company and 
remain at its current address for the foreseeable future. The company consists 
of only four people, but has a wide berth in the alternative music business. 
ICM, one of the industry's leading talent agencies, represents music acts such 
as Robert Plant, the Black Crowes and SWV.

OCCUPIED TERRITORY; HOMELESS ADVOCATES SEEK TO MAKE POINT WITH U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Johnson arrived at the boarded-up duplex on West 17th Place with only 
the layered clothes on his back and a bag he stitched together, stuffed with 
notebooks of poetry he has written about his life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, it's good to have a place where I can open up the door and say, 'I'm 
home,' " Johnson said, throwing his bag down on the stained linoleum floor. 
</P>
<P>
 How long the duplex remains his home depends entirely on the generosity of the 
landlord: the U.S. government. With the help of homeless advocates, Johnson and 
three other transients took some bolt cutters to the place in Los Angeles' 
Pico-Union district and illegally moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 The break-in was part of a statewide effort Monday to force the federal 
government to turn over abandoned government-owned buildings to the homeless, 
as required by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an act of civil disobedience," said Rob Leonard, a member of the 
California Homeless Network, which organized the Los Angeles break-in. "Yes, we 
are trespassing on federal property, and that's a crime. But it's also a crime 
that these buildings are left vacant." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about a dozen structures owned by the federal government were 
simultaneously taken over by the homeless coalition from Long Beach to San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles duplex has been owned by the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development for the past six months in a neighborhood with some of the city's 
most entrenched social problems, including drugs and gangs. The coalition chose 
this particular abandoned property -- surrounded by a chain-link fence with a 
single red rose bush on the front lawn -- because of its proximity to the HUD 
office, where organizers first staged a rally and news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 While advocates tacked up signs urging HUD to "cut the red tape," some nearby 
residents expressed anger over their new neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want those bums in my neighborhood," said William Schuessler, who 
lives across the street and was watching the well-attended event. "Tell them to 
get a job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before noon, as the crowd thinned, the new tenants relaxed on several 
donated couches and beds, waiting for HUD officials to react. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Ming, area coordinator for HUD's Los Angeles office, said he will meet 
with the squatters today to try to persuade them to leave. If they refuse, he 
said he will go to court to force them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you do if someone took over your home illegally?" Ming said. "I'm 
disappointed that the homeless people feel that it was necessary to take over a 
HUD home when we've got a program where we make these homes available to them. 
There are normal channels there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leonard said he and other homeless advocates became tired of negotiating 
for access to the government residences, which include about 50 homes and 
apartments in the Los Angeles area. As part of HUD's arduous applications 
process, homeless advocates must prove that they have the personnel and the 
funding to run a group home -- a difficult requirement for many small 
organizations to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked and talked and talked to HUD," Leonard said, whose group has yet 
to qualify for a house under HUD's criteria. "Our strength in these 
negotiations will be that we have occupied the duplex." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said three network members plan to stay at the 17th Place duplex with 
the homeless residents until the dispute with HUD is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll start up a 24-hour watch, so there will always be someone awake in each 
of the units to make sure everything is OK," Leonard said. "We'll be ready if 
and when the police come." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said even if the group is thrown out: "At least we have made our 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 He said group members have been planning the takeover for several months. 
Using names provided by area homeless advocacy organizations, they chose 
Johnson and three other homeless people -- two men and a woman -- from a group 
of 15 to participate in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said he wanted to make sure squatters had no previous convictions 
before asking them to break the law. "We were concerned about the 
three-strikes-you're-out law," he said. "Our people are all clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has been living in parks in Downtown Los Angeles, said he was 
glad to have a place to stay, even if it's only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his fellow squatters, Robert Furney -- who has spent time on the 
streets in Santa Monica -- added: "I've lived in storm drains, I've lived in 
bushes. It's nice to have a roof over my head."

FINAL DEFENDANT IN DENNY CASE CONVICTED ON 2 OF 5 CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last criminal defendant in the Reginald O. Denny beating case was 
acquitted Monday of two of the five charges against him, and a jury deadlocked 
on a third. 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors convicted Lance Parker, 28, of one felony and one misdemeanor 
vandalism charge after hearing two weeks of testimony and deliberating for 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, a dispatcher for a messenger service, faces a maximum three-year, 
six-month term when he is sentenced May 12. He could have been sentenced to 
almost 10 years in prison if he had been convicted of all five charges. 
</P>
<P>
 When the verdicts were read, Parker bowed his head and wept. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been accused of two counts of shooting at a vehicle, one count of 
assault with a deadly weapon and two counts of discharging a firearm with gross 
negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution had contended that he fired a shotgun at Denny's truck, 
endangering Denny and others; fired the weapon at a passing car, assaulting the 
never-identified driver, and fired at gas pumps at a nearby gas station, 
endangering people nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews outside the courtroom, jurors said they agreed with the 
prosecution that Parker was the man who rode a motorcycle at the intersection 
of Florence and Normandie avenues in the first hours of the Los Angeles riots 
on April 29, 1992. They also said they believed he was the person who fired at 
Denny's truck and at the gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they did not believe, however, that Parker fired his gun at the 
passing car or that he had put anybody but himself in danger with his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors said they discounted the testimony of Bob Tur, a television 
helicopter pilot who said he was in his aircraft 150 feet above the 
intersection when he saw Parker firing the shotgun at the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors said they also discounted the testimony of Henry Keith Watson, a 
former defendant in Denny's beating, who was convicted of two misdemeanors 
during a highly publicized trial last year and sentenced to five years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson denied a contention by the prosecution that he had told authorities a 
week before Parker's trial that Parker was the man with the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators had testified that Watson originally put them on Parker's 
trail when he told them that the man with the shotgun played on a local semipro 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the team roster, police were narrowing down the possible suspects when 
they got an anonymous tip naming Parker, the officers testified. He was 
arrested in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, he owned a motorcycle similar to the one used in the 
shooting and bore some physical resemblance to fuzzy videotaped pictures of the 
man wielding the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parker's lawyer, Chokwe Lumumba, maintained outside the courtroom Monday 
that his client is innocent of all the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumumba said, however, that he was satisfied that the jury had not bought much 
of the prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin McCormick expressed disappointment with the verdicts, 
but said he was gratified that the jury had not accepted the defense's 
contention that Parker had been railroaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's was the last of six criminal cases that grew out of the attacks on 
Denny and other motorists at Florence and Normandie. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other felony charges alleging that Parker was trying to set fire to 
Denny's truck when he fired at it were dismissed in earlier court proceedings. 
Those dismissals are being appealed by the prosecution.

RIORDAN'S REVAMP PLAN HITS TROUBLE; GOVERNMENT: SOME COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY 
CONSOLIDATING DEPARTMENTS COULD HURT PROGRAMS ON WOMEN'S ISSUES, POLLUTION 
CLEANUP AND HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's proposal for a sweeping reorganization of 
the city's bureaucracy ran afoul of two City Council committees Monday, with 
lawmakers saying that departmental consolidations could damage programs that 
promote low-income housing, women's rights and cleanup of Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's plan to double funding for a church-based anti-gang program also 
appeared to be in some danger, as several council members said they will not 
increase support for the fledgling Hope in Youth organization while more proven 
programs are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments Monday represented the first substantial setbacks for 
Riordan's $4.3-billion spending plan, which the full City Council must consider 
by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan made "reinventing government" a centerpiece of his campaign and 
proposed last month the elimination of the full-time board that oversees public 
works programs, as well as the creation of new super-agencies for social 
programs and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 But after all those plans came under fire Monday, Riordan insisted that he is 
willing to compromise and that the growing council opposition "is not a giant 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's aides predicted that Riordan can still win some of the votes when 
the budget comes before the full City Council later this month. But even if 
Riordan's reorganizations do not succeed, his central plan for beefing up the 
Police Department will remain intact, Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer was quick to 
predict. 
</P>
<P>
 "These other issues around the periphery haven't changed that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble for the Riordan plan began immediately at Monday afternoon's meeting 
of the council's Budget and Finance Committee. A contingent of about 30 women 
came to City Hall to oppose the mayor's proposal to consolidate the Commission 
on the Status of Women with five other social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from several women's rights organizations said the new 
Community Services Department would not assure the same level of attention to 
women's issues. They complained that fewer women employees would come forward 
with complaints of sexual harassment if the commission were subservient to a 
larger agency. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman told the committee that she had been directed to a shelter and saved 
from a husband who nearly killed her by throwing her through a plate glass 
window. "I would have been just another statistic if it weren't for the 
commission," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan aides said that under the reorganization the commission would retain 
its separate identity and that $2.2 million would be saved by having payroll, 
accounting and other functions consolidated for the small departments. That 
money could go back into programs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council budget committee recommended 3 to 0 that the women's 
commission be kept independent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next before the committee were defenders of the full-time board that currently 
runs the city's public-works programs. They said the Board of Public Works has 
helped improve the city's sewer system, reducing the pollutants dumped from 
sewers into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gold, staff scientist for Heal the Bay, said the board in recent years 
has created an "environmental ethic" that helped push ahead the renovation of 
the city's antiquated sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also questioned whether the anticipated $1.5 million saving 
from eliminating the board is worth the doubts about what would replace it. 
Riordan had argued that a single department head could be held more accountable 
and would be less susceptible to political pressure and lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members Ruth Galanter and Richard Alatorre recommended against the 
elimination of the board, while Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as those proposals were suffering initial defeats, Riordan was facing 
another group of council members with his plan to create a single Citywide 
Development Agency to bring together economic development programs now diffused 
in at least three agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing him were the skeptical members of two City Council committees that 
focus on housing -- Community Redevelopment and Economic Development. 
</P>
<P>
 The four city lawmakers noted that it was the City Council that had suggested 
focusing the city's economic development efforts in a single super-agency. But 
they said Riordan's rush to embrace the proposal and include it in the budget 
left too many questions unanswered -- particularly how workers with divergent 
pay scales and retirement plans can be brought into a single department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and other committee members said they also are 
likely to oppose the plan to include the city's Housing Department in the new 
Citywide Development Agency, saying it would be lost in the larger body. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (Riordan) set out to do was entirely too ambitious and not thought 
through sufficiently," Ridley-Thomas said. "This economic development question 
is entirely too important to rush. We cannot afford to blow it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the joint committees are not expected to vote until next week, the 
council members signaled Monday that they would like the consolidation 
considered separately from the budget and that they want a separate city 
Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Riordan's longest budget day, council members also sharply 
questioned his plan to double spending to $5 million for the Hope in Youth 
anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked why the program, initiated by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and other

agencies for scarce funding. And they said they are concerned that the city has 
been asked to pay more while Los Angeles County's proposed contribution remains 
the same.

NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS DISMANTLING BEGINS; EX-TENANTS DENIED ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The whine of chain saws in the early morning fog Monday marked the start of an 
autopsy on Northridge Meadows, where 16 tenants died in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, sections of the roof had been cut away to reveal the guts of the 
building, and half a dozen lawyers were arguing their cases at a sidewalk news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Former tenants, many from pancaked first-floor units, came to retrieve their 
belongings and were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the place where his mother died -- the exposed mattress, the broken 
walls, the painted letters DB, for dead body -- Bill Runnings felt sick to his 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 So began the dismantling of Northridge Meadows, the scene of the largest 
concentration of earthquake fatalities from the Northridge quake and Exhibit A 
in seven wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want some answer to why this thing happened, so we can move on," said 
Runnings, 28, a roofer from Phoenix. He said he was supposed to visit his 
mother, Karol Runnings, the night she was killed in a quake so powerful that it 
drove her bed through the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take months or years of testing and study before experts can deliver 
those answers. Even then, a jury probably will have to decide the central 
issue: whether the collapse of Northridge Meadows was caused by the 
6.8-magnitude earthquake, the construction or some combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Runnings said, respect has drawn him to his mother's shattered 
apartment, where the bed juts out, exposed to the elements. The family 
photographs are in a box in the closet, still underneath something. His lawyer, 
Jeffrey Behar, was there to assure that when the time comes, Runnings and his 
sister, Julie Tindall, 29, will be able to get inside apartment 108. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four months after the quake, Tindall said, "it bothers us to know her 
stuff is everywhere, and possibly the rats and maggots are getting to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other former residents were told they must hire attorneys to get inside this 
week while the experts gather evidence. Later, tenants who hire salvage crews 
can clear out apartments before the city puts the wrecker's ball to Northridge 
Meadows, probably about May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers, other experts and lawyers -- about 20 in all, according to one 
estimate -- flocked to 9565 Reseda Blvd. for the court-ordered controlled 
demolition. The 164-unit building will be taken apart, piece by piece at times, 
so experts can test and study it to determine whether construction defects 
caused or contributed to the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be looking at the building's connections and supports as well as 
shear walls and other seismic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers started at the top, cutting away several sections of the roof. 
At that pace, it could take at least a week before the critical evidence in the 
40 flattened first-floor apartments is uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Joel Castro, who represents relatives of two women who died, told 
reporters that his engineers had found evidence of another structural defect: 
The third-floor shear walls were not fastened to the roof. Castro maintains 
that the fasteners were required by building codes, and says they distribute 
seismic forces that play on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen Tharpe, attorney for owner Shasikant Jogani, said there was no 
evidence that the latest alleged defect had caused or contributed to the 
collapse. "After all, the roof didn't collapse," Tharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro earlier had alleged other defects: that support pipes in the parking 
structures were too thin, weaker nails were found where stronger nails were 
specified in the building plans, joist hangers were smaller than those 
specified, and floors were supported insufficiently with diagonal strips rather 
than plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Tharpe was encouraged by his experts' "find": a long board with nails 
jutting out. It was evidence to Tharpe that the vertical forces of the quake 
had picked the building up and put it down eight feet to the north. The nails, 
he noted, were straight, indicating that powerful vertical forces were at play, 
not just lateral forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro also alleged for the first time that Northridge Meadows was not built 
to code. As an example, he contended that the tuck-in parking slots were 35 
feet deep -- 10 feet deeper than the 1970 building codes allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tharpe and attorneys for builder Brian Heller disputed that contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Mower, Heller's lawyer, maintained that the complex was built to code. 
Tharpe said Jogani believed that Northridge Meadows was built to code when he 
bought it from Heller in 1981, about 10 years after it was constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tharpe said, California law holds Jogani, and other landlords, liable 
for damages when people are killed or injured in their buildings. The legal 
principle is known as "strict liability," and California is one of just a 
handful of states to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani has filed a countersuit against Heller's construction company, which in 
turn is likely to sue its subcontractors. In 1991, Jogani was listed as one of 
Los Angeles' largest residential landlords, with holdings worth $385 million. 
He held liability insurance on Northridge Meadows, but no quake insurance. He 
says the quake and recession have claimed his equity in all his properties.

THE SHOW MUST GO ON, FIESTA OFFICIALS SAY; VIOLENCE: DESPITE GANG SKIRMISHES

<P>
 In the wake of disturbances that forced the early closing of Fiesta Broadway 
stages, organizers and city officials said Monday that they would not allow 
gang members to end an event that attracted more than 500,000 people Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defining question for the city of Los Angeles is, how much longer can our 
events be held hostage by gang members?" asked Estela Lopez, executive director 
of festival co-sponsor Miracle on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that the violence Sunday had "brought into question the 
viability" of such events, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre on 
Monday said he strongly believes that the event must go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot tolerate and allow an insignificant number of people to ruin an 
event like this," the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Castro, president of El Dorado Communications, said: "I think there's no 
question we can host these events safely. The only alternative is we all live 
in our houses behind bars and never see each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to play it safe, don't have the event," said Castro, whose 
company owns radio station KMQA-FM (La Maquina), one of the festival's 
sponsors. "But if you want to play it safe, don't get in your car. Somebody 
could run into you, shoot you." 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual Fiesta Broadway, the nation's largest Cinco de Mayo 
celebration, drew crowds that made some streets in the 36-block festival area 
nearly impassable. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was made up overwhelmingly of families and young people out to enjoy 
top-name Latino entertainers in a festival atmosphere. Thousands of young 
couples brought children, and police said there were no signs of trouble until 
about 300 gang members began to congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence erupted at 4th and Spring streets when radio station KPWR-FM (Power 
106) closed its stage after fire and police officials told the station that the 
crowd had grown too large to control. The station, which was making its first 
appearance at the festival, shut its stage at 2:45 p.m. as singer Stevie B. was 
scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members in the crowd, estimated at up to 10,000, began throwing rocks and 
bottles at the stage and at officers, police said. Officers, some in riot gear, 
fired rubber bullets and beanbag-like projectiles from 12-gauge shotguns into 
knots of troublemakers and began clearing streets of hundreds of thousands of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking 30 guys" who started the trouble, said Paul Sansone, KPWR's 
marketing director. "It's very frustrating. A very small element ruined the 
chance for thousands to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 18 people were injured, apparently none seriously. Police said 14 
people were arrested, most for failing to comply with an order to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansone said the crowd near his station's stage was larger than the area could 
safely hold, and shortly after 1:30 p.m. station staffers began to notice that 
gang members were flashing hand signs at one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two distinct groups, about 30, near our stage," Sansone said. When 
the stage was closed, he said, "The stage was bombarded by 40-ounce beer 
bottles, cans and other objects." 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizers assured the station that no alcohol would be sold by vendors, 
Sansone said. That ban was enforced, but liquor stores in the festival area 
were open for business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have young people on a hot day, you don't want alcohol," Sansone 
said. "That's like matches and dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre said he would favor new safeguards for next year, such as banning the 
sale of alcohol at stores inside the festival area. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Michael R. Hillmann, who commanded 72 officers at 4th and Spring, 
said police and festival organizers recognized two weeks ago that crowd control 
could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 By 11:30 a.m. Sunday, Hillman said, "there was a very, very large number of 
people, and a very large number of gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 When fighting broke out about three hours later, Hillman said he felt "some of 
the gang members were provoking a stampede. I had my squads break out into a 
line and move north on Spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my officers to be very discriminating with the use of the rubber 
projectiles to avoid women and children. And over the next 30 to 40 minutes, 
before the dispersal was complete, we fired a total of 32 37-millimeter foam 
rubber baton rounds. We were shooting in front of the crowd, and there were 
very few women and children in our path. Most were gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Hillman said, "It was a riot. We had a riot situation at 4th 
and Spring." 
</P>
<P>
 South of Spring Street, however, stages remained opened until nearly 5 p.m., 
and one continued until the festival's scheduled 6 p.m. closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said his station's stage at 11th and Hill streets was "completely 
unaffected" by the violence. "South of 6th Street, you would never know 
anything happened down there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some police gang experts did not believe that the gangs arrived looking for 
trouble. If anything, the fact that so many rivals were willing to rub 
shoulders is a testament to the efforts of the Mexican Mafia prison gang in 
unifying thousands of Southern California street gang members, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys feel comfortable walking on the streets now because they know 
they're not going to get shot," said LAPD Detective Terry Wessel of the Rampart 
Division's anti-gang CRASH unit. "Six months ago, you would have had dead 
bodies there." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone entering the festival's gated entrances was searched by private 
security guards. Most men coming through the gates were frisked and asked to 
reveal the interiors of their baseball caps, one festival-goer said. Purses, 
even tote bags for infants, were inspected. Alcohol, weapons and food were 
confiscated, he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CHARGES 
AGAINST NICHOLSON IN CAR SMASHING DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Monday dismissed misdemeanor assault and vandalism charges against 
actor Jack Nicholson, who had been accused of smashing a motorist's windshield 
with a golf club. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the objections of prosecutors, Municipal Judge Martin Suits ruled at a 
hearing that the victim's complaint had been laid to rest by a civil settlement 
reached with Nicholson in March and that a criminal case was unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Blank, 38, alleged that while he was stopped at a traffic light in 
North Hollywood on Feb. 8, Nicholson got out of his car wielding a golf club 
and accused him of cutting him off. The Academy Award-winning actor then 
pounded the roof of Blank's Mercedes-Benz and shattered its windshield, Blank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank had sought unspecified damages from Nicholson, saying the attack had 
caused him to fear for his life and lock himself in his car for safety. The 
terms of the settlement were not disclosed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CLERK'S OFFICE OWED 
MILLIONS, AUDIT FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of dollars in overdue business taxes and fees have not been collected 
because of poor management by the city clerk's office, according to an audit 
released Monday by City Controller Rick Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lack of aggressiveness on the behalf of taxpayers," Tuttle said. 
"Businesses (that don't pay their taxes) are having their police, fire and 
other services subsidized by other taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Business taxes, which do not include sales taxes, account for about $262 
million a year, or roughly 10% of the city's overall budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said lax accounting procedures also expose the city to fraud, although 
no specific cases were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the city clerk's office, which handles $1.46 billion in revenue 
annually, were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit of the city clerk's Tax and Permit Division found that because of 
"major weaknesses" in procedures, nearly $17 million in overdue business taxes 
remain uncollected. About $2.8 million has been written off as unrecoverable. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous controller's report found that more than one-third of businesses 
are not on the city's tax rolls at all, which costs an estimated $66 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit criticized the clerk's office for not even knowing how much money 
was owed the city. The Tax and Permit Division had not compiled a report on its 
accounts receivable, and auditors had to estimate the $17 million through their 
own calculations, according to Deputy Controller Tim Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has moved so slowly to collect some back taxes that the statute of 
limitations has run out. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk's office has failed to prioritize its work so that big accounts 
get collected first, the audit found. Overdue tax bills of a few thousand 
dollars were being pursued while bills of over a $100,000 were being ignored 
until it was too late to legally collect them. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk is also not effectively collecting items such as sewer fees, 
which make up 22% of the revenues the office handles. For example, at least 48 
major sewer customers were not billed for periods as long as nine years, 
costing the city $4.8 million, the audit found. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if these customers are billed, about $1.9 million may not be collectible 
because the statute of limitation has run out, the audit said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: A BRIEF RULING; 
INVENTOR OF GLOWING LINGERIE GETS $175,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles jury got to the bottom of the glow-in-the-dark panties 
controversy Monday, leaving a local garment manufacturer $175,000 lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Phosphorescent lingerie inventor Mark Graham was awarded compensatory damages 
from underwear maker Joe Hara as jurors ruled that Hara had stolen Graham's 
idea for glowing bras and bustiers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Superior Court panel paused only briefly before refusing to award 
punitive damages to Graham -- now a 41-year-old Nashville songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts came after a two-week trial, during which Judge Lillian Stevens 
repeatedly ordered courtroom lights turned off so a parade of frilly lingerie 
could be shown. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, sixth-graders who wandered into the courtroom on a field trip 
giggled as glowing panties were displayed. Another time, Graham's lawyer, 
Lawrence S. Cohen, drew laughs from the jury as he held a glowing teddy 
upside-down and then crashed into the courtroom blackboard as he groped for the 
light switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hara's attorney, Richard Levy, said the judgment virtually wipes out Hara's 
6-year-old company, which produces the Desiree line of lingerie. It employs two 
dozen workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a very big precedent in the fashion industry," said Hara, 
41. He warned that other novice designers will think they invented a certain 
style and then claim exclusive rights to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said he thought up his luminous lingerie idea in 1991 and asked Hara to 
manufacture it for him. But he said Hara backed out -- only to begin producing 
his own glowing apparel the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hara contended that he started selling his own phosphorescent lingerie only 
after Graham backed out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham said the episode has left him with a less-than-glowing appreciation of 
the garment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still interested in selling these," he said. "But maybe I'm not cut out 
for this business." BOB POOL

PANEL ENDS VOTING RULES THAT FAVOR TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leadership council at a Boyle Heights elementary school has agreed to 
abolish a voting system in which teacher ballots counted for 6.32 votes and 
parents counted for one but has not decided on an alternative procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The willingness of Euclid Avenue Elementary School teachers and staff to 
abandon the so-called "ratio of equality" system came as a number of parent 
organizations in the Los Angeles Unified School District joined forces with a 
vocal group of Euclid parents to denounce the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, supported by the PTA and others, on Monday demanded a return to the 
one-person, one-vote arrangement used during the election to decide on a new 
school calendar.

<P>
 One of the first California condors introduced into the wild in early 1992 is 
back at the Los Angeles Zoo after being captured to protect her from bad 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-year-old Xewe had been sitting on power lines, a behavior that 
electrocuted two other members of the endangered species.A third died by 
hitting a power pole and a fourth by drinking antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Xewe was captured Thursday in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary area in Ventura 
County and placed in quarantine for 30 days at the Los Angeles Zoo, officials 
said Monday. If she is found to be healthy, she will be moved into a zoo aviary 
with three other female condors that were recaptured. Five other condors were 
reported to be doing well in the remote Lion Canyon area of Santa Barbara 
County.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WITNESS 
HEDGES CRITICISM OF OFFICERS WHO BEAT KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Police Department training officer testified Monday that 
although much of the force officers used on Rodney G. King was unreasonable, it 
violated "administrative policy only." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mark Conta told the jury hearing King's damage lawsuit that there was 
nothing malicious or criminal in the behavior and that he could not judge the 
behavior of officers who failed to intervene and stop the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be unfair for me to judge them because of their different 
perceptions," Conta said. "It depends on where you're standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Conta was a key government witness in last year's federal prosecution of four 
officers accused of violating King's civil rights. He had resisted testifying 
in King's federal court lawsuit, citing psychological stress.

 A former Santa Ana police officer convicted of extorting money from a liquor 
store owner was sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to two 
years probation.  
</P>
<P>
 Sang H. Masog, 36, demanded $2,500 from the Santa Ana liquor store owner in 
July, 1992, to intercede on the merchant's behalf with the state Alcoholic 
Beverage Control Department.The payoff was tape recorded by an undercover 
officer.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Masog was being investigated by the FBI and U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles, which had received allegations that he also was 
extorting money from business owners in Koreatown, Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark A. 
Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Masog pleaded guilty last year to "extortion under color of official right," 
which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

ONCOLOGIST FACES ETHICS QUESTIONS OVER RELEASE OF FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westside oncologist, already under scrutiny from the National Cancer 
Institute for discrepancies in data he submitted to a major national breast 
cancer study, is now the target of criticism for an alleged breach of medical 
ethics -- releasing confidential patient files to a Chicago newspaper reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 A top NCI official said Monday that Dr. David Plotkin released the records 
without the permission of his patients. The agency has notified the federal 
Office for Protection From Research Risks -- which monitors scientific research 
and has disciplinary powers -- and an internal review board at Brotman Medical 
Center in Culver City, where Plotkin practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "A patient's medical record is confidential and I think it's very important 
that any of us, when we go to a physician, know that information about our 
health is not made public," said Dr. Bruce Chabner, director of the division of 
cancer treatment at the NCI. "I think this was not ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Plotkin said the doctor had released the files on the 
condition that the reporter would not make the names of patients public -- and 
he did not. "He sought and received a guarantee that no patient confidentiality 
would be breached," said spokesman Larry Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, experts in medical ethics say Plotkin acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should not do it," said Art Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics 
at the University of Pennsylvania. "It is a given that a researcher's 
obligation first and foremost is to protect patient privacy. Information should 
not be revealed, ever, without explicit subject consent or court order." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest development involving Plotkin comes amid a wide-ranging probe into 
data discrepancies -- and, in one case, outright fraud -- in research conducted 
by the nation's oldest and largest breast cancer study group, the National 
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project. The project is responsible for some 
of the most important breast cancer research in the country, including a 
landmark 1985 study that found that lumpectomy -- in which only the cancerous 
tumor is removed -- is as effective as mastectomy, in which the entire breast 
is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group has been tarnished in recent months by revelations that a 
Canadian researcher, Dr. Roger Poisson, had falsified data so that women who 
were ineligible for the lumpectomy study could be included. The NCI says the 
fraud did not change the study's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures prompted the NCI to force the head of the project, noted 
breast cancer researcher Bernard Fisher of the University of Pittsburgh, to 
resign. They have also spurred audits of participating institutions in New York 
and Louisiana, as well as the Memorial Cancer Research Foundation of Southern 
California, a one-doctor center run by Plotkin. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCI has found no evidence that Plotkin committed fraud, although it has 
found deficiencies in his files, including one case in which a woman who died 
after open-heart surgery was reported as being alive. Results of the NCI review 
are likely to be made public later this week, Chabner said. Meanwhile, the 
chief executive officer of Brotman Medical Center, a private 495-bed hospital 
with which Plotkin is affiliated, said the hospital is taking control of 
Plotkin's files at the NCI's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Plotkin contacted the NCI last week to request the review. He told officials 
that a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, John Crewdson, had presented him with 
an internal audit conducted by the NSABP in 1990 that showed serious 
discrepancies in his data. He said he had not known of the 1990 audit but 
allowed Crewdson to look at his files because he believed he had nothing to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg, Plotkin's spokesman, said the doctor feared that his reputation 
would be damaged if he did not permit Crewdson to examine his work. "He was 
scared," Weinberg said. "It was an error." 
</P>
<P>
 Crewdson, meanwhile, was also criticized by the NCI's Chabner for examining 
the records. However, Dick Ciccone, managing editor of the Chicago Tribune, 
said that because the records consisted solely of NSABP enrollment data -- as 
opposed to patient histories and disease prognoses -- the paper does not 
believe there was a breach of confidentiality. But he acknowledged that the 
files included patient names as well as specific information, such as a 
patient's tumor size, that help doctors determine whether women are eligible to 
participate in NSABP studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not, in the classic sense, a violation," Ciccone said. 
</P>
<P>
 What, if any, action might be taken against Plotkin for the alleged breach is 
unclear. The Office for Protection From Research Risks has the power to 
discipline researchers by barring them from receiving federal funding. But 
Plotkin has not participated in the NSABP since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times shortly after Fisher was forced to step down, 
Plotkin defended Fisher, saying it was impossible for the head of the NSABP to 
know what each researcher had done. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Plotkin said he had "markedly decreased" his own involvement 
in the NSABP because he did not like the direction the project was taking. In 
particular, he objected to a current -- and highly controversial -- clinical 
trial in which the NSABP is testing to see whether the drug tamoxifen can be 
used to prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he felt tamoxifen would not be effective and complained that the trial 
was initiated "because of pressure from feminist groups to do more studies on 
women." And he said that, in participating in earlier NSABP research, including 
the lumpectomy study, he felt that he became "a tool of the feminists of Los 
Angeles in bringing about less radical surgery for breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Through his spokesman, Plotkin has declined interviews about the NCI audit.

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD APPROVES EXPANSION OF MAGNET PROGRAM, ADDING 24 SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education voted Monday to expand its popular magnet 
program this fall, opening specialized programs on 24 campuses and adding room 
for 8,000 new students in one of the largest expansions in the program's 
history.  
</P>
<P>
 The expansion proposal had sparked bitter debate among board members when it 
was introduced two weeks ago, because few of the proposed magnets were 
bilingual or in inner-city neighborhoods, and Latino students have long been 
underrepresented in the magnet program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is wrong with our policy," board President Leticia Quezada said 
Monday. "Latinos are being hugely underserved by what we consider the best 
program in the district." Of 37,000 magnet students, 29% are Latino and 4% are 
limited English speakers in a district that is 66% Latino and 44% 
limited-English-speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, district staff recommended the addition of 21 magnets. But in 
reviewing that list, board members expressed dismay that almost half the new 
centers would be in the San Fernando Valley and few were in predominantly 
minority or inner-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, more than 15,000 of the district's 37,000 magnet seats are in the 
Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 To remedy that, Supt. Sid Thompson on Monday recommended adding three more 
magnets to the list: a bilingual math-science-technology center at Miles Avenue 
Elementary School in Huntington Park, a bilingual International Humanities 
magnet at Le Conte Middle School in Hollywood, and a math-science-technology 
magnet at Huntington Park Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, centers on two other campuses -- Belvedere Middle School's Latin 
music magnet in East Los Angeles and Grant High School's technology magnet in 
Van Nuys -- will offer bilingual classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members were unanimous in approving the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment forms explaining the new magnets are to be sent to parents this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson recommended that the district step up efforts to attract Latino 
students to magnet programs, which are popular among parents because they offer 
smaller classes, more money for special activities and a handpicked faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Students must apply for magnet schools and are selected based on a variety of 
factors, including ethnicity and whether their neighborhood schools are 
overcrowded. About 38,000 students apply each year for 9,500 annual openings in 
the district's 108 magnet centers and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 To boost the number of Latinos accepted at magnet schools, the board voted 
Monday to have Thompson and district lawyers consider a change in the selection 
criteria that would double the bonus points given applicants from overcrowded 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Jeff Horton called the changes and the addition of bilingual 
programs a "good-faith effort to address the inequality" in magnet enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 But board member Julie Korenstein, who represents the San Fernando Valley, 
complained that district officials, in their desperation for East and Central 
Los Angeles sites, appeared to be "jamming it down the throats" of schools that 
did not volunteer for magnet status. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnet schools were created as a vehicle for student integration during the 
divisive busing battles of the 1970s. The schools aim for student bodies that 
are 30% white and 70% minority, but board members voted Monday to ask district 
lawyers to review whether the ratios can be changed. New Magnet Schools 
</P>
<P>
 These are the new magnet centers approved Monday by the Los Angeles Unified 
School District board, to open this fall sharing existing campuses:

ROBINSON: TIME TO TAKE GAME TO NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It didn't take a Purdue rocket scientist to figure out what Glenn Robinson 
planned to say Monday in a Gary, Ind., high school gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Making good on a season-long vow to hold a news conference if he changed his 
mind about returning to Purdue for his senior year, Robinson announced he is a 
Boilermaker no more. In what amounted to one of the great career no-brainers, 
Robinson declared himself available for the June 29 NBA draft -- and the likely 
No. 1 pick and possible $100 million price tag that will come with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the news conference was nothing more than a nostalgic formality. 
Sitting in the same gym where he helped lead Roosevelt High to a state 
championship and where a life-size photo cutout of Robinson hangs from a wall, 
the now-former Purdue All-American forward merely confirmed what had been 
predicted for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last month's NCAA Final Four, Robinson had told at least one 
other All-American player that he was forgoing his final season of eligibility 
for the NBA. It became official the moment Robinson called a Monday news 
conference in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everyone to know in the city of Gary that I'm leaving because I'm in a 
unique situation," Robinson told reporters and an audience of about 300 friends 
and well-wishers. "A lot of people don't have the opportunity to go into the 
lottery or maybe even be the No. 1 pick." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe? Laker General Manager Jerry West has said that Robinson, whose 
30.3-point scoring average led the nation, might have been the No. 1 selection 
last year and, in his mind, is the No. 1 selection this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Hill, the Duke star who is expected to be picked shortly after Robinson, 
said there was no better college player in the country this year. And this was 
after Hill, considered the game's best defender, held Robinson to a season-low 
13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue Coach Gene Keady has said that Robinson "is one of those guys you 
probably have once in a lifetime." Still, Keady was hopeful that Robinson, who 
led the Boilermakers to a 29-5 record, a Big Ten Conference championship and a 
place in the Southeast Regional final, might return for another championship 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 No such luck. Robinson had as much chance of coming back as Keady had of going 
an entire game scowl free. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an opportunity of a lifetime," Keady said. "I would like to coach him 
another year, but the opportunity was just too good to pass up." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-8 Robinson, who missed his freshman season because of academic 
restrictions, completes a list of underclassmen that now includes California's 
Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray, Connecticut's Donyell Marshall, Michigan's Juwan 
Howard and Jalen Rose and Louisville's Clifford Rozier. But only Robinson is 
considered the consensus No. 1 choice and the player most likely to break the 
$100-million contract barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in an unprecedented deal, No. 1 pick Chris Webber received a 15- 
year, $74.4-million deal from the Golden State Warriors. Anfernee Hardaway got 
a 13-year, $65-million package from the Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything is realistic nowadays," said Robinson's agent, Dr. Charles Tucker. 
"I would certainly say he is worth that because he brings more than basketball 
to the game. He brings a personality." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, NBA lottery teams will settle for the basketball part. Not 
only did Robinson average 30-plus points, but he was good for 10.2 rebounds per 
game, capable ball handling, toughness, a work ethic to die for and the ability 
to carry a team (and the Boilermakers needed carrying) whenever necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a new NCAA rule, underclassmen can return to school and regain 
their eligibility -- with strings attached -- up to 30 days after the draft. Of 
course, this doesn't do Keady and Purdue any good for two reasons: Robinson has 
an agent, which is an NCAA no-no; Robinson promised weeks ago not to look back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I say I'm leaving, I'm leaving," he said. "I'm not going to play around." 
</P>
<P>
 So Robinson is gone. For Purdue and college basketball, it was nice while it 
lasted.

MCNALL TO KEEP ONLY 28%; KINGS: REVISED SALE AGREEMENT WILL CUT OWNER'S SHARE. 
TEAM PRESIDENT MLAKAR LEAVES TO JOIN PENGUINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King owner Bruce McNall, plagued by legal and financial trouble, will operate 
the team for pending majority owners Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and Joseph M. Cohen 
under a revised sale agreement that will reduce McNall's ownership of the club 
to only 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement coincided with an announcement Monday by King President Roy A. 
Mlakar, who handled day-to-day operations, to his staff that he is leaving the 
club for a similar position with the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall will direct the team's operations as president of a newly formed Kings 
executive committee. He also will represent the team on the NHL's Board of 
Governors. Although he will run day-to-day operations, sources say McNall will 
have to ultimately answer to Sudikoff and Cohen, who have been trying to close 
the $60 million deal for nearly five months. McNall, who is in Switzerland, 
could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources told The Times that the restructured deal features two key changes. 
First, telecommunications executive Sudikoff and entertainment executive Cohen 
will own 72% of the team -- up from 65% under the original plan -- leaving 
McNall's 28% to be held in some form of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The second change involves reducing the amount of money paid to creditors of 
McNall's financially strapped business operations. Sources said creditors are 
likely to get $1 million to $2 million a year from King operations, a smaller 
amount than under the previous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff and Cohen hope to close the deal as early as Friday. The prospective 
deal still has one major risk. McNall's other creditors could try to disrupt 
the deal by seeking to force McNall's operations into involuntary bankruptcy 
proceedings. Indeed, several creditors are known to have complained Monday to 
McNall representatives after reading about the revised deal in The Times on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff and Cohen cleared a major hurdle over the weekend in their effort to 
buy control of the team by arranging for Bank of America to finance the deal. 
In addition, NHL officials have been working to keep the deal together to 
prevent the Kings from being involved in bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank stepped in after Sudikoff's lenders -- insurance firms Allstate and 
Cigna -- backed out when it became known that a federal grand jury is looking 
into whether McNall falsified loan documents. A criminal defense attorney 
representing McNall has said that McNall expects no action will be taken when 
the investigation concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Sudikoff and Cohen dropped out, sources say the Kings probably would have 
been thrown into turmoil and likely would have ended up in bankruptcy 
proceedings. Sudikoff and Cohen are known to have spent $4.1 million helping 
the Kings meet payroll. The team's payroll was not paid as expected on Monday, 
but is scheduled to be met today, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff and Cohen also financed a $275,000 Rolls-Royce convertible that 
McNall presented to Wayne Gretzky in March after Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's 
NHL record for goals scored. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, whose finances have become severely strained lately, is selling 
control to shed a $92 million loan owed to Bank of America, which is trying to 
recoup what it can. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire $60 million in proceeds from the sale is expected to go to the 
bank. Banking sources say the bank will most likely write off the remaining $32 
million, although the bank in the future could become a 10% partner in a new 
arena that Sudikoff and Cohen want to build. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Mlakar, a news conference is tentatively set for Wednesday in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar is scheduled to fly to Pittsburgh today with Penguin owner Howard 
Baldwin, who happens to be a good friend of McNall's. 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mlakar's leaving comes as no surprise given the turmoil surrounding the Kings 
on and off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been the team's president since June, 1992, succeeding McNall. 
Previously, he was the Kings' executive vice president for four seasons and was 
largely responsible for convincing McNall to promote Nick Beverley to the 
position of general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 There also has been speculation Beverley might also leave .

JIM MURRAY: HIS CREDO: HAVE GLOVES, WILL TRAVEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many years ago, decades, in fact, there used to be an African 
light-heavyweight prizefighter with the improbable name, Battling Siki, whom 
the press liked to call the "Singular Senegalese." 
</P>
<P>
 Siki, whose real name (or Frenchified version thereof) was Louis Phal, marched 
to nobody's drummer. He was as close to nature as a man gets and he roamed the 
world in search of happiness he never found. Not surprisingly, he died of a 
gunshot wound on a New York street. 
</P>
<P>
 He flew in the face of convention his whole life but most audaciously defied 
fate on March 17, 1923, in Dublin, Ireland, when he defended his 
light-heavyweight title against Mike McTigue.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, in case the date means nothing to you, be advised it meant a lot to 3 or 
4 million Irishmen, to say nothing of their compatriots around the world. It is 
the feast day of the country's patron saint, St. Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, fighting an Irishman for a title in Dublin on St. Patrick's Day is the 
height of nonchalance, to put it as politely as possible. Siki could have kept 
that title only if the seas dried up or shamrocks turned orange. In fact, 
keeping it might have seemed a complicated form of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 McTigue won it, of course. All he had to do was survive to do that. If he was 
breathing when it was over, he was going to win. 
</P>
<P>
 But I often think of Battling Siki these days whenever I come upon the fistic 
adventures of another peripatetic African, the Right Honorable Azumah Nelson, 
of the Accra, Ghana, Nelsons.  
</P>
<P>
 Azumah, it so happens, answers to the title "Ambassador" in his native land as 
he is the ex-officio legate of his government wherever he goes.  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Azumah, this is a lot of places, the far reaches of the planet. 
This brave little character -- he weighs 130 pounds -- roams so far and wide in 
pursuit of his pugilistic career that he answers to the nickname "the Road 
Warrior. " 
</P>
<P>
 He asks no quarter of life. He goes to the wolf's lair. He fought and beat 
Wilfredo Gomez, the pride of Puerto Rico, on Wilfredo's turf, San Juan. He 
fought the British featherweight, Pat Cowdell, in Cowdell's native Birmingham, 
England. He fought the Aussie, Jeff Fenech, in Melbourne. He fought Gabriel 
Ruelas in Mexico City. And he fought Jesse James Leija in Leija's hometown of 
San Antonio. He would fight a shark in a tank if the price was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Azumah, fortunately for him, is a very fair fighter. If his opponent is 
tangled up, he steps back. When he floors a man, which is frequently, he turns 
to the neutral corner. When he loses, which is seldom (twice in 41 fights), he 
is gracious. He is so decorous, so circumspect, his nickname is also "The 
Professor." He is the only man of ambassadorial rank ever to hold a pugilistic 
championship. And he has held two -- featherweight and super-featherweight.  
</P>
<P>
 His Excellency had 52 amateur fights, then seven pro fights in his native 
Ghana. His first road fight was in, of all places, Bakersfield.  
</P>
<P>
 He then fought all over Africa, from Freetown to Zambia. Then, he packed his 
trunk. He fought Salvador Sanchez in New York. He fought in McAfee, N.J.; 
Cleveland; Las Vegas, Richfield, Ohio; Lagos, Nigeria; Puerto Rico, Miami, 
England, Los Angeles, Atlantic City, Zaragoza, Spain; Sydney, Mexico and Texas. 
Home has ropes around it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not a career, it's an odyssey.  
</P>
<P>
 He's a curious little fellow, Azumah. He ricochets between the featherweight 
and super-featherweight titles, but made a brief step-up to lightweight, and 
lost closely to Pernell Whitaker -- his only other loss was to the 
hard-punching Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 At 35, he is too old to be fighting, but too good not to be. His fights are 
studies in style. He is not hard to hit, simply hard to hurt. His fights have 
all the delicacy of a train wreck. Only a dozen of them have gone the distance. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He will fight Leija again on Saturday in one of four championship rematches on 
a card inelegantly titled, "Revenge! The Rematch!" It will be held at a rare 
neutral site for Azumah -- the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. It's hard to tell who is 
avenging whom as their last fight in San Antonio ended in a draw.  
</P>
<P>
 Azumah is spotting Leija eight years in youth, but Azumah figures those are 
years of boxing lore that Leija will wish he had by mid-fight.  
</P>
<P>
 Azumah might fight a polar bear on an ice floe next. But don't look for him to 
end up on a New York street bleeding to death. Ghana's roving diplomat owns a 
distillery and a trucking firm in his homeland.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's a permanent tourist. And if he does get hurt and the ring doctor 
asks him if he knows where he is, and he can't for the moment remember, it 
won't be because he's dazed. It will be because he has to think back for a 
minute and that, if it's Tuesday, it must be Bakersfield.  
</P>
<P>
 He probably is the only one who really could fight an Irishman in Dublin on 
St. Patrick's Day. And get no worse than a draw.

CROLL, 74, CHOOSY ABOUT HIS CHANCES; KENTUCKY DERBY: HOLY BULL'S TRAINER 
DOESN'T SEEK THE ROSES UNLESS HE BELIEVES HE CAN WIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The avuncular, 74-year-old trainer of Holy Bull, the favorite for Saturday's 
Kentucky Derby, might be on this year's Racing Hall of Fame ballot, but he is 
not a regular for the race that launches the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Croll trained horses for 33 years without having a Kentucky Derby 
starter. On the last day of March in 1973, that began to change.  
</P>
<P>
 Gulfstream Park ran the Florida Derby that day, and Croll saddled Royal And 
Regal for a three-length victory. In the next race, 30 minutes later, Croll 
sent out another 3-year-old, Mr. Prospector, who went six furlongs in 1:07 4/5 
-- still the Gulfstream record. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Croll's headaches began. His recollections of that first trip to the 
Derby sound more like Kafka than Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the owners of both horses wanted to run in Kentucky. Despite his 
Florida Derby victory, Croll wasn't high on Royal And Regal as a Derby 
contender, and he definitely didn't think Mr. Prospector should be shipped to 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to ask Mr. Prospector to go from six furlongs to a mile and a 
quarter (the Derby distance)," Croll said. "That was ridiculous. This was a 
green horse. I all but got down on my knees to convince the owners that they 
shouldn't go. I told them that we would embarrass the horse if we ran him in 
the Derby. But they told me that if I didn't take him, some other trainer 
would. So I went along. I thought that maybe I could talk them out of it when 
we got to Louisville." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, the Derby Trial was run four days before the Derby, and Mr. 
Prospector finished second in the seven-furlong race. X-rays afterward showed 
he had suffered a cracked shin bone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was good enough to win (the Trial) by 10 (lengths)," Croll said. "That was 
tough. I didn't want him in the Derby, but I didn't want him to miss it the way 
he did." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the wrong year for any marginal 3-year-olds to be running in the 
Derby. The field was perhaps the deepest until this year. Sham, the Santa Anita 
Derby winner, finished 1 1/2 lengths behind Secretariat, the eventual Triple 
Crown champion and the yardstick ever since for comparing horses. Forego 
finished fourth in the Derby, then won three horse-of-the-year titles after 
Secretariat retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll's Royal And Regal was eighth. Mr. Prospector came back to win stakes, 
but he is more renowned for being the best stallion since Northern Dancer. He 
has sired seven Eclipse Award winners, one North American horse of the year, 
Conquistador Cielo, and one Canadian national champion, Afleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this year, Croll had some good horses, but he made only one more trip 
to the Derby, finishing second with Bet Twice when Alysheba outran his colt in 
1987. Bet Twice was a legitimate contender. That is what it takes to get Croll 
to Louisville in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Holy Bull's credentials -- an undefeated record last year and a 
Florida Derby victory by almost six lengths this year -- Croll said he wouldn't 
have come 70 miles down the road from Keeneland if the gray colt had run poorly 
in the Blue Grass Stakes on April 16. Holy Bull won the Blue Grass, defeating 
Valiant Nature, one of the best West Coast 3-year-olds, by 3 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 So, 21 years after that first, sour Derby experience, Croll is having fun at 
Churchill Downs. Some trainers of Derby favorites seldom appear in public 
without beads of perspiration lining their brows, but there is no pressure 
visible around Croll's barn. One possible reason: The trainer of Holy Bull is 
also the owner, Croll having inherited the Derby horse and seven others after 
his client of 37 years, supermarket heiress Rachel Carpenter, died last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Croll doesn't have to worry about some owner poking around the barn, asking 
how Holy Bull is doing every quarter-hour and submitting written riding 
instructions for their jockey on Derby eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull arrived at Churchill Downs on Saturday and completed his important 
preparations Monday, working six furlongs in 1:14 3/5 with a closing quarter 
mile of 24 1/5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he was blowing afterward, and he got just a tad tired," Croll said. 
"This is a cuppy track, and I was pleased with the work. We know he has speed, 
and the main thing is to keep him finishing strong. I think he's all set to 
fire, and all we have to do is pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of days before a lot of the stakes races you run in, you wind up 
saying to yourself, 'I wish we had done this, or I wish we had done that,' " 
Croll said. "But with my horse, it's been different. I wouldn't change one 
thing that we've done going into the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 Croll cited four California-based horses he perceives as Holy Bull's chief 
challengers: Tabasco Cat, Valiant Nature, Brocco and Strodes Creek. Based on 
their running styles, Tabasco Cat should be closest to the front-running Holy 
Bull early; Valiant Nature and Brocco won't be far behind and Strodes Creek 
will be making his move from farther back. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely many horses will try to match strides with Holy Bull early. 
Ulises, one colt that might challenge for the lead, was on the track in bright 
sunshine Monday, working out at the same time as Holy Bull. Ulises went five 
furlongs in 1:02 over a drying-out track that was hard hit by rain during the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Derby probables worked six furlongs Monday, the same distance as 
Holy Bull. Valiant Nature was timed in 1:14 and Tabasco Cat in 1:15. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull has won seven of eight starts, earning almost $1 million, and in all 
of his victories, from 5 1/2 furlongs to 1 1/8 miles, he has run out front. 
Croll has said repeatedly, however, that jockey Mike Smith can restrain Holy 
Bull if a horse tries to outrun them at the start. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an unlikely occurrence; no horse has beaten Holy Bull to the lead so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would your horse be in trouble if another horse made the lead?" Croll was 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be in no trouble," he said. "The trouble would be for the horse on the 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 With his regular jockey, Gary Stevens, in from California to ride, Brocco 
worked five furlongs in an impressive 1:00 3/5 Monday. "It was an awesome 
move," Stevens said. "This is by far the best workout of his career." . . . 
Other five-furlong workouts produced times of 1:02 3/5 for Strodes Creek, 1:02 
4/5 for Mahogany Hall and 1:02 for Ulises. . . . The pony that escorted Ulises 
to the track cut toward the rail and was in the path of Holy Bull for a few 
moments at the start of his workout. Holy Bull's exercise rider, Bobby Perna, 
yelled at the other rider and the pony moved out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Mike Rutherford, who put up a late fee of $6,000 to make Lakeway 
eligible for the Triple Crown races, will make the decision, but on Monday 
trainer Gary Jones gave several reasons why the filly shouldn't run in the 
Derby, and no reasons why she should. Lakeway is expected to be a heavy 
favorite Friday in the Kentucky Oaks for 3-year-old fillies. Entries for the 
Oaks will be drawn Wednesday and the Derby draw is Thursday, so theoretically 
Lakeway could be entered in both races. It costs $10,000 merely to enter the 
Derby. Also, if Lakeway ran in the Derby, she would need a jockey, because Kent 
Desormeaux is committed to riding Soul Of The Matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Battaglia, the Churchill Downs linemaker, has made Holy Bull the early 
8-5 Derby favorite, with Brocco next at 3-1. Other probable morning-line odds: 
Tabasco Cat, 6-1; Southern Rhythm and Strodes Creek, both 8-1; Valiant Nature, 
12-1; Powis Castle, Blumin Affair and Soul Of The Matter, all 15-1; and Go For 
Gin, Kandaly, Mahogany Hall, Meadow Flight, Smilin Singin Sam and Ulises, 20-1.

WORLD CUP '94 / 45 DAYS AND COUNTING; A PAINFUL LESSON; SERIOUS KNEE INJURY IN 
'93 HAS GIVEN U.S. SOCCER STAR BALBOA A NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a misstep, nothing more. An awkwardly placed foot that came down in an 
unexpected indentation. At any other time, with any other foot, perhaps the leg 
and attached body would have traveled on without mishap. Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 But this foot wedged into that hole and didn't budge. This body twisted this 
knee so that the joint's stabilizing structure snapped with a loud pop! that 
sent an emphatic message to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcelo Balboa had processed the message before he hit the grassy ground, 
before his teammates had rushed to him, before his mother in the the stands had 
begun to sob. It was not one of those cinematic moments, he said, in which your 
life passes before your eyes. It was much worse. Balboa saw his long-nurtured 
soccer career pass before him and keep on moving, as if it cared not a whit 
that he wasn't able to stand and follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa learned much as he lay crumpled on that soccer field, while trainers 
and doctors tested and waggled his limp knee into crazy angles. He discovered 
that it is possible to love something and for that thing to be indifferent to 
your love. He learned that his ardent love was not enough, and not enough even 
when tempered with respect. Marcelo Balboa's lesson was this: Learn to be 
grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who would care to be a cliche? It is not flattering to have your life viewed 
as something predictable or common. But the outlook for Marcelo Balboa, 
pre-April 17, 1993, was typical of that of most athletes, even professional 
ones. He could perform any daring stunt without fear. He was certain that his 
body would do whatever he asked of it. It always had, always would. 
</P>
<P>
 He had meant to study harder in high school, but there were so many sports to 
play. He had intended to graduate from college, but he was offered a great 
opportunity to play soccer. He wanted to develop outside interests, but when he 
wasn't at practice he was so tired. For Balboa, life was something to do when 
you can't play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 His life was one-dimensional, but he knew it and didn't care. Balboa had 
played in the 1990 World Cup finals. He had played more minutes with the 
national team than any other American for the last two years. He was a key 
figure on the team and was on course to play in this summer's World Cup. How 
many Americans can say that? They were paying him to play soccer. Life was 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 That was pretty much Balboa's psychological landscape before his right foot 
found that recess made by a long-erased football yard line. In that otherwise 
forgettable game -- the U.S. national team against Iceland -- Balboa's world 
changed because his ability to play soccer was taken from him. The snapping 
sound his teammates heard was the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee 
tearing under stress. Also found was a partial tear of the medial lateral 
meniscus cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
 After Balboa was taken off the field and given the initial injury assessment, 
after the team's doctor and trainers had returned to the game, Balboa went to 
the showers and cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit me big time," he said the other day. "Everything I had worked so hard 
to get up to that point was gone. I was the player of the year in 1992 and 
everything had been going so well for me. I was just starting to play well in 
the beginning of '93. All I saw when I was in the shower and I was crying was 
the World Cup go by and I wouldn't be there.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I had worked for went by me. As a soccer player, everything you 
work for is the World Cup. Great, I played in 1990. But I saw 1994 going by 
without me and that really hurt. I didn't want that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 That was on a Saturday. Sunday morning, Balboa had an MRI test of his knee. 
The next day Dr. Bert Mandelbaum confirmed what Balboa had feared: he would 
have surgery immediately and the usual recovery period was 9-12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa, though, did not accept the time frame the doctors gave him. Everything 
would have to be accelerated, he said. He wanted the surgery immediately, then 
an aggressive rehab program. He got what he asked for.  
</P>
<P>
 After the operation, Balboa went to his apartment in Laguna Nigel. For six 
hours a day a passive-motion device attached to his right leg mechanically bent 
and straightened it to improve his range of motion. A plastic sleeve around his 
knee circulated cold water to keep swelling down. Two surgically implanted 
tubes drained pooling blood from the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 On the fourth day after surgery, the physical therapy began. After seven days, 
the stitches came out. For the next four weeks, Balboa was fitted with a 
hip-to-ankle brace that was so constricting it allowed him to sleep only on his 
back, fitfully. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain was one thing, but the work involved in rehab was quite another. For 
an athlete who thought he was tough, this was a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always heard people say, 'You have to ride the bike, you have to do this 
for rehab,' " Balboa said. "The first thing Dr. Mandelbaum said after surgery 
is, 'We're going to put you on a real aggressive program.' I'm like, 'Oh, all 
right. No big deal.' I go to the therapist. He gets me on the table and we 
start doing (range of motion) patterns with his hands. I did about five of them 
and I couldn't do any more. It was absolute pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking to myself, 'This is going to be tougher than I thought.' Then 
(the therapist) said, 'Today is nothing. Wait until we get the stitches out.' 
As we went on day by day, it would get harder and harder and longer and longer. 
I never realized what kind of effort I'd have to give." 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise was even greater because Balboa's best friend on the team, 
Fernando Clavijo, had already gone through a similar rehab on a knee and told 
him it wasn't so bad. The second week into rehab Balboa confronted Clavijo with 
his friend's light assessment of the work required and Clavijo simply laughed. 
"I lied to you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa is 26, but he was quite young when he realized his father's soccer 
skills had passed directly to his older brother, Claudio. Balboa's strategy was 
to run and run. He figured that fitness would compensate for a lack of natural 
ease with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Balboa coached his sons until they were well into their teens. He had 
played professional soccer in Argentina, then as a defensive midfielder for the 
Chicago Mustangs of the now-defunct North American Professional Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio and Marcelo would join their father every Sunday to watch 
Spanish-language soccer telecasts. They played in a youth soccer league in 
Cerritos. They grew up with soccer, but they also played water polo, football, 
baseball, whatever sport was in season. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis made Marcelo choose. Too much time spent on sports and not enough time on 
schoolwork, he told his son. The boy's grades were not good, even though he was 
smart. You may play a sport, but not four or five, the father said. Marcelo 
chose soccer and football. He became a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of high school, I had offers to go to the best schools, but I 
didn't have the grades," Balboa said. "I was lazy. I didn't want to do the 
work. I realized that when I wanted to go to college and I couldn't go where I 
wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead he went to junior college and played with the national under-20 team. 
He transferred to San Diego State, where his fame as a talented defender was 
equaled by his reputation as a private person whose interests extended to 
soccer, period. That focus was about to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, I didn't go to one party," Balboa said. "I wasn't interested 
in the drinking. I didn't get into that until college. San Diego State was a 
party team. I got involved in that and I didn't like it. I didn't want to be 
part of a team that was known for drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bob Gansler called and asked if he would like to play full time for the 
U.S. national team that was trying to qualify for the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When soccer was taken away from him, Balboa was left with no outlet for his 
competitive drive. Physical therapy became a substitute for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who puts in six hours a day, seven days a week for five months with no 
complaints and no setbacks . . . that says a little about that person," said 
Rudy Rudawsky, the U.S. team trainer. "He came to every practice. Every 
practice. He didn't have to. He could have dropped off. He never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa listened to the therapist's predictions about when he would return, but 
in his mind he subtracted two months from each estimate. When they said he 
would be running in six months and practicing again in eight, he figured he 
would be running in four months and practicing in six. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish this, Balboa extended himself. He was told to do X, and he did 
X+. When Balboa was cleared to ride a mountain bike, Rudawsky shepherded Balboa 
and Clavijo through the hills of Laguna Nigel. As the players raced downhill 
ahead of him, Rudawsky didn't see Balboa fly off his bike and cut his right 
knee. Balboa had made sure the trainer stayed to his left. 
</P>
<P>
 He also insisted in maintaining his routine, as if it might make the injury go 
away. That meant sleeping, as usual, in his bedroom on the second floor. No one 
saw the many times he missed a step and slipped, or was there the night he fell 
down the entire flight of stairs and lay for many minutes, still and in the 
dark, afraid to move. 
</P>
<P>
 His family watched as Balboa struggled to recover. On Friday nights, his 
mother came over and stayed until Sunday, cooking and helping as much as his 
pride would allow. His father -- who had never been injured in his career -- 
was awed by his son's dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 "To our family, soccer is our love," Luis Balboa said. "But if Marcelo hadn't 
played, it wouldn't have changed anything. We are so proud. Even as a father, I 
was impressed with how hard he worked to rehabilitate his knee." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to action with the team on Dec. 5, 1993, playing for a few minutes 
in a game against El Salvador. Balboa came on as a substitute and immediately 
began running around with no apparent plan. He took a shot the instant it 
presented itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like a puppy," he said. "I was so happy to be out there. I was going to 
go out there and run and have fun again." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's back as the team's full-time sweeper, Balboa is doing what he 
used to do, but with a new outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot about myself," he said. "The whole thing made me realize that 
I had to look after soccer and what was going to happen to me. Since 1988, when 
I started with the team, I never thought about anything but soccer. I was going 
to school, I knew I was getting an education, but I didn't really think about 
it. Once I got hurt, I kept on thinking, 'What happens if I can't come back and 
play soccer? What am I going to do?' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I realized there's more to life than playing soccer. There's 
other things I want to do. I want to go back and finish my degree. It's very 
important to me now.  
</P>
<P>
 "You take things for granted when you're healthy. Between practices, I used to 
sit in the house and watch TV. I wouldn't do much. You realize you have to go 
out and enjoy life. I was kind of letting life roll by me. I was playing 
soccer, coming home and relaxing. Now I go to movies, play golf, jet ski. It 
wakes you up. It's like a reality check. You see what your life was and now you 
see what it's like without soccer. Let me tell you, at that point my life 
looked pretty bleak without soccer." Player Profile

FOUR DRAW FINES, SUSPENSIONS FOR ROLES IN NBA PLAYOFF VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miami teammates Keith Askins and Grant Long, Atlanta's Douglas Edwards and San 
Antonio's Dennis Rodman were suspended and fined by the NBA on Monday after 
fights and rough play in games during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Askins was suspended for three games and fined $15,000 for coming off the 
bench in a third-quarter fight between Atlanta and the Heat during Saturday's

ORLANDO AGREES WITH RAIDERS: THERE WILL BE NO MOVE THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orlando city officials publicly conceded Monday what they had privately known 
since last week, that the Raiders had no intention of moving there. 
</P>
<P>
 "After numerous telephone negotiations, certain economic specifics could not 
be resolved," Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence there was any serious negotiating by the Raiders. Owner 
Al Davis toured the 72,000-seat Citrus Bowl while in Orlando last month for the 
owners' meetings. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Davis asked for 
improvements to the stadium that would have cost $30-40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando officials were preparing a relocation package for the Raiders, but 
were told last week not to bother. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum, the Raiders' home since 1982, is undergoing approximately $35 
million worth of repair work to fix damage caused by the January earthquake and 
is expected to be ready by the start of the season, probably at a reduced 
capacity of 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, the Raiders signed tight end Jamie Williams, a free agent who 
spent five seasons with the San Francisco 49ers. STEVE SPRINGER

49ERS TRADE BONO TO KANSAS CITY; HE REJOINS MONTANA AS BACKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kansas City Chiefs got some backup protection for Joe Montana on Monday by 
signing quarterback Steve Bono to a two-year deal reportedly worth $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs sent a future draft pick to the San Francisco 49ers for Bono, a 
veteran in his 10th year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono was released by the 49ers last Friday after the team asked him to take a 
50% pay cut to $750,000. He was re-signed Monday before being traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The obvious is that the acquisition of Steve Bono gives the Chiefs added 
insurance at the very important quarterback position," said Carl Peterson, the 
Chiefs' general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono, 31, who played at UCLA, spent five seasons with the 49ers after joining 
them as a free agent in 1989. The 6-foot-4, 215-pounder, backing up Montana and 
Steve Young, played in 40 games, starting nine, completing 266 of 479 passes 
for 3,114 yards with 20 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he played in eight games, completing 39 of 61 passes for 416 
yards, no touchdowns and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Bono's experience helps the Chiefs, whose other backup quarterback is Matt 
Blundin.

RAMS SENDING ANAHEIM NOTICE TO ESCAPE LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The check is signed, the notification letter written and the brief news 
release has been prepared. Today the Rams will officially inform the city of 
Anaheim that they are terminating their lease for Anaheim Stadium, effective 
Aug. 3, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 100%," said John Shaw, Ram executive vice president."Our legal counsel, 
Bob Meyer . . . will deliver the letter and check to the city, notifying the 
city that we are exercising the escape clause in our lease." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim gave the Rams the escape clause in their 30-year lease in 1990, in 
exchange for the team's agreement not to block or delay the construction of the 
Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The clause calls for 15 months' notice and a $2-million deposit on the bond 
for the expansion of Anaheim Stadium. The team must pay off the remaining 
indebtedness, which is estimated to be $30 million, if it terminates the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams can revoke today's notice at any time, but they will lose their 
$2-million deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has said it remains open to the possibility of staying in Anaheim, 
but today's action will free the Rams to negotiate to move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't expect anything to happen for a while," Shaw said. "We are in no 
position at this time to sign a letter of intent to move anywhere, or anything 
like that. We will take our time and explore all options." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams believe their opportunities to earn more money are limited by their 
stadium leaseand the lack of passion in Southland sports fans. They say the 
interest in cities that failed to land expansion franchises gives them a window 
of opportunity.

 Rodney Peete, former USC and Detroit Lion quarterback, worked out for the Ram 
coaching staff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete, who is considered a prime candidate to back up Troy Aikman in Dallas, 
is one of three quarterbacks being auditioned this week by the Rams as a 
potential understudy to Chris Miller. Indianapolis' Jack Trudeau and Phoenix's 
Chris Chandler will also work out. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the team will take a look at New Orleans cornerback Toi Cook, who 
attended Stanford and Montclair Prep in Van Nuys. 
</P>

 The Rams announced the signing of guard Jeff Pahukoa, an unrestricted free 
agent who started three games for them last season. T.J. SIMERS

FABREGAS TOO HOT TO BE COOL FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie catcher Jorge Fabregas slammed his fist into his mitt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 15 minutes before the Angels were to leave their clubhouse for batting 
practice and Fabregas was already keyed up. Three hours before game time and he 
watched the clubhouse goings-on intently. One week in the major leagues and he 
still wanted to soak up every possible moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the room, Bo Jackson opened fan mail, wondering how he would ever have 
time to read it all. Nearby, Brian Anderson and Spike Owen spoke with 
reporters. Jim Edmonds walked to the trainer's room. Chili Davis chatted with 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fabregas sat in front of his locker, watching and punching his mitt. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week, it was still difficult for him to believe he was here. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question he's made an immediate impact, though. Fabregas' debut has 
been the only positive development for the Angels since catcher Greg Myers was 
put on the disabled list because of a sprained knee suffered in a home-plate 
collision with Boston's Mike Greenwell on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels start tonight's game against the New York Yankees as losers of nine 
of their last 10 games. Their pitching rotation is a shambles, no thanks to 
injuries and poor performances, and their hitting isn't much to brag about 
either. They have scored nine runs in five games on this home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas, 24, has been a tremendous surprise, going seven for 15 in six games 
last week. The Angels knew he was good and hoped he was ready to step up to the 
majors after two seasons of head-turning play in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always liked him," General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "We picked him 
high and rated him high." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, in his first season as general manager after nine years as the club's 
director of minor league operations, isn't troubled by Fabregas' inexperience 
behind the plate. Neither is Manager Buck Rodgers, an Angel catcher from 
1961-69. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes behind-the-plate experience is overrated," Bavasi said. "I'm not 
sure calling a game is akin to splitting the atom." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rodgers, "You can take a young catcher who's been properly taught and 
bring him to the majors, and he'll have an edge on somebody who's been up a 
long time (but hasn't had the same training)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' options were limited in this case. Without Myers, they were down 
to rookie Chris Turner, batting .103, and Fabregas, who was at triple-A 
Vancouver. Even their bullpen catcher is out, sidelined because of a broken arm 
suffered the same day Myers was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the Angels have been looking for a catcher ever since Bob Boone 
became a free agent after the 1988 season. Lance Parrish had a couple of solid 
years after Boone's departure, but Ron Tingley and John Orton couldn't do the 
job. And now Myers is injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas simply chooses not to ponder how or why he's in the majors. He got 
his break and he's determined to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for what happened to Myers," Fabregas said. "He took care of me 
during spring training. You never know when you're going to get your break." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas rocketed through the Angel farm system simply because he is a 
catcher. He was a third baseman in college, but when somebody handed him a 
catcher's mask, shin guards and a chest protector, he saw it as his ticket to 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much knew the team that drafted me was going to make me a catcher," 
he said. "I didn't think I was a big league third baseman." 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Miami, Fabregas had a .331 batting average, seventh-best 
in Hurricane history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels drafted him in the first round of the 1991 draft, turned him into a 
catcher and sent him on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first pro season, he batted .283 in 70 games at Class-A Palm Springs in 
1992. Last year, he hit .289 in 113 games at double-A Midland and .231 in four 
late-season games at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's in the big leagues, showing he might stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early in my career I was a better hitter than a catcher," Fabregas said. 
"Now, it's evening up. I have bad at-bats, but I've learned you can't take it 
behind the plate with you. You have to stay focused on every pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 It's far different from playing third base, where you can kick the infield 
dirt, spit and think about your last at-bat, your next at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catching is so important defensively that you can afford to give up a little 
offensively," he said. "But nowadays, you can't just hit .210. You have to put 
up some numbers. I try to do things to move guys over and drive in runs. I want 
to be a tough out every time I'm up." 
</P>
<P>
 When Fabregas needs help behind the plate, he turns to Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between innings, he'll tell you to use the pitcher's fastball more often," 
Fabregas said. "He helps me out because I don't know all the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers has no qualms about letting Fabregas call the pitches, even with 
veterans such as Chuck Finley or John Dopson on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him to be afraid to try things," Rodgers said. "The school of 
hard knocks is still the best university in the land. Jorge had good coaching 
at Miami and in the farm system. I've seen him come along. He's learned the job 
good so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabregas knows that a young catcher needs to inspire confidence among his 
teammates. It seems he's already done that with Bavasi and Rodgers. The 
pitching staff is next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to put them in the frame of mind (to say), 'I have no doubts when 
Fabregas is back there,' " Fabregas said. "I caught in the big league spring 
training camp for two years. I know what they like to throw. It's not like I'm 
coming up here cold turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Fabregas has left nothing to chance, looking poised and confident. He 
believed this was the season he would be called up. He just didn't think it 
would happen so quickly. Or that he would be quite so successful.

STRAWBERRY SET FOR RELEASE, BUT FUTURE WITH DODGERS REMAINS UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry will be released from a drug treatment center this week, 
perhaps as soon as today, but his plans as far as the Dodgers are concerned 
remain unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody knows," said Michael Strawberry, Darryl's 
brother."Darryl hasn't talked with (the Dodgers) or anything, and they need to 
figure out what to do as an organization and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Strawberry has been involved in the family therapy program at the 
treatment center, reportedly in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, has not said what the club plans 
to do when Strawberry is ready to return to play. They are paying him $3 
million this season and owe another $5 million for next season, the last of his 
contract. Their options include releasing him with pay, trading him -- perhaps 
picking up a portion of his salary to do so -- allowing him to return or 
finding a way to void his contract. MARYANN HUDSON

 Davis was a high school basketball standout in New York and, according to 
scouts, had a good shot at making the NBA.But Jackie Robinson helped to 
persuade him that baseball was his true calling. 
</P>
<P>
 The outfielder and occasional third-baseman spent the first seven of his 18 
big league seasons with the Dodgers, leading the National League in batting in 
1962 and '63. His .346 average and 153 runs batted in in '62 remain 
single-season records for the Los Angeles franchise.

 Davis, 55, owns a company that specializes in producing promotional caps and 
other items. A resident of San Bernardino County, he also gives private batting 
lessons to children and adults.

 Reichardt became the highest-paid "bonus baby" in baseball history when the 
Angels beat out 17 other teams and signed him for a reported $200,000 in 
1964.It looked like the club's gamble would pay off when the outfielder started 
1966 with 16 homers and a .288 average, but his season ended after only 89 
games when an illness led to the removal of a kidney in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichardt came back to hit 17 home runs the next season and a career-high 21 
in 1968, but he was traded in 1970 and retired in 1974 without living up to the 
expectations of many baseball scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 51, he sells insurance and is part owner of a restaurant in Gainesville, 
Fla.

CYCLING; LEMOND HOPES TO KEEP RIDING THROUGH DUPONT, '96 OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is a three-time winner of the Tour de France, twice the world champion and 
perhaps America's greatest cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at 32, Greg LeMond cannot predict how his summer will turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond is one of 112 cyclists embarking on the 12-day, 1,050-mile Tour DuPont, 
which will start Wednesday with a prologue at Wilmington, Del. It will end May 
15 with a 16.6-mile time trial from Kernersville, N.C., to Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked recently how he will fare in America's biggest cycling event, 
LeMond said, "I honestly don't know. I hope I can do well. I haven't been 
feeling as great as I wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 Can he win a fourth Tour de France, which begins July 2? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But LeMond does know that reports of his imminent retirement are premature. 
Although his career is on the downside, LeMond said he wants to hang on through 
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, when professionals will be allowed to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing getting me tired of racing is having to live in Europe eight 
months a year," he said. "(But) if I have some big setback this year, it might 
be difficult for me to carry on." 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond had a disastrous year in 1993, dropping out of the Tour of Italy and 
the Tour de France. He blamed his weakened condition on severe allergies, then 
returned to Medina, Minn., to recuperate. But while on a training ride in 
Minnesota, he crashed and suffered a broken wrist, effectively ending his 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond also suffered financial problems in his family cycling business that 
resulted in strained relations with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he says he is ready to continue for two more years although he has -- as 
usual -- raced poorly in Europe this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, if the physical (part) is there, my mental ability is there," he 
said. "Last year, I started from ground zero. I've done a lot of tests where my 
(oxygen) uptake is better than it ever has been. I've yet to get my weight down 
to where it used to be. . . . that could hurt my climbing."

MARKET FOCUS; CASTRO PLAYS A CAPITALIST CARD, SEEKING MORE TOURIST DOLLARS; 
IT'S A DANGEROUS GAME BECAUSE CUBANS ARE BARRED FROM VACATION FACILITIES.

 For most visitors, Cuba is the land of the Four S's -- Sun, Sand, Sea and Sex. 
For Cuba itself, that all rolls into a single S: "Survival." 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial effort to stem the disintegration of Cuba's economy, the 
island's Communist leaders have turned to tourism, a standard device elsewhere 
but one which Cuban ruler Fidel Castro once derided as the corrupt symbol of 
the capital order he overthrew 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely, it was on April 21, 1959, that Castro banned private beaches and 
began opening former tourist facilities to Cubans, a practice that has been 
reversed again under the current approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the most daring and dangerous part of all of this," said a diplomat 
from a country with strong financial links to Cuba. "Because Cubans don't have 
dollars they can't get in (to tourist attractions) and because they see what is 
available to the foreigners, the Cubans naturally are going to be resentful, 
particularly since for 30 years they have been taught there should be no 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 That there is discrimination is obvious. Two Cubans, invited to drinks 
recently by a foreigner in the fancy Hotel Nacional, were refused entry not 
only to the hotel but to the grounds itself. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Cubans are gambling on, the diplomat said, "is that enough money can 
be generated in a short enough time" to ease the economic crisis and head off 
serious discontent stirred by discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program began four years ago, there have been some successes in 
drawing in badly needed foreign currency, and the hotels and beaches are often 
full of pale Canadians and Europeans looking for sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't yet the Cuba that dominated Caribbean tourism from the 1920s 
until the 1959 revolution closed the Mafia's casinos and shut down the 
elaborate nightclubs that featured gorgeous strippers, both men and women, and 
explicit sex shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Havana was Miami, Las Vegas and Sodom all rolled into one," said Luis Mendez, 
a Cuban-American who lived in Havana before going into exile in 1961. "There 
were things wrong with it," he said, "but it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Havana and Cuba still aren't that much fun, but the government is making 
changes from the post-1959 puritanical approach that left most tourist 
facilities, including grand hotels, tattered and moldering. 
</P>
<P>
 Financed by foreign capital, mostly Spanish and Canadian, Havana hotels have 
been restored and some new ones built. The island's beaches have been cleaned 
up and dozens of seaside hotels and villas renovated or built from the sand up. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants reserved exclusively for foreigners are doing business around the 
capital. Some feature an international cuisine; one specializes in Spanish 
cooking, another Italian dishes. There is even a restaurant that pretends to be 
Chinese, serving rice and soy sauce on otherwise unidentifiable food. 
</P>
<P>
 Nightclubs are presenting floor shows in the Vegas mode, with tall, leggy 
chorines wearing towering feathers and tiny bikinis, moving to the beat of big 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even culture is being exploited, at least to the degree that it attracts 
foreign dollars. Old copies of books by and about Ernest Hemingway are 
available, and tours are arranged to the bars where he drank, the marina where 
he kept his boat and the house where he lived off and on. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway and the restaurants and nightclubs aside, the tourist magnets that 
the Cubans are counting on are the four S's, and here in Varadero they 
flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 With its 12 miles of sugar-fine, white sandy beaches only a two-hour drive 
east of Havana, Varadero rivals the best resorts of the Caribbean, the 
government boasts. 
</P>
<P>
 But just claiming that it's so is not enough in the Caribbean, where every 
beach is ecstatic, so Cuba has undertaken a program to make sure that 
foreigners, at least a certain class of them, are tempted. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices are a major draw. Ads in Canadian newspapers promise round-trip 
charter air fare, a week in a Varadero hotel and local transportation for just 
over $500. Throw in three meals a day and the price goes up to just over $600 
for the package. 
</P>
<P>
 With few exceptions, Americans are restricted from traveling to Cuba, but for 
those willing to violate U.S. laws, a three-night stay with air fare to and 
from the Bahamas can cost as little as $220. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is sex. There is nothing out of the ordinary in the ads placed 
in newspapers in Canada and Europe showing scantily clad young women gamboling 
in the waves or strutting down the beach, and as a tour of various beaches 
proves, it certainly isn't false advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another, less palatable part of that S. 
</P>
<P>
 To one degree or another all those new nightclubs and fancy hotels are centers 
of prostitution, mostly on the part of very young girls, the majority of them 
black, the poorest sector of Cuban society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decline and fall of Cuba's economy and the turn to attracting foreigners 
has made it inevitable," said a diplomat here. "The only way for most of these 
kids to survive is to sell themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Another supposed attraction is Cuba's self-proclaimed freedom from AIDs, a 
claim reinforced until recently by Castro's policy of rounding up HIV carriers 
and AIDs sufferers and quarantining them. International health organizations 
say AIDs is as much a problem here as anywhere, but the illusion dies hard, and 
Cuba is a regional leader in sex tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving down 5th Avenue, a major road through the once-opulent Havana 
neighborhood of Miramar where many of the capital's tourist restaurants and 
hotels are located, is to run a gauntlet of hitchhiking girls. An American 
woman reporter was waved off when she stopped for a teen-age girl she thought 
actually needed a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the tourism campaign is working. Cuban officials say about 
600,000 foreigners came here last year, up from nearly none only four years ago 
when Fidel Castro reluctantly approved the program. They project about an 8% 
increase for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 That still leaves Cuba far short of the top Caribbean tourist destinations. 
Jamaica had nearly 475,000 tourists in the first three months of this year 
alone, while the Bahamas report nearly 400,000 visitors for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a country where for more than 25 years tourism was largely limited to 
ideological-driven Castro admirers with more holes in their jeans than money in 
their pockets, or groups of Eastern European workers who carried nearly 
worthless currency, Cuba and tourism seems a mix again. Maybe, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 Those prices are bargains for the tourists, but questionable for Cuba since 
the government is forced to subsidize the entire program. "There is no way the 
government can make a profit," one foreign economic expert said. "The (Canadian 
and Spanish) hotel operators take their share off the top and before the rooms 
are discounted. The foreign airlines and charters all get their money up 
front." 
</P>
<P>
 A diplomat from a country involved in the tourist trade agreed and noted that 
the strategy can be counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theory is that the subsidies act as loss leaders, that is the cost is 
made up by the spending the tourist will do once they are here," he said. But 
the type of tourist drawn by cheap fares and sexual adventures are not the big 
spenders that have created real wealth in St. Lucia and Antigua, two Caribbean 
destinations for big spenders, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the old joke of the French Canadian tourist," the diplomat pointed out. 
"He comes with a Bible and a 10-dollar bill. After a week he hasn't cracked 
either one." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, except for cigars and rum there is little to spend money on here. 
Even the famous dollar stores do little to attract buyers since what they sell 
is usually available at home for equal or lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger problem results from the gamble that tourism will pay large 
enough dividends soon enough to head off social discontent. There are signs 
that the government is losing the gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 The outsiders, here with government approval, are beginning to feel the heat. 
Drivers of rental cars are shouted at, and sometimes their vehicles are 
vandalized. Male tourists walking the beach with young Cuban women receive 
glares of open resentment from Cuban men. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is bad business," said Ronaldo Cruz, a bartender at the Hotel Varadero 
Internacional. "The foreigners come here with dollars and buy what we can't 
get. The women go out with them because it's the only way they can earn money 
or get a decent meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work here so I should be happy. But I don't get paid in dollars, and if you 
write a tip in dollars on the bill, I get it in pesos so I can't even buy in 
the dollar stores." 
</P>

WORLD VIEW; KEEPING THE PEACE: U.N. GETS MIXED REACTION TO GOAL; CLINTON AGREES 
WITH THE IDEA BUT INTENDS TO STRICTLY LIMIT U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN MISSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In their first weeks on the job, Clinton Administration officials, flush with 
the excitement of fresh ideas, prepared a paper for their boss' signature on 
the role of U.S. troops in peacekeeping missions of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Peacekeeping had become the fashionable defense concept of the New World 
Order, and no one anticipated much of a delay before President Clinton would 
sign that paper -- Presidential Review Directive 13. But the mood over 
peacekeeping soon soured in Washington, and the official paper languished and 
metamorphosed for more than a year. Now, the White House says Clinton is ready 
to sign the latest version, probably Thursday, 15 months after the first draft 
of PRD 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The signature -- even after so long a delay -- signals a significant move 
forward. U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping seemed doomed last October 
when 18 U.S. Rangers died as the result of a raid in Somalia during the 
frenzied manhunt for warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. The deaths shocked Clinton 
into ordering the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Somalia within five months 
and made him reluctant to commit any more troops to future peacekeeping 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even while the President put U.S. peacekeeping in official paralysis, a 
host of universities and think tanks churned out innumerable reports and 
seminars on peacekeeping as a key element of modern defense policy. The roster 
of sponsors includes the U.S. Naval Academy, the Johns Hopkins School of 
Advanced International Studies, the Henry L. Stimson Center, Columbia 
University, the National Defense University, the United Nations Assn. of the 
U.S.A. and Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all this, said one U.S. military analyst, "this subject commands 
more time on behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff than any other subject."  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts persist in pushing international peacekeeping because there seems no 
alternative for maintaining order. As U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali said it in a recent news conference: "Public opinion in the 
United States is not eager for that country to play the role of world 
policeman. The United Nations is there to do that job, and there is a consensus 
that despite all the difficulties, despite all the contradictions, the only 
forum existing today that can play this role is the United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
 As he prepared to sign PRD 13, Clinton evidently agreed -- though with a good 
number of conditions. U.N. peacekeeping may still be the fashionable defense 
policy of the day, but a lot of problems have to be cleared up, including the 
exact nature of U.S. participation, the quick assembly of forces and the 
untangling of command in small U.N. armies made up of many nationalities. 
Peacekeeping is undergoing a hard look these days. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer locked into impotence by U.S.-Soviet enmity and vetoes, the Security 
Council has dealt with a rash of crises by dispatching peacekeeping missions 
throughout the world. In the first 40 years, the Security Council authorized 13 
peacekeeping operations. In the last nine years, it has launched 20. As of 
March, the United Nations ran 17 peacekeeping missions with 72,000 troops and 
police at an annual cost of $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The more recent missions have been far more complex than the old missions, 
which amounted to little more than patrolling of cease-fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peacekeeping done by a British cop with just a whistle and no stick is no 
longer feasible," said Gen. Philippe Morillon of France after his return from 
command of the U.N. operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Several of the newer 
missions -- such as those in Bosnia and Somalia -- involve enforcement of order 
and the creation of national institutions, such as a police force and a 
judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Somalia withdrawal, the U.S. contribution of peacekeepers 
is meager. The United States now has 714 troops in three missions: the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, western Sahara and Israeli cease-fire lines. 
Thirty other countries -- led by France with 6,603 troops deployed -- have more 
peacekeepers on U.N. duty. Even tiny Jordan has dispatched almost five times as 
many. The U.S. hesitation has created resentment in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never have clean wars," Morillon said, evidently exasperated by the 
Clinton Administration's peacekeeping policy. "You have to be ready to fight, 
you have to be ready to die. Clean wars do not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States is not the only country wary of peacekeeping now that it 
has taken ugly turns. After 10 Belgian paratroopers were killed in Rwanda in a 
vain attempt to save the life of the prime minister from marauding Hutus in 
early April, Belgium announced that it was withdrawing its troops from the U.N. 
peacekeeping mission there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, though all worry about public opinion, democratic governments 
such as France, Britain and Canada are far more willing to let their troops don 
the United Nations' blue helmets and berets than the United States. U.S. 
officials and members of Congress often rationalize the U.S. reluctance by 
saying that U.S. soldiers are more vulnerable than others because gunmen relish 
the prestige of killing a representative of the world's only superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 While this may be true, the U.S. reluctance still handicaps the United Nations 
sorely, because many governments tend to follow Washington's lead. When Clinton 
decided to withdraw the Americans from Somalia, Kofi Annan of Ghana, the 
undersecretary general for peacekeeping, said it was difficult to persuade 
other world leaders to send troops to an area that the U.S. President believes 
is too dangerous for his own troops. The U.N. mission in Somalia is now 
dominated by India, Pakistan and other Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the contents of PRD 13 have not been made public, Assistant Secretary 
of Defense Edward L. Warner III revealed the essential details in testimony a 
few weeks ago before a Senate Armed Services subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner said that, under the new policy, the United States would take part in a 
U.N. peacekeeping mission only when: 
</P>
<P>
 * The mission advances U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * The level of risk is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 * The operation would fail without U.S. participation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The probable length and exit date for the mission are known. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, U.S. forces would always be under U.S. command, meaning the 
President and U.S. officers would always have the final authority to issue 
orders covering every aspect of U.S. military operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in some cases, the Clinton Administration might put the U.S. troops under 
U.N. control, meaning a U.N. commander could assign a task for a U.S. unit to 
do under its American commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner also said that the United States, which is now assessed 31% of U.N. 
peacekeeping costs, would try to reduce that assessment to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 While trying to produce a coherent policy on peacekeeping, the Clinton 
Administration has been skittish for months about seeming gung-ho. Warner's 
testimony reflected this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace operations are not the centerpiece of U.S. foreign and defense policy," 
he said. "Our peacekeeping policy review has not been an effort to expand U.N. 
peacekeeping or U.S. involvement in U.N. operations. Rather, it is an effort to 
improve the U.N. and its ability to undertake peace operations . . . and to 
make better use of American contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he also testified that the Pentagon had started training military units 
for "the unique challenges associated with peace operations" and was developing 
new equipment, such as "belly plates" for armored personnel carriers, and 
non-lethal crowd control weapons for peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, the conditions laid down in PRD 13, if followed 
strictly, would likely keep U.S. troops out of most peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you need to know the exit date before you go into an operation," a former 
senior official of the State Department said, "you will never go in." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials were angered last September when Clinton, addressing the 
General Assembly, said: "If the American people are to say yes to peacekeeping, 
the United Nations must know when to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 His phrasing skirted the fact that the United States, with its veto in the 
Security Council, could have stopped any peacekeeping operation it did not 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright has tried to scale down and 
even prevent some peacekeeping missions -- even when they are supported by 
traditional U.S. allies Britain and France. Under U.S. pressure, for example, 
the Security Council authorized 3,300 extra peacekeepers for the "safe areas" 
of Bosnia in March rather than the 10,000 requested by Secretary General 
Boutros-Ghali. The siege of Gorazde soon underscored the desperate need for 
more peacekeepers, and the United States gave in a month later and voted with 
the rest of the council to approve the other troops.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's hesitation has also weakened the United Nations' 
campaign to speed up the time it takes to start a mission. For a year, Col. 
Gerard Gambiez of France, on special assignment for the United Nations, has led 
a task force trying to persuade governments to set aside trained units that the 
secretary general could call up when he needed to assemble a peacekeeping 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 This troubled U.S. officials at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "My American friends think I am talking about a standing army, which is not 
the case," Gambiez said recently. What his task force wanted, he said, was for 
governments to designate trained troops that could be called up when the 
Security Council authorized a mission. Despite the commitments, governments 
could still refuse to dispatch the troops if the proposed mission troubled 
them. Moreover, knowing the Clinton Administration's reluctance to send U.S. 
soldiers into peacekeeping missions, Gambiez asked the United States to commit 
resources such as transport and communications rather than soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need paratroopers," Gambiez said. "We need things that are much more 
precious and that are too expensive for other countries to provide. . . . We 
can play without the United States, but it would be a pity." 
</P>
<P>
 At an April 14 meeting with U.N. diplomats, Gambiez announced that 18 
countries had signed agreements with the United Nations to designate 28,000 
troops as standby forces for peacekeeping. In addition, he said that 13 other 
governments were engaged in serious negotiations that could result in signed 
agreements for 42,000 more troops -- making a total standby force of 70,000, 
about the same number that are now in the field. The colonel did not identify 
all the governments that had signed agreements but later told reporters that 
France was one. 
</P>
<P>
 The session produced a sign of cooperation from the Clinton Administration. 
Albright's deputy, Ambassador Karl F. Inderfurth, told the meeting that the 
U.S. government welcomed the work of the task force and would soon provide the 
United Nations with a detailed "listing of the (U.S.) military capabilities it 
feels most appropriate for peacekeeping purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Inderfurth said the Clinton Administration would not sign any agreement 
and that the list "in no way implies a commitment to provide these 
capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Gambiez hailed the promise of a list as a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what I want," he told reporters. "This is what I have been 
waiting for. I want to know what they will make available to us. I do not need 
a piece of paper. They cannot sign for internal political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 A constant refrain comes from Clinton Administration officials, members of 
Congress and think tank analysts when they discuss peacekeeping: that there 
often is confusion over who is really in charge. This issue is heightened by 
the feeling among many outsiders and, in fact, insiders as well, that U.N. 
bureaucrats are often inept. 
</P>
<P>
 The command in Bosnia has long been entangled in crossed signals and 
recriminations -- not surprising in a mission with confused goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations has acted both as an impartial referee distributing food to 
all and as a protector of besieged towns from Serbian aggression. Military 
decisions have been made by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, U.N. 
peacekeeping commanders and U.N. bureaucrats. The secretary general, a 
professor and diplomat with no military experience, has had final authority to 
decide when and when not to bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 This has bruised feelings. In a letter that has never been published by the 
United Nations, Gen. Jean Cot of France, the former commander of the U.N. 
Protection Force in the former Yugoslav republics, complained to Boutros-Ghali 
in January that the duties of the force commander and the secretary general's 
special representative were "incompatible' -- a euphemistic way of saying their 
roles clashed -- and that bureaucrats in New York "have rapidly made me the 
object of day and night harassment on minor problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Cot also said the system for U.N. civilian approval of air support was so 
cumbersome as to weaken the credibility of air power as a deterrent. He 
requested the authority to order NATO air support on his own in case of attacks 
on the Sarajevo airport, a U.N. military base or any humanitarian operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boutros-Ghali refused and later removed Cot and Lt. Gen. Francis 
Briquemont of Belgium, who was the commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia, for 
challenging the authority of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue erupted again on April 23 when NATO decided to bomb the Bosnian 
Serbs for defying an ultimatum by continuing to shell Gorazde. The NATO 
decision was vetoed by Yasushi Akashi of Japan, the secretary general's special 
representative, who insisted that the Serbs would end their siege that night. 
In the end, Akashi was proven correct, and many Western governments were 
probably relieved that there had been no bombing, but Akashi's defiance of NATO 
still irritated many U.S. and European officials. Largest Peacekeeping

 The United States, despite boasting one of the world's largest armies, has 
made a relatively small contribution, in terms of soldiers, to United Nations 
peacekeeping missions. Thirty countries, many of them with armed forces just a 
fraction of the size of the U.S. military, had more personnel assigned to U.N. 
contingents as of March 31. Following is a list of the top 25 nations in terms

THE WEEK AHEAD: PANAMA CITY; NEW FACE FOR PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Panamanians will vote Sunday in their first presidential election since a U.S. 
military invasion ousted strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Perez Balladares, candidate of the party that backed Noriega, leads in 
the polls, while entertainer Ruben Blades is surging into a strong second 
position in the last week of campaigning.Blades, known as the salsa king of 
Latin music, has long taken an interest in his country's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner replaces Guillermo Endara, whose election victory in May, 1989, was 
annulled by Noriega, but who was given the office after the American invasion. 
Under Panamanian law, a president cannot succeed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The new president is expected to oversee the delivery of the Panama Canal to 
full Panamanian control before the year 2000.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; TURNING GUNS TO PLOWSHARES; MUSLIMS AND CROATS ARE MOVING 
OUT OF THE TRENCHES AND INTO THE FIELDS IN BOSNIA TRUCE AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been two years since Ferid Smajlogic traded his business suits and 
briefcase for a camouflage uniform and a gun, and the notion of resuming his 
job as an export manager at a paper mill remains just a soldier's fantasy about 
the good life that will come when war is over. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a truce takes hold among Bosnian Muslims and Croats who inhabit the 
stretches of the country that Serbian nationalists failed to conquer, the 
factory workers, farmers and others who were mobilized to defend their turf 
have begun to seriously contemplate a future as civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every Bosnian male between 16 and 60 was drafted into the war effort 
after Bosnian Serbs rebelled against independence in March, 1992, leaving the 
civilian economy to founder and public services to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Muslim-led government and Croatian rebels agreed in March to 
reconcile in the regions they control, a coordinated effort has been launched 
by U.N. troops, aid workers and war-weary citizens to move men out of the 
trenches and into the work of rebuilding a ravaged state. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatians like Smajlogic, home on furlough, pitch in with neighbors to repair 
water pumps, shell-shattered windows and tractors. Women and pensioners, helped 
by older children, are preparing ground for the first crops in two years. 
Relief workers are sweeping debris out of schools that became refugee centers 
and bomb shelters, restoring classrooms for the day when local authorities 
decide the artillery bombardment has stopped for good. 
</P>
<P>
 But military commanders, whose power and authority were inflated by 
responsibility for marshaling a defense, are resisting the transition that will 
once again relegate them to the periphery. And even fatigued fighters such as 
Smajlogic concede that their communities remain too vulnerable to immediately 
recall fighters from the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be able to come back from the front as soon as possible and get 
back to work with civilian things, like getting water and electricity restored 
to our homes," said Smajlogic, a Muslim. "We're sick of war, but we need some 
guarantees that it is really over. It is not up to us whether it ends or not. 
You have to keep in mind that the Chetniks are right above us." 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian nationalists, labeled Chetniks by their enemies in reference to the 
savage Serbian royalist forces that fought against Ottoman Turkish rule in 
centuries past, remain in possession of 70% of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, Bosnia-Herzegovina is divided by religions -- the Eastern 
Orthodox Christian Serbs, the Roman Catholic Croats and the Muslim Slavs, who 
are a plurality in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 A new federation has been proclaimed by Muslims and Croats in what is left of 
the country that was home to all three groups for centuries before the former 
Yugoslav federation began splintering in 1991. But many remain wary of the 
prospects for a genuine and lasting peace while they are surrounded by Serbian 
gunmen who seem destined to keep most of the land they have seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The question that hangs over central Bosnia and stalls the desired return to 
civilian activity is whether the outgunned Muslims and Croats who make up the 
majority of this country's population are willing to give up the goal of 
liberating Serb-occupied regions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officers and Western mediators say they see the vanquished Muslim-led 
government as having little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is completely out the window here. The deutsche mark is the only 
power, and the only vehicles you see on the roads are U.N. and (foreign) 
press," said Maj. Mike James, spokesman for the British U.N. battalion in 
Vitez. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a military-controlled area because of the war. We're just 
starting to see civilians taking over some services from the military, but 
those in the military don't much like giving up that control," James added. 
"Demilitarization is occurring, but so far only to a very small extent. Nothing 
is going to happen here overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes time to get beyond the fact that Muslims and Croats were battling 
each other over the past year. Armed checkpoints are still maintained by the 
ostensibly reconciled Muslims and Croats at the perimeter of each town, village 
or hamlet. But movement among the communities that were at odds during a year 
of Muslim-Croat fighting has intensified since heavy artillery was withdrawn 
from the area last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Highways that once carried heavy traffic from the suburbs to the cities are 
now filled with people making their way on foot to visit families and check on 
the homes they were driven from during the Croat-Muslim falling-out. 
</P>
<P>
 The most visible change from the past year, when people huddled in shelters as 
all three armed factions fought for territory, is the legion of people tilling 
the soil in preparation for spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nusret Sahbaz, a 45-year-old union administrator for utility workers, used his 
first leave from army logistics work to hoe a patch of farmland for his family 
in a publicly owned field in Maglaj that had been fallow for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his industriousness, Sahbaz said he remained skeptical that he and 
other furloughed fighters would be left to plant in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the aggressors are pushed back from Sarajevo and other cities they 
surround, there will be no hope that it is really settled," Sahbaz worried 
aloud as he turned over the weed-choked earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Muslims, who suffered hunger when Serbian and Croatian nationalists 
cinched off supply lines to starve them out, have made the planting of 
subsistence crops such as corn, beans and vegetables a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has put together 400,000 
"family packs" of seeds and gardening materials to allow the Muslims to plant 
their own food. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be big spinoff benefits from this. It's good for their mental 
health, because once the seeds are distributed, people are taking control of 
their own destiny and won't be so reliant on foreign aid," said Todd Cleaver, a 
New Zealander working with the U.S.-based International Rescue Committee in 
nearby Zenica. 
</P>
<P>
 IRC, the agency distributing the farming packets, has encountered numerous 
obstacles imposed by local government officials and war profiteers who have 
sought to control the flow of reconstruction aid to the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest growth industries here is going to be the mafia," Cleaver 
predicted. "It happens after any war, when people want to get into positions of 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the setbacks of occasional attacks by Serbian forces and resistance to 
restoring civilian control, signs abound throughout central Bosnia that 
war-weary residents are pushing their leaders to pay more attention to 
regaining normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools are already starting to reopen, and there is a lot of interest 
expressed by municipal authorities in having us bring in basic supplies, like 
books and pens," said Steven Corliss of the U.N. refugee agency's office in 
Zenica. 
</P>
<P>
 Many school buildings sustained major damage from shelling, and others are 
still being used to house refugees displaced from towns and villages now 
occupied by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from chalk to textbooks must be imported, as all Bosnian factories 
except those producing armaments were shut down over the past two years as 
workers were drafted into the defense effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects aimed at jump-starting the stalled civilian economy include 
repairing hospitals and providing equipment and medicine for basic health care; 
reconnecting utilities and starting up factories to produce vital products and 
jobs, and building homes for upward of 1 million Bosnians who are unlikely ever 
to be permitted to return to homes in Serb-occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to think about population shifts," the IRC's Cleaver said of the 
large number of Bosnians who will have to be permanently resettled once a 
negotiated division of the country is brokered and ethnic segregation is, in 
effect, given the West's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some refugees have already moved into homes and apartments abandoned by Serbs 
who feared reprisals after their nationalist brethren opened fire on central 
Bosnian communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took over a Chetnik apartment -- they took ours, so why not?" said Zlata 
Basic, 39, who was driven by the Serbs from the village of Jablanica, a mile 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her three children insist they will go home again if the Serbs lose. 
They reject any suggestion that they might be compelled by a negotiated 
compromise to forgo the lost territory and make a new life in their place of 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the territorial status quo is little changed by toothless diplomacy, 
and life in exile for people like Zlata Basic drags on for years, some aid 
officials and Western mediators believe the refugees' current places of shelter 
will eventually be considered their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, fear that the nurtured dreams of all displaced Bosnians to 
return to their own land and homes will fuel considerable doubts that the war 
is over and that stability and prosperity can be rebuilt in Bosnia's segregated 
and diminished territory.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; NUCLEAR TUSSLE RAISES THE STAKES IN KOREAN WAITING GAME; 
WASHINGTON EXPECTS NORTH KOREA TO COLLAPSE WHEN LEADER KIM DIES. MEANWHILE, IT 
TRIES TO AVOID PROVOKING THE NORTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 U.S. Army Capt. Kevin C. Warren gestures toward the North Korean outpost on 
the next ridge and muses how he has become part of a test of wills that has 
gone on for almost 41 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Little has changed here since July, 1953, when North and South Korea signed a 
fragile armistice. North Korea still is run as a Stalinist regime. Its troops 
stand guard grimly at the border. Tensions are high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a waiting game," Warren concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, the contest has taken on a new urgency as the Clinton 
Administration, moving to block the Pyongyang government's bid to build a 
nuclear arsenal, has rekindled some of the passion in North Korea's defiance of 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiting game has intensified as the United States and South Korea try to 
nudge Pyongyang into halting its nuclear weapons program without setting off a 
backlash that might spur North Korea into military action. 
</P>
<P>
 For the immediate term, the United States is patiently trying to coax the 
North Koreans into allowing international inspection of all their nuclear 
facilities by late summer, in time to determine whether one of the last 
redoubts of communism is going to reprocess more of its spent plutonium into 
material for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the long haul, Washington is waiting for death to come to Kim Il Sung -- 
the 82-year-old North Korean dictator, known to his countrymen as the Great 
Leader, who has been the country's unchallenged power since before the 1953 
Korean War armistice. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. analysts believe that, with no clear successor in sight, the Pyongyang 
regime is likely to collapse after Kim dies and that the country will be 
absorbed by South Korea, much as East Germany was taken in by West Germany. 
"Once he goes, I'd give things about six months before the (Korean) Peninsula 
is reunified," one well-placed U.S. official says. "The question is, what 
happens in between?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the interim, the Administration, under pressure from a nervous South Korea 
to be patient and not provoke Kim unnecessarily, has settled into a 1990s 
waiting game more subtle than the one that began in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 On the diplomatic front, Washington is retreating from the hard-line stance 
that it took in March when it threatened North Korea with everything from 
economic sanctions to a possible preemptive military strike to prod it to 
comply with international inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 After conferring with South Korean leaders late last month, U.S. Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry sounded a more conciliatory tone, even putting off a 
controversial decision on whether to hold the annual U.S.-South Korean military 
games. Pyongyang had railed that it would regard resumption of the "Team 
Spirit" exercises as an "act of war." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Administration has been moving quietly, but determinedly, to 
provide a long list of equipment designed to help fill worrisome gaps in the 
military capabilities of U.S. and South Korean forces here. Seoul, for example, 
will bolster its current arsenal with sophisticated artillery-locating radar, 
precision-guided antitank weapons, improved communications equipment and more 
night-vision goggles. 
</P>
<P>
 And last month, the first shipment of 48 Patriot air-defense missile launchers 
and Apache attack helicopters, which Washington has deployed to help strengthen 
American defenses here, arrived in the southern port of Pusan. The batteries 
became operational this week. 
</P>
<P>
 There also has been a noticeable cooling in the rhetoric south of the DMZ. 
Only a few weeks ago, for example, Perry had warned that the United States 
would do whatever it took to halt Pyongyang's nuclear program. But more 
recently, he has pledged that "the United States will not initiate a war" or 
even "provoke a war by any rash actions on the peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 "What talk you hear occasionally in the media of war is entirely 
inappropriate," he told a news conference on his trip here. 
</P>
<P>
 The abrupt switch in U.S. strategy stems from several factors. First, the 
previous, more-bellicose approach did not work, only prompting Kim to dig his 
heels in more. Pyongyang vowed that Seoul would become a "sea of flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the South Koreans -- who, after all, would suffer the brunt of the 
damage if North Korea ever decided to attack -- had become decidedly nervous 
about the impact of the U.S. saber-rattling. Seoul clearly wanted a change. 
</P>
<P>
 The two governments finally saw an opening when Kim himself turned 
unexpectedly more conciliatory, delivering a rare speech in which he denied any 
nuclear ambitions and vowed to let inspectors in. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Perry and his South Korean counterparts lost no time in praising the 
address -- albeit warily -- as encouraging. Within a few hours, the United 
States softened its approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, despite all the worry in Washington about a possible North Korean 
attack, those who confront the North Koreans here every day essentially agree 
with Perry's assessment that there is no sign yet of imminent war. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, whose battalion patrols the 4-kilometer-deep stretch of mountainous 
land that is the DMZ, says there have been no unusual troop movements recently 
north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not seeing anything different," he says. "It was kind of tense during 
last November, when there was all that war talk in the papers. But since then, 
it's died down." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Air Force Capt. Pat Lee, who flies an A-10 "Warthog" jet from Osan Air 
Base a few miles from the North Korean border, says he too has not noticed any 
unusual troop activity -- on either side of the DMZ. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to tell whether the Administration's new approach on the 
nuclear proliferation issue is working. Pyongyang last week rejected the latest 
Western demand that it allow international inspection to sample spent fuel rods 
from its big reactor at Yongbyon to see whether North Korea is reprocessing 
them to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Han Sung Joo, South Korea's suave foreign minister, plays the waiting game as 
deftly as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any policy of just waiting for the North Koreans to 
collapse," he asserts at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds, an instant later: "We have to deal with the situation" as it exists. 
Defending Two Koreas 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has a larger army than South Korea and more combat equipment in 
many categories despite spending less. These charts do not reflect the latest 
U.S. sales to the South, including antitank weapons and air-defense missile 
launchers. SPENDING 03,17,13,17 North South On defense $5 billion* $12.2

THE PRESS; WORLD MEDIA HAIL SOUTH AFRICAN VOTE AS A TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's landmark elections in South Africa turned the page to a new era. 
Although credit is due to all South Africans, whose courage and determination 
were finally rewarded when balloting began last Tuesday, many singled out 
President Frederik W. de Klerk and African National Congress leader Nelson 
Mandela, expected to become the country's first black president. A look at 
world reaction to the elections: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday was a marvelous moment in modern history, a day which will be 
relived in the memory as a triumph of hope over despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "For millions of black South Africans the first experience of voting was more, 
much more, than a mere process of marking a ballot-paper. It was an affirmation 
of human dignity. It made them free citizens in a free nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened in that beautiful, tortured land is a political miracle. 
The credit belongs equally to F.W. de Klerk, who so bravely found a way out of 
the grisly grasp of apartheid, and to Nelson Mandela, a man great enough to 
rise above the temptations of hatred and vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Daily Mail , London 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, apartheid is gone. But there is no quick fix for all the lives broken by 
family separations, the missed chances at education and the glaring economic 
inequalities that continue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Huge challenges await the new government. In a country where half the

 "Despite the horrible violence that has occurred, South Africa's transition to 
democracy has been far more peaceful than it might have been were it not for 
the Nobel-Peace-Prize-winning leadership of (Nelson) Mandela and President F.W. 
de Klerk. . . . Paradise is not around the corner. But black South Africans now 
at least have the power to build a better future."

 "The revolution in South Africa . . . is the capping stone of the process of 
decolonizing Africa, the high point in the democratization of the world toward 
the end of the century. (Israel) has been following (the elections) like others 
are following them, but also because of the great similarity between the 
compromise that has been taking shape there since the rise of De Klerk to 
government and our peace process. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason for the determination (to reach a solution) on the part of the 
leaders in South Africa is the fact that terrorism and political violence there 
soars high above that which is to be found here, but the lesson is relevant for 
us regardless: Without shared determination, without mutual aid and working 
together out of a desire to build a new reality . . . it is impossible to turn 
enemies into partners."

 "What saved the day was the realization by all political leaders, irrespective 
of race and color, that their own people would never forgive them for letting 
opportunity pass by. Hence, the stirring of hope at almost every level, and the 
repudiation of traditional posturing. For instance, black politicians did not 
object to the biggest peacetime military call-up in South Africa's history or 
to Mr. de Klerk's decision to post 100,000 police officers . . . at 9,514 
polling stations. It is hoped that this cooperative spirit will survive the 
elections."

 "On the one hand, the United States of America has tried to achieve total 
transparency -- a multicultural utopia -- and has failed, as black lesbians are 
pitted against handicapped Hispanics in a welter of political correctness. On 
the other hand, South Africa is now attempting to do what seems obsolete in the 
States: to achieve the blind ideal of a uniformity which outshines all 
differences. South Africa as a melting pot, and the United States as a land of 
apartheid of the neo-separatists?"

 "Whatever challenges South Africa faces after the election, it is of historic 
importance that nearly 20 million disenfranchised blacks will this week join a 
political process built on the wreckage of apartheid. Cracks began to appear in 
the structure of the old system in the 1980s. But few, if any, could have 
foreseen that a decade later the majority black population would be on the 
brink of taking power. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The voting . . . will not solve South Africa's problems; years of enlightened 
government will be needed to overcome the evils of apartheid. . . . But that 
should not prevent us from welcoming the last great act of decolonization in 
Africa, nearly 350 years after the Dutch first landed at the Cape."

 "Through the course of almost three and a half centuries, the South African 
black population has suffered a racist nightmare and has waged a struggle, many 
times ignored and silent, to convert its dream of liberty into reality. These 
elections mark the end of a historic era. However, the convulsed internal 
political scene clouds the optimism and raises a question: Has the dream of 
liberty been achieved? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be easy to erradicate from the entrails of the local society the 
vices and violence engendered by more than three centuries of racism. The reins 
of the economy are in the hands of the white minority, the great majority of 
the black population lives in poverty and the youth are tired of their 
situation. To make the dream of liberty a living reality will be a titanic 
task."

NEXT STEP; FOR PLO, A LONG CLIMB OUT OF CHAOS; THE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP IS 
ILL-PREPARED TO TAKE OVER HEALTH CARE, SCHOOLS AND WELFARE IN OCCUPIED LANDS. 
AND TIME IS SHORT.

<P>
 During the hours after a Jewish settler killed about 30 Palestinians in a 
Hebron mosque last February, another human catastrophe unfolded -- this one 
with little notice -- on the West Bank. It was a disaster that tragically 
illustrated chaos within the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership, 
which soon will take control of parts of the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 As the world recoiled at the slayings inside Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs, 
untrained Palestinian ambulance drivers with no radio equipment or paramedic 
skills took dozens of wounded survivors to the wrong hospitals, failed to 
perform basic first aid and contributed to a death toll that exceeded 53 that 
day, according to a monthlong investigation by Palestinian health experts. 
</P>
<P>
 One man who had been shot in a leg artery, for example, died after being 
driven more than 40 miles -- past at least one hospital with an emergency room 
-- without benefit of first aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the injured died of treatable wounds because emergency room entrances 
were clogged with family members and blood donors, the study found. Still 
others, it said, could have been saved if the Israelis had provided more 
ambulances, better emergency room facilities and proper radio communications in 
the West Bank and Gaza territories it has occupied for the past 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had there been a proper first-aid and triage system in Hebron," the report 
concluded, "it is doubtless that some lives would have been saved." 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths documented the sad state of basic human services in the occupied 
territories and, according to Dr. Mustafa Bargouthi, the Palestinian author of 
the study, they also underscored the scant progress the PLO leadership has made 
in laying the groundwork for new and improved services in the areas where it 
hopes soon to begin autonomous rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian technocrats have been waiting months for their political 
leadership to approve plans for an emergency health care system that would 
include inexpensive paramedic training in the territories, Bargouthi said. 
Instead, the leaders have been negotiating with potential international donors 
for a costly medical infrastructure that will take years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care is only one of dozens of critical social needs that Bargouthi, a 
physician and public health expert, and other Palestinians in the territories 
say their political leaders in Tunis, Tunisia, and their negotiators in Cairo 
have yet to address. Among the others are education, telecommunications and 
social welfare in the future autonomous zone. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior U.S. official put it recently: "There is a race here against time. 
. . . Everything must be done to help the Palestinians get their house in order 
before a final agreement is signed, or else they will be unable to bring the 
visible changes they will need on the ground to make this thing work." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, the Israeli and Palestinian sides, meeting under American and 
Egyptian mediation in Cairo, said substantial progress had been made on the 
deal to launch autonomous Palestinian rule in Gaza and Jericho, the initial 
step in the long process of building peace. The agreement could be signed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with several key Palestinian leaders and professionals in 
Jerusalem and throughout the territories, it was clear that money is only a 
part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Palestinians assigned by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to build the 
basic structures of a new society share a growing frustration with their 
leadership. All complained about poor communication, a lack of coordination and 
priorities that differ vastly from those of the PLO leaders who are negotiating 
the political deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's handpicked representatives agreed that the need for a semblance of 
bureaucratic order is urgent. Most also conceded that they have yet to meet 
that need. And, they admit, ominously, that if they fail, most Palestinians 
will abandon Arafat's PLO in favor of the more radical and fundamentalist 
Islamic groups that oppose the PLO's peacemaking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very limited window in which to succeed, or else it will be total 
chaos," said Hassan abu Libdeh, deputy director of the PLO's powerful economic 
committee, which is overseeing the Palestinians' nation-building efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as yet, no, I cannot say our house is anywhere near in order." 
</P>
<P>
 The inadequate emergency health care system is a critical case in point, 
according to Bargouthi, who is a member of the PLO's negotiating committee on 
health, education, culture, women and information services. It was his West 
Bank-based Health Development Information Project that conducted the study on 
Hebron's post-massacre emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks since the massacre, Bargouthi said, PLO negotiators in Cairo have 
continued to ignore recommendations on the need for education and in emergency 
health care, focusing instead on costlier, higher-profile items such as 
buildings and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, Bargouthi said the PLO recently sought and won a Japanese grant 
of $3 million worth of high-tech diagnostic gear, including four new kidney 
dialysis machines, for a hospital that has yet to be built in Jericho, a town 
of 8,000 that will serve as the PLO's capital in the first stage of autonomy. 
But not a cent has been sought, he added, for such basic needs as paramedic 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creating systems is the least expensive part of development," Bargouthi said. 
"It's much less expensive to train dozens of ambulance drivers than it is to 
buy a single ambulance." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the sentiments of fellow technocrats working in the territories during 
many of the years that Arafat and his political inner circle have been in 
exile, Bargouthi accused the leadership of benign neglect. He said his 
committee sent 600 documents covering every detail of setting up a health care 
system to the PLO's chief negotiators months ago but has yet to receive a 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 As with emergency care, that neglect has taken a human toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Libdeh, whom Arafat appointed to the task of creating the economic 
infrastructure of a future Palestine, cited a glaring example of the PLO's 
failure to start a solid system: rehabilitation programs for the thousands of 
Palestinian prisoners who have been or will be released from Israeli jails -- 
among them men who have been the backbone of Arafat's organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The money for rehabilitation is there, Libdeh said. More than $13 million has 
been donated by the European Union and Switzerland. A detailed program for 
vocational training and psychological treatment has been submitted to the PLO 
leadership in Tunis. But no action has been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why? I don't know. Because we're stupid?" Libdeh, who has a doctorate in 
statistics from Cornell and a master's degree from Stanford, said with a laugh. 
"No, it is the bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Libdeh, whose committee is the official conduit for the $2.4 billion 
in international aid the world has committed to the Palestinians, stressed that 
the PLO leadership alone cannot bear the blame for its failure to implement 
changes. "The international community has played a major role in this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $2.4 billion that was pledged during a fund-raising conference in 
Washington last year, Libdeh said, only $70 million has been delivered -- a 
third of it in the form of a World Bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the international aid is tied to a final autonomy agreement, which has 
been delayed by a spiraling cycle of violence involving groups opposed to the 
peace process and has produced a series of massacres that have left scores of 
Jews and Palestinians dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the negotiations also have bogged down in disputes both petty and crucial. 
And countries such as the United States, which has pledged more than $400 
million, will not release those funds until Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin reach final agreement on implementation of the initial autonomy 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Libdeh said the United States and other nations "are using this as a hammer to 
shape us," insisting that his committee could do more if it had more resources 
to work with in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, this process is a bloody one, and, since it began, no delivery," he 
said. "The economy is worse. The standard of life is on a sliding scale 
downward. So what's happening is, by the time the signing occurs, nobody will 
care anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Palestinians say money is the least of the factors to blame for the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real chaos just in the way decisions are being made," said Daoud 
Kuttab, a businessman and film producer who has been frustrated in trying to 
help build a Palestinian broadcasting operation that would help the PLO 
reinforce its message to an increasingly skeptical Palestinian public. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the television station, Kuttab said, Israel bears part of the 
blame; it has approved but not released the frequency needed for the station to 
go on the air. "But the problem also is political appointees rather than 
professional appointments. And I would put this in the category of 
indifference," he said, adding that even if the frequency were released now, it 
would take weeks or months to get it on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat and the people around him are simply too busy to pay attention to the 
broadcasting operation. . . . The PLO has put absolutely no money into this 
project. Their attitude is: 'If it succeeds, fine. If it doesn't, that's OK 
too.' But it is a very important tool to get in place here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he remains optimistic despite the frustration, Kuttab reflected 
the general mood of most Palestinian professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," he said. "I think we will look back on these days and laugh somehow. 
But in the meantime, it's going to be very, very painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Bargouthi said the Palestinian leadership has a tailor-made solution to the 
problem already in place: There are 830 Palestinian non-governmental 
organizations in fields ranging from health care to education and 
rehabilitation that have been functioning for years in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he explained why Arafat has not simply plugged those organizations into a 
new governmental structure. "It is because you have many people from outside 
who want to come in and take these posts," he said of exiled leaders such as 
Arafat, who will assume key positions of power in lands they haven't seen in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is, the needs are tremendous. The expectations are very 
high. And the resources are limited. People will see their lives deteriorating 
at a time when their expectations have never been higher, and they will turn to 
(the militant fundamentalist group) Hamas and the other radical organizations 
who are opposed to this peace process."

POSTSCRIPT; GERMANY TAKES NEW LOOK AT BUCHENWALD'S HISTORY; COMMUNIST-ERA 
EXHIBITS WILL BE OVERHAULED TO REFLECT SOVIET ROLE AND THE DIVERSITY OF 
INMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In front of the barbed-wire fence and iron gate of Buchenwald concentration 
camp stands a refurbished bear house, part of what once was the Buchenwald 
Zoological Garden for Nazi guards and their children in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In the forest behind the wind-swept camp, temporary crosses and stones mark 
mass graves for thousands of inmates who died in Buchenwald after the war, when 
Soviet occupation forces held prisoners there. 
</P>
<P>
 These new markers signal a sweeping renovation of Buchenwald memorials, one 
that historians say will give a broader and more accurate view of the camp near 
this historic German town about 150 miles southwest of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The current displays were designed by the Communist government of the former 
East Germany and tend to glorify German Communist inmates' resistance to the 
Nazis while giving short shrift to the plight of Jews, Gypsies and other people 
who were imprisoned in the camp during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no mention at all of the Soviet-era camp operation in the displays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a historically true, proportional picture of the concentration camp 
to be presented to the public," said Stuttgart University historian Eberhard 
Jaeckel, chairman of the committee overseeing the changes. "There was an 
over-accentuation of Communist prisoners (under the East German 
administration). The commission realized early on that the role of Jewish 
inmates was neglected, that, in the last years of the war, more than 90% of the 
inmates were foreigners -- Poles and Russians." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan announced last month, the East German portrait of 
Buchenwald will itself become an exhibit, Jaeckel said, "to show how the camp 
was used to produce legitimacy for the regime of the German Democratic 
Republic." 
</P>
<P>
 Politics, as before, will play a role in the depictions of what happened at 
Buchenwald. This renovation has been controversial, particularly among former 
Communist inmates who believe rightists are rewriting their history to play 
down the resistance, and among Jews who fear that Nazi and Soviet crimes will 
be put on a par; about 56,000 people died in Buchenwald under the Nazis and 
about 7,100 under the Soviets, but many of the latter victims were Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials have tried to assuage these concerns. The new museum plan 
calls for three separate exhibits: the principal exhibit on the Nazi camp from 
1937 to 1945; a smaller one on the Soviet era from 1945 to 1950, and a third on 
East Germany's use of Buchenwald as a museum until 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum will be shut down in the fall for renovation and reopen next April 
for the 50th anniversary of the camp's liberation by Allied forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Rikola Luettgenau, a historian who has helped to shape the concept for the new 
museum, says that East German curators operated under the motto "Preserve the 
fire from the past, not the ashes." Consequently, he says, the museum did not 
adequately show the horrors of World War II Buchenwald, the SS officers and how 
the camp fit into the Nazi state. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchenwald was not only a prison and sometime execution camp. It was also a 
training center for 3,000 to 4,000 Waffen SS troops, and it provided forced 
labor for V-2 rocket production in an underground factory at an adjacent camp, 
Mittelbau-Dora. Waffen SS men and their families lived just outside the 
perimeter of Buchenwald; the zoo was established to provide them with amusement 
and relief from job stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the SS, it was not a problem to have a zoo 20 meters in front of a 
crematory. We want visitors to ask these questions: Why did the SS have a zoo? 
How did they live in two worlds, a zoo and a concentration camp?" Luettgenau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchenwald was built in 1937 to imprison Nazi political enemies. The following 
year, ethnic inmates -- Jews, Poles and others who did not fit into the Nazi 
scheme -- were locked behind the gate with iron letters spelling "Jedem Das 
Seine" ("To Each What He Deserves"). More than 250,000 people passed through 
Buchenwald under the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp was not a mass extermination center on the scale of Auschwitz, but 
thousands were executed. At least 8,484 Soviet prisoners of war were shot; 
other prisoners were shot, hanged or received lethal injections; many more died 
of hunger and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Under East German curators, the crematory became a memorial to Ernst 
Thaelmann, "a leader of the German working class" shot in front of the building 
on Aug. 18, 1944. The plaque honoring him will remain under the new plan but 
with additional information, such as the fact that he also was a member of the 
prewar German Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Communists were among the first prisoners in Buchenwald, they held 
positions of power within the camp organization. They organized secret 
resistance groups that experimented with making explosives in a camp cellar, 
collected weapons and saved hundreds of children from starvation and death. At 
the end of the war, they helped keep prisoners from being marched out of the 
camp with fleeing SS troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all Communist inmates will be treated as heroes. Communist Party files 
opened after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 suggest that some prisoners 
collaborated with the SS. Others apparently put the names of Jews and Gypsies 
on lists of inmates to be shipped out of Buchenwald, replacing their own 
comrades. 
</P>
<P>
 Another exhibit will mention that some inmates working at the camp hospital 
used lethal injections to kill prisoners whom they believed to be spies, and 
that power struggles between inmate groups also led to killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the liberation of the camp, and of Germany, also is being 
broadened. Communist camp survivors talk of the camp's "self-liberation," and 
indeed, inmates did take over the guard towers and raise white flags in the 
camp two days before the end. 
</P>
<P>
 But the East German exhibits showed only Red Army flags after the war, even 
though American soldiers were the first of the Allies to arrive at Buchenwald. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, in exchange for part of Berlin, the Americans swapped control 
of Thuringen state with the Soviets, who took control of the area. Buchenwald 
became the Soviets' Special Camp No. 2, one of seven in the occupation zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Weimar residents say they knew the Soviets used the camp, but talk of this was 
taboo in the old East Germany. In 1990, however, museum officials dug up mass 
graves from the Stalin era confirming what everyone suspected -- that many 
inmates had died under the Soviets too. 
</P>
<P>
 The graveyard will be permanently marked and integrated into the new exhibit 
on the Soviet era. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the current exhibits, meanwhile, will pass into the historical section 
on Buchenwald during the Communist East German era.

VENTURES IN THE NEWLY STABLE NATION.

 His string tie and finger-licking-good chicken say America all the way, but in 
Beirut the colonel is Kuwaiti. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kentucky Fried Chicken shares its red and white storefront with the 
shocking pink premises of Baskin-Robbins here in the recovering capital of 
Lebanon. The two businesses are concessions owned by Americana, a Kuwaiti 
company representing 44 businesses -- many of them U.S.-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Beirut's Pizza Huts answer to Egyptian and Saudi owners, who have a Lebanese 
partner. Two Pizza Huts are already open, with 18 more to come. Confidence in 
the future of Lebanon -- which for most of the 1970s and '80s did not appear to 
have much of one -- has convinced Pizza Hut to invest $40 million over the next 
five years, the operators say. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon is a fresh market, grab it now or lose the future. That's the line at 
this end of the Mediterranean. If you have money, come here and do something, 
advises Nadwa Ghannoum, head of the investment department at a Beirut bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new style of Arab investment," said Marwan Iskandar, a leading 
Lebanese economist. "Before, real estate was the main interest (in Lebanon). 
This (commercial) development speaks of good expectations for the market and 
shows that Lebanon is accepted, in principle, as a safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 Spearheading all this business in business is Lebanon's billionaire prime 
mover and prime minister, Rafik Hariri. 
</P>
<P>
 What's good for a hut is good for a hotel, and Kuwaitis now own two of 
Beirut's best-known hostelries: the war-shattered but still standing Holiday 
Inn, and the Commodore Hotel, once Beirut's press headquarters and now owned by 
the Emir of Kuwait himself. The Holiday Inn will be renamed and refurbished by 
a Japanese firm with a 25-year operating concession, developers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Beirut's fast-recovering banking sector hums with activity spurred 
by Persian Gulf cash. At one Beirut bank, Gulf clients soared from a paltry 50 
two years ago to 500 at present. Confidence in Lebanon nets the Lebanon & Gulf 
Bank between $52,000 and $75,000 in transfers each week. The incoming hard 
currencies are converted into Lebanese-pound fixed accounts, where they earn a 
hefty 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arabs who adhere to the rules of Islam -- which forbid interest-earning 
endeavors -- investing in Lebanese real estate continues to be a gold mine of 
an alternative. Residences and hotels in traditional Christian resort areas 
such as Broummana and Beirut Meri are selling as soon as they go on the market. 
Heavier plungers are buying huge tracts of land for condominiums, sports clubs 
and beach complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movers and shakers from the Gulf are flocking to my office with feasibility 
studies for real estate projects," said an investment banker who, typical of 
private businessmen in the Middle East, asked to remain anonymous. He described 
one project as a seaside complex so big and so expensive that there will be no 
parallel in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf Arabs' long love affair with Lebanon has a genesis that even their 
petrodollars can't buy -- the weather. The mountains and cool air leave the 
Gulf Arabs, who have summered here since the 1950s, just the way they like, 
high and dry, rather than suffering in the steamy heat at home. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Kuwaitis, coming back to postwar Lebanon is coming home. They 
vacationed here before civil war tore Lebanon apart in 1975, triggering a 
series of conflicts that continued to the beginning of this decade. Of about 
6,000 to 7,000 Kuwaitis who own property in Lebanon, 60% to 70% reportedly have 
contacted their agents and lawyers in Beirut and given them the go-ahead to 
start repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulf Arabs appear delighted to see Lebanon back on its feet. They didn't like 
Europe, and Europe didn't like them. Nothing was agreeable -- not the weather, 
not the customs, not the languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Lebanon, they gamble and party. If they lose, at least they have a 
good time doing it. In the West they played the stock markets and got burned. 
Real estate speculation in the flagging Western markets, especially Houston and 
London, also cost them dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lebanese are doing everything possible to roll out the carpet -- quite 
literally -- for the return of the Gulfies. Hundreds of buildings in Beirut are 
Gulf-owned. Many fell prey to squatters during the war. Now the government is 
moving quickly to pay off the illegal tenants and get them out. 
</P>
<P>
 As of 1993, all Gulf Arabs could enter Lebanon without a visa, a courtesy not 
accorded other Arabs. Although the law is not reciprocal, the Lebanese do not 
seem to mind. The priority is to bring back the Gulfies and their money -- and 
relieve them of a bit of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon never gave up on its old friends. During the Gulf War, when no one 
else would handle Kuwaiti dinars, Lebanon faithfully accepted transactions in 
the Kuwaiti currency. "Where are you? London? Sure we'll send you money," said 
a Lebanese lawyer re-enacting conversations with his Kuwaiti clients. He says 
he often moved $100,000 a day during the war that saw Iraqi forces occupy 
Kuwait and drive many of its moneyed citizens abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Kuwaiti has more savvy than the one who invested in Lebanon in the 
'60s and '70s, before the Lebanese civil war. Another lawyer with Kuwaiti 
clients said: "They used to say, 'Take this money and buy a building.' They 
didn't care. They didn't check. Now they want every penny accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 Business-minded Kuwaitis come here personally and make their own deals. One 
Kuwaiti beamed as he announced to his investment banker that he had bought 
himself a piece of land in Sofar, a mountain resort village 15 miles east of 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you going to build a villa?" the banker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kuwaiti made a sweeping gesture and answered, "No, a small city."

<P>
 Former Edison High standout Brandon Jessie, the State community college 
basketball player of the year at Ventura College, has signed a letter of intent 
to play at Utah, Ventura Coach Philip Mathews said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, a 6-foot-5 1/2 forward, took trips to Utah, Georgetown, Arizona State 
and Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, who averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds last year for Ventura, is a 
two-time All-Western State Conference selection. He was an all-county selection 
and a two-time All-Sunset League player at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews said he was certain from the time Jessie arrived at Ventura that he 
would play Division I basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just needed a little fine tuning at this level and he'll need a little 
fine tuning at the next level," Mathews said. "He's going to be a fine player 
at Utah." JEFF FLETCHER

 BIG BUCKS: Several Ventura County cities are finally shaking off the effects 
of prolonged recession, ringing up some of their best sales in years. . . . 
Even in communities where sales continue to drag, city leaders say the economy 
has started to release its stranglehold. . . . Taxable sales in Santa Paula, 
for example, continue to decline. "But things are looking better," said Ken 
Cott, the city's economic development coordinator. "We have several projects in 
the fire right now that could very well turn things around for Santa Paula." 
</P>
<P>
 WE'RE NO. 1: Speaking of money: Ventura County has been ranked tops in an 
audit of California's 14 most populous counties when it comes to financial 
health (B1). . . . The audit, prepared by an independent auditor, was released 
last week. Funny thing is, the county also ranked first last year and didn't 
even know it. . . . "I'd like to have a big party, but of course we won't pay 
for that with county money," said Thomas Mahon, the county's 
auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 CRIME FIGHTERS: Once again, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks have been ranked 
among the safest big cities in the nation. And Ventura County leaders don't 
want that to change. . . . Assemblyman Nao Takasugi on Friday will host a 
"Youth Crime Summit" in Thousand Oaks. A communitywide crime symposium will be 
held the next day at Westlake High School. . . . "At his last town hall 
meeting, the assemblyman said we are real lucky to have the lowest crime rate," 
said Jaylene Hobrecht, Takasugi spokeswoman. "And he wants to keep it that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD TIMING: As Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization sign a 
long-awaited peace accord Wednesday, PLO official Afif Salieh will arrive in 
Ventura County to discuss the Middle East peace process. . . . Safieh, who will 
deliver an address to the World Affairs Council of Ventura County, actually was 
booked weeks before the peace pact was hammered out. . . . "The timing couldn't 
get any better," council spokesman Tom Jolicoeur said. Taxable Sales

POWERFUL CYCLONE SLAMS BANGLADESHI COAST, OFFSHORE ISLANDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cyclone that gathered strength over the warm waters of the Bay of Bengal for 
two days walloped offshore islands and the Bangladeshi coast Monday with winds 
up to 125 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no immediate reports of casualties from wind-driven rains that 
reduced visibility to almost zero when the storm lashed the offshore islands of 
St. Martin's, Shapuri, Maheskhali and Kutubdia and the coastal towns of Cox's 
Bazar, Chakaria and Teknaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm was heading north toward the Chittagong region, which was devastated 
by a similar cyclone in 1991 that killed about 131,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is blinding rain and roaring winds. . . . We have plunged into 
darkness," said Tajul Islam, a relief worker on Maheskhali, where 10,000 people 
were killed in 1991. He was contacted by telephone from Dhaka, Bangladesh's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Communication with most areas abruptly ended when the cyclone hit the mainland 
at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Enamul Kabir, the administrator of Cox's Bazar, said thousands of 
mud-and-thatch houses were blown away. Hundreds of trees and electricity poles 
were uprooted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most vulnerable people are the 200,000 Muslims from Myanmar living 
in refugee camps south of Cox's Bazar. They arrived two years ago to escape 
persecution by the predominantly Buddhist army in Myanmar, formerly Burma. 
</P>
<P>
 The Meteorological Department said wind speeds of up to 125 m.p.h. were 
recorded in Teknaf on the border with Myanmar.

NEW AREA FOR REDEVELOPMENT IS PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura should consider establishing a new redevelopment area just east of 
downtown that would allow the city to condemn stores and other privately owned 
property in an effort to eliminate blight, City Council members proposed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, acting as the city's Redevelopment Agency, said at a special 
meeting that the new zone could be established in an area adjacent to the 
city's existing downtown revitalization zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at a critical point now in downtown," Councilman Steve Bennett said. 
"It's all either going to hang (together) or it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal comes at a time when the city's original downtown revitalization 
area is running out of money. That area is bounded roughly by Palm Street on 
the east, the Ventura River on the west, the Southern Pacific railroad tracks 
on the south and Poli Street on the north. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to transform that area's vacant lots, thrift stores and parking 
lots into a neighborhood combining condominiums and townhouses with more 
upscale retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The new zone, as sketched hastily by city staff in a presentation to the 
agency, could run from Palm on the west to Ash Street on the east, and from 
Poli on the north to the railroad tracks on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city could face opposition to another redevelopment zone. The 
ongoing efforts to revitalize western downtown have created considerable 
controversy among some merchants and others in the community as the city has 
considered forcing out businesses that have operated in the area for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment agencies are created by cities to improve neighborhoods deemed 
to be blighted. As property values increase, all of the extra property taxes go 
to the redevelopment agency -- not to schools, the county or special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency can use property tax money to spur private investment, while the 
City Council can only direct that revenue toward such public improvements as 
streets or lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Redevelopment Agency has only $5.5 million in cash and assets to 
spend on spiffing up the first downtown redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six developers, however, are asking for loans and subsidies on five 
different projects in the zone. City staff say there is probably not enough 
money to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, council members say they will consider continuing their efforts 
downtown by creating the new zone adjacent to the existing one. 
</P>
<P>
 This would allow the agency to collect even more tax increment dollars from 
the downtown area, and increase the number of parcels it can acquire by eminent 
domain. Once a redevelopment agency condemns and subsequently acquires a 
property, it usually tries to sell the land for what its members deem 
appropriate development. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, however, council members merely asked city staff to prepare a 
preliminary study examining the feasibility of creating a new redevelopment 
zone. Such a study could cost $10,000 to $15,000, said Everett Millais, city 
director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson, who serves as the Redevelopment Agency's 
director, said the new zone presents "an opportunity to really make a 
difference in our downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can somehow get some more money into the downtown area, we could make a 
real impact."

NAVY SETTLES DISPUTE OVER TESTING OF EXPLOSIVES; CHANNEL ISLANDS: THE ACCORD 
WITH FIVE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS REQUIRES NEW AERIAL SURVEYS OF THE TARGETED 
OCEAN AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three days after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against a 
Navy proposal to detonate underwater explosives in an area near the Channel 
Islands rich with marine life, the Navy and five environmental groups have 
settled their legal dispute over the tests, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, approved Friday by U. S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, but 
not announced until Monday, requires that the Navy conduct at least eight days 
of new aerial surveys of the proposed testing area. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the survey will be compared to others taken 18 miles farther out to 
sea in an area environmental groups have said is a better site for the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy must also prepare a full environmental impact report on the proposed 
"ship-shock" testing -- a federally mandated procedure required to test the 
strength of warship hulls, electronics packages and overall crew survivability 
in simulated battle conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 To simulate those conditions, the Navy in a five-year plan proposed to 
detonate as many 270 underwater explosives near the ships, with charges 
weighing as much as 10,000 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement effectively puts on hold the testing program for nine months to 
a year as Navy officials prepare the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The five environmental groups, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
called the agreement a victory in their quest to stop or move the testing 
program. Navy officials have acknowledged that the tests may kill a small 
number of marine mammals and harass or injure hundreds of others, some of which 
are listed as federally endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This agreement) serves notice that even the military must respect and 
preserve our natural resources," said Joel R. Reynolds, a senior attorney for 
the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice-based Save the Whales, American Oceans Campaign, the Humane Society of 
the United States and Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay joined the Natural 
Resources Defense Council in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the dispute has focused on whether the tests should be conducted 
farther offshore in deeper waters, where the concentration of marine life is 
not so great. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Friday's settlement, the Navy received permission to proceed with 
one ship-shock test of the USS John Paul Jones, one of the Navy's new 
Aegis-class destroyers. A total of four, 10,000-pound underwater detonations 
will be allowed under terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed testing area is about 20 miles southwest of Navy-owned San 
Nicolas Island and about 85 miles southwest of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons 
Station in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials, who initially vowed to appeal Wilson's preliminary injunction, 
said they could live with the terms of the agreement brokered late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that a suitable compromise was worked out," said Lt. Cmdr. 
Frank Thorp, a Navy surface fleet spokesman in San Diego. "What we are not 
pleased about is some of the characterizations that have labeled us as not 
caring about the marine environment. The truth is that we have gone to 
extraordinary lengths and costs to reduce the risks posed to marine mammals 
during these tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Smullen, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the parent group of the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
which granted the Navy authorization for the tests, said the agency is pleased 
that environmentalists and the government could reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Smullen said that the protection of marine mammals was the critical issue and 
that the agreement between the fisheries service and the Navy will ensure those 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly 20 marine mammal and sea bird experts, including those with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, will be on three aircraft and the test ship 
itself in order to perform extensive surveys and provide unprecedented 
protection," Smullen said. "That's what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement is a very positive step in recognizing the importance of 
enforcing our environmental laws in protecting the marine ecosystem, especially 
in sensitive areas such as the Channel Islands," said Lisa Weil, policy 
director for American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thorp said a testing date for ship-shock testing of the John Paul Jones has 
not yet been set, but that the ship must be tested before June 30 to meet Navy 
deployment schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Brennan, spokesman for the Ventura County chapter of the Surfrider 
Foundation, said the settlement was a positive move toward helping efforts to 
preserve marine life in the waters of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call it a complete victory, but considering what is on the line 
out there, we'll take it," Brennan said. "And who knows what we'll find in the 
environmental review once it's done."

COUNTY IS RATED AT THE TOP IN STATE FOR FISCAL STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As counties across California sink deeper into debt, Ventura County has 
emerged as the community with the strongest financial standing, according to a 
study of the state's 14 largest counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's low debt level, coupled with a $34-million revenue surplus in 
last year's budget, puts the county at the top of the list, a San 
Francisco-based investment banking firm concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County basically had very good scores across the board," said Jean 
Buckley, a vice president with the firm Prager, McCarthy & Sealy. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials hope that the high marks will translate into lower interest 
rates on future borrowing -- and lower costs for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 County Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon plans to use the report to argue for 
improved credit ratings. Already, bond buyers and analysts have begun calling 
Buckley for information on the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Ventura County comes out on top certainly validates their good 
credit ratings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley used a formula, involving 17 economic and fiscal factors, to assess 
the credit standing of the state's most populous counties. What she found, 
overall, was a "worsening debt burden" with a 75% increase in net direct debt 
per capita. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time that debt burdens have been increasing, California's 
counties have experienced diminished financial flexibility," according to the 
study. Many counties have little money left over at the end of the budget year 
for unexpected costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County, on the other hand, had $34 million on hand when the fiscal 
year ended in June, Mahon said. That money was funneled back into the new 
year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county does a good job of managing its finances and making sure that all 
the (fiscal indicators) are strong," Supervisor John K. Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the healthy surplus, Ventura County scored consistently high in 
Buckley's study, except in population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon said the county's relatively slow-growing population is one of the 
factors that has kept it out of debt. Faster-growing communities, such as San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties, must invest heavily in new roads and schools 
to keep up with new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon also credited the county with a cautious approach to borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said, Ventura County typically opts for 15-year bonds on 
projects, rather than 30- or 40-year debt plans used elsewhere. "In effect, 
what we're doing is paying it off in half the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is basically quite conservative. I don't like debt." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's debt burden would undoubtedly grow if the Board of Supervisors 
proceeds with plans to build a new $38-million wing and parking lot at Ventura 
County Medical Center, Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond buyers typically want a higher interest rate on bonds used to pay for 
hospitals, she said. "The (counties) pay more for their hospital debt than they 
would for a jail or other projects," Buckley said. "Hospitals are not viewed as 
the most essential projects for a county." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still the project, alone, would not knock Ventura County out of its secure 
credit position, she said. The No. 2 county in her study, Contra Costa in 
Northern California, has already issued bonds for a new hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A good credit rating, validated by national analysts, could save the county 
hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of a construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, when the county wants to borrow money, it sells bonds, then pays 
back the buyers at a certain interest rate. The credit rating determines, to 
some extent, how high the interest runs. 
</P>
<P>
 A good rating indicates a low-risk investment, so buyers are willing to accept 
lower interest rates for calculating repayment. That results in the county and 
taxpayers having less money to repay. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the county has an A+ rating from Standard & Poor's rating group and 
A1 from Moody's Investors Service Inc. Mahon hopes to upgrade the rating to AA 
with Standard & Poor's. The highest possible rating is AAA.

 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele, acting as a Juvenile 
Court judge, decided that Phillip Hernandez was guilty of the least serious 
homicide charge, one that carries a maximum sentence of four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had sought a conviction on second-degree murder, which could have 
sent Hernandez, 14, to the California Youth Authority until his 25th birthday 
for the slaying of Chad Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard -- a popular member of the baseball team at Valley View Junior High -- 
was stabbed in the chest just after classes Feb. 1 and died a short while later 
at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele's ruling came after nearly a full day of arguments by attorneys for 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Donna L. Forry said Hernandez should be convicted of no 
more than involuntary manslaughter, but also said an acquittal on grounds of 
self-defense could be justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe that, given the circumstances, what he did was reasonable," 
Forry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those circumstances, Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison argued in court, 
warranted a murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison declined to comment after the verdict. But a top official in the 
district attorney's office expressed disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt strongly that what occurred justified a second-degree murder finding, 
and that's why we prosecuted it that way," Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. 
McGee said. "Obviously, the judge saw it differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Forry expressed relief that her client escaped a murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those respects, it is a victory for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents for both of the boys attended the two-week trial and were present when 
Steele announced his verdict. Both sides declined to comment as they left the 
courtroom, but in previous interviews, Hubbard's parents faulted school 
officials for failing to provide adequate supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Forry also argued in court that the incident might have been avoided had 
school authorities done a better job of handling a feud between Hernandez and 
Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the verdict, Simi Valley Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said district 
officials just want to put the whole incident behind them. She said district 
personnel will advise school officials on how to handle discussions of the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main charge is to continue with the education of students and continue in 
the least disruptive manner," she said. ". . . We need to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Collins, a member of the Simi Valley school board, said the verdict did 
not surprise her because of information that emerged during the trial that 
Hernandez had been punched by Hubbard before the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tragedy, but it did turn out to be different than we (initially) 
perceived it to be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses -- including nearly a dozen present and former Valley View students 
-- testified about how the boys had a strong dislike for each other. They 
recounted numerous run-ins between the two, including pushing matches in the 
locker room and one occasion when Hernandez allegedly stole Hubbard's baseball 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 They testified that the dispute started a few weeks before the stabbing 
because Hubbard believed that Hernandez had called him a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the stabbing, Hubbard hounded Hernandez as the defendant walked 
to his bus stop after classes, witnesses testified. Attorneys on both sides 
agreed that Hubbard insisted on fighting and finally punched the defendant at 
least once -- and maybe two or three times -- before being stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez testified that he could not remember the stabbing because he blacked 
out after Hubbard punched him. The defense contended that Hernandez was only 
defending himself when he stabbed Hubbard, who was portrayed in court as the 
larger and stronger of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Forry also presented evidence that Hubbard had consumed alcohol prior to the 
stabbing and had a 0.06% blood-alcohol level. The legal limit to operate a 
motor vehicle is 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 The alcohol made Hubbard aggressive and irrational, Forry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forry said Hernandez "endured the threats, endured the pushing, the prodding 
and then finally reacted." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her client was backed into a corner because of the harassment he 
received from Hubbard and because no one helped him. "The school completely 
abandoned Phillip in this situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison acknowledged from the start of the trial that Hubbard had started the 
fatal altercation. He argued, however, that Hernandez had no legal right to 
stab Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed out to the judge that several witnesses had testified that 
Hernandez had promised to kill Hubbard if Hubbard continued to threaten him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the kid who was backed into the corner and didn't have anything 
else to do," Ellison said. "His intent was to do just what he said: It was to 
kill Chad Hubbard." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing his ruling Monday, Steele said he did not believe Hernandez's 
testimony. But he ruled that Hernandez did not voluntarily intend to kill his 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing is scheduled May 17.

VICTIMS OF CRASH BELIEVED TO BE MISSING THOUSAND OAKS FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hunter in the San Bernardino County desert has found the wreckage of a light 
plane and the apparent remains of three Thousand Oaks residents missing since 
their plane disappeared in July on a trip from Utah to Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino County coroner's office tentatively identified the bodies 
as those of K. Reed Harrison, 54; his wife, Judith Utz Harrison, 54, and their 
18-year-old daughter, Julie. 
</P>
<P>
 With the discovery, a memorial service was scheduled for next week in Westlake 
Village by daughters Kathleen Harrison, 24, and Christina Harrison, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Harrison said she learned Sunday night of the discovery from a 
friend of her mother's who knew the man who found the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing OK," she said Monday in a telephone interview from her home in 
Salt Lake City. "We'd been expecting it, but . . . I thought knowing would be 
better. It's not much better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrisons were reported missing July 25, sending the daughters on a 
weeks-long interstate search that covered parts of Nevada, Utah and eastern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed Harrison, an attorney and former Thousand Oaks planning commissioner, had 
been flying his wife and youngest daughter back to Camarillo Airport in his 
white-and-beige single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza after a family reunion in 
Roosevelt, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was last spotted on radar screens after passing over mountains near 
Price, Utah, about 60 miles southwest of Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 It apparently slammed nose first into the desert floor and disintegrated about 
26 miles northeast of Baker, only two miles off its prescribed course toward 
Camarillo, said Marshall Franey, a San Bernardino County coroner's inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Buhrle found the wreckage Saturday while hunting in an area surrounded 
by mines, and brought San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies to the site 
Sunday, the Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franey said the crash scattered wreckage in a 450-foot-wide circle across the 
Silurian Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane came down just five miles from a dry lake bed that could have been 
used as an emergency runway and would have been visible from the air over the 
crash site, Franey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The wreckage) was found approximately two miles off its course," Franey 
said. "It would have been very difficult to see from the air. From the air, it 
would appear to be just debris from a mine shaft -- there's two or three mine 
shafts in the area just a short distance away." 
</P>
<P>
 Franey said purses and wallets found at the crash site identified the victims 
as the Harrisons, but he is awaiting the family's dental records to confirm the 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the plane disappeared in July, Christina and Kathleen Harrison launched a 
search for their parents and sister that engaged dozens of pilots covering 
thousands of square miles of desert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the Air Force, had volunteers fly over 
the entire 65,000-square mile flight path through Colorado, Utah, Arizona, 
Nevada and California searching for sign of the Beechcraft. The air search 
continued for 18 days before it was called off. 
</P>
<P>
 The two daughters also handed out flyers in Nevada, posted a $25,000 reward 
and were flooded with calls from psychics. The reward offer expired in 
November, Christina Harrison said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were contacted by probably 15 psychics, and they weren't the only people 
who tried to take us," she said. "There were a lot of people who probably took 
a little bit of advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 One Las Vegas man called the Harrisons' attorney, saying the family was alive 
and living in Mexico, and demanded that the reward be put into an escrow fund 
for him until he provided proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a huge loss -- most of our family, the baby and our parents. Julie 
was the youngest," Christina Harrison said. "Finding them has forced us to deal 
with it where we hadn't dealt with it before. We were just kind of plugging 
along before and doing what we could do to find them." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board is studying the wreckage to try to 
determine the cause of the crash, said Fred O'Donnell, spokesman for the 
Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're assisting to determine whether there were any violations of FAA 
regulations, and we'll report to the board with that information," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PRIVATE GROUP WANTS TO RUN STRAWBERRY 
FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MCDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard recreation and community services director is recommending that the 
City Council today approve a move to privatize the California Strawberry 
Festival, the annual city-sponsored attraction that celebrates one of the 
area's most abundant crops. 
</P>
<P>
 James Faulconer will ask the council to approve a request by the California 
Strawberry Festival Committee to operate the festival.If the measure is 
approved, the committee would then become a private, nonprofit corporation, 
Faulconer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also be asked to spend $600,000 to produce and operate the 
1995 festival with the understanding that the money would be paid back to the 
city with interest over time, Faulconer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, money spent by the city on the festival has been repaid by 
corporate sponsorships and revenues raised by the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Strawberry Festival, which will be held May 21 and 22 at Oxnard 
College, has generated more than $500,000 in each of the past five years, 
Faulconer said. Much of that revenue helps fund a variety of local nonprofit 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan up for discussion today would better "reflect the arrangement between 
the city, the private sector and the California Strawberry Festival Committee 
that has developed since the event's inception," Faulconer wrote in his report 
to council members. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the proposal would also renew a two-year management services 
contract for $146,354 with William Lynn Garlock, who would agree to manage the 
event through June 30, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulconer proposes two alternatives to forming the corporation: maintain the 
status quo or establish a revolving fund for the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 But he recommended against keeping things the same because that restricts the 
festival's development. Faulconer said the revolving fund alternative would be 
acceptable but not preferred by the committee. JEFF MCDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 2 ORDERED TO FACE TRIAL ON GRAND THEFT 
CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge who said he planned to throw out felony grand theft charges against 
two former Oxnard card casino promoters charged with stealing $10,000 in an 
unrelated construction deal changed his mind Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Allan Steele denied a defense motion to dismiss the 
charges against Michael E. Wooten, 45, and Frank Marasco, 48.He ordered the men 
to appear in court today for the start of their trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Steele had said he was inclined to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten, of Camarillo, and Marasco, of Ventura, are accused of submitting a 
false $10,000 voucher to a consortium of Ventura County investors for work on a 
development project in Santa Paula, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of paying a construction firm for overseeing the work, the defendants 
spent the money, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele's ruling Monday was the second setback for the men in the past four 
days. On Thursday, a judge fined them $3,000 each after they pleaded guilty to 
one misdemeanor count of money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Each defendant admitted violating state law by making $998 in small 
contributions indirectly to two Oxnard councilmen, one former councilwoman and 
a state assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cases against the defendants were investigated by the Ventura County 
district attorney's newly formed political corruption unit. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FARMERS TAKING A LOSS ON CELERY CROPS THIS 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The celery crop that Ventura farmers are harvesting this spring is netting 
barely half the price it drew last year, as fields here and across the state 
produce far more celery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the brutality of supply and demand," said Rex Laird, executive 
director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "The euphoria that we experienced 
last year has been replaced by tragedy this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Consistently one of Ventura's largest cash crops, celery brought in as much as 
$20 a carton at its peak last year. In January, prices dropped to as low as 
$3.50 to $4 a carton, so low that some farmers left stalks rotting in the 
fields rather than harvest them, local salesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 With prices rising to $7 or $8 a carton last month -- about the break-even 
point -- harvesting picked up again and should continue through July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, local farmers expect to lose money on this year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have to average $50 a carton to break even now," said David Cook from 
the sales office of Deardorff-Jackson Co. in Oxnard. "We sold so much, so 
cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County farmers grow celery on about 9,500 acres, most of them on the 
Oxnard Plain, county Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail said. The crop, 
which is shipped to markets nationwide, brought in $78.9 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 That sum could be even higher when 1993 sales are calculated. Heavy rains in 
the winter, as well as plant disease, kept the yield low and the prices high in 
much of 1993, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the celery harvest begins in November and lasts through 
July. Each celery crop needs 90 to 120 days to grow. The county requires 
farmers to stop harvesting July 15 and leave the fields empty for at least a 
month before the next crop is planted. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; ROBBERY SUSPECT SERIOUSLY WOUNDED

 An Oxnard robbery suspect who was accidentally shot by one of his accomplices 
as they fled angry convenience store clerks was in serious condition Monday and 
three others were in jail on suspicion of armed robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yair Vasquez, 18, of Oxnard was shot in the head by an accomplice aiming at 
clerks who were pursuing them Sunday night, police said.Vasquez was recovering 
Monday at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 He and three others were arrested after two Oxnard 7-Eleven stores were robbed 
of beer at gunpoint, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first robbery occurred about 9:45 p.m. Sunday at a 7-Eleven at Channel 
Islands Boulevard and El Dorado Avenue, police said. Officers responding to the 
robbery were told that the suspects were seen leaving in a blue Cadillac, 
heading east on Channel Islands Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers went to another 7-Eleven in the 2000 block of Pleasant Valley Road in 
anticipation that the suspects were on their way to commit another robbery. 
When the officers arrived at the convenience store, about a mile away from the 
first one, they noticed a blue Cadillac parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the men stole the beer and were chased to their car by two clerks. 
They saw several people fighting near the car, and then heard a shot fired near 
the Cadillac, which then sped away on Beaumont Avenue. Police stopped the car 
and arrested the youths, including a 15-year-old Oxnard juvenile whose name was 
withheld because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Andrade, 19, and Manuel Aguilera, 18, both of Oxnard, were being held on 
$250,000 bail each at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted murder and 
robbery, authorities said. They were scheduled to be arraigned today. The 
juvenile was being held at Juvenile Hall. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 3 SEA LIONS SHIPPED IN FROM WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of the California Coastal Commission and local fishing 
officials, the National Marine Fisheries Service has trucked three Washington 
state sea lions to waters off the Ventura County coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the mammals were deposited in the ocean near Ventura Harbor by 
fisheries officials late last week.The transfer was done in hopes of reducing 
the sea lions' take of already decimated steelhead trout populations around 
Ballard Locks in Washington's Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisheries service officials cited their "administrative authority" to move up 
to 10 of the fish-eating animals to Southern California, despite the Coastal 
Commission's rejection in February of a request to transfer up to 60 sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the severe decline of the steelhead population and how efficient sea 
lions are as predators, we had to do what we could," said Hal Alabaster, 
spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the parent 
agency of the fisheries service. 
</P>
<P>
 But James R. Raives, a Coastal Commission analyst, said Washington officials 
are just transferring their problem to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong possibility that such a relocation won't work anyway," 
Raives said. "At best, it's just a temporary fix for them. It really is not 
addressing the real issue of how they are dealing with their steelhead 
populations." 
</P>
<P>
 Local fishing industry officials have argued against the transfer, saying the 
aggressive sea mammals can thwart fishing operations by helping themselves to 
catches of halibut and sea bass, often directly from fishing nets. J. E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; HEARING ON RV PARK TONIGHT MAY BE THE 
LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a planned recreational vehicle park in Port Hueneme will have a 
final chance to air their concerns at a public hearing today before the City 
Council decides whether to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, set for 6 p.m. at Port Hueneme City Hall, is expected to be the 
last of several the city has held on the proposed park over the last four 
years, City Clerk Karen Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote is expected to be preceded by a protest from residents who claim that 
the park will harm the environment, invade their privacy with traffic and 
tourists, and block their view of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, however, have pursued the RV park as a means to bring 
much-needed revenue to the city, saying the park will generate $400,000 per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider whether to approve an environmental impact 
report that states that the project's effects on the environment will be minor. 
The council must also decide whether to change the zoning of the beachfront 
property to allow for a commercial RV park. Finally, the council will decide 
whether to issue itself a development permit, said Tom Figg, city director of 
community development. CHRISTINA LIMA

 Of the 28 students from Chaparral Middle School in Moorpark who entered the 
Ventura County Science Fair last month, more than 20 came out winners. 
</P>
<P>
 And the secret to their success, their teacher says, was a program that pushed 
each of the school's 480 students to develop their own science projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found this is a great way to learn," Chaparral science teacher 
Mary-Alice Reyburn said. "They develop an idea all the way through and get 
involved in real problem solving. It's a hands-on way of learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyburn said the students were told about the science requirement when they 
were in the fifth grade. When they entered the sixth grade, their topics -- 
ranging from "Growing Toe Fungus With Sweat" to "How Can We Improve Landfills" 
-- were developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers for other subjects, such as language and history, gave students class 
credit for some of their research and writing on the science projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a team effort," Reyburn said. "And, over time, the children developed 
a lot of excitement and enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 When the school had an in-house competition March 2, the projects filled the 
auditorium and overflowed into classrooms with displays that showed off a 
cross-section of student interest in botany, chemistry, biology, physics and 
animal science. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Gary Wallace, whose project on landfills won a blue ribbon in the 
Ventura County Science Fair on March 18, said he was able to develop his idea 
over a long period. 
</P>
<P>
 He had read about how magnets quicken the growth of radishes and wondered if 
they would somehow speed up the decomposition of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sort of weird how I got the idea," Gary said. "I saw something with 
President Clinton mentioning how we were running out of landfill space, and 
then I read the article about radishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary's project showed that magnets do speed trash decomposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other Chaparral students won first-place awards, three won second-place 
awards, one won a third place, six won honorable mentions and six won special 
category awards. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: SIMI VALLEY; TRAFFIC LIGHT PLANNED NEAR SITE OF 
CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials agreed Monday to install a traffic light at an 
intersection near the Metrolink station where a police cruiser slammed into a 
nurse's car two weeks ago and caused injuries that left her in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineers said there had never been a crash at the intersection, but they 
recommended installing the light a year ago because of the increasing number of 
cars passing and stopping at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers estimate that 19,700 cars move through the intersection in a 
24-hour period, and that the light will cost $100,000 to install -- $11,500 of 
which will be paid by the city and $88,500 by federal gas taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 After several neighbors of Madera Elementary School complained of people 
speeding in the school zone, the council also agreed to install a flashing 
yellow light at the nearby crosswalk.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the light, engineers proposed installing a light at Alamo 
Street and Texas Avenue and improving signals at half a dozen other crossroads. 
The council approved the list of lights by a 5-0 vote. MACK REED

 Two people were hospitalized in serious condition Monday after a woman lost 
control of her van while driving across a bridge in Moorpark, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatin Hijaz, 20, of Moorpark was driving west on Tierra Rejado Road when she 
apparently lost control of the vehicle, crossed over to the eastbound lane, 
veered onto the sidewalk and hit two pedestrians, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijaz's vehicle then flew into the air and over an embankment before finally 
coming to rest at a nearby nursery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijaz and one of the pedestrians, Robert Lopez Sr., 46, of Moorpark, were 
taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center. Both were in serious condition, a 
nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other pedestrian, Maria Hernandez, 16, of Moorpark, was taken to Simi 
Valley Hospital, where she was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation was continuing, authorities said. CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: THOUSAND OAKS; STOLL WITHDRAWS FROM RACE FOR

 Otto Stoll, a public relations consultant and citizen activist, has withdrawn 
from the race for a Thousand Oaks City Council seat for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll said he has undergone two heart transplant operations and suffers from 
transplant coronary artery disease, a progressive terminal illness.He recently 
spent two weeks in the hospital after his body tried to reject his transplanted 
heart, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he fears future bouts of illness that may require prolonged 
hospitalization, Stoll said he felt compelled to bow out of the council race. 
His condition, he added, would make it difficult to campaign or serve 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart patients can lead a very active life, but I don't think they should 
promise the voters four years of service when they may not be able to deliver," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll will continue to serve on several committees, including Citizens for a 
Safe Ventura County and the Ventura County Area Housing Authority. He is 
organizing a daylong crime prevention seminar to be held Saturday at Westlake 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council seats will be up for grabs in November. Mayor Elois Zeanah and 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar have announced plans to run for reelection. Other 
candidates include dentist Gregory Cole, firefighter Andy Fox and detective 
Mike Markey. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll said he backs Zeanah and Fox, but would not issue formal endorsements. 
"I don't have any support to throw anywhere," he said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: SIMI VALLEY; CITY OKS CHANGES FOR PROJECT AT FAIR 
SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a massive housing and business development on the site of the Simi 
Valley Days fair moved a step forward Monday as the Simi Valley City Council 
approved planning changes that would allow the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 0 to approve changes to the General Plan that would 
allow three groups of developers to build about 560 houses and apartments and a 
variety of businesses on the vacant field at the southeast corner of Los 
Angeles Avenue and Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Simi Valley Days said they have been assured that they can use 
the 67-acre lot for the fair in September, but they are already looking for 
alternative sites for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Postal Service also plans to build a post office on a 6.17-acre 
parcel on the lot, but will require no special zoning from the city because as 
a federal agency, it is exempt from the city's land-use laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years ago, a similar plan called Simi Village was drafted for the 
site, but nothing was built. MACK REED

TEEN-AGE GIRL SAYS SHE LIED TO MOTHER TO GET OUT OF CHORES; COURTS: ATTORNEY 
FOR MOTHER ACCUSED OF CHILD ABUSE TRIES TO PAINT DAUGHTER AS A DIFFICULT, 
STUBBORN CHILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under cross-examination Monday, the teen-age daughter of an affluent Westlake 
woman on trial for child abuse testified that she often lied to her mother to 
get out of doing homework and chores that she considered boring. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James M. Farley at one point asked the 16-year-old girl why 
she frequently lied to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" the teen-ager said. "Because it was a pain in the butt to do what she 
told me." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's adoptive mother, 51-year-old Charlotte Russo, faces one count of 
felony child abuse for allegedly biting the girl and one misdemeanor count of 
child abuse for locking her in the family's racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager has testified about being beaten and hosed down by her mother, 
and fed nothing but peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a Ventura County Superior Court jury Monday, Farley tried to paint the 
girl's testimony as unbelievable and her behavior as that of a Farley asked the 
teen-ager repeatedly why she didn't keep up with her schoolwork when she knew 
that was the condition of moving back into the main house with her family. She 
replied that she found the homework boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things are boring, you don't like to do them, do you?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who does?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although attorneys for both sides agree that Russo incarcerated the girl 
inside the racquetball court bathroom and that she bit her daughter, they 
differ on the nature of these incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the mother's treatment of the girl went beyond 
discipline into physical and emotional torture. But Farley has sought to 
portray Russo as a concerned parent who tried to help an unruly child. 
</P>
<P>
 During two hours of cross-examination Monday, Farley suggested that the 
arguments between the girl and her mother didn't begin until the girl was in 
seventh grade and began to lie about her schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 But the teen-ager, who was adopted by Richard and Charlotte Russo when she was 
1, said her problems with her mother began before that. The Russos have four 
biological children who are now adults, and two younger adopted children, 
including the 16-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was her attitude toward me," she said haltingly. "She would always 
complain how I ate, how my hair looked. She would criticize me." 
</P>
<P>
 In previous testimony, the girl has said she was forced to act like a maid for 
her family, doing chores at their nine-bedroom home from the time she got home 
from school about 2:30 p.m. until after 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, she said Monday, was hard to please. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just wanted everything perfect," the girl said. "If you missed a spot on 
the carpet, she'd make you re-vacuum the whole carpet." And if Russo thought 
that her daughter's homework was messy, she would demand that she copy it over, 
the girl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you think she was trying to help you do better?" Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know her motives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to poke holes in the girl's accounts to county social workers, Farley 
questioned her about the dates and circumstances of certain incidents, 
including when her mother allegedly held the girl by her ankles over a banister 
inside the racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl stuck to her account, saying her mother only pulled her back up to 
the second-story landing after the teen-ager admitted that she had lied about 
her homework.

DISTRICT TO START NEW PROGRAM AT INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL; THOUSAND OAKS: OFFICIALS 
SAY 139 SIXTH-GRADE STUDENTS HAVE SIGNED UP TO ATTEND COLINA IN THE FALL WITH 
SEVENTH- AND EIGHTH-GRADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks school officials said Monday that they have received enough 
applications to fill a pilot program in the fall that will allow sixth-grade 
students to attend school with seventh- and eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program will allow some students normally assigned to the 18 
elementary schools in the Conejo Valley Unified School District to attend 
Colina Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other intermediate schools in the district will remain limited to 
seventh- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the program at Colina is intended to provide a better 
transition -- academically and socially -- for students moving from elementary 
school to intermediate and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Van Leuven, director of secondary education, said the program follows 
state guidelines for sixth-grade students and gives teachers a chance to work 
in teams, using themes to unite different subject areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just adding a sixth grade to a school doesn't make it a middle school," 
Leuven said. "It's a philosophy that emphasizes transition." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board approved the program at Colina in March. The program was 
presented to students and parents at two open houses last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials were not certain until Monday that the program would start, 
after they determined that the district had received more than the minimum 
number of applications needed to fill classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has received 139 applications from students throughout the 
district to enroll in the program, which can accommodate up to 144 
sixth-graders. At least 108 students were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district will continue to accept applications until all 144 spaces are 
filled, Assistant Supt. Richard Simpson said. After that, students will be 
placed on a waiting list, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the applications for Colina, Thousand Oaks administrators have 
received nearly 300 transfer requests for fall, under a new state mandate 
allowing parents to choose their children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mandate, students living nearest schools are given first priority, 
while other spaces will be assigned by lottery or the order in which 
applications are received. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said Monday that it appeared that about 95% of the district's transfer 
requests would be approved. Only a few schools had more transfer requests than 
spaces. Among those were Banyan and Walnut elementary schools, and Thousand 
Oaks High School, where 42 new students wanted to enroll and only 15 wanted to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 A higher number of requests had been expected for Thousand Oaks High because 
some students now assigned to Westlake High actually live closer to Thousand 
Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what happens is kids get associated with friends . . . and they want 
to stay together," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials planned to start sending out letters today to parents whose 
transfer requests were approved. Administrators will also decide today if 
lotteries will be held for spaces at schools with too many applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The shifting of sixth-graders to Colina Intermediate School is expected to 
relieve some of the crowding at Conejo and Westlake Hills elementary schools. 
If the program is successful after two years, Colina would become a permanent 
middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Malone, a parent who worked on a committee that reviewed the middle 
school proposal, said she enrolled her daughter in the program because she 
believes that it will better prepare students for honors classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone said she was also attracted to the program because the four sixth-grade 
teachers -- Carol Philips, Sheila Brayer, Jackie Hadley and Scott Johnson -- 
will coordinate lesson plans, using some of the same themes throughout math, 
science, English and social studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming together and sharing ideas," Malone said. "Somehow when you 
put that much positive energy together, good things happen."

NO NEED FOR A DICTATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's punitive reaction to Judge Lawrence Storch's 
reduction of a jury verdict makes it evident that Bradbury wants to dictate his 
version of justice to everyone in Ventura County, including judges. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not attend the Todd Love trial and, therefore, cannot know whether Judge 
Storch's decision to reduce the jury verdict is or is not defensible according 
to the evidence on record. But when a jury renders a verdict against the weight 
of the evidence, it is the duty of the trial judge to re-weigh the evidence and 
take steps to see that justice is done in accordance with the evidence. We have 
no reason to believe that Judge Storch takes that duty lightly nor uses it with 
undue frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's need for retribution is clearly unprofessional, but he's done this 
before and no doubt will again, if he continues to be reelected. Perhaps we 
citizens of Ventura County owe our congratulations to Judge Storch as a jurist 
who maintains his commitment to justice even in the face of Bradbury's 
opposition to everyone not dedicated to his status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorneys and judges have separate, well-defined duties. In a 
democratic society, nobody needs a district attorney who wants to be judicial 
dictator.

HOLIDAY'S MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is to provoke conscious thought and cultural sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 I was shopping at a grocery store in town when I came across a sign near a 
beer display.The sign read, "Buy Now, Only 23 More Days Until Cinco de Mayo." 
Thoughts came to mind of the "commercial aspect" of Cinco de Mayo that I would 
see in the weeks to come. We'll see the beer ads, tortilla chip displays piled 
high with salsa and bean dip, and red, white and green streamers strung up 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 It is sad that these are the images that come to mind when Cinco de Mayo is 
mentioned. What happened to the feelings of independence and freedom? It is 
necessary that people respect all cultures, but in order to respect each 
other's culture, we must first be knowledgeable of the culture. It is first sad 
that different cultures and histories are barely covered or not covered at all 
in our schools. Then to encourage stereotypes, from media or films, just adds 
fuel to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 To set the record straight, we Mexicanos celebrate Cinco de Mayo to 
commemorate a historical triumph. On the morning of May 5, 1862, more than 
4,000 Mexican troops defeated a superior force of 6,000 French troops at La 
Batalla de Puebla. Gen. Zaragoza led the fight against one of the most 
experienced and professional armies in Europe and won. Although, ultimately, 
the French were successful at briefly occupying Mexico under Napoleon III, 
today's annual festivals commemorate this victory and the courage it 
represented throughout the Southwest, which we must remember was formerly a 
part of Mexico.

VALUABLE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to K. L. Greenstreet's letter of April 19 on the subject 
of the controversial Port Hueneme RV park proposal. In that letter, the writer 
equated the Wright Cultural Center with the projected RV park as another Port 
Hueneme City Council plan to make money for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural center was never conceived as a money-making business operation. 
Quite the reverse is true. 
</P>
<P>
 The center came about in connection with the city's determination, beginning 
some 20 years ago, to clean up and consolidate the several types of properties 
and to form an integrated plan to develop the neighborhood in ways in which the 
city and its residents could take pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Port Hueneme already had a traditional community center, it was thought 
unwise to duplicate it, but rather to construct the excellent multipurpose 
center that exists today. The new center would not only provide cultural 
activities for everyone, but it would enhance the image of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 No statements or promises about the center's potential to make money were ever 
made by the City Council. In fact, it was fully understood that not only could 
the center not be expected to show a profit, nor even break even, but, 
according to experience in other towns and places, it would have to be 
subsidized by the city. The council thought that the values of the center, many 
of them intangibles, certainly made the venture worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 No one who admires this splendid facility and the values it represents, and 
cares for its fate in the months and years to come, could possibly argue that 
the council was wrong. In the opinion of this writer, a theater is at least as 
important to a community as a church, a school or a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as bleak as things may appear at the present time, the Wright center does 
have the potential to pay for itself and to realize the great twin goals that 
the council (members) did envision when they planned its building. 
</P>

<P>
 I would like to address an issue with regard to the proposed Hueneme Beach RV 
Park. I walk regularly in front of Surfside II and III, and have noticed the 
inordinate number of unleashed and uncurbed dogs in the beach area designated 
for the RV park. Not only are the dog leavings unsightly and unsanitary, but 
dogs off their leashes are trouble waiting to happen. It is only a matter of 
time before one bites someone or mauls another dog. 
</P>
<P>
 I can understand the city taking a stand to leave this area unpatrolled in 
order to illustrate the abuse residents have heaped upon this undeveloped 
parcel. It makes the plan to erect a 143-space RV park look less nightmarish. 
However, by not attending to the unleashed animals (and their owners), the city 
is inviting a lawsuit when someone finally does get hurt. Let's not let it get 
that far. 
</P>
<P>
 I encourage the city to take responsibility for enforcing its leash law. As 
with many laws, when they are unenforced, people feel they can abuse them. How 
can the city expect to be able to police an additional 143 RV owners and their 
pets when they cannot confront the existing problem?

STREET CLOSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With regard to the closing of Poli Street, the series of useless, 
ill-considered, knee-jerk reactions by most of the Ventura City Council 
continues to be sadly amusing to those of us who choose to live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing does become quite obvious, though.These servants of ours haven't 
visited the neighborhood in ages. If they had, they would know that speed bumps 
aren't needed. Sunset Drive, especially between Foster and Hyland (avenues), is 
so rutted, ridged and pot-holed that any speed over 15 m.p.h. is already 
suspension-busting. Who needs speed bumps? 
</P>
<P>
 At least the council no longer insists that any of this has anything to do 
with the year-old tragedy that initiated the string of inappropriate decisions 
in the first place.

CLAS ATTACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent attacks against our state's CLAS examinations are a concerted 
effort orchestrated by national religious-right organizations such as the Eagle 
Forum, the Christian Coalition, the Rutherford Institute and Concerned Women 
for America. Although trying to disguise the attacks as local incidents, 
members of these organizations, with guidance from their national leaders, are 
waging a well-organized battle against every school district in the state of 
California.These are the same people who fight against sex education in high 
schools, work to censor reading material -- which they consider immoral -- from 
our children's schools, and oppose school breakfast programs and after-school 
care because they somehow devalue the family. 
</P>
<P>
 These organizations are very well-financed and, unfortunately, are succeeding 
at intimidating school districts into conformity with their very narrow 
viewpoint of how the world should be run. Our public schools enroll children 
from every nationality, race, religion and sexual orientation. The needs of all 
of these students should be met, not just the needs and desires of an extremely 
vocal, cash-rich minority. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge all school districts, especially the Simi Valley Unified School 
District, to consider the wants and needs of my children and the many other 
children who are not aligned with these organizations when making decisions 
concerning their education and future. It's time to start worrying about our 
children's education, not about the next election.

MAYOR PUSHES FOR MORE ROADWORK FUNDS; THOUSAND OAKS: ZEANAH WANTS TO CUT OUT 
AUTO MALL LANDSCAPING AND OTHER EXTRAS THAT SHE DEEMS FRIVOLOUS. OTHERS ON THE 
COUNCIL DISAGREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irate at the potholes, cracks and patches she glimpses beneath her car, 
Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah has launched a personal campaign to boost 
funding for street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 To free up money for roadwork, she wants to cut out extras that she deems 
frivolous -- items such as landscaping the Auto Mall and widening Oakwood Drive 
for a new Civic Arts Plaza entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 For Zeanah and her lone ally, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, the issue extends 
beyond the physical condition and aesthetic appearance of Thousand Oaks' 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear that inappropriate expenditures from the city's gas tax fund, which 
by law must be used for transportation, have drained away road-repair money and 
forced delays in maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 But their concerns have so far received a bumpy reception. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zeanah announced at last week's council meeting that "city streets are in 
the worst shape I've ever seen in my 17 years of living here," her colleagues 
on the dais openly scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that the public works department responds immediately to reports of 
potholes or gaping cracks. And they defended the city's 375 miles of streets as 
safe and well-maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with the premise that we need more money to repair our roads," 
Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the city will spend about $1.6 million to repave and construct 
roads, slightly above last year's total, Public Works Director Donald Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget also allocates $1 million for general street maintenance and 
another $1 million for public transportation, including the Thousand Oaks 
Transit buses and the Dial-A-Ride subsidized taxi service. 
</P>
<P>
 All those transportation dollars come from the city's gas tax fund, which in 
turn is fed by the state tax on gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the council will consider tapping the fund to pay for operating a new 
wheelchair-accessible van to transport elderly, low-income and disabled 
residents around the city. The van would augment a fleet of six station wagons 
that serve about 5,000 people a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running the van for eight hours each weekday would cost $42,000 a year. 
Offering it just during peak hours would run about $16,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Councilwoman Judy Lazar backed the expenditure as a viable use of 
the city's gas tax fund. But Zukowski wavered, reluctant to drain road-repair 
money although she supports the subsidized taxi program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our basic needs from the gas tax fund have been compromised because we've 
used the money in areas that are not essential," Zukowski said. "We're just not 
keeping up with street maintenance as we used to, and you can see the wear and 
tear. We've used the funds for optional items." 
</P>
<P>
 As a prime example of misdirected funds, Zeanah and Zukowski cite the 
council's decision to spend $600,000 in gas tax money to buy a piece of 
property on Oakwood. It will be converted into a sweeping entrance into the 
Civic Arts Plaza parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for last year's Auto Mall landscaping, which cost more than $150,000, 
also came from the gas tax fund. And city staff recently proposed tapping the 
fund again for "Welcome to Thousand Oaks" gateway signs, which would cost about 
$5,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 All that money, Zeanah and Zukowski argued, might have been better spent on 
routine road repair, especially along Moorpark and Erbes roads and in the 
Wildwood area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comparing the current condition of our streets to our own standards," 
Zeanah said. "Has it been a conscious decision of the staff to stop paving 
streets to our standards?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That question, posed at the end of last week's council meeting, drew a swift 
and angry response from City Manager Grant Brimhall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our city overlay (repaving) program is one of the most vigorous in the 
county," he said, "and it's certainly far superior to any city in Los Angeles 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Because many of the city's neighborhoods were developed at the same time, the 
roads have aged at the same pace and demand for repairs has boomed over the 
past few years, Brimhall said. At the same time, the city has switched to a new 
asphalt mix that costs about twice as much as conventional asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the city continues to repave 13 to 15 miles of road a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the streets in this city are in pretty good shape," Nelson said, but 
he added: "There will always be more needs than money."

SCOTT HARRIS: CONFRONTING THE MOTHER OF ALL HOLIDAYS; IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE

 "Most of the women I work with," the counselor was saying, "want to be 
married. They're in their 30s to early 40s, and now they're looking to find a 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "They start to get frantic -- 'Where can I find a man? The right man. A good 
man!' . . . They thought Mr. Right would just pop up. But now you've got to go 
out and really look for them." 
</P>
<P>
 And they aren't just looking for Mr. He'll Do. They are looking for someone 
worthy of the title of Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 The women of whom Alice Dollinger speaks might be considered the innocent 
bystanders of Mother's Day. With May 8 closing fast and so many biological 
clocks ticking so loud, Dollinger, an Encino psychotherapist, issued a press 
release: 
</P>
<P>
 "While millions of women are being honored on Mother's Day, those women who 
are childless, either by choice or by circumstance, suffer from feelings of 
isolation , failure and guilt. " 
</P>
<P>
 In her statement, Dollinger underlined those words. Hallmark doesn't make 
Mother's Day cards for these women, which is probably a good thing. But come 
Saturday, they are invited to a workshop that Dollinger promises to be free of 
both price and guilt. The purpose, the press release explains, is "to empower 
childless women to deal with the pressures and expectations of friends, family 
and society." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of guilt, I have a confession to make. My initial response to 
Dollinger's release was a snide chuckle. After all, not all victims of Mother's 
Day are so innocent. I couldn't help but think of Connie Chung, celebrity 
journalist, who appeared on the cover of People magazine proclaiming that she 
wanted to have a baby.  
</P>
<P>
 That was August, 1990. That month, Chung turned 44. She had success, fame, 
fortune -- and now she wanted a baby?  
</P>
<P>
 But the more I thought about it, the more I felt sad for her. This past 
winter, instead of feeding a baby, Chung helped feed the media frenzy over 
Tonya Harding in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 And now I feel guilty about this feeling of sadness. What, after all, is the 
proper attitude, the proper etiquette, on the subject of childless women who 
wish to have children? Are feelings of pity appropriate? Or does such sympathy 
only serve to perpetuate societal expectations and those attendant feelings of 
isolation, failure and guilt? 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a comfortable topic. Even as I write these words, I can imagine 
some readers, perhaps people close to me, feeling pangs over the subject 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a topic that most women don't talk about," Dollinger explained. "It's 
so painful they keep it to themselves. So this is the beginning of opening up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dollinger figures three types of women may be interested in her workshop. The 
first are traditionally minded women who always planned on having children and 
for whatever reason are unable to conceive or carry a child to birth. The 
second are women who are ambivalent about the idea of motherhood -- and often 
marriage as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The third group are "women who have really taken in the women's movement and 
make a conscious choice not to have children -- to not base her identity solely 
on being a mother." These women, Dollinger says, have come to terms with their 
own feelings about motherhood. "Their problem is dealing with everyone else's 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Dollinger said she expects women in the first two groups, the traditional and 
the ambivalent, to be the most interested in the workshop, which is scheduled 
for 10 a.m. Saturday at 1601 Ventura Blvd. The topics include "external and 
internal pressure," "working through feelings of isolation, shame and guilt" 
and "grieving and acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
 Dollinger, the mother of two grown children, learned about the deep pain some 
childless women feel through the experience of a confidante. Through her, she 
also learned that Mother's Day is a reminder of something lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the women that do decide to come" to the workshop, Dollinger said, 
"are in a place in their lives where they want to switch from feeling like a 
victim to being a survivor. They want to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's times like these when one stops and thinks, gee, but it's nice to be a 
man. We don't worry much about biological clocks. We can put off regrets and 
self-recrimination for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Mother's Day has a way of making us feel guilty too. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, I called up my folks to ask them about their mothers. The 
former Ella Effie Rhymes had 12 children, including my father. The former 
Frankie Calhoun had 10, including my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers, I suspect, still do most of the heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 But son-hood is hardly guilt-free.  
</P>
<P>
 My mom had just one comment when I told her I was writing about the anguish of 
childless women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm not childless. I'm grand childless," she said. "I did my part."

VOLUNTARY CUTBACKS IN WATER USE REQUESTED; DROUGHT: DESPITE STATE ANNOUNCEMENT, 
LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY LAST YEAR'S SURPLUS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE COUNTY 
THROUGH THE SHORTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although water levels in Ventura County's reserves remain relatively high, a 
drought watch announced Monday by state officials has the county's largest 
water distributor asking residents to voluntarily cut back on usage. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a rainy season that produced a snowpack estimated to be about 70% 
below normal, local officials said last year's surplus should be enough to 
carry the county through the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state water levels are way below normal," said Don Kendall, manager of 
the Calleguas Municipal Water District, which provides water from state 
resources to 450,000 users throughout the east county, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
"We're in drought watch mode, but there's probably adequate storage this year 
to get through to next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The county actually fares better than much of Southern California, state 
officials said, in large part because of water stored in the North Las Posas 
Groundwater Basin by Calleguas and because water levels at Lake Casitas are 
still high from last year's rains. 
</P>
<P>
 However, water district officials cautioned that relying on last year's heavy 
rains and resulting surplus -- snowpack was 150% of average at this time last 
year -- is dangerous business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be prudent," said Maurice Roos, a hydrologist with the state. "We 
have to be aware that we're not sure what next winter is going to bring. One 
more dry year could send us into drought." 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which delivers water 
it buys from the state to Calleguas, is asking customers to cut usage by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we have ample supplies of water for this year, but who knows what is 
going to happen next year?" spokesman Bob Gomperz said. If winter rains have 
not begun by November, he said, the district may institute mandatory cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the six-year drought ended last year, Gomperz said, most Southern 
Californians had learned to live with less water, installing conservation 
devices in showers, sinks and toilets. That awareness hasn't faded, he said, 
and, as a result, usage continues at lower-than-average levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said Calleguas is relying on several recent efforts it has made to 
"drought-proof" the region to ease the worries about a drought watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Pumping the North Las Posas basin with water from state resources has given 
the district a backup if the state returns to full drought status, he said. 
That underground basin can store up to 300,000 acre-feet, three times the 
amount consumed annually by the district's users. 
</P>
<P>
 One acre-foot is enough to supply an average family with water for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also plans to conserve water with the opening of a new 
reclamation plant near Oak Park this summer, Kendall said. Treated sewage 
system water from the plant will be used to irrigate parks, golf courses and 
other greenbelt areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Jones, spokesman for the state Department of Natural Resources in 
Sacramento, said runoff from the Sacramento River watershed is expected to be 
half its average this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we call a critically dry year," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said supplies at state reservoirs, now at about 90%, will dissipate before 
the next rainy season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "By fall, we may be at a point where reservoir storage is so low that we'll 
consider ourselves in a drought," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Ventura County Flood Control District, rainfall for the 
county was about 70% of normal this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Casitas Municipal Water District, which relies solely on Lake Casitas 
to supply its 55,000 users in western Ventura and the Ojai Valley, this year's 
rain, coupled with last year's surplus, was enough to keep the reservoir 93% 
full. 
</P>
<P>
 "No worries from us," said John Johnson, Casitas general manager. "We've got 
enough to last six or seven years." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Water Conservation District, which replenishes ground-water basins 
in the Santa Clara River Valley and the Oxnard Plain, also reported respectable 
water levels and plans no service cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lake Piru is at average inflow level for the year, and we've got substantial 
carry-over from last year, so we're in fine shape," General Manager Frederick 
Gientke said. County Rainfall

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; CARE AND SUPPORT FOR 
ABUSE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many women who walk through the doors of the Family Service 
Agency of Burbank have one thing in common -- they are trying to survive living 
in their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Battered, abused, afraid, they come seeking support and strategies sometimes 
just to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's Community Awareness Response and Education (CARE) program offers 
support groups for battered women and separate groups for batterers, when a 
court requires them to seek counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The CARE program was launched in 1992, when an increasing number of women 
started coming into the agency asking for help dealing with abuse, said JoAn 
Viele-Lyman, the program's coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get women from all kinds of backgrounds and nationalities and classes," 
said Amy Blackshaw, a volunteer who helps lead one of the weekly women's 
groups. "The groups are very, very diverse, yet there is a very common element 
because they are victims of violence in their own home. Many of them feel they 
are alone. The reality is they are not alone at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Viele-Lyman agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Culturally, when it comes to battering, we're all the same. It doesn't matter 
if the man is rich or poor. It cuts across all socioeconomic lines. 
Unfortunately it's alive and well in our communities," she said. "Most of them 
have absolutely no clue that they don't have to live like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups help women who are in abusive relationships, women who have left 
their abusers and women trying to build new relationships in the aftermath of 
abuse. The goal of the agency, Viele-Lyman stresses, is not to rescue, but to 
empower battered women with knowledge and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a safe environment. Safety and trust is crucial to the empowerment of 
these women," Viele-Lyman said. "You can't change in isolation. You can't 
change without information." 
</P>
<P>
 Viele-Lyman also takes that information on the road. She lectures on domestic 
violence at colleges, high schools and detention centers, hoping that the more 
the public hears, the more the seriousness of domestic violence will be 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency needs volunteers to help educate the public about domestic violence 
by speaking to community groups. Volunteers are also needed to help with child 
care, with one-on-one outreach and with leading the women's groups as Blackshaw 
does. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been extremely educational and eye-opening for me," said the 25-year-old 
from Pasadena. "I learn probably more than I teach. I get a lot from hearing 
these women from different backgrounds share their experiences and 
perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
 Viele-Lyman said the agency especially needs multilingual volunteers. But the 
most important criterion is that the volunteers be "passionate in their belief 
that women do not deserve to be abused," she said. "Violence is never OK. It's 
never an alternative. Never. Never." 
</P>
<P>

 The San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council is seeking volunteer drivers and 
substitutes for its Meals on Wheels program. Volunteers would pick up food from 
Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys and deliver it to homebound people of 
all ages. Contact Norm or Judy at (818) 365-8110. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteer Center of San Fernando Valley, a service of the Assistance 
League of Southern California, seeks volunteers for several agencies: 
</P>
<P>
 The Canoga Care Center needs people to work some evenings calling bingo, horse 
racing and other games. Children Are Our Future, a Canoga Park agency that 
operates group homes for troubled teens, needs clerical help. The Pacoima 
Senior Center also needs clerks. The Women's Care Cottage, which provides food 
and referrals for homeless women and children, needs members for its board of 
directors.

FIXATIONS: POMPADOUR AND CIRCUMSTANCE; JAKE BRICKS AND HIS BARBERSHOP IN ORANGE 
DRAW HUNDREDS OF ROCKABILLY REGULARS -- PLUS BANDS FROM AS FAR AS EUROPE -- FOR 
THE FLATTOPS AND DUCKTAILS OF THE NEARLY BYGONE '50S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jake Bricks was smoking a Marlboro Light in front of his barbershop, the 
nicotine density of his cigarette being the only giveaway that it wasn't 1956. 
Otherwise, the Pom-Aid in his hair, sharp clothes covering colorful tattoos and 
the pin-up bedecked shop behind him all belong to the era when fins were in. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stood to greet me, I couldn't help but notice Bricks casting a quick, 
appraising look at my hair and shoes and sensed a quick summation on his part 
that I'm beyond rockabilly redemption. You could rub chicken grease in my hair 
until the moon turned blue and I'd still look like an ex-hippie. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Bricks has a large clientele who are not patchouli-afflicted. 
Just off the Orange Circle at 110 N. Olive Ave., Jake's Barber Shop is a magnet 
for some 1,000 regular customers -- not to mention touring bands from as far as 
Europe -- who are desirous of the pompadours, flattops and ducktails he 
dispenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you do, please don't call me a hair stylist in the paper," he asked. 
"I don't wash hair. I don't trim long hair. I don't do women, plain and simple. 
This is a regular old-time, old-fashioned barbershop." 
</P>
<P>
 As we talked, he went to work on the pomped head of his friend and customer, 
musician Robert (Big Sandy) Williams. His preferred hair goop, by the way, is a 
supply of new-old-stock oleander-perfumed Kincaid Pom-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid, Bricks, 23, was no great fan of barbershops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the John John haircut, and only went in every six months. I didn't like 
going. Then, when I got into the rockabilly scene when I was in seventh grade, 
I started getting into haircuts. I went from going every six months to every 
three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial blast of rockabilly music happened too long ago to have even 
interested Bricks' parents. Instead, like most of the music's young fans, he 
was introduced to it by the Stray Cats and other revivalist bands in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty much the Stray Cats and the kids at school that got me into it. 
It seemed my whole junior high was kinda rockabilly at the time. Before that, 
when I was in elementary school, I thought I was into punk rock, Black Flag and 
all that. I cropped my hair and stuff, wore camouflage and boots. Then I went 
to a dance and saw this group of kids dressed different, and I think, 'What 
kind of punk rockers are those?' And my friend says, 'Those aren't punk 
rockers, they're rockabellies." So for like a year I thought it was called 
'rockabelly.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then in seventh grade I saw all these kids like that. So I go, 'Hey, how do I 
become like you?' They told me where to go and I got an argyle sweater, dress 
shirt, big giant wingtips, rolled-up jeans, Vaseline in my hair. It was the 
look, and that was it for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen all my friends change and go to different fads in the '80s, from 
new romantic to mod to punk rock. I kinda just shook my head, because to me 
rockabilly is forever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have speculated that in emulating the clean-cut '50s, kids were trying to 
irk their hippie-era parents. Bricks claims that wasn't the case with him, 
though he does acknowledge the generational difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom grew up in the '60s and '70s, so she liked the Doors and Led Zeppelin. 
I've got a picture of her with that hippie-flower child look, with the boots up 
to here, the miniskirt, the flowered shirt and long, long hair parted in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bricks was something of a pugilist in his youth, and his look only added to 
his confrontations.  
</P>
<P>
 "I went to like 13 high schools. I got kicked out of the first high school for 
fighting, and after that it just kept happening because I was the only 
rockabilly around. Somebody would grab my hair or pick on me. I attended 
Westminster High for a total of two periods. A bunch of guys came up to me when 
I was opening my locker, and one just gave me this big big sock in the jaw. I 
picked him up and threw him against the locker, and his friends jumped me. I 
got kicked out for it. I got cast as just a bad kid no matter what I did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays I stay away from that stuff. If anything happens I talk it through 
with people. Besides, if I break my hand, I can't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Between bouts in school, Bricks was in his local barbershop so often that the 
owner encouraged him to go to barber college. After graduation he went to work 
in the shop, with the barber telling him, he says, that the shop would be 
passed on to him. Instead he and the barber had a falling out over the 
clientele Bricks attracted, and he opened his own shop 25 months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go out on your own," he said. "I had to sell my car, almost lost 
my wife, everything, getting this place open. You shoulda seen it when I leased 
it. Everything in here was corroded, and brown, like an ugly leather '70s 
color, walls, ceiling, floors, cabinets." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop now is tiled in black, white and turquoise linoleum. The vintage 
chrome and white enamel Belmont barber chairs have been reupholstered in black 
Leatherette with turquoise piping. Raucous rockabilly music blares out of his 
small stereo (Bricks also sells rockabilly records and CDs at reasonable 
prices). The walls are decorated with '50s girlie pinups, bamboo-framed 
paint-by-numbers oils and photos of some of the famous and semi-famous heads 
he's had the pleasure to have known. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Big Sandy and his group the Fly-Rite Boys, Bricks has taken his 
trimmer to X's Billy Zoom, the Dave and Deke Combo, '50s star Sonny Burgess, a 
number of local and European rockabilly and country bands and even British star 
Morrissey, whose locks he likely could have bagged and sold. Whether his 
customers are rock gods or old-timers in their 70s coming in for a trim, Bricks 
charges $8. 
</P>
<P>
 The one head he'd really like to get ahold of is Sid King's. In the '50s the 
Texan headed the rockin' Sid King and the Five Strings. Today King is a barber, 
and Bricks once made a pilgrimage to Richardson, Tex., to meet him. "I got my 
hair cut by him, and it was great: I talked barbershop and music with him," 
Bricks said. Now he'd like to be able to cut King's hair sometime. "To me it's 
just a great honor to meet these guys. I get down and worship them on my hands 
and knees." 
</P>
<P>
 While we talked, an '80s-maned man and his young son came in for cuts. Bricks 
kept discouraging them until they left. It wasn't just that their hair was 
beyond his interest. "I try to stay away from little kids as much as I can. 
Parents always say, 'They're really good; they don't move around or cry.' Then 
they squirm and cry like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Once kids are a bit older, he often tries to recruit them into what he calls 
his "rockabilly army," getting them interested in the music and lifestyle of 
four decades ago. Like his shop, his home is appointed in '50s furniture. He 
drives a '58 Oldsmobile. "I was born and raised here in the old part of Orange 
near the circle. I'm so glad I have a shop right here. I'm fascinated with 
these old brick buildings, the signs on them you can barely read anymore. The 
place is great. It's just a shame the way they do things now. You drive up the 
91 (Freeway), and everywhere it looks just like they stuck little Monopoly 
pieces all over." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks the solidity and high-octane fun of the '50s has a lot to offer '90s 
kids.  
</P>
<P>
 "The generation I grew up in, the early '80s, there were 10 or 12 different 
fads in that little decade there. But the whole '50s were the '50s, and the 
'60s pretty much stayed the '60s. There wasn't so much change in five years. 
That's why you see these kids now running around doing the gang-banging stuff. 
There's no new styles for them to get into because they've all been used up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider my shop an outcast-of-society-type shop, for the unwanted. When I 
used to go to this other barbershop, some people were afraid of me, staring at 
me. But in here you don't get that. Greasy hair, tattoos, whatever the style, 
freaky or whatever, they don't get stared at or made fun of. I even have a few 
old guys who come in here, in their 60s and 70s. They're really cool guys. They 
were punks when they were young, and we carry on conversations that aren't just 
about golf or fishing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outcast or no, Bricks' business has prospered when few others do. And there 
aren't many barbershops so popular that they sell out of their trademark 
T-shirts, as he has. His old shirts read, "Hip Cuts 4 Hep Catz." His next 
batch, he says, will proclaim, "Custom Chops and Greasy Mops." 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "It's funny, in barber school I was the only one out of 100 students 
who paid attention when this old guy was showing how to cut a proper ducktail. 
These kids in school with me used to make fun of me all the time for wanting to 
be a regular barber instead of a hair stylist like them. Now, who do you think 
comes knocking on my door looking for jobs after making fun of me all this 
time? I've had three or four of them. I tell them, 'Get outta here. I don't 
want you working here. You're a hair stylist , remember?' "

 * Paper bags with eyeholes for sale in the reception area. 
</P>
<P>
 * His waiting room is crawling with Jacksons. 
</P>
<P>
 * At first visit, he nervously asks: "You didn't see '60 Minutes' last Sunday,

</P>
<P>
 * You're a guy, you go in for a nose job and you come out a triple D.

<P>
 "When dealing with serial killers, the best thing is to be a neighbor. The

Neighbors of serial killers never hear anything -- they only complain when 
someone's stereo is turned up too loud."

YOUR BODY: BODY WATCH; CURBING THE CRAVING FOR FATTY FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yesterday you promised yourself you would cut down on fat-filled foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Today you indulged in a single scoop of double chocolate fudge -- but you were 
kind enough to hold the cone -- and your taste buds sent an all-points bulletin 
to your brain: We can't live without this stuff! 
</P>
<P>
 So how do you reduce fat in your diet without undue tears and deprivation? 
</P>
<P>
 Retrain that palate! OK, so you're thinking what a failure it was when you 
tried to retrain your dog to like the couch less. But, really, it can be done. 
Learning to prefer lower-fat foods is one way. Another approach is to 
incorporate foods "engineered" to taste as if they still contain real fat. Each 
method has its pros and cons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heel, Palate!: "If you want to shift, eat foods naturally low in fat with no 
fat substitutes," advises Richard Mattes, a researcher and nutritionist at 
Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 To eliminate urges for high-fat foods, Mattes says, "you must reduce the 
exposure to 'mouth feel.' " That's scientific-ese for the great feeling of ice 
cream and other high-fat foods sliding over your tongue. In fake-fat -- or 
modified -- foods, manufacturers try to re-create that mouth-feel without the 
fat grams, sometimes more successfully than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have avoided high-fat foods for eight to 12 weeks, you will begin to 
prefer lower-fat foods, Mattes says. He bases this on a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fat Study: Mattes assigned subjects to three groups. One group was advised 
to follow a reduced-fat diet and omit all "discretionary" fat sources, such as 
table spreads and mayonnaise. Another group was placed on the same reduced-fat 
diet but allowed to eat fat-modified products. The diet was not modified in the 
control group. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 weeks, the two groups on the diets had reduced fat intake about the 
same amount -- from more than 30% of total calories to less than 20%. But the 
"pleasantness" ratings for high-fat food declined only in the group that did 
not use fat-modified products, says Mattes, whose study was published last year 
in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Because they reduced their 
exposure to fat, he says, they began to want it less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa, Fat: While eating foods with fat substitutes or the fat removed will 
reduce overall fat intake, it won't retrain your palate, he says. You will 
continue to crave high-fat foods. "If it feels like fat in your mouth, that's 
what you should avoid," Mattes says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Vote for Fake Fats: Relying only on naturally low-fat foods is unrealistic, 
given hectic schedules and lifestyles, contends Alicia Moag-Stahlberg, a 
Chicago dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn. She sees no 
harm in using a two-pronged approach, choosing lower-fat foods when you can, 
but also adding foods that have been modified to reduce or eliminate fat. (Fat 
substitutes can be found in a number of foods, including ice cream; low-fat 
milk is an example of modified fat.) 
</P>
<P>
 Liking the taste of fat is more than a sensory experience, she says. It's tied 
in to upbringing, family rituals and other factors. In her efforts to cut fat 
in the family diet, Moag-Stahlberg soon learned "not to mess with (her) 
family's ice cream." Her husband and two children will tolerate fat substitutes 
in some foods, but not dessert. Her husband grew up eating dessert every night 
and considers it a comforting family ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Moag-Stahlberg says more studies like Mattes' are needed to prove that 
retraining the palate to prefer less fat can be accomplished in the eight to 12 
week period he cites. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Caveats: Whether you try to reduce fat intake by eating foods naturally low in 
fat or foods engineered to be low in fat, beware: If you think you're eating 
low-fat foods, it's easy to overeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In another study -- published last year in the International Journal of 
Obesity -- Mattes and researcher Florence Caputo gave 17 subjects the same meal 
over three 12-day time blocks. During one time block, they told the subjects 
that the meals contained about the same amount of fat as they normally ate. 
During another time block, they said the meals contained more fat than usual 
and during yet another time block, less fat. 
</P>
<P>
 The subjects thought the study's purpose was to examine the effect of fat 
intake on odor perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people thought they were eating less fat, they ate more total calories," 
Mattes says. 
</P>

<P>
 Trimming Fat: Victoria Moran, author of "Get the Fat Out: 501 Simple Ways to 
Cut the Fat in Any Diet," suggests: 
</P>
<P>
 * Buying quality, non-stick cookware so you are less likely to throw in a pat 
of butter while cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buying expensive knives so that chopping vegetables is less of a chore. 
</P>
<P>
 * Considering gourmet condiments -- such as raspberry vinegar, capers and 
Dijon mustard -- that don't add appreciable fat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using freshly ground pepper and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Washing and spinning dry salad greens before you put them in the 
refrigerator. When the time comes, making a salad will seem like less work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Putting salad oil in a spray bottle (or buy it that way); you'll probably 
use less.

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; RUNNING ON INSTINCT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My favorite downtime activity has resulted in sprained knees, twisted ankles 
and broken fingers.It's an activity after which I frequently need more downtime 
to recover. I play pickup basketball. It satisfies the little voice in the back 
of my head that nags me to exercise, and the gym provides a place for guys to 
be guys. But the most compelling reason: Basketball is played almost completely 
on instinct. And for me, an auditor whose sedentary working world is full of 
numbers and analysis, the joy of play using little more than boyish impulse is 
irresistible.

PUTTING CHILD AND FAMILY FIRST; JUNIOR LEAGUE IS HONORED FOR ITS EFFORTS TO 
CURB ABUSE AND ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY 
</P>

<P>
 Those fighting on the front lines in the escalating battle against child abuse 
were honored last week when the Child Abuse Prevention Council of Orange County 
staged its 11th annual Community Advocacy Dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 At the invitation of the council, the Orange County Board of Supervisors and 
Frank Fasel, the presiding judge of Juvenile Court, 300 guests turned up at Le 
Meridien in Newport Beach to applaud the Junior League of Orange County, which 
received the council's Child Advocate of the Year Award. The $50-per-person 
dinner also raised about $10,000 for the council. League Saluted 
</P>
<P>
 Tables were decorated with balloons and toy boxes that had small teddy bears 
and miniature rocking horses on their lids. Guests were served chicken with 
Forestiere sauce on a bed of spinach and a chocolate cup filled with fresh 
berries and raspberry coulis.  
</P>
<P>
 After the All-American Boys Chorus sang a medley of show tunes and patriotic 
numbers, State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley presented the Child Advocate award to the Junior League. The league was 
chosen for its commitment to help stop child abuse and adolescent pregnancy in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we'd be more effective if we targeted two issues," said Virginia 
Genovese, immediate past president of the league, who accepted the award. "We 
really feel strongly we can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the league-sponsored projects: Orangewood Children's Home, which 
received a $117,000 grant for its building fund from the league; Court 
Appointed Special Advocates, a program launched by the league in 1983 to 
represent children who have been made dependents of the court through abuse and 
neglect, and the Child Abuse Services Team, a program designed to reduce the 
trauma experienced by child victims of sexual abuse. Uphill Battle 
</P>
<P>
 Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the Child Abuse Prevention Council is 
a coalition of more than 90 agencies as well as businesses and individuals 
committed to the prevention of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there were 36,721 reported cases of child sexual, physical, 
emotional abuse and neglect in Orange County -- the highest number to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are shocked when they learn we have a problem in Orange County," said 
Shelley Westmore, council chairwoman. "But child abuse cuts across all 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Families under stress who don't have outside support are at the greatest risk, 
she said. The council tries to prevent abuse by providing family counseling, 
parenting classes and support groups to such families. 
</P>
<P>
 To alert people to the child abuse problem, the council launched its 1994 
Child Abuse Prevention Campaign called "Open Your Heart to a Child." As part of 
the campaign the council distributed 50,000 blue ribbons and educational 
bookmarks during April (Child Abuse Prevention Month). 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to give people something they can do to prevent child abuse," 
said Barbara Oliver, director of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Ribbon Campaign originated in 1989 when Bonnie Finney, a grandmother 
in Norfolk, Va., learned her grandson had died from child abuse, Oliver said. 
Finney tied a blue ribbon around the antenna of her van in her grandson's 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "She chose the color blue because she didn't want to forget the battered and 
bruised body of her grandson," Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the dinner will benefit the council's Life Enrichment Assistance 
Program, which offers grants and scholarships to youths leaving foster or group 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were Carole Neustadt, event chairwoman; past council 
presidents Betty Clark, Anne Nutt, Martha Killefer, Evelyn Young, Margaret 
Jager, Marcia Adler and Dee Knapper; Larry and Carol Leaman, Sylvia Valles, 
Deborah Vaswani, Beth Groves, Gene and Linda Howard, Mary Hendrickson, Jim and 
Judy Nelson, Ron and Merry Lloyd, Del and Glennda Mourer, Lilia Powell, Judith 
Swayne, Pamela Iles, Frank and Mary Ann Xavier. KATHRYN BOLD

 Nursing Rats Are a Study in Sensitivity 
</P>
<P>
 And now, from the "So What Else Is New?" files of medical research comes a 
report that nursing mothers have increased sensitivity in the area where their 
babies suck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Journal of Neuroscience has announced that mother rats experience 
heightened sensation on their nipple-studded underbellies. 
</P>
<P>
 Human mothers who have felt the sometimes excruciating suction of hungry 
little mouths may not be surprised. But what may startle even the most 
sleep-deprived mom is that such stimulation appears to double the size of the 
area registering touch, pain and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts told Science News magazine that the study implies maternal behavior is 
more complicated than once thought. "A wonderful piece of work," said Thomas R. 
Insel of the National Institute of Mental Health. "It only underscores the 
importance of sensory stimulation." (And of mothers, we might add.) Clearing Up 
Confusion About Donating Organs 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Americans specify their wishes to become organ donors when they 
register for their driver's licenses. Health experts say this well-meaning 
gesture has not been as successful as it could be because prospective donors 
don't specify their wishes verbally to family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the donor card consent is legally binding, "no organ procurement 
agency will take organs without the family's permission," said Barbara Meltzer 
of the Regional Organ Procurement Agency of Southern California. It is not 
uncommon for family members to deny the donation request if the individual did 
not expressly stated his or her wishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Health officials are asking everyone who carries a donor card to also tell 
someone about their wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 For information or to receive an organ donor card, call ROPA of Southern 
California at (800) 933-0440. Preparation May Help Cut Summer-Camp Injuries 
</P>
<P>
 A little planning and an early medical check-up may prevent a child's injury 
at summer camp. You should: 
</P>
<P>
 * Visit the pediatrician a couple of months before camp begins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inquire about camp activities. The American Academy of Pediatrics says 
injuries on trampolines can be catastrophic. Diving is also a potentially 
dangerous sport requiring correct facilities, careful instruction and constant 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask the camp director about the availability of medical personnel, location 
of the nearest hospital, and emergency procedures and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a child is going to camp for a specific sport, obtain information on the 
instructors and consider a conditioning program for these activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, all these preparatory motions won't preclude a good case of poison 
ivy. When Babies Swallow Things They Shouldn't 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder why the piggy bank is never full? Babies and preschoolers favor pennies 
when it comes to swallowing foreign objects, but a new device enables doctors 
to retrieve such objects that lodge in the esophagus. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Pittsburgh, researchers have developed a technique that 
threads a balloon-tipped catheter through the nose or throat to the object 
blocking the esophagus. Once the tip is past the blockage, the balloon is 
inflated and the catheter withdrawn, bringing the object into the mouth where 
it can be retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors switch to a catheter with a magnet tip to capture other commonly 
swallowed objects, such as small disk batteries and ball bearings. The catheter 
can't be used for sharp objects, such as pins, which could be pushed into the 
wall of the esophagus. 
</P>
<P>
 * This health roundup, compiled by C.A. Wedlan from wire service reports, 
appears in Life & Style on Tuesdays.

 * Talk about 'Talk Soup': Things got soupy at E!'s "Talk Soup" last week. On 
Friday morning, Greg Kinnear, who hosts the show on which he shows clips of

Brogliatti a liar on the air. The senior vice president of programming for E! 
promptly called Brogliatti to apologize, and pulled the program, scheduled for 
four repeats during the day, off the air. Last week's TV Guide noted that a lot 
of talk shows no longer supply clips to Kinnear's show and quoted Brogliatti 
for the reason Warner Bros. no longer helps with Jenny Jones and Jane Whitney 
clips. " 'Talk Soup,' " she said, "degrades our shows and makes fools of the 
guests." On the Friday show, Kinnear said, "Now when you open this article up. 
. . there's something that you need to know. Barbara Brogliatti is lying 
through her teeth. . . It has everything to do with some legal entanglements 
that are happening here with Warner Bros." Brogliatti responded that Kinnear 
was referring, incorrectly, to litigation over the title of a new syndicated 
show planned by Warner Bros., "which is totally irrelevant to the clip issue."

 Message to Grant: Nine days after he died, former President Nixon's 
congratulations were delivered to gospel singer Amy Grant. Nixon, who died 
April 22, sent his best regards to the performer in a letter dated May 1, the 
day she was awarded the Pax Christi Award by Minnesota's St. John's University. 
Nixon's former spokeswoman said the letter had been routinely dated ahead to 
coincide with the event. It was on display at the university, along with 
letters to Grant from President Clinton and former Presidents Reagan, Bush, 
Carter and Ford. The Pax award, presented annually and usually reserved for 
theologians, was given to Grant, 34, for her service to the gospel through her 
music. PEOPLE WATCH

VASQUEZ'S SPECIAL TREATMENT AT NIXON FUNERAL FRUSTRATES BOARD; PROTOCOL: HE WAS 
THE ONLY SUPERVISOR TO BE GIVEN A PURPLE PIN THAT ALLOWED ENTRANCE TO THE 
EXCLUSIVE RECEPTION HOSTED BY THE FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Several Orange County supervisors expressed frustration Monday over how their 
colleague, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, was the only one among the board 
members to be given VIP treatment at last week's funeral for former President 
Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 All five supervisors attended the funeral, but only Vasquez got a coveted 
purple pin that allowed admission to an exclusive reception afterward that was 
hosted by Nixon's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and William G. Steiner said they had to use 
their wits to get past a phalanx of security personnel to gain admittance to 
the reception. 
</P>
<P>
 An angry Supervisor Roger R. Stanton was shut out altogether, forced to wait 
at the reception door for a half an hour until his colleagues emerged so he 
could get a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who went home right after the 
funeral service, said he was aware of his colleagues' concerns but did not want 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy appeared to center on the different-colored pins that were 
issued to the 4,000 guests who attended Wednesday's funeral at the Richard 
Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The best seats at the funeral and entrance to the private reception that 
followed went to those guests wearing purple pins. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, Wieder, Steiner and Stanton were given yellow pins, which only allowed 
them into the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez and his guests were issued purple pins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was truly embarrassing to know that the four of us were not playing the 
same role as Gaddi was," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez could not be reached for comment Monday, but his colleagues said their 
disappointment stems from the fact that Vasquez was initially scheduled to 
attend the funeral with them in a limousine provided by the county Office of 
Protocol. However, early last week he let other board members know that he 
would be making his own arrangements, his colleagues said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez told his colleagues after the funeral that he was not aware they were 
issued different pins and thus denied entrance to the reception, the 
supervisors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez, whose 3rd Supervisorial District includes the Nixon library, was a 
strong supporter of the facility's development. Pictures of the late President 
adorn his county office, as does a note from Nixon complimenting him on a 
speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Anderson, the county protocol chief who spent days helping with 
preparations for the funeral and organized the supervisors' attendance, said 
the guest lists were "controlled by the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace and 
the family." Library officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>

 "I would have stood out on Yorba Linda Boulevard to be part of such a historic 
event," Steiner said. "But being part of the reception was a little more 
difficult than anticipated. I wish Gaddi had given his colleagues the same 
consideration as he gave the others with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton could not be reached for comment Monday, but one official recalled 
that he had "never seen Roger so upset" as when he was denied entrance to the 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
 As a statement of their frustration, some board members, who have started 
referring to themselves as members of the "Excluded Club," said they have 
discussed wearing their yellow pins at today's Board of Supervisors meeting.

OLMOS STANDS AND DELIVERS IN CAL STATE TALK 
</P>

 Delivering a lesson on Latino pride Monday at Cal State Fullerton, actor and 
community activist Edward James Olmos urged about 500 students to be 
encouraging role models to struggling youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give of your time; give of your mind," said Olmos, the 47-year-old star who 
played a demanding calculus teacher in the film "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 Olmos' appearance, plus a low-rider car show and poetry readings and skits by 
the Chicano Poet Society, helped kick off the university's weeklong Cinco de 
Mayo celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "While in your four years here, go into the junior high (schools) and be a 
mentor to one kid," said Olmos, who serves as a member of the Whittier College 
Board of Trustees. "You've got to go back to your junior highs and help, 
because we're losing so many beautiful kids." 
</P>
<P>
 After Olmos' speech in the University Center's Titan Pavilion, some in the 
audience stepped to microphones on the floor to ask questions and make 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of suffering all around the world and we need a lot of stars 
like you to come down and support us, and we the students do need to be 
involved in our barrios," said Javier Cortez, 26, a Cal State Fullerton student 
and community activist. He also led the students in a pre-Olmos speech chant, 
"Si se puede!" (yes, you can). 
</P>
<P>
 Olmos, who has two biological children, two stepchildren and two adopted 
children, starred in, directed and co-produced "American Me," a 1992 film about 
the self-perpetuating cycle of gang life in East Los Angeles. He also played 
Lt. Martin Castillo in the television program "Miami Vice" and won an Oscar 
nomination for his role in "Stand and Deliver" in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor also joined other public figures in calling for calm during the 1992 
Los Angeles riots ad helped organize cleanup efforts after the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Acevedo, 32, a student, said she was surprised to hear what Olmos 
had to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't know what he would say but for him to tell us that we are all 
one community, no matter what color you are -- he's hitting it on the nail. 
He's trying to tell us that if we remain segregated, we will head into 
self-destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Other university students and instructors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this presentation as a genuine inspiration," said Adolfo Ortega, a 
Chicano Studies professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ronald Hughes, chairman of the Department, of Sociology, "I think people 
need to constantly be reminded that they need to give back to their community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that was Olmos' main point, he also talked about what it means to be 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the '60s, to be a Mexican American was to be nothing, nada, " he said. 
"Now is a time to bring about change."

FINAL ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN TAY MURDER TRIAL; COURT: JURORS ARE EXPECTED TO 
BEGIN DELIBERATIONS TODAY ON WHETHER TO CONVICT ROBERT CHAN OF FIRST-DEGREE 
MURDER OR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER IN THE 1992 KILLING OF HONOR STUDENT STUART A. 
TAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors were asked Monday to choose between first-degree murder and voluntary 
manslaughter convictions for a teen-ager accused of masterminding the 1992 New 
Year's Eve slaying of honor student Stuart A. Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum told the Orange County Superior Court 
jury that it could disregard the prosecution's entire case and still have 
enough evidence from Robert Chan's own testimony to prove he is guilty of 
murdering Tay, 17, of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan insisted that others orchestrated the killing but tripped himself up by 
admitting that he followed orders during the fatal attack, Rosenblum told the 
jurors during closing arguments. Accomplices are held equally culpable under 
the law, the prosecutor told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He convicted himself; he was convicted out of his own mouth," the prosecutor 
told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no room left for Mr. Chan to weasel out of it. It's over," he later 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman said Rosenblum's case was weak 
because it relied heavily on an admitted liar who pleaded guilty to his role in 
Tay's slaying and agreed to testify against the other teen-agers in exchange 
for being prosecuted as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 The key prosecution witness in Chan's trial was Charles Choe, 18, of 
Fullerton. Choe, who admitted participating in the slaying but said he did not 
strike Tay, is expected to be released from the California Youth Authority when 
he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. At the time of the 
slaying, Chan told jurors, he was under the delusion that Tay had rigged his 
home with explosives and was about to kill him. Under the theory of "imperfect 
self-defense," jurors should convict Chan of the less serious charge of 
voluntary manslaughter, Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an individual with an extremely troubled mind," Schulman told the 
jury, which is expected to begin deliberating today. "If Stuart Tay was not 
eliminated, in (Chan's) mind, Stuart Tay would kill him."  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Chan plotted Tay's death because he feared Tay would 
double-cross him in a planned computer heist. Tay was lured to a Buena Park 
back yard and beaten unconscious with baseball bats before rubbing alcohol was 
forced down his throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, once a candidate for class valedictorian, admitted to jurors that he 
then taped Tay's mouth and nose before burying him in a shallow grave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection begins today for three other youths charged in Tay's death: 
Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Mun Bong Kang, 19, and Kirn Young Kim, 
18, both of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan faces life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder and charges that 
he used a baseball bat and ambushed Tay, who attended Foothill High School in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused murderers attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. The six 
teen-agers got together to plan the robbery of an Anaheim computer parts 
dealer. The scheme began to unravel when Chan learned that Tay was lying about 
his identify and background. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney told jurors that some of the blame for the killing rests 
with the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay allegedly tried to impress his new friends by claiming to be a 19-year-old 
crime figure with dozens of followers and involvement in illegal activities 
ranging from counterfeiting to weapon sales and computer pirating. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan began to fear Tay, Schulman said. In his feeble mental state, Chan became 
convinced that Tay had planted bombs in his home and was about to kill him, the 
defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was "playing with fire and didn't realize it," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's true or not doesn't matter," Schulman said of Chan's fear that 
he was about to be killed. "It's what he believes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenblum asked jurors to not be "gullible" and noted that the plot to 
kill Tay was hatched over many days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is not whether or not (Chan) is paranoid schizophrenic, because it 
doesn't matter," Rosenblum said. "This young man knew exactly what he was doing 
every step of the way."

SANTA ANA BREAKS GROUND FOR JAIL; CRIME: OFFICIALS LAUD THE FACILITY AS 
CRITICAL TO THE CITY'S POLICING EFFORTS. BUT SOME RESIDENTS CRITICIZE ITS COST 
AND FEAR THE COUNTY AND OTHERS WILL BE SHIPPING INMATES IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Donning hard hats and shoveling dirt, Santa Ana city officials ceremoniously 
launched construction of a $107-million jail and police administration building 
Monday, praising it as a key to crime fighting for the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have suffered from a 'no room at the inn' sign at the County Jail," Mayor 
Daniel H. Young told a crowd of more than 50 city employees and other 
supporters who gathered for the small ceremony. "By not being able to take 
criminals into the County Jail for booking, we have faced tremendous 
limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana jail, which will be able to house 420 inmates sentenced for up 
to a year, will allow police to carry out sting operations with the assurance 
that cells will be ready and waiting, especially on Friday nights when the 
County Jail fills beyond capacity, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the celebration of the facility, financed by the biggest bond issue ever 
sold by the city for a single project, comes amid growing criticism by some 
residents that it is far too costly and will send a message to the county that 
jails, and a possible expansion of the Central Jail in Santa Ana, are welcome 
in the downtown area. The city will not be able to resist county offers to pay 
for space at the new jail, they add. 
</P>
<P>
 "By building the city jail, you will have diminished any argument that you may 
have presented to the county to keep a jail out of a residential area," said 
community activist and mayoral candidate John Raya.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people in the community like myself who are going, 'Wow, 
now (Santa Ana) has become like Motel 6 for prisoners. We'll leave a light on 
for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Ron Heike predicted: "The city's not going to be able to afford that 
jail, and it's just a matter of time before the county takes over that 
facility."  
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been politically touchy, with the City Council taking a hard 
stance several years ago against county efforts to build a new jail in downtown 
Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is silly. I still have signs under my bed at home that say 
'Santa Ana has done its time!' We've been fighting a jail in downtown Santa Ana 
for years," Heike said. "Dan Young was even against putting a jail there." 
</P>
<P>
 But this jail is different, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing, these are our own bad guys that we're talking about putting in 
our jail. We're not talking about bad guys from Fullerton, San Clemente or 
Mission Viejo," Young said. "We're taking our share of the responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that the city will consider renting space once its own 
needs are met. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do welcome their money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would probably consider renting space to neighboring cities and the 
federal government, which will have a greater need for space once the new 
federal courthouse is constructed, before it would consider taking county 
prisoners, added Police Chief Paul M. Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials add that the new jail will save the city about $1.5 
million a year in booking fees it now pays to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The groundbreaking for the jail comes two weeks after the City Council 
approved an agreement to rent up to 14 beds a day in its 48-cell 
pre-arraignment facility to the U.S. Marshal Service for federal prisoners 
whose cases are pending. It also comes after the county transferred 
maximum-security prisoners to the Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange last month, 
highlighting the county's overcrowding dilemma and enraging city officials in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana jail will be located on eight acres near the Municipal Stadium 
at Civic Center Drive and Shelton Street. The project includes a 
236,000-square-foot administration building designed to accommodate expansion 
through the year 2050; a four-story jail for 420 inmates with a kitchen and 
laundry facility; a parking garage and a 900-foot tunnel linking the jail with 
the Orange County Intake/Release Center.  
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the financing for the project in March, 
hiking the utility tax from 5% to 6% to help finance it. But officials concede 
that won't be enough.  
</P>
<P>
 While the utility tax increase will raise about $3.2 million a year, the 
30-year debt service on the $107-million bond issuance will start at $5.5 
million a year and climb to $8.5 million year within a decade, Finance Director 
Rod Coloma said.  
</P>
<P>
 Coloma said the city will have to dip into sales and property tax revenue to 
finance the debt. It remains unclear how much it will cost to operate the jail, 
but Young said it will come out of the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our mind, it's just something we have to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Raya: "Where does the money to operate the jail come from? The only 
place it comes from is by renting the rooms out to the highest paying 
customer."

FOSTERING LOVE; COUNTY TO HONOR 3 FAMILIES FOR OPENING HOMES -- AND HEARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Carolyn Griffith knew 14 years ago when she took in her first foster child -- 
a baby boy abandoned in a hotel by his mother -- that she might have to give 
him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing could really ready her for the flood of emotions that day seven 
months later when the boy left her home to be reunited with his father and 
grandparents. "Nothing had prepared us for the kind of pain we would be going 
through. When I saw the back of his head in the car (when he was taken away), 
it was devastating, it really was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That pain has not stopped Griffith and her husband, William, from taking in 44 
more foster children since then, and the couple will be honored today along 
with two other foster families for the continued commitment that they have 
shown toward children in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Griffiths, the board will recognize Willie and Leroy Barnes of 
Orange, who have given homes to many foster children over the past nine years, 
and Regina Markwardt of Santa Ana, who has taken in 20 children over the many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Labitzke, who coordinates the county's foster homes program, said the 
Barneses, the Griffiths and Markwardt "are the ultimate volunteers." 
</P>
<P>
 All five, she said, share a common strength: They are willing to take in 
children who have particularly critical needs -- whether the child is 
developmentally disabled or has a baby of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among about 600 families in Orange County that raise foster children, 
many of whom come from abusive households, for about $300 a month per child. "I 
think they're all heroes," Labitzke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors began giving the awards in 1986 after noting a 
critical shortage of foster parents. "We needed to find a way to show these 
families how much we do value them and appreciate what they are doing. They are 
all doing a great job, but there are some that are more outstanding than 
others," Labitzke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty foster families were nominated for the award by social service 
agencies, other foster parents and probation officers, and the three winners 
were picked from that group. They will be honored at 8:30 a.m. at the Hall of 
Administration in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, 45, become a foster mother in 1980 after she saw a friend bringing 
along different toddlers to church. She later learned they were foster 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always looked so cute, although I didn't know at the time it was just 
dressing up the wounds of sexual abuse and some of the other ills these 
children go through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking in that first baby boy, she, her husband and two daughters -- 
both in their 20s -- have never been without a foster child for more than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith now has four foster children and one child she adopted after being 
his foster mother. But Labitzke said about half the county's foster children 
are eventually reunited with their parents.  
</P>
<P>
 "I see what an important role that foster parents play in breaking a cycle of 
abuse," Labitzke said of Griffith's work, adding that Griffith was presented 
with the Great American Family Award in 1987 by then-First Lady Nancy Reagan at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Barnes said she decided to become a foster mother because she "felt 
sorry for (the children). They didn't have anywhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she had already raised two boys of her own, Barnes decided to start with 
foster sons. Later, she began caring for girls who had been on criminal 
probation.  
</P>
<P>
 One 17-year-old girl who has lived with the Barneses for three years said: "We 
have a good relationship, like a real grandmother and granddaughter."  
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, whom she sees regularly, has seven other children and has 
had trouble maintaining a job. "It's better for me to stay here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She goes to the same high school as another of the Barnes' foster children, a 
16-year-old girl. The two tell their classmates they are cousins. But not 
everyone in school believes them, she says, because one is black and the other 
is white. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old has a quick retort: "Haven't you heard of interracial 
marriage?" 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the home, however, it can be more difficult to forget about race. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old, who has been with the Barneses for a year, says she gets 
along with everyone in the family. But, she added, "I have my moments, because 
I'm the only white person here." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes tries not to let that get in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see her, I see a girl, I don't see a white girl. (People) say why do I 
care, and I tell them, 'I care because you are a human being.' . . . I treat 
these like they're mine. I don't get on them like a herd of horses."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEW GROUP TO TARGET CITY PENSION SPIKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opposition to pension spiking by city employees has led to the formation of a 
new citizens' group. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Mello, a retired mechanical engineer who is spearheading the new 
organization, announced that the group is calling itself the Citizens Bureau of 
Investigation.He said about 25 Huntington Beach residents currently are 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main thrust right now is the spiking scandal," Mello said. He added that 
in the future, the group will investigate suspected wastes of money by city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking involves government employees who artificially increase their pensions 
by converting unused vacation days into a final-year salary. Mello's group 
claims that 153 current city employees are scheduled to benefit from pension 
spiking, and he has criticized City Atty. Gail Hutton for not making their 
names public. Hutton's office has said the names should not be made public 
because of privacy rights of the employees.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; HONORED TUTOR WANTS TO DO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eduardo Garcia carefully tapped the keys on a computer with two fingers, 
producing a poem called "Relaxing Flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old boy typed: "Five little flowers standing in the sun . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 minutes, Eduardo finished his 10 lines of verse under the guidance of 
tutor Rose Espinoza. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, 42, has filled her garage on Fifth Avenue with two computers, 
shelves of books, desks and other classroom materials so she can tutor Eduardo 
and about 35 other neighborhood youngsters after school. She started the 
after-school school three years ago, to woo area children away from the streets 
and to their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza's homework headquarters was dubbed "Rosie's garage" by the community. 
But more recently, the program was given a formal name and won national 
recognition, and now Espinoza is launching a fund-raising program to expand her 
free service to the summertime. 
</P>
<P>
 Called MAS or Motivating Adolescents to Succeed, the program last week was 
recognized by President Clinton. He picked Espinoza, a computer designer for 
Beckman Instruments in Brea, as one of 21 volunteers nationwide who received 
the prestigious Presidential Volunteer Action Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza wants to expand the enrichment program to the summer so her young 
pupils will be kept busy with recreational activities, sports leagues or arts 
classes. And since these youngsters come from poor families that cannot afford 
to buy athletic uniforms or pay for piano or dance lessons, Espinoza is asking 
local businesses and organizations to help her fund the program. 
</P>
<P>
 She's named the fund campaign the "MAS Field of Dreams" because her students 
have never participated in organized sports leagues or joined a children's 
performing troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids deserve it," said Espinoza, who offers rewards to those who get 
straight A's on their quarterly report cards, show improvement in their grades 
or get on their school's honor roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The students range in age from 4 to 18, said Espinoza, whose sister, Victoria 
Kennedy, also helps tutor. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, their work has helped students improve their grades, and most 
of the youngsters attribute their increased motivation to Espinoza's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Borja, 12, said he used to get Cs and Ds. "Now I get mostly Bs and some 
As," said the Imperial Middle School sixth-grader. "We're lucky that Rosie 
helps us because if she didn't help us, nobody else would." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis said his parents speak only Spanish and cannot help him with his 
schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 As an offshoot of her efforts, Espinoza persuaded the Fullerton Joint Union 
High School District to send a teacher to her garage four days a week so a 
dozen local parents could be tutored in English after their children leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza also occasionally takes her pupils on tours of nearby university and 
college campuses and on outings to museums, opera houses and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosie is the best lady I ever met," said Eduardo, a Las Positas Elementary 
School third-grader. "She always helps and worries about us and she takes us to

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; FINANCE REPORTS FOR OLD TOWN CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The two candidates vying to represent the Old Town district have each raised 
more than $5,000 with just a week left in the runoff election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters go to the polls May 10 to choose between incumbent Councilwoman Marilyn 
Bruce Hastings and businessman Jim Klisanin.The polls will be open from 7 a.m. 
and 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters should go to the same polling station they voted at during April's 
general election, said City Clerk Joanne M. Yeo. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports filed last week by both candidates showed that 
Hastings collected a total of $5,900 in contributions while Klisanin collected 
$5,647. 
</P>
<P>
 Final campaign finance reports must be submitted to the city clerk's office by 
the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings came within a few votes of winning the general election outright in a 
three-way race against Klisanin and community activist Charles Antos. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings and Klisanin are fighting for the right to represent the Old Town 
district, a neighborhood of small tile-roofed houses, apartments and beachfront 
mansions bisected by the Main Street business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings has been an outspoken opponent of development. She has served on a 
council that some merchants consider anti-business because it has rejected bids 
by alcohol-selling establishments to expand their operating hours. Hastings has 
championed the views of some Old Town residents who argue there is already an 
over-concentration of liquor-selling businesses on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin, a teacher, real estate agent and developer, said that Hastings and 
the current council have not worked hard enough to improve the business 
climate. He said the council has saddled merchants with too many regulations 
and fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Hastings and Klisanin do support the building of a police substation at 
the Seal Beach Pier.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CONTRACT FOR STADIUM REPAIR TO BE AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today is expected to award a $3.6-million construction 
contract to a Hawthorne company that submitted the lowest bid for repairing the 
earthquake damage at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid by Parr Construction was substantially lower than city officials' 
estimate of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprised a lot of people that it was that low," city spokesman Bret 
Colson said.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hope to have the stadium repaired by mid-August. The 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake toppled the stadium's 17.5-ton Sony Jumbotron 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract involves installing a new scoreboard and repairing a concession 
stand, restrooms and several thousand seats. Parr's bid was $3.6 million. The 
next-lowest bid was $3.64 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have considered applying for federal and state assistance to 
help cover the repair costs. The stadium's earthquake insurance policy has a 
$6-million deductible. The city also is considering legal action against the 
installers of the original scoreboard. MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; CITY TO LET LEGION STAGGER FEE PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have decided to allow a local veterans organization to 
pay city fees of $900 by installment rather than in a lump sum up front. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Legion Post 783 had asked the council to waive the $900, which 
includes $750 for a conditional-use permit and $150 in various charges the 
group will incur if it moves its headquarters to a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 To save money, the veterans plan to move from 11320 Beach Blvd. to a 
lower-rent building at 10576 Magnolia Ave., said William Snyder, a Korean War 
veteran who is planning the move. Snyder asked the council for the fee waiver, 
saying the group has contributed much to the city and wants to save the $900 
for charitable uses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Linda J. Pappas Diaz said last week that she feared waiving 
the fees would be unfair to other groups and would set an uncomfortable 
precedent. Mayor Sal Sapien said the council would not have to grant extensions 
of fees to other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The legion's permit application is in the hands of the Planning Commission. If 
the Planning Commission rejects it, the veterans should not be forced to pay 
the $750 permit fee, Sapien proposed. Normally, if a conditional-use permit 
application is denied, no money is returned to the applicant because city staff 
already has done review work. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Greg Hulsizer reported that planning staff members are likely to 
recommend that new site be approved. The Planning Commission is scheduled to 
consider the application on June 1. If approved, the veterans will begin paying 
for the permit Dec. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 American Legion members raise money for charity groups that work in the city 
and region. They also volunteer to help on various projects. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; COUNCIL TO WEIGH PLAYHOUSE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who oppose a plan to build a new theater will appeal the Planning 
Commission's approval of the project to the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say the proposed 250-seat Second Stage, a spinoff from the Moulton 
Theatre on Laguna Canyon Road, would provide a place where "artistically 
adventuresome" projects could be staged while enhancing the city's reputation 
as an "arts mecca." 
</P>
<P>
 The new playhouse would be built at the south end of town in a now-empty 
building that once housed a Bank of America branch. The project has had the 
solid backing of the city's arts and business communities, and the Planning 
Commission approved it last May. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some residents of the Three Arch Bay neighborhood adjacent to the 
project site want the council to overturn the plan. They say that having a 
theater next door would be too disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of constant traffic in the parking lot at late hours during the week 
and on the weekends is intolerable," wrote a theater opponent in one of the 
hundreds of letters both for and against the project that have poured into the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the Planning Commission meeting, we've gotten letters almost every 
day," city planner Ann Larson said Monday. "It's gotten to the point, though, 
that the letters don't mean a great deal, because they seem pretty (evenly) 
split." 
</P>
<P>
 If a majority of the City Council votes tonight to uphold the Planning 
Commission's decision, theater operators plan to open the new facility by early 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Stage is a 10-year dream of Laguna Community Players Inc., a 
theater group commonly known as Laguna Playhouse that operates out of the 
Moulton Theatre. The nonprofit group bought the former Bank of America building 
in 1991 and decided last year that it was the ideal place to create a second 
playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater operators have agreed to improve the fencing between the bank building 
and a row of Three Arch Bay homes to soften the noise. They have also agreed to 
let the city review the amount of traffic and noise the playhouse is generating 
three months after it opens. 
</P>
<P>
 The project prompted a 3 1/2-hour public debate when it went before the 
Planning Commission, which finally approved it on a 3-2 vote and with a list of 
conditions. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CITY TO START REWARD PROGRAM ON GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted to offer rewards to residents who help catch 
graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents whose information leads to the conviction of graffiti vandals 
defacing property are eligible for rewards of $500, $250 or $100.The council, 
which approved the program in a 5-0 vote last week, allocated $5,000 for the 
new program from its unappropriated reserves fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need help from people in the community in apprehending people who spray 
graffiti on public and private property," Mayor Gene Beyer said. "It's a step 
in the right direction and this resolution should help keep our city clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new measure, the city will pay $500 for information in cases 
involving damage that totals $5,001 or more. If the property damage is less 
than $5,000, the tipster will receive $250. Residents will earn $100 if a 
suspect is enrolled in a rehabilitation program instead of having formal 
criminal charges filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution was developed partly because residents who have helped police 
catch graffiti artists in the past have asked for rewards. Residents may choose 
to remain anonymous and still receive cash awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims for payment must be made to the Police Department within 60 days of a 
conviction. The Police Department has final discretion in determining whether 
to pay a reward and to whom the payment shall be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers say the new measure will strengthen a graffiti removal program the 
council passed in April, 1993. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; SCHOOL TO CELEBRATE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Newport Elementary School was opened in 1894, it shared Balboa peninsula 
with a bustling wharf and some oceanfront cottages and the city jail. The 
McFadden family donated the materials, and local townspeople built the wooden 
school for the first class of 18 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, like the city, has grown enormously since then, but it will try to 
recapture some old-time feel this month with a centennial celebration that will 
feature a reunion for alumni, a dance and other festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 The big birthday bash happens on May 21, and school officials and parents are 
working feverishly to locate students, parents, teachers and administrators who 
have been associated with the school on the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school has always drawn (from the families of local) fishermen, cannery 
workers and sons and daughters of celebrities. . . . A real diverse group," 
said Ralph Whitford, who taught for 30 years at the school. "But none of that 
made any difference, they were all beach kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Elementary School, or Newport Grammar School as it is known to 
old-timers, sits right on the beach. For decades, students have spent their 
recesses playing on the sand and watching the waves come in. From some of the 
classrooms, it is easy to gaze out the windows and see people using the 
boardwalk and boats sailing on the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 For its first 50 years, it served as the sole grammar school for youngsters in 
Newport Beach and much of the surrounding community. By 1933, the original 
school had been replaced by a brick structure and a bell tower, which later 
collapsed in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the school retains many of the qualities that recall a bygone era. Even 
though the school is named Newport Elementary School, the old name "Newport 
Grammar School" is still spelled out over the main entrance. The administration 
office has wood floors, there are interior hallways, and wall murals date back 
to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the birthday party, which is being planned by the parent-teacher 
association, will be used to refurbish the school.  
</P>
<P>
 Former students, parents, teachers or administrators who want to attend the 
"Day at the Sea" should call the school at (714) 760-3454.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; BRAILLE STUDENTS TO TAKE TOUR OF HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visually impaired adults throughout Orange County can get a tactile tour of 
the Dana Point Harbor during the sixth annual Touch for Sight starting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day event will take Braille students fishing in the deep sea, 
shopping in the Dana Harbor area and exploring the ocean in the Orange County 
Marine Institute's floating laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 People of all ages may participate, although most who have signed up are 
senior citizens, said a representative of the Braille Institute's Orange County 
center, which is co-sponsoring the event along with the Dana Point Harbor Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This encourages our students to do things they might not ordinarily think of 
doing," said Julie Juliusson, spokeswoman for the Braille Institute. "Often, 
our students think because they lost their sight, they've lost the ability to 
enjoy things like fishing. Our program gives people the self-confidence to do 
the things they used to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour will start at 10 a.m. at the Dana Wharf with a display of equipment 
to help the blind and partially sighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, the students will take a chartered fishing expedition from the 
wharf. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, local historian and author Doris Walker will lead the students 
on a walking tour of the harbor, followed by lunch at a seafood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The last day of the Touch for Sight tour will feature a voyage on the marine 
institute's new 70-foot vessel, the Sea Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will be part of the first public tour using the science vessel, 
which will be outfitted with a video hookup so passengers can observe the ocean 
floor and handle samples of sea life brought up by divers. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SPACE-SAVER SCHOOL PROPOSAL CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a letter sent to 4,000 Santa Ana residents, Councilwoman Lisa Mills called 
a controversial site for a space-saver school a waste of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that construction at the site would unnecessarily demolish 
businesses. Mills' mailing included a form letter residents could use to write 
a state senator and oppose use of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many other sites in Santa Ana that would cost less, have no 
negative impact on badly needed local shopping or businesses, and be more 
appropriately located for young teen-age students," said the letter, received 
by residents Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana was selected by the state to take part in the space-saver program, 
designed to build schools vertically rather than horizontally in overcrowded 
districts. The state first approved money for the plan in 1989, but no district 
has yet to come up with a workable plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At a contentious meeting in February, the Santa Ana Unified School District 
board approved a site at Bristol MarketPlace on Bristol and 17th streets for a 
two-story junior high school. However, the plan has been mired in controversy 
because of the property's $21-million price tag, to be paid by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said the $21-million cost is far too high and prompted the district to 
have three new property appraisals made at a cost of $25,000 each. They were 
due to be turned in to the State Allocation Board on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills' letters were on council stationery but she said she mailed them at her 
own expense. Included was a form letter to state Sen. Leroy Greene 
(D-Carmichael), who serves on the allocation board, urging that another site be 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have a philosophical disagreement with paying $21 million to buy the 
back of a parking lot. Most people I've talked to didn't want to see it," Mills 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji, who supports the project, said she 
was outraged by Mills' letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the consensus is she really overstepped her bounds on this issue," 
Yamagata-Noji said. "She has continued to utilize her role on the City Council 
to attack the school board and try to discredit us for this decision. I think 
that when somebody doesn't get their way, they can always fall back on saying, 
'Well they haven't studied all the issues. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata-Noji said two of the three appraisals were turned in to the state on 
time, but she did not know what they contained. The content of the appraisals 
has not been shared with board members out of concern that they would leak them 
to the public, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's a taxpayer concern, but it's kind of hard to address, because 
it's premature," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that the Montgomery Ward and HomeBase stores that would be 
demolished to build the school would then be rebuilt, adding to the cost of the 
deal.LEE ROMNEY

 The City Council will conduct a study session today to determine how to 
distribute more than $166,000 in federal community development block grants to 
charities, nonprofit groups and city programs.  
</P>
<P>
 The grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development are intended 
to fund public services for low-income families and senior citizens or to 
prevent slums and blighted neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 3 p.m. session, the council will consider requests from 22 local groups 
that have asked for a combined $287,000. Among the requests: the West Grove 
Pony Baseball League is asking for $2,000 and the Community Services and 
Recreation Department is seeking $50,000 for a gang prevention education 
program. The Boys and Girls Club of Westminster is requesting $40,000 and the 
Community Services Programs Inc. is seeking $35,000 for its programs for 
at-risk youths. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; POLICE SEEK MAN IN HOLDUPS AT TWO BARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are looking for a man they believe is responsible for the armed robbery 
of a bar and the attempted robbery of another over the weekend as the bars were 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:30 a.m. Saturday, the Classic Q Sports Bar, in the 4200 block of 
Martingale Way in Newport Beach, was robbed after the manager was tied up, 
according to Sgt. Andy Gonis.At 2:30 a.m. Sunday, a man hiding in a booth 
attempted to rob the Corona Cafe, in the 3200 block of East Coast Highway in 
Corona del Mar. The manager spotted the man, who was carrying a gun, and locked 
his office door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, a man about six feet tall wearing dark clothes and a ski mask 
brandished a gun and threatened employees while demanding money. Police believe 
the suspect patronizes the bars before the robberies.

 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District announced last week that Estancia 
High School Principal Frank Infusino has accepted an assistant superintendent 
job in Yermo. 
</P>
<P>
 Infusino will leave the district at the end of the school year for the 
2,800-student Silver Valley Unified School District, said Newport-Mesa Supt. 
Mac Bernd. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is really good," Bernd said. "I hate to lose him."

GM SUED BY IRVINE DRIVER INJURED IN ACCIDENT; TRIAL: THE MAN WAS PINNED AGAINST 
HIS NEIGHBOR'S CAR AFTER HIS PICKUP SLIPPED OUT OF GEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A civil trial began Monday in the case of an Irvine man who is suing General 
Motors over injuries he said he received when his GMC pickup truck slipped out 
of gear and pinned him against his neighbor's car in front of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth W. Wagner claims in his lawsuit that he was the victim of a defective 
automatic transmission that causes General Motors vehicles "to jump out of 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, 53, suffered a crushed hip and other severe injuries in the accident, 
he testified Monday. He is seeking unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for GM denied the allegations, telling an Orange County Superior Court 
jury that the company's transmissions are among "the safest on the road today." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our greatest sympathy goes out to Kenneth and (his wife) Sally Wagner for 
what happened," said Jack Trigg, a Denver lawyer representing the auto maker. 
"But it's unfair (for them) to blame GM for their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred on Dec. 17, 1988, as Wagner, a toolmaker, was getting 
ready to leave his house for work. Wagner said that when he started his GMC 
1988 Sierra pickup, which he had bought the previous year, he heard a loud 
noise coming from the rear of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the engine running, shifted the truck into park and got out to 
investigate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost instantly after closing the driver's door, the pickup lurched 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, who weighs about 170 pounds, said he attempted to stop the 2 1/2-ton 
vehicle from crashing into his neighbor's Mercedes-Benz, which was parked 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took off after it (and crouched down behind) like a football player to get 
everything into it," Wagner testified. "But it got me. . . . It pinned me, it 
crushed me. I didn't have time to escape." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner said he was freed only after his wife jumped into the truck and drove 
it a few feet forward. The couple still owns the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 During opening arguments, Wagner's lawyer, Tom Anderson of Indio, told the 
jury that it was not uncommon for GM vehicles to "jump out of park." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said GM officials have acknowledged in depositions that they knew as 
early as 1978 that some drivers do not shift completely into park and "with 
some disturbance" the shifting lever slips out of park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were injuries and deaths caused by this phenomena," Anderson told the 
jury, adding that GM issued warnings about the "faulty" transmissions in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy for GM to correct this "design defect," but the company has 
never done so, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also said his client realized that trying to stop the pickup from 
backing up "wasn't a smart thing to do, but he was trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Trigg, GM"s lawyer, said the accident was caused by Wagner's "driving errors." 
Wagner, he said, failed to set the parking brake, switch off the ignition, and 
failed to push the gear lever completely into park. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had done only one of those things, this accident would not have 
happened," Trigg said. "We're not asking for perfection, but we have the right 
to ask for one (safety measure)." 
</P>
<P>
 The errors were compounded when Wagner attempted to stop the 5,000-pound 
pickup, Trigg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which is expected to last six weeks, will be held in two phases 
before Judge Robert Gardner. In the first phase, the jury will be asked to 
determine if GM was liable for the accident. If GM is found liable, the jury 
would have to determine the amount of damage the Wagners suffered.

 The promoter of the city's fifth annual Mariachi Festival and Fair announced 
the event's cancellation Monday because of disturbances Sunday at L.A. Fiesta 
Broadway, the nation's largest Cinco de Mayo celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Festivals West said the festival, with events 
scheduled for Saturday through May 22, was canceled at the request of the 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the request of sponsors, (Festivals West) has to cancel the event," 
said the statement. The company said it "is sure there is not going to be a 
reschedule." Festivals West could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Santa Ana Library and St. Joseph Church, where some of the 
events were to take place, said they were surprised when Festivals West advised 
them of the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called (Festivals West) back and left them a message asking them if we 
could still hold the cultural events," said Margie Jean Owens, library services 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-day festival had been planned for May 22. The benefits would have gone 
to the Orange County branch of the Mariachi Heritage Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen people, including six police officers, were injured at the Los 
Angeles festival, which attracted more than 200,000 people. Ten arrests were 
made.

4-YEAR TERM GIVEN IN DEATH OF MAN, DAUGHTER IN DRUNK-DRIVING ACCIDENT 
</P>

 An Anaheim man who pleaded guilty to killing a Santa Ana father of six and his 
teen-age daughter in a drunk-driving accident on March 28 was sentenced Monday 
to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Luis Cardenas sentenced Candido Diaguerro Castrejon, 28, 
to state prison for the deaths of Jose Contreras Jr., 34, and Christine 
Contreras, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it wasn't enough because in that time he's going to do, he's not going 
to bring my family back," said Jose Contreras' wife, Antonia, who is raising 
their other five children, ages 2 to 17. "The other kids have nightmares and 
cry a lot, asking for their father and sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Castrejon pleaded guilty to seven felony and misdemeanor counts, including 
gross vehicular manslaughter, stemming from two accidents in the early morning 
hours of March 28, said Dan Skinner, the Contreras family's attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 The maximum sentence he faced was 13 years, but through a plea bargain he 
received a four-year jail term, Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Castrejon struck the Contrerases' car when he ran a red light 
at Katella and Magnolia avenues in Stanton just after midnight. He was fleeing 
a minor collision with a car just two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Contreras, a manager at a screw distribution company in Orange, died 
instantly.  
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, an eighth-grader at Spurgeon Junior High School who had hoped to 
become a model, died hours later at UCI Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 A niece of Jose Contreras also was in the car and suffered a broken arm.

2 HURT ON FAIR ROLLER COASTER SUE FOR $1 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two people injured in a roller coaster collision last summer at the Orange 
County Fair have filed a lawsuit seeking compensation for medical and other 
expenses and $1 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court on behalf of Christopher W. 
Pitts and Melinda S. Greenleaf, accuses B&B Amusements, owner and operator of 
the Cyclone roller coaster, and the Orange County Fair of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 As result of the July 12 collision, the two suffered permanent physical 
injuries, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were among eight people injured when a two-car train full of 
passengers crashed into an empty train, which in turn hit a train that was 
being loaded with passengers, officials said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Department of Industrial Relations report later concluded that a bell 
that normally rang to warn the brakeman of a train's approach was not 
functioning, but said the ultimate cause of the collision was operator error. 
</P>
<P>
 The parties involved in the suit could not be reached for comment Monday 
evening.

EX-POLICE OFFICER GETS PROBATION ON EXTORTION CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Santa Ana police officer convicted of extorting money from a liquor 
store owner was sentenced Monday in U.S. District Court to two years' 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sang H. Masog, 36, demanded $2,500 from a Santa Ana liquor store owner in 
July, 1992, to intercede on the merchant's behalf with the state Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control.The payoff was tape-recorded by an undercover 
officer from the Santa Ana Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Masog was being investigated by the FBI and the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles, which had received complaints that he was also extorting 
money from business owners in Los Angeles' Koreatown, Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark 
A. Byrne said. He declined to say whether a federal investigation had been 
launched as a result of the Koreatown allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Masog pleaded guilty last year to "extortion under color of official right," 
which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. 
In sentencing Masog to probation Monday, Judge Consuelo B. Marshall cited 
Masog's acceptance of responsibility and lack of a criminal record. Masog 
resigned from the Police Department in July, 1992.

ONE POWERFUL PROFIT IDEA; MANAGEMENT: ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER'S 
EARNINGS ARE SOARING AS EMPLOYEES STRIVE TO EARN BONUS CHECKS BY CUTTING 
OPERATING COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rachel Benavides, the travel coordinator at Power-One Inc., knew the power 
supply company's new bonus plan was catching on last year when salesmen started 
asking her to buy them super-discount airline tickets for business trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted the deals where you have to stay over on Saturday night," she 
recalls. "That's how you get the cheapest seats and hotel rooms." For the 
inconvenience, Power-One's sales people were cutting their department's costs 
and helped achieve one of the incentive program's main goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 200 employees at the firm's Camarillo headquarters plant now say 
they were inspired by the chance for extra money but were also spurred on by 
the goals themselves. The bonus program, introduced companywide in January, 
1993, set such goals as improving product quality, cutting costs and speeding 
up the introduction of new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on March 17 of this year, the plan's architect, Chief Executive Steve 
Goldman, announced the results. Power-One's initial incentive plan was a big 
success. Company sales rose 8% last year to $51 million, and more importantly, 
employees reduced costs so effectively that profits skyrocketed almost 50%, to 
$2 million. Goldman, 36, calculates that the incentive plan added $750,000 to 
Power-One's profits last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Goldman passed out checks totaling $342,000 to every employee at the 
Camarillo plant -- an average of $1,700 per person, although some employees 
received more than twice as much. That brought the cash rewards received this 
year by Power-One's 1,000 employees at various locations worldwide to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say money isn't a motivator, but it is," Goldman says. "We 
came up with a plan that had a specific formula. It showed exactly how much the 
bonus pool would be if certain goals were achieved. . . . People were 
fascinated with what achieving the goals meant to the company and their 
departments." 
</P>
<P>
 Reliability engineering supervisor Dirk Anderson, for instance, found himself 
and others in his department working until midnight as the first year's program 
came down to the wire. "The sooner we solved the problems, the sooner we got 
the units to the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and his engineers were trying to reduce the failure rate on the 
complicated devices that Power-One produces to convert AC, or 
alternating-current electricity, to DC, or direct current. By reducing the 
failure rate, the engineers reduced costs and got the products out on or ahead 
of schedule, another bonus plan goal. 
</P>
<P>
 So it went throughout the Camarillo plant. Maggie Nadjmi, in product 
marketing, found herself working extra-hard as a customer-service 
representative. Kevin Gero, a sales engineer who had worked for AT&T and Compaq 
Computer, was amazed to find himself and everybody else in his department 
thrashing out their own budget. That would be unheard of at his former 
employers, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Other companies, of course, have tried bonus plans. But when Goldman and his 
aides couldn't find another firm with a plan that was adaptable to relatively 
small, privately held Power-One, they ad-libbed one of their own. A key element 
was the promise that for every dollar saved, the company would contribute 15 
cents to the bonus pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Goldman has a plan for 1994 that ties virtually all company activities to 
the incentive program. "We've developed software that allows anybody in the 
Camarillo plant to push a few buttons on a computer and find out, day to day, 
how each department is doing in relation to its goals," he said. Goldman 
expects this new twist to boost enthusiasm over the bonus plan, so he's 
projecting a 50% annual growth rate in profits for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Camarillo, Power-One has plants in Mexico, Puerto Rico and the 
Dominican Republic. And while it's a small company, Power-One's average $1,700 
bonus to the workers at its Camarillo plant exceeded Ford Motor Co.'s average 
bonus this year of $1,350. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One, whose customers are mainly electronics, industrial and medical 
companies, might have gone on quietly earning a respectable profit and 
gradually carving itself a larger and larger slice of the nation's $6-billion 
power supply market. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, however, people are taking notice -- not only as a result of the 
bonus program, but also because a consortium headed by Power-One was recently 
one of the first groups chosen by the Clinton Administration to develop 
projects aimed at generating new jobs by converting defense know-how to 
commercial uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One and its consortium partners -- including Rockwell International, the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and GenCorp Inc. -- will seek new uses 
for the aerocapacitor, a high-density storage device that's something like a 
battery. The modest, $1.9-million federal grant project could help develop an 
economically feasible electric car. The assignment is especially appropriate 
for Power-One, which since it was founded in 1973, has refused all military 
work because of its notorious peaks and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wall Street has renewed efforts to woo the firm into going public or 
listening to takeover offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman joined Power-One in 1982, when he was 24. An engineering graduate of 
the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, he held engineering and 
research-and-development posts until he earned his master's degree in business 
in the late 1980s. After that, he was promoted to chief financial officer, and 
in 1990 he was named chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of Power-One's stock is held by its two founders, whom Goldman 
declined to identify. He said the two owners are seldom involved in operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers say Power-One is about the 10th largest producer of power 
supply equipment in the nation and the largest privately held company in the 
field. In almost anything that's powered by electricity -- from a vending 
machine to an automated industrial production line -- you will find a unit made 
by Power-One or one of its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One has about 500 power supply models in production, for such customers 
as AT&T, Bell Industries, Du Pont, GE Medical, Kodak and Texas Instruments. The 
company shies away from the costly practice of creating new products for 
individual customers -- but its engineers still design 50 new configurations a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 For some customers, however, Power-One gets involved in every stage of 
designing electrical equipment. Power-One is working with the ventilator 
division of Puritan Bennett Corp., based in Carlsbad, to develop a new 
life-support system for heart surgery patients. 
</P>
<P>
 At Power-One, no single customer currently accounts for more than 4% of 
revenues. Indeed, to avoid dependence on just one source, the absolute limit 
for a single customer is 10%.  
</P>
<P>
 For a conservative company, however, Power-One has become expansive in its 
outlook. Sales grew modestly from $45.9 million in 1991 to $51 million in 1993. 
But for the next three years, Goldman projects a jump in sales to $90 million 
or $100 million by 1996.

 A drug industry megamerger helped the stock market rally Monday despite a jump 
in interest rates -- the second consecutive session in which stocks have 
ignored the bond market's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the stumbling dollar continued to lose ground against the German 
mark, but stabilized against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials gained 19.33 points to 3,701.02, as 
health-care issues jumped following news that drug maker Syntex agreed to a 
$5.3 billion takeover by Roche Holdings Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow was lifted in part by drug giant Merck, which gained 1 1/2 to 31 1/8, 
and by Eastman Kodak, which soared 3 1/4 to 44 3/4 on rumors that it plans to 
sell all or parts of its Sterling drug unit. A Kodak announcement is due today. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts also noted that the stock market's rally Monday was broad in 
scope, and included industrial and technology issues that would benefit from a 
continuing healthy economy. Many of those stocks had been clipped in recent 
weeks as investors feared that higher interest rates would slow the economy 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a natural rebound . . . as people realize that the world is not 
ending," said Douglas Myers, trader at brokerage Interstate/Johnson Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, another surge in rates failed to rattle stocks on Monday, even as the 
yield on three-month Treasury bills topped 4% for the first time in more than 
two years. Long- term yields also rose, for a third consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates were pushed higher after the National Assn. of Purchasing 
Management said its April index of manufacturing activity rose to 57.7% from 
the previous month's 56.7%, a sign that the economy's expansion remains on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have continually demanded higher yields on long-term bonds over the 
past three months, fearing that the economy's strength will lead to rising 
inflation down the road. Also, the Federal Reserve Board's decision to begin 
boosting short-term interest rates in early February, as a way of moderating 
economic growth, has put added upward pressure on rates across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Treasury auctioned new three-month bills at an average yield of 
4.10%, up sharply from 3.94% last week and the highest since March 30, 1992. At 
the start of the year the T-bill yield was 3.06%. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-bill rate's jump Monday suggested that many investors are betting that 
the Fed will move soon to boost its benchmark short-term interest rate to 4%. 
The Fed has already raised that rate from 3% at year end to 3.75% currently. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer-term yields also rose Monday, but fell back from midday highs. The 
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds closed at 7.33%, up from 7.30% Friday but down 
from about 7.37% at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said bond investors were spooked by a segment of the purchasing 
managers' survey that showed nearly half the businesses reporting price 
increases on materials bought in April. As the T-bond's yield approached 7.40% 
on Monday, however, bond dealers said some traders bought bonds to close out 
"short" positions, which are trades in which borrowed bonds are sold in 
anticipation of falling prices.  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar halted its plunge against the Japanese yen, but it 
weakened again versus the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed had intervened in currency markets Friday to support the dollar, for 
the first time since last August. Many traders believe the Clinton 
Administration has decided it doesn't want the dollar to fall below 100 
Japanese yen, despite the weak dollar's use as a lever against Japan in trade 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders chose not to challenge the Fed on the yen Monday, and the dollar 
closed at 101.70 yen in New York, up from 101.55 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the buck continued to lose ground versus the mark, closing at 1.650 marks 
in New York, down from 1.654 on Friday. "There is a growing perception that 
Germany's recession has bottomed out and therefore there is more interest in 
holding marks," said one currency trader. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, investors seemed oblivious to the bond and dollar 
markets' fears. Rising stocks outnumbered losers by 12 to 9 on the New York 
Stock Exchange and smaller stocks outperformed blue chips. The Nasdaq composite 
index of mostly smaller issues jumped 6.84 points to 740.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said stock investors appeared to be focusing solely on prospects 
for higher corporate earnings as the economy grows. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug and other health-care issues posting big gains on news of the Syntex 
deal included Lilly, up 2 3/8 to 51 5/8; Schering-Plough, up 3 5/8 to 64; 
Amgen, up 1 1/4 to 41 3/4; PacifiCare A, up 3 1/2 to 54 1/4, and Ramsay HMO, up 
3 3/4 to 58 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues attracting buyers included Alcoa, up 3 to 70 1/2; DuPont, 
up 1 3/8 to 58 1/2; Cooper Tire, up 3/4 to 26 7/8; Emerson Electric, up 2 3/4 
to 61, and Ford, up 2 1/2 to 60 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech sector, computer networkers led a rally. Wellfleet 
Communications gained 3 3/4 to 77 5/8, Cabletron Systems rose 3 3/4 to 106 3/4 
and Newbridge Networks jumped 4 to 54 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, casino operator Caesars World tumbled 4 7/8 to 43 3/4 after 
projecting lower quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX index rose 22.67 points to 2,268.65, while Tokyo's 
Nikkei index slid 155.04 points to 19,570.21. The London market was closed for 
a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index fell 63.37 points to 2,230.73 as investors 
continued to sell on news of poor corporate earnings reports.

ROCHE WILL ACQUIRE SYNTEX FOR $5.3 BILLION; MERGERS: CALIFORNIA FIRM'S DEAL 
WITH THE SWISS PHARMACEUTICAL GIANT WILL CREATE THE WORLD'S FOURTH-LARGEST DRUG 
COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Syntex Corp., a pioneering Silicon Valley company that lately has fallen on 
hard times, has agreed to be acquired by Switzerland's Roche Holdings Ltd. in a 
$5.3-billion deal that would create the world's fourth-largest drug company. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger, one of the largest ever between drug makers, comes as the 
pharmaceutical industry attempts to cope with health reform and intense 
pressure from government, health maintenance organizations and hospital groups 
to cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal also offers the clearest evidence yet of the dilemma faced by Syntex 
and other big drug makers when once-lucrative patents on their products expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, Syntex lost U.S. patent protection on its flagship products -- 
the prescription painkillers Naprosyn and Anaprox. The Palo Alto firm was 
besieged by competing generic versions that were priced as much as 80% lower 
than the brand-name drugs. While the lower generic prices have been good news 
for consumers, Syntex's sales have been hammered. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the prospect of health reform and a rapid decline in painkiller 
sales forced Syntex to give up its independence and seek a bigger partner. 
Roche, a $9-billion-a-year company with headquarters in Basel, is more than 
four times Syntex's size. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't have survived in a very highly competitive health care market 
by themselves," said Arvind Desai, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Syntex Chairman Paul E. Freiman said the company sought a buyer after 
concluding that rapid changes in health care would favor two types of companies 
in the next decade: global giants with the financial resources to fund research 
on multiple drugs, and small biotechnology firms with a narrow research focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Syntex sees itself as a 'tweener' company," Freiman said in an interview. 
"The company was too small to be big and too big to be small. Strategically, 
that's not the place you want to be in this changing environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Max Gurtner, a Roche spokesman, said Roche was interested in Syntex for 
several reasons. Syntex has several "innovative" drugs under development and 
its products complement Roche's offerings. Moreover, by creating a larger 
company with a broader product line, Roche hopes to gain negotiating clout with 
the HMOs and hospital groups that are wielding growing influence on drug 
purchasing decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at such investments with a very long-term eye," Gurtner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Riccardo, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. in New York, said the 
merger also could produce "dramatic synergies" between the two firms. He says 
costs at Syntex could be cut sharply by reducing employment and other steps. A 
Roche spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of staff cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the Roche offer, Syntex shares rocketed $8.25 to $23.50 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. But the stock remains far below its peak of $54 in 
early 1992, at the zenith of the drug industry's popularity on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the deal is likely to fuel more consolidation in the 
$65-billion-a-year drug industry. The prices of such drug stocks as Eli Lilly & 
Co., Merck & Co. and Upjohn Co. also rose in heavy trading, as speculators 
tried to pick the next takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 Eran Broshy, a partner at Boston Consulting Group who heads its U.S. health 
care practice, expects more "horizontal" mergers among the roughly 60 
pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is facing a more difficult set of circumstances than they've 
ever had to deal with," Broshy said. "They're having to deal with managed-care 
companies and intermediaries like pharmacy benefit managers. . . . The result 
is a business that's becoming more of a commodity. Profits are down, prices are 
down and companies are laying off people." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, Syntex shareholders would receive $24 cash per share of common 
stock, a 57% premium over last Friday's closing price on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 While several analysts expressed surprise at Roche's hefty offer, analyst 
Desai noted that Syntex stock has traded as high as $21 during the past year. 
"It's a fair valuation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite continuing rumors that Syntex was seeking a merger partner, analysts 
had been knocking its shares recently. Hours before the Roche deal was 
announced Monday, analyst Neil Sweig of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. in New York 
issued a sell recommendation on Syntex stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would give Roche the sixth-largest share of drug sales in the United 
States. Because Roche does so much business overseas, it would rank fourth in 
worldwide sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Roche has a U.S. affiliate, Hoffman-La Roche, based in New Jersey, and owns 
roughly 63% of Genentech Inc., a South San Francisco biotechnology firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Syntex is a pioneering drug maker founded by scientists who invented the birth 
control pill in the 1950s. The company's fortunes rose quickly in the 
mid-1970s, when it unveiled its blockbuster drug naproxen, the generic name for 
the arthritis pain reliever that generated nearly $1 billion in annual sales -- 
or half the total annual sales for the firm -- a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. patents expired last year, Syntex came out with its own generic 
naproxen to protect its market share. But many other generic competitors have 
eaten away at the company's sales. Moreover, Syntex found itself with few new 
drugs nearing market approval to take up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Freiman, a 32-year veteran of Syntex, said he was personally torn between 
wanting to remain independent and doing what was best for the company and 
shareholders. "It's a bittersweet day for me," he said. He hopes to stay on 
after the merger, he said, but "there are no guarantees for anybody, the 
janitor or the CEO." 
</P>
<P>
 Roche's tender offer is subject to certain conditions, including acquisition 
of a majority of Syntex shares and government approval. Syntex Corp. At a

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: MORE ADVERTISERS ARE TAILORING TV SPOTS TO 
ETHNICITY OF VIEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Burger King TV spot features three African Americans who have their 
photos snapped in a photo booth at a carnival. Even the unseen narrator for the 
spot is an African American celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for this commercial on "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 While the NBC hit comedy ranks near the top with general viewers, it rates 
among the very least-watched of all shows by African Americans, says a new 
report by the New York advertising agency BBDO Worldwide. That's why Burger 
King has instead placed its ethnic TV spot on all of the top five most popular 
TV shows among black viewers: No. 1 -- "Living Single" (Fox), No. 2 -- "Martin" 
(Fox), No. 3 -- "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" (NBC), No. 4 -- "Blossom" (NBC) and 
No. 5 -- "Family Matters" (ABC). 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers from Burger King to Coca-Cola are paying closer attention to which 
shows African Americans watch. Black consumers -- who number nearly 30 million 
and account for more than 12% of the U.S. population -- represent America's 
largest ethnic segment. What's more, industry surveys have shown that they tend 
to be heavy viewers of prime-time network TV. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to reach the nation's estimated 10.2 million African American 
households, advertisers increasingly recognize that they must often steer a 
different course from the mainstream. For years, many advertisers figured that 
if they broadcast ads on the most popular television shows, they pretty much 
had their bases covered with all ethnic groups. But that is clearly no longer 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Every three months, Burger King asks its ethnic agency, Uniworld Group, to 
develop its own list of the most popular shows with blacks. Usually -- but not 
always -- these top shows feature African Americans in featured roles. During 
the 1993-94 television season, the four major networks scheduled 25 shows with 
blacks in key roles -- compared to 16 shows just two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure about 15% of our customers are black," said Michael Evans, a Burger 
King spokesman. "So about 15% of our media budget is aimed at blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 A new Coca-Cola spot, featuring a group of black women singing "Always Coke" 
in a cappella tones, has recently begun to air on a number of shows that the 
soft drink maker believes are popular with black viewers. Among them: "Living 
Single" and "Martin." 
</P>
<P>
 But Coke doesn't simply rely on viewership numbers to determine where to place 
its ads, said James Latimore, director of African American consumer marketing 
at Coca-Cola. "Keep in mind, these numbers are reported after the fact," he 
said. So beyond accessing the numbers, Coke asks its agency to screen all the 
upcoming shows and "help us make an educated guess" about which shows will be 
popular with which minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all advertisers say they are intent on knowing which shows blacks prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic shoe giant Nike, whose market is primarily 15- to 34-year-olds, says 
it is far more interested in targeting its customers by age. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not big advertisers on a race basis," said Scott Bedbury, advertising 
manager. "Besides, that's a very difficult thing to do on television." While 
Nike advertises on a number of Fox Television shows, it does so primarily to 
target teen viewers, Bedbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 But BBDO executives insist the results of its study -- based on Nielsen Media 
Research for the first half of the 1993-94 television season -- are crucial to 
many advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to give a black viewer the choice of watching 'Seinfeld' or 
'Martin,' I could almost assure you that 'Seinfeld' would lose out," said Doug 
Alligood, vice president of special markets at BBDO. "Advertisers have to 
realize that the general market is not the whole market." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, the study pointed out that black and non-black 
teen-agers do watch many of the same shows. In fact, 70% of the same TV 
programs appear on the top 20 lists of each group. "But as teens get older," 
Alligood predicted, "they'll unfortunately become more like their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 A separate study on Latino viewing habits completed last year by the ad agency 
revealed that Latinos also have very different viewing habits from the 
mainstream market. No such study has yet been done on Asian American viewing 
preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Television continues to cash in on advertisers interested in reaching 
ethnic and teen viewers. Fox had five shows that ranked among the top 10 most 
popular with African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox executives say they are very aware of the network's popularity among 
blacks. But they note that because non-blacks far outnumber African Americans 
in the United States, even the network's most popular shows with blacks are 
viewed by audiences that are primarily white. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not exclusively programming to any audience," said Dan McDermott, 
senior vice president of current programming at Fox. "We're trying to program 
to the broadest possible audience without excluding anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at CBS concede the network is not content with the fact that it had 
just a single show, "In the Heat of the Night," that ranked among the top 20 
viewed by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always working to find ways to increase our performance with this 
audience," said George Schweitzer, executive vice president of programming. He 
said the network has three black-targeted shows in development for next season, 
including two sitcoms and a drama. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Singapore Airlines has pulled all U.S. advertising because of publicity 
surrounding Michael Fay, the American teen-ager in Singapore sentenced to 
caning for vandalism. . . . The New York office of the Venice agency Chiat/Day 
has picked up the estimated $5-million ad account for Prince Sports Group,

KODAK MAY ANNOUNCE IT'S ABOUT TO SHED DRUG UNIT; RESTRUCTURING: IT WOULD BE THE 
FIRST MAJOR MOVE UNDER LEADERSHIP OF GEORGE FISHER. RUMOR BOOSTS STOCK $3.25. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. fueled speculation late Monday that it will sell all or 
parts of its Sterling Winthrop drug group by saying it would make a major 
announcement early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak gave no details and declined to elaborate beyond a two-sentence release 
alerting Wall Street to a "significant announcement" this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Sterling could be a candidate for sale, especially after a sharp 
rise in drug stocks propelled by news Monday that Roche Holding Ltd. bid $5.3 
billion for Syntex Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts stressed that they were merely speculating, and the announcement 
may be unrelated to Sterling, a maker of prescription and other drugs acquired 
by Kodak in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Kodak signaled a major corporate development in this fashion was 
when George Fisher was named chairman and chief executive in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about Sterling helped lift Kodak's shares $3.25 to close at $44.75 
in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading of 2.43 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug companies, faced with a toughening U.S. market and the likelihood of 
heavier cost controls coming from Washington, are looking for partners. And 
Kodak spun off its slow-growing chemicals business last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was scheduled to meet later today with Wall Street portfolio managers 
and journalists in New York, and May 11 he conducts his first Kodak annual 
meeting at the company's headquarters in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings with analysts and stockholders mark Fisher's first major 
appearances before shareholders since his appointment in October, when he quit 
as chairman of celebrated high-tech innovator Motorola Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to know, 'Where's the beef?' " said analyst Brenda Landry of Morgan 
Stanley. "He's got to tell us how he's going to hitch a ride on the electronic 
superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 The first outsider to head Kodak, Fisher has spent much of the last months 
studying the world's largest maker of photographic products and meeting its 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He has caused internal stirs by eating lunch in Kodak's cafeteria and pushing 
a shopping cart around a local Kmart store. 
</P>
<P>
 Since succeeding beleaguered Kay Whitmore in December, Fisher has hired a new 
chief financial officer, shuffled Kodak's electronic imaging businesses into 
one group and overseen a flat first-quarter earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodak, long used to getting premium prices for its black-and-yellow boxes of 
film, also announced under Fisher its first-ever discounted line of 
photographic film called Funtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect this to set off a price war," Prudential Securities analyst Alex 
Henderson said. "It's dangerous to compete for market share in a business with 
high gross margins." 
</P>
<P>
 Big shareholders -- the same ones who demanded Whitmore's ouster -- want the 
company to swallow the bitter pill and realize its decades of high growth are 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they want cost savings, job cuts and maximum profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to take out 20,000 to 30,000 jobs," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fisher has repeatedly said he sees some Kodak operations as growth 
businesses and that he may not need to cut all 10,000 jobs targeted in a 
restructuring launched by Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees opportunities for Kodak in emerging digital technologies and 
electronic information systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fisher's a growth guy. He's a builder, not an ice man," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be very surprised if he did anything big," said portfolio manager Ernest 
Widmann of Widmann, Siff & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Gary Schneider at Bear Stearns & Co. said he expects Fisher to take 
modest steps aimed at increasing Kodak's cash flow and cutting its debt, but he 
doubts the company will launch another restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he concentrates 100% on vision and not on micromanagement matters, then 
I'd be disappointed," Schneider said.

MARCH CONSTRUCTION SPENDING THAWS OUT; ECONOMY: MEANWHILE, A SURVEY OF 
PURCHASING MANAGERS SHOWS STRONGER GROWTH THAN ECONOMISTS HAD EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Spending on construction projects, held down the first two months of the year 
by unusually harsh winter weather, rebounded in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported Monday that construction spending rose 0.8% 
in March, with a jump in commercial work more than offsetting a drop in 
government construction. Spending on home building also rose, despite mortgage 
rates that have gone up since hitting a 25-year low last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Construction is going to do quite well. Banks have started to lend on 
commercial properties," said Michael Sumichrast, a Washington-based real estate 
economist. "Commercial building has been slow, but there is gradual 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said that while the March recovery was weaker than expected, a 
bigger gain is likely during the second quarter of the year. Many analysts had 
predicted a 2% rise in construction spending. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management, a trade group 
of buyers for the nation's factories, said American manufacturing strengthened 
in April for the eighth straight month. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely followed economic survey was stronger than expected and suggested 
the overall economy is becoming more robust. The purchasing managers' index 
rose to 57.7%, compared to 56.7% in March. A reading above 50% indicates an 
expanding manufacturing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and government 
construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $495.4 
billion in March, up from $491.7 billion in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending was down 1% in February and 2.3% in January after increasing for each 
of the previous eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, government spending declined 2.7%, to $126.9 billion, after slipping 
0.3% in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on home building rose 1.5% in March, to $234.4 billion, after 
increasing 0.3% in February and 0.4% in January. With revised figures for 
January -- which previously had shown the category unchanged -- residential 
construction has increased 11 straight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.32% last week, according to the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on apartment buildings was up 1.8% in March, the third straight 
increase. Multifamily construction generally has lagged in recent years because 
of vacancies in many areas of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-residential spending rebounded sharply in March, rising 3.8% to $92.7 
billion after a 5.1% drop in February. Leading the way was spending on 
commercial property, such as shopping centers, which rose 5.8%, and office 
buildings, which increased 9.1% after dropping 5.3% in February. Construction

IBM SHUFFLES MANAGEMENT IN AN EFFORT TO REVERSE SLIDE; CORPORATE: COMPUTER 
MAKER ANNOUNCES SENIOR EXECUTIVE FROM PRINTER UNIT WILL REPLACE OUTGOING PC 
DIVISION PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IBM's personal computer division, after losing much of its 1993 momentum 
during the first quarter, announced broad leadership and structural changes 
Monday, including the retirement of top executive Robert Corrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The division known as the IBM PC Co. is the world's largest maker of PCs and 
grew remarkably last year after reshaping itself in the summer of 1992. But 
high costs and some vexing product problems have recently hurt it. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will fill Corrigan's title as president of the IBM PC Co. His duties 
will be assumed by G. Richard Thoman, hired as IBM senior vice president five 
months ago to oversee the PC Co., the IBM printer unit and an emerging 
subsidiary that will make PCs based on a new computer chip IBM co-designed. 
</P>
<P>
 The PC Co. also changed the duties of top executives, realigning several 
operations and wiping away geographic divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our business, the key factors are quality and cost and speed," Thoman 
said. "What we're designing to do with this organization is maintain the 
quality lead we already have and enhance our cost and speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Corrigan, who will retire June 30, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrigan, 53, had earlier indicated to Thoman and IBM Chairman Louis V. 
Gerstner Jr. that he would probably leave this year. Some analysts said his 
decision to step down now is a sign the autonomy given the IBM PC Co. in 1992 
was evaporating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems they're going to be making more decisions at the headquarters 
instead of the unit," said Jeff Henning, analyst at BIS Strategic Decisions in 
Norwell, Mass. "I don't think that's in their best interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoman, however, said the changes had been planned with Corrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrigan leaves the company as it struggles with several products. He visited 
Japan last month to try to correct a well-publicized shortage in screens for 
ThinkPad laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 New models in IBM's core PS-2 desktop line for businesses have been postponed 
since winter because of a technical problem. An excess supply of ValuePoint 
models has forced price cuts to that line. 
</P>
<P>
 After sales grew nearly 40% in 1993, the PC Co.'s growth screeched to just 6% 
in the first quarter, according to a preliminary estimate by International Data 
Corp., a market researcher in Framingham, Mass. The industry grew an average 
11% in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more damaging to IBM's psyche is that its PC sales slipped behind Compaq 
Computer Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. during the quarter. Compaq sold 970,000 
PCs compared to Apple's 845,000 and IBM's 840,000, according to IDC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they've ever been third in any quarter," said IDC analyst 
Richard Zwetchkenbaum. "Compaq has become something they're fixating on and 
rightly so." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM does not report the profitability of its units. But analyst estimates of 
the PC Co.'s profit margin range from the single digits to around 18%. That's 
better than losing money but not enough to satisfy Wall Street.

 Arco To Finalize Cost-Cutting by Midyear: Atlantic Richfield Co. President 
Mike Bowlin made the announcement at the company's annual meeting."We know that 
further substantial changes are needed, including more cost cutting and perhaps 
some paring of our capital spending," said Bowlin, who takes over as chief 
executive from Lodwrick Cook on July 1. Los Angeles-based Arco undertook a 
major reorganization of its oil and gas producing operations in the 48 
contiguous states last year. Cook told the meeting that Arco will change the 
way it does business because of expectations that crude oil prices will remain 
low for some time. Bowlin said Arco is prepared to offer about 16% of its 
Vastar Resources Inc. subsidiary to the public.

 Neiman Marcus to Close Subsidiary Stores: The company said it will shut its 
39-store Pastille retail chain and close as many as 50 of its Contempo Casuals 
chain's 288 stores. The move will eliminate up to 1,000 of the 3,800 jobs in 
the two chains and result in a pretax charge of $48.4 million, or 74 cents a 
share after tax, in the third quarter ended April 30.Neiman Marcus' 65%-owner, 
Harcourt General Inc., said it too would take a $48.4-million pretax charge, 
equal to 35 cents a share after tax, in its fiscal third quarter ending July 
31. The cutbacks at Contempo will include the closing of its Hong Kong buying 
office and greater use of outside sources for merchandise buying. Pastille, 
with stores in 15 states, was a unit of Contempo and was seen as a national 
chain if it proved successful.

 Kmart to Sell Shares in Its Divisions: The retailer plans to sell shares 
representing 20% to 30% of each of its four specialty divisions by late fall, 
company executives said. But "we're not selling the companies," said George 
Mrkonic, executive vice president for specialty retailing at Troy, Mich.-based 
Kmart Corp. Rather, he said, Kmart is selling a "window of value" in the 
divisions. Kmart announced plans in February to sell shares of Borders-Walden, 
which operates Borders Books and Music stores and the Waldenbooks chain; 
Builders Square, a home-improvement products chain; OfficeMax, a chain of 
office products stores, and the Sports Authority sporting goods chain. Kmart 
common stock would be redesignated as Kmart Group common stock. Shareholders 
will vote on the plan at the June 3 annual meeting.

 AT&T, Novell Link To Offer Network Service: The venture will turn the 
telephone company into a giant computer network. The product, called AT&T 
NetWare Connect Services, will let users sign onto the network using Novell's 
software and communicate across the phone lines.Computer users could send and 
receive data, faxes, electronic commerce and messages, and link their networks 
of computers to one another. In seeking the alliance with Novell, AT&T realized 
it sits with a resource that's absolutely key to the networks that are popping 
up across industry, analysts said. The network was attractive because it could 
link so many businesses together, analysts also said, easing the electronic 
traffic that sometimes clogs fax machines or makes it difficult to send and 
receive data. Novell stock closed up 62.5 cents at $19 on the Nasdaq, while 
AT&T ended up $1.375 at $52.625.

 Savings Bond Rate Rises: The interest rate on U.S. savings bonds for the next 
six months will be 4.7%, up from 4.25%, the Treasury Department said.The rate, 
adjusted twice yearly for market conditions, took effect Sunday and will 
continue through Oct. 31 for Series EE bonds. When held for five years, the 
yield at redemption is the average of semiannual interest rates during the 
period or the guaranteed minimum rate, whichever is higher. Series EE bonds 
issued since March 1, 1993, pay a minimum 4% when redeemed within five years.

BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOBILES; MAZDA, MITSUBISHI MODELS WIN COVETED APPROVAL

<P>
 Two of Orange County's foreign-based auto companies won coveted Consumer 
Reports recommendations for nine of their models in the magazine's annual April 
auto issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies are Mazda, whose Mazda Motor of America Inc. unit is 
headquartered in Irvine, and Mitsubishi, whose Mitsubishi Motor Sales of 
America import and distribution arm is located in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars, by size and price range, are: 
</P>
<P>
 Compacts under $20,000: Mazda 626 and Mitsubishi Galant. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-sized over $25,000: Mitsubishi Diamante and Mazda 929. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagons, all sizes: Mitsubishi Expo LRV (also sold as the Eagle Summit) and 
Mitsubishi Diamante. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporty cars under $25,000: Mazda Miata and Mazda MX-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporty cars over $25,000: Mazda RX-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Mazda-badged vehicle, the Navajo, received a Consumer Reports 
recommendation in the sports utility class, but it isn't made by Mazda -- it's 
a two-door Ford Explorer with Mazda trim. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the magazine reviewed 194 cars, wagons, minivans and sports utility 
vehicles from 32 manufacturers in its April issue, and 44 of them won 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Suzuki, whose American Suzuki Motors Corp. is located in Brea, nor 
Hyundai, with U.S. headquarters in Fountain Valley, placed any of their cars on 
the Consumer Reports recommended list for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia Motors Corp. the newest foreign car maker to launch sales under its own 
name in the United States, has set up national headquarters in Irvine, but the 
Kia Sephia sedan was introduced too late to be included in the Consumer Reports 
review.

VISION COMMUNICATIONS TO ANSWER FRAUD CHARGES; SECURITIES: SEC ALLEGES NEWPORT 
BEACH COMPANY COLLECTED NEARLY $4.5 MILLION FROM TELEPHONE SALES. FIRM SAYS 
INVESTORS KNEW RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Vision Communications Inc. in Newport Beach is scheduled to appear in federal 
court today in Washington to answer charges of fraud brought by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation collected nearly $4.5 million through so-called "boiler room" 
telephone sales offices in Costa Mesa, La Jolla and Plano, Tex., said SEC 
officials. Vision Communications promised 300% returns in three years on a 
wireless television cable system in the twin cities of Wilkes-Barre and 
Scranton, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC charged Vision Communications with selling unregistered securities, 
operating a boiler room and overstating the rewards of the investment while 
understating the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a kernel of something there, but with the money they were pulling 
out of the operation, they could not capitalize a wireless system," said Judith 
Starr, assistant chief litigation counsel for the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Schiffman, a lawyer representing Vision Communications, said on Monday 
that he is working to resolve the dispute with the SEC. He said all of the 300 
investors supplied to the company tape-recorded assertions that they knew the 
risks of the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors, who spent an average of $10,000 to $15,000 each on Vision 
Communications' securities, were located when they responded to a television 
infomercial, the SEC said. Respondents' names were sold to Vision 
Communications for as much as $12 each, the SEC said, and many were elderly and 
invested their retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Vision Communications principals William L. Clemens Jr. and Michael Imbesi 
have been ordered by two states to cease selling securities without registering 
as brokers or dealers, according to court documents supplied by the SEC. 
Clemens was ordered to cease business in Kansas, and Imbesi in Kansas and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the state Department of Corporations raided and shut down several 
similar wireless sales operations in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties. The operations were selling allegedly illegal investments in wireless 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 citizens have called the Department of Corporations since the raid, 
said spokeswoman Lindsey Kozberg, and the calls have resulted in 20 more sales 
entities that the department may investigate. She said they are offering 
high-tech, mostly wireless cable, investments.

 Rockwell International Corp. said Monday that it will sell its automotive 
plastics business to a subsidiary of competitor Cambridge Industries Inc. for 
an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell agreed to sell three automotive plastics manufacturing plants to 
Plastics Acquisition Corp., a unit of Cambridge Industries, an automotive 
plastics firm in Dearborn, Mich.The deal is subject to regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell will shed about 1,722 employees who will go to work for Cambridge. Of 
those, 1,150 now work at a plant in Centralia, Ill., 367 in Lenoir, N.C. and 
185 in Newton, N.C. About 20 sales and engineering employees working at 
Rockwell's Automotive headquarters in Troy, Mich., would also work for 
Cambridge. After the sale, Rockwell would have 73,300 employees, including 
6,700 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Aseritis, an analyst for investment bank First Boston Corp. in New York, 
said he estimated the division will sell for between $200 million and $250 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Rockwell's point of view, (with $11 billion in sales), it doesn't appear 
to have a big impact on their earnings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don H. Davis Jr., Rockwell's chief operating officer, said the deal is in 
accord with Rockwell's strategy of emphasizing its manufacture of automotive 
components and electronics parts, which the company can put together and sell 
as complete component systems, such as car seats, sunroofs or door latches. 
</P>
<P>
 The automotive plastics unit made parts such as the hood for the Dodge Viper.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who declined to comment on Aseritis' estimates, said the division was 
profitable with annual sales of about $200 million.

FIDELITY PRESSES BID TO ACQUIRE US FACILITIES; MERGER: IRVINE FIRM SAYS IT WILL 
BEGIN SEEKING VOTES FROM COSTA MESA INSURER'S SHAREHOLDERS TO PUT UP COMPANY 
FOR SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fidelity National Financial Inc., which set the stage last week for a hostile 
takeover attempt of US Facilities Corp., made it official Monday by saying that 
it will begin seeking votes today from the Costa Mesa insurer's shareholders 
for approval to put the company up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title insurer, said that directors of US 
Facilities were simply using a "stall tactic" by deciding Friday to delay 
negotiations and to set up other procedures to consider the $79-million merger 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 William P. Foley II, Fidelity's chairman, said Monday that he asked his 
counterpart, US Facilities Chairman George Kadonada, in a brief telephone 
conversation Sunday to delay the May 25 annual meeting of US Facilities for a 
month to give directors of both companies time to negotiate and to show that 
Kadonada's firm was proceeding in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still want this to be friendly, though it appears we're being very 
aggressive," Foley said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities, a medical business, property and casualty insurer, refused to 
delay the scheduled meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the company said US Facilities would have no comment beyond 
stating the results of its Friday board meeting. After a daylong meeting 
Friday, directors decided to delay any decision until an unspecified mid-May 
meeting, appoint a committee of three non-management directors to review the 
acquisition proposal and hire an investment banking firm to give it advice. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded letter last Tuesday to Kadonada, Foley sought a friendly 
takeover that would make US Facilities a wholly owned subsidiary with all of 
its management intact. But the letter also said that deadline pressures 
required Fidelity to seek proxies -- rights to vote shares from US Facilities 
stockholders -- to get the issues addressed at the annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that Foley 
first sought a "strategic alliance" with Kadonada late last year and that 
Kadonada agreed to consider it and to respond. But he never responded, the 
document stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Fidelity's $15-a-share proposal has been withdrawn, but Foley 
said his company would offer the same "very lucrative amount" to shareholders. 
The amount is 67% above US Facilities' $9-a-share stock price on March 20, the 
day before Fidelity started buying shares aggressively and pushing up the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity also said Monday that it has increased its stake in US Facilities 
from 8.2% to 9.25% by buying 60,000 more shares last Thursday and Friday at 
$13.88 to $14 a share. Foley said Fidelity bought more on Monday and would buy 
enough to give it just under 10%, a level that would require additional filing 
requirements with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of US Facilities stock closed Monday at $13.50 a share, down 25 
cents a share from Friday's close on the Nasdaq market system. Fidelity's stock 
closed at $17.25 a share, down 37.5 cents a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, Fidelity will seek proxies to put two unaffiliated directors 
on US Facilities' board and to pass a shareholder resolution putting the 
company up for sale and approving measures for independent reviews of bids. 
Last week, Fidelity sought only one board seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley acknowledged that US Facilities could block his company from presenting 
its proposals at the May 25 meeting. Fidelity, therefore, is seeking proxies 
representing at least half the shares outstanding so that if it is blocked, it 
can refuse to attend the meeting and create a lack of a quorum, causing the 
meeting to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity wants to acquire US Facilities to help it smooth out earnings and 
avoid the cyclical nature of the title industry where fluctuating interest 
rates can greatly raise or lower profits. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities reported net income of $6.8 million last year on revenue of $112 
million. Fidelity posted $36.3 million in earnings on $575.4 million revenue 
last year.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: BIG O TIRES TO MODIFY PROXY STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major shareholder in Big O Tires Inc. said Monday that the tire products 
retailer has agreed to demands that it modify a soon-to-be released proxy 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The shareholder, Kenneth Pavia, is general partner in Balboa Investment Group 
LP of Newport Beach, a limited partnership that controls 9.6% of the company's 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Big O Tires of Englewood, Colo., agreed to his demands that it not 
count abstentions and broker non-votes when shareholders vote on whether to 
hire an investment banker who would explore ways to enhance shareholder value, 
including sale of the company.  
</P>
<P>
 "We think there are people out there willing to pay more than the present 
market price for Big O," Pavia said. "We're aware of some people who are 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
 The result of the proxy vote will be announced June 8 at the company's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Big O Tires owns or operates 354 stores nationwide, about 15 of them in Orange 
County. It has 34 stores in Canada.

SEC LOOKING INTO DERIVATIVES TRADING; REGULATION: THE AGENCY WANTS TO KNOW IF 
COMPANIES REPORTING LOSSES ADEQUATELY WARNED SHAREHOLDERS OF THE RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT D. FROMSON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining public reports of 
companies announcing losses on derivatives trading to see if shareholders were 
adequately warned of the risks, according to government sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies being scrutinized include Procter & Gamble Co., which lost $157 
million in derivatives trading this year, the largest such loss ever reported 
by a U.S. industrial company. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC is concerned that P&G and other companies may not have adequately 
disclosed to shareholders the magnitude of their derivatives activities and the 
risks associated with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial derivatives are instruments so named because their value is 
"derived" from underlying securities such as stocks and bonds or from 
underlying indexes such as interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies often use them to hedge business risks such as interest rate or 
foreign exchange rate movements. 
</P>
<P>
 But several prominent companies have lost money on positions that in 
retrospect appear to have been speculations rather than hedges. 
</P>
<P>
 After the SEC completes its review it will likely either stiffen reporting 
standards or step up enforcement of existing rules, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure violations can lead to fines and consent orders in which a company 
agrees to improve its reporting. A spokeswoman for P&G declined to comment on 
any SEC review. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC action underscores the woeful state of public disclosure of derivative 
positions by major U.S. companies, according to industry analysts. Although 
they have been improved, accounting and reporting standards still are too low 
to capture the evident risks associated with derivatives, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies burned by derivatives this year include Gibson Greetings Inc., 
Dell Computer Corp., Mead Corp., Marion Merrell Dow Inc. and Eaton Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The $10-trillion market in derivatives has grown up largely beyond the purview 
of regulators. But as more companies use derivatives, regulators are concerned 
that companies are not keeping their shareholders well informed. 
</P>
<P>
 A company that trades publicly is required to tell shareholders about events 
"material" to its earnings and financial strength. 
</P>
<P>
 But such information is routinely relegated to obscure footnotes in annual and 
quarterly reports to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if shareholders take the time to go to the footnotes, they learn little, 
according to Joe Kolman, editor of Derivatives Strategy & Tactics, an industry 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple truth is that efforts to improve disclosure so people can actually 
understand what is going on have failed," Kolman said.

 Admar Group Inc.: The managed-health-care-services company of Santa Ana posted 
a profit of $403,700, or 5 cents a share, for its fiscal year ended Jan. 
31.That figure contrasts with a net loss of $731,200, or 9 cents a share, for 
the prior year. Revenue rose 39%, from $12.7 million to $17.6 million. The 
revenue increase resulted from client increases and the acquisition of four 
businesses. For the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of $117,300, or 
1 cent a share, contrasted with a profit of $38,800, or less than 1 cent a 
share, for the year-earlier period. Revenue was flat at $4.1 million.

 Two New Entries: Mitsubishi, which just brought out a redesigned and revved-up 
Eclipse sports coupe, unveils the 3000 GT Spyder this fall. The car is a 
convertible version of Mitsubishi's 3000 GT sports car.But it's not just any 
old convertible. Not a shred of canvas anywhere. Instead, harking back to the 
1950s, when Ford tried the same thing with a full-size passenger coupe -- the 
Mitsubishi features an automatic retractable hardtop that stores in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia, whose products are new to the United States, brings its four-door 
Sportage to the country in December. A few of the sports utility vehicles can 
already be spotted in the environs of Kia's corporate offices in the Irvine 
Spectrum. Executives like to drive them to lunch and to business appointments 
to gauge the reactions the curvy vehicles get from passersby. A two-door 
version is due next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyundai, which has redesigned the Sonata and recently introduced it as a 1995 
model, replaces the Excel later this year with a whole new compact -- the 1995 
Accent. It will be curvier, bigger and more powerful than its predecessor, 
company officials say.

 Operating Costs: The cost of owning and operating a car doesn't stop with the 
monthly payment -- or even the price of maintenance and weekly fill-ups at the 
gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Automobile Assn. of America, in conjunction with Runzheimer International, 
a travel and transportation consulting company, says that insurance, 
registration, licenses, taxes, finance charges and depreciation can add from 
$11 to nearly $14 per day to the cost of owning a car in this country.Add to 
that average operational costs of 7.7-cents to 10.3 cents per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAA report uses three 1994 models, a 4-cylinder Ford Escort LX, a 
6-cylinder Ford Taurus and a V-8 Chevrolet Caprice, to arrive at its cost 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the Escort just 10,000 miles a year costs $3,982 -- or 39.8 cents per 
mile. The Taurus at 10,000 miles a year costs $4,665 (46.6 cents a mile) and 
the big Chevrolet comes in at $5,844 (58.4 cents a mile) for 10,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving more costs less: at 15,000 miles a year the annual cost of the Escort 
drops more than a nickel a mile to 34.5 cents; the Taurus is down almost seven 
cents to 39.8 cents a mile, and the Caprice plummets 11 cents a mile to 44 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Club report, unfortunately, doesn't factor in the Orange County 
driver's added cost of idling in freeway traffic jams for about half the time 
the engine is running.

WHEN GOING TO THE MALL IS AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE; EDUCATION: STUDENTS LEARN 
BUSINESS PRACTICES AT THE NATION'S LARGEST ENCLOSED SHOPPING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Hiram Bonet ducks out of class at noon and heads for the Mall of America, 
he's not skipping school to shop or ride the roller coaster at the seven-acre 
amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 His trip is legit. The 17-year-old is learning business skills from the 
experts -- those who run the nation's largest enclosed shopping mall and 
entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonet, a junior at Bloomington's Kennedy High School, is one of 15 students 
enrolled in a course in "Entrepreneurship and Business" at the mall's new 
learning center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pursuing career interests and getting a flavor of what it's like," 
said Jerry Cromer-Poire, a social studies teacher from St. Paul Central High 
School who teaches the pilot course. "We're not involved in flipping 
hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend mornings in regular classes at their home schools, then go to 
the mall for classes and internships with businesses Monday through Thursday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cromer-Poire's students, internships can be as varied as the 400-plus 
businesses in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 A student interested in sports medicine works at a sports equipment store. One 
considering a career in jewelry making is interning in a jewelry store. Others 
help manage restaurants, sell clothes and recycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The center opened in January and plans by next fall to offer several courses 
to about 100 students from five districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each class will have a real-world partner. The pilot class is being offered 
with the mall's developers and its operations staff. 
</P>
<P>
 An "Environmental Issues" class will get help from Browning-Ferris Industries, 
which collects and recycles the mall's trash. "Arts in the Marketplace" will 
work with the Camp Snoopy amusement park in the middle of the mall, which 
offers plays and musical performances along with its rides. 
</P>
<P>
 The amusement park is operated by Knott's Berry Farm of Buena Park under a 
licensing arrangement. It was the first theme-park venture by Knott's outside 
California. Knott's Berry Farm is a Southern California institution, hosting up 
to 4 million guests a year in its theme park and thousands more in its 
restaurant complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of taking business classes at the mall isn't much different from 
taking other specialized classes at vocational-technical schools or zoology 
classes at the zoo, Cromer-Poire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to go in at management level," he said. "The idea of 
making decisions, of getting involved in change is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 That has captured the imagination of Bonet, who is interning with the 
operations people who run the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted a broad-based view of what it takes to run the Mall of 
America," said Bonet, who plans to major in business in college. After that, he 
says, he may go into business law. "What areas of business I wasn't sure. 
That's why I took this class." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonet has worked with the mall's tourism department, selling the mall to 
potential visitors; the sponsorship department, persuading businesses to 
sponsor events in return for advertising; public relations and events planning 
and sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he sees the stamp of business everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go into Camp Snoopy," he said, "I notice the 'Hormel' Cookout, the 
'Ford' Playhouse. The hot-air balloons say 'Pepsi.' It's in your face. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're learning because you want to learn, not because someone's trying to 
force it. In a regular classroom, you focus so much on the work that you forget 
to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "This class will look wonderful on a college application." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses using student interns also are pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gotreau, manager of a Tony Roma's restaurant, is training a student in 
restaurant operations and wants her to see all sides of the business -- 
including busing dishes, hostessing and working in the kitchen. 
</P>

 "If they're going to come work in these businesses, they can't get just a 
one-sided slant," he said. "She has a keen interest in what's going on. I wish

 Marcy Richeson, manager of the Gap Kids store, is teaching an intern the 
tricks of the children's clothing business.

 "She's learning about the product, how to sell the product. She's aware of the

She's learning what we're all about."

 "I've never lost anybody yet," he said. "The attendance rate is wonderful. The 
kids are all motivated. They all try hard. I see kids talking more concretely 
about college plans."

 Bonet said his parents were skeptical at first when he told them he wanted to 
attend a class at the mall, "until I brought home the books. They found out it 
was a legitimate class and not just a way to waste time."

1 DEAD, 6 HURT IN COLLISION

 An Arleta woman was killed and six people were injured -- including three 
children -- Monday when her car crossed the dividing line of Lassen Street and 
slammed head-on into another car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dead at the scene was Josephine Collins, 36, who was the only person in her 
green Chevy Nova, according to Officer Frank Zdroy of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Collins had been driving erratically as she 
traveled westbound on Lassen, Zdroy said. She crossed into eastbound traffic at 
about 3 p.m., he said, and crashed head-on into a white Mazda driven by a 
34-year-old Northridge woman who had just picked up her two children at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge woman, whose identity was not released by the police Monday 
night, was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where she was listed in 
critical condition with undisclosed injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 8-year-old son was taken to Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. Police 
would not say how extensive his injuries were. 
</P>
<P>
 His 9-year-old sister was treated for bruises and released from the Northridge 
hospital. With her left knee wrapped in bandages, the girl was in the 
Northridge hospital waiting room with her father and other family members as 
her mother underwent emergency surgery Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were about five blocks from home," said a relative, who asked not to be 
named, at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the second car was the woman's 27-year-old sister-in-law from Granada 
Hills and her 5-year-old son. She was listed in stable condition at the 
Northridge hospital, and the boy was taken to Children's Hospital, where his 
condition was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 A third car slammed into the Mazda. The driver of that car was treated and 
released at Granada Hills Community Hospital.

DISSECTION OF APARTMENTS FOR EVIDENCE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The whine of chain saws in the early-morning fog Monday marked the start of 
the autopsy of Northridge Meadows, where 16 tenants died in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, sections of the roof had been cut away to reveal the insides of the 
building, and a half-dozen lawyers were arguing their cases at a sidewalk news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Former tenants, many from pancaked first-floor units, came to retrieve their 
belongings and were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the place where his mother died -- the exposed mattress, the broken 
walls, the painted letters DB, for dead body -- Bill Runnings felt sick to his 
stomach. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 So began the dismantling of Northridge Meadows, the scene of the largest 
concentration of earthquake fatalities and Exhibit A in seven wrongful death 
and personal injury lawsuits. It could become one of the largest and most 
studied pieces of evidence in Southern California, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want some answer to why this thing happened so we can move on," said 
Runnings, a 28-year-old roofer from Phoenix. He said he was supposed to visit 
his mother, Karol Runnings, the night she was killed in a quake so powerful it 
drove her bed through the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take months, even years, of testing and study before the experts can 
deliver those answers. Even then, a jury probably will have to decide the 
central issue: whether the collapse of Northridge Meadows was caused by a 
6.8-magnitude earthquake, the quality of the construction or some combination 
of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Runnings said, respect has drawn him to his mother's shattered 
apartment, where the bed juts out, exposed to the elements. The family 
photographs are in a box in the closet, still underneath somewhere, out of 
reach. But his lawyer, Jeffrey Behar, was there to assure that when the time 
comes, Runnings and his sister, Julie Tindall, 29, will be able to get inside 
Apartment 108. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four months after the quake, Tindall said, "it bothers us to know her 
stuff is everywhere and possibly the rats and maggots are getting to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other former residents were told they must hire attorneys to get inside this 
week, while the experts gather evidence. Later, tenants who hire salvage crews 
can clear out apartments before the city puts the wrecker's ball to Northridge 
Meadows, probably about May 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers, other experts and lawyers -- about 20 in all, according to one 
estimate -- flocked to 9565 Reseda Blvd. for the court-ordered controlled 
demolition. The 164-unit building will be taken apart, piece by piece at times, 
so experts representing all sides can test and study it to determine whether 
construction defects caused or contributed to the fatal collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be looking at the building's connections and supports, as well as 
shear walls and other seismic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers started at the top, cutting away several sections of the roof. 
At that pace, it will take at least a week before the critical evidence in the 
40 flattened first-floor apartments is uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Joel Castro, who represents relatives of two women who died, told 
reporters that his engineers had found evidence of another structural defect: 
The third-floor shear walls were not fastened to the roof. Castro maintains 
that the fasteners, which distribute seismic forces that play on the walls, 
were required by building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen Tharpe, attorney for owner Shasikant Jogani, said there was no 
evidence that the latest alleged defect had caused or contributed to the 
collapse. "After all, the roof didn't collapse," Tharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro earlier had alleged other defects: That support pipes in the parking 
structures were too thin, that weaker nails were found where stronger nails 
were specified in the building plans, joist hangers were smaller than those 
specified, and floors were supported inadequately with diagonal strips of wood 
rather than plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Tharpe was encouraged by his own experts' "find": a long board with 
nails jutting out of it. But to Tharpe, it was evidence that the vertical 
forces of the quake had picked the building up and placed it down eight feet to 
the north. The nails, he pointed out, were straight, indicating powerful 
vertical forces were at play, rather than solely lateral forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro also alleged for the first time that Northridge Meadows was not built 
to code. As an example, he contended that the tuck-in parking slots were 35 
feet deep -- 10 feet deeper than the 1970 building codes allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tharpe and attorneys for builder Brian Heller disputed that contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Mower, the lawyer for Heller, maintained that the complex was built to 
code. Tharpe said Jogani believed Northridge Meadows was built to code when he 
bought it from Heller in 1981, about 10 years after it was built. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tharpe said, California law holds Jogani, and other landlords, liable 
for damages when people are killed or injured in their buildings. The legal 
principle is known as "strict liability" and California is one of just a 
handful of states to follow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Jogani has filed a countersuit against Heller's construction 
company, which in turn is likely to sue its subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Jogani was listed as one of Los Angeles' largest residential 
landlords, with holdings worth $385 million. He held liability insurance on 
Northridge Meadows, but no quake insurance. He claims that the earthquake and 
the recession have claimed all his equity. A Shifting Footprint 
</P>
<P>
 A plot plan called a "footprint" will aid in the documentation of structural 
defect evidence being gathered this week in the controlled demolition of he 
Northridge Meadows Apartments. The buildings shifted in several directions 
during the Northridge earthquake-as much as eight feet in some places-according 
to the plan drawn from aerial photographs taken before and after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The footprints were drawn up by attorneys representing the building owner. A 
floor-by-floor dismantling of the building is being documented by attorneys, 
engineers, city building and safety personnel survivors and relatives of 
deceased tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are examining structural elements to determine how the buildings were 
constructed and how the structures performed during the quake. Elements 
analyzed this week will include: Roof and wall diaphragms: Assess the flat 
plywood pieces that form the roof, walls and flooring between floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shear walls: Determine whether those on the collapsed first floor were where 
they shouldhave been and enough nails and the correct materials were used. 
Hold-downs: Analyze the metal bolts or screws that hold vertical pieces of wood 
to foundation. Source: The law firm of Tharpe & HowellDEMOLITION

VOTERS GO TO POLLS TO REPLACE PAT NOLAN; POLITICS: SPECIAL ELECTION IS FIRST IN 
A SERIES TO DETERMINE SUCCESSOR FOR 43RD DISTRICT ASSEMBLY SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican voters from Glendale, Burbank, Los Feliz and Silver Lake will try 
to identify an heir to former state Assemblyman Pat Nolan in a special election 
today while local Democrats groom a champion they hope will wrest Nolan's old 
district away from the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 The special election, featuring four Republican candidates, two Democratic 
candidates and a Libertarian -- was triggered by Nolan's forced resignation 
last February after pleading guilty to one count of political racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 If any candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, he or she will serve the last 
seven months of Nolan's term, which expires Dec. 5. But such an outcome is seen 
as unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this many candidates chasing the job, it's going to be very difficult to 
win outright," said Sheila McNichols, campaign manager for one of the two 
top-ranked GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring the unexpected, the top vote-getter from each party will square off on 
June 28 in a special election runoff for the 43rd Assembly District. The winner 
will serve as Assembly member until December. 
</P>
<P>
 But the election derby for the 43rd District doesn't end there. Still up for 
grabs will be the new two-year Assembly term that begins Dec. 5. Regular 
elections to fill that seat will be held June 7 (the primary) and Nov. 8 (the 
general). 
</P>
<P>
 All seven candidates in today's election will also be running in the June 7 
primary. In addition, two more Republicans and one more Democrat will be in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale-Burbank area has been a GOP bastion for decades, but there are 
signs of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan's guilty plea and resignation left Republicans in disarray and has 
threatened to produce a bloody and protracted GOP succession battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nolan collapse also followed implementation of a reapportionment plan that 
eroded GOP strength by adding Silver Lake and Los Feliz to the 43rd District. 
Before the remapping, the district was 47% Republican, 42% Democrat; now, it's 
44% Democratic and 42% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, red flags went up in GOP quarters when Bill Clinton, Dianne Feinstein 
and Barbara Boxer carried the district, albeit by narrow margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Democratic strategists are hoping to turn the tables again with former 
Assistant U. S. Atty. Adam Schiff, who left his job in December to begin 
campaigning. Schiff, 33, is facing only minor opposition for the job of 
Democratic standard-bearer in the 43rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff's campaign consultant is veteran Parke Skelton, who insists that the 
43rd District is no longer like Orange County and can be won by a moderate 
Democrat like Schiff, who has tough-on-crime credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the two top GOP candidates in today's election, Glendale Municipal 
Judge James Rogan and Julia Wu, an elected member of the Los Angeles Community 
College Board of Trustees, have engaged in mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, 36, a Glendale resident, emphasized his Horatio Alger past as he vied 
for the support of Nolan partisans and received sizable financial help from the 
Allied Business PAC, a Christian conservative group composed of four wealthy 
businessmen, investors and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Rogan mailer says the candidate grew up in a broken family and never 
completed high school but, nevertheless, went on to be recognized as one of the 
state's top prosecutors. He was appointed by to the bench by then-Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu, who emigrated to the United States from Taiwan as a young woman, has been 
pitching herself as a longtime Republican Party activist who got her start in 
politics working for former President Richard Nixon's campaigns and proved her 
electability by beating an incumbent in 1987 for a seat on the community 
college board. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu has challenged Rogan's party origins, noting that he had been a Democrat -- 
indeed, a member of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party Central Committee 
-- until 1988, when he converted to Republicanism. Wu has called Rogan an 
"opportunist" who switched parties to be appointed by a GOP governor to a 
judgeship, and she has tried, in a last-minute mailer, to implicate Rogan in 
several plea-bargain deals both as a prosecutor and a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan has attacked Wu's charges as sleazy and fired off an attack mailer of 
his own, claiming that Wu, as a college trustee, had voted to double her salary 
and supported a widely criticized plan to establish a slush fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The squabbling within GOP ranks is not likely to abate soon. Once today's 
election is finished, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Peter Repovich, 36, 
will enter the Republican fray in earnest. Repovich is a candidate in the June 
7 Republican primary, not in the special election, and has a war chest of more 
than $300,000, much of it in the form of a loan from a well-to-do friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich has called himself the outsider who can best restore rank-and-file 
Republicans' faith in their party after the Nolan debacle. Rogan's candidacy in 
particular is simply the product of Glendale's old boy's network, Repovich has 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Republican who gets into the special election runoff will likely be 
"fighting two battles at once -- one against the other Republicans in the June 
7 primary and the other against the Democrat in the runoff," noted Jot Condie, 
Wu's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rogan and Wu, the GOP candidates are David Wallis, an engineer 
and activist, and Joseph Pietroforte, retired public accountant. Besides 
Schiff, Ken Kulpa, a broadcaster, is running as a Democrat. The Libertarian 
candidate is Willard Michlin, a real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers expect a light turnout for today's election.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: SEPULVEDA DAM; ALTERNATIVE SITES FOR SEPTIC FACILITY OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen alternatives to a controversial septic waste-receiving facility in the 
Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area will be introduced at a city-sponsored workshop 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 sites have been identified by the Los Angeles Department of Public 
Works as alternatives to the nearly completed facility at the Donald C. Tillman 
Water Reclamation Plant.The May 7 workshop and open house at the Tillman plant, 
from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is holding the workshop as part of an environmental study that it is 
conducting, despite the fact that most of the construction has been completed 
on the Tillman site. If the project is approved, it will accept sewage from 
residential septic tanks throughout the San Fernando Valley before channeling 
the sewage to the Hyperion Treatment Plant in Playa Del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation and transportation department staff members will be on hand during 
the event to answer questions, public works spokeswoman Christine Harris said. 
People will also be able to look at a map of the alternative sites, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Harris, an engineering consultant considered 70 city-owned 
maintenance yards before whittling the list down to 15 sites throughout the 
city, including Northridge, Pacoima, Sunland, Sun Valley, the area around Los 
Angeles International Airport and downtown Los Angeles. The consulting company 
looked for city-owned maintenance yards being used for purposes compatible with 
sewage disposal -- such as garbage collection -- and near main sewer lines, the 
spokeswoman said. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE FARM HERITAGE IS FOCUS OF COALITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to gain momentum from a change in presidents and the apparent demise of 
a nearby development plan, a group supporting Pierce College's agricultural 
heritage has refocused its efforts on promoting the embattled college farm as a 
useful oasis in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coalition to Save Pierce College Farm, which helped spearhead opposition 
to the planned dumping of 425,000 cubic yards of dirt on the 240-acre farm, 
will channel its energies into crop and animal programs now that plans to move 
topsoil from Warner Ridge have been put on hold, said coalition President Margo 
Murman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all kinds of local organizations and people who would be thrilled 
to help out on the farm," Murman said. "But there has been no mechanism on 
campus to recruit them. It's something that just can't be done by the 
instructors. It's too big." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, which formed in 1990 when budget cuts at Pierce began to 
threaten agricultural programs, has big hopes for the farm.  
</P>
<P>
 The vineyards and groves and orchards of citrus, avocados, apples, figs, pears 
and plums are badly in need of new funds. The nursery could possibly be 
developed into a moneymaker for the farm. Rodeos, horse and dog-herding shows 
and other events could be held there on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the interest is out there," Murman said. "We just need to open the 
farm to the public. This is one of the only places in Los Angeles that urban 
kids can get hands-on experience with plants and animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Murman said the coalition of 1,400 mostly Valley-based farm supporters plans 
to ask newly appointed Pierce President Mary Lee to support outside efforts to 
rejuvenate the cash-poor farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who took agriculture classes at Pierce during the late 1970s, may be an 
easy sell. But she said she needs to meet farm supporters before making any 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first question is where their organization fits in with the college," Lee 
said. "But I certainly think the farm is a tremendous asset to the college. And 
I don't oppose dirt coming onto the farm, as long as it's used to landscape, 
and not just as a layer on top of everything. It requires some well-thought-out 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
 The key, said Murman, will be to establish an organization sanctioned by 
Pierce College -- whether or not it is the coalition -- that will raise outside 
funds for farm upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce was founded in 1947 as an agricultural school, but suffered severe 
cutbacks as Pierce's student body and resources dwindled in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Murman said the coalition will model its farm support, in part, on the efforts 
of Friends of Pierce Pool, a group of local swimmers who organized last year 
when administrators threatened to close the outdoor pool. 
</P>
<P>
 That group secured the donation of a pool heater, a water purification system 
and a replastering job through public grants and private gifts. KURT PITZER

 A fire at a mini-mall destroyed a restaurant early Monday and caused $275,000 
in damage but caused no injuries, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out about 3:05 a.m. at the Celebrity Coffeeshop, located in a 
one-story strip mall at 8336 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., fire dispatcher Jim Wells 
said. It took firefighters about 20 minutes to contain the blaze. The cause is 
under investigation, Wells said. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 Just as necessity spawns invention, calamity is breeding ingenuity on the 
earthquake-ravaged campus of Kennedy High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Barred from her kitchens in the damaged B building of the Granada Hills 
campus, veteran home economics teacher Suzanne Gutsch is teaching her students 
how to cook in ovens of foil-wrapped cardboard boxes over coals set in aluminum 
pans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these kids have never cooked before," said Gutsch, who learned 
outdoor cooking skills as a Girl Scout leader. "Anything you can make at home, 
you can make in a box oven." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Northridge earthquake, Gutsch taught the Independent Living course, 
which includes a unit on cooking, in a classroom equipped with six 
mini-kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, having relocated to one of 60 bungalows brought in after the quake, 
Gutsch is making do with what she has -- as are many of the science, art and 
physical education teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their labs locked in crippled buildings, students in a physiology class 
dissected a fetal pig on a table in a bungalow, using 2-gallon jugs of water to 
wash their hands. Marine biology students used scissors to cut up a dogfish (a 
kind of shark) on tables covered with paper and plastic. Banned from 
still-closed locker rooms, students in physical education work out in their 
school clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never a dull moment here," said Assistant Principal Pete Fries. 
"Everyone's had to be really flexible." 
</P>
<P>
 On a roped-off plot of cement just outside the old home economics room, 
Gutsch's class was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Students prepared coals by stacking them in tin cans, then spreading them into 
aluminum turkey pans. Then they piled foil-wrapped chicken breasts, whole 
potatoes and corn directly onto them. For dessert, the students baked brownies 
and cupcakes by setting pans on racks with coals around them. They turned foil 
boxes upside-down over the pans to create ovens. 
</P>
<P>
 As smoke from the coals wafted into the air, about two dozen students sat 
around picnic tables sampling the fruits of their newfound cooking skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something people should know how to do," said senior James Davis. "You 
never know when an earthquake's going to happen." SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY OFFERS ALTERNATIVES TO KILLING PIGEONS

<P>
 City officials are promoting education over euthanasia after a move by the 
City Council to trap and kill hundreds of pigeons ruffled residents' feathers.  
</P>
<P>
 The council will review several alternatives -- including an ordinance that 
would ban pigeon feeding -- during its afternoon meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternatives were drafted after a controversial council decision last 
month to trap and poison the prolific birds with carbon monoxide by putting 
them in a cloth sack and tying it to the tailpipe of a running car. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the birds became necessary after a flock of pigeons 10,000 strong 
roosted in the downtown business district -- fouling awnings, sidewalks and 
ledges, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is the first in Los Angeles County to adopt such a sweeping measure, 
which prompted calls from animal rights activists around the country. JENNIFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; OVER HALF OF STUDENTS LIMITED IN ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than half of the city's 28,659 schoolchildren have difficulty reading, 
writing or speaking English, according to a report released by the school 
district this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of students in the Glendale Unified School District who have 
problems understanding English more than doubled since 1982, when about 24% of 
the district's student body was reported as limited English proficient. 
</P>
<P>
 About 14,917 of the district's students have difficulty understanding English 
and must receive special tutoring from teachers and their peers to understand 
classroom lessons, said Alice Petrossian, director of special projects and 
intercultural education. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more of the district's students -- about 20,012, or 70% -- speak a 
language other than English at home, including Armenian, Spanish or Korean, 
according to statistics taken from the 1994 Language Census Report. The 
district is required by the state Department of Education to compile the annual 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 And about 15 of the district's 28 schools have student populations that are 
composed almost entirely of students who have limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 These schools include elementary campuses such as Edison School, with 90% of 
its student body having difficulty understanding English; Mann School, with 92% 
of its students classified as limited English proficient, and Roosevelt Middle 
School, with 91% speaking little English. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the needs of a multilingual student body, the district tests students 
at its Welcome Center and then places them in a special education program 
designed to complement everyday classroom activities, Petrossian said. JENNIFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; BRAILLE OPENS NEW WORLD FOR BLIND MUSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A shotgun blast to the head 11 years ago robbed Rick Johnston of his world of 
vision, but a unique Sun Valley school that teaches Braille music to the blind 
is opening up a world of color. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream come true," said Johnston, 28, a Burbank resident who got his 
first guitar on his 17th birthday, two weeks after the shooting. Like most 
every other blind musician, he learned to play by ear. "I never thought I'd be 
able to play real music," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Johnston, real music is jazz, with all its color and complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 And until he started taking lessons at the Southern California Conservatory of 
Music in Sun Valley, jazz was out of reach -- something hidden behind a door, 
which he might get a metaphorical glance at through a peephole. The man who has 
opened that door for him was Braille music instructor Richard Taesch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought there'd be a reason to seriously learn Braille," said 
Johnston, taking a break from a lesson with Taesch, a guitar strapped across 
his lap and his seeing-eye dog, Eli, sprawled on the floor before him. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservatory, which opened in 1972, is run out of a strip mall along 
Sunland Boulevard. But the work by Taesch, who began Braille music instruction 
there a year ago, has started to make waves among the blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire what he's doing," said Bettye Krolick, a transcriber and Braille 
music authority. 
</P>
<P>
 By setting up the program, Taesch has created the first Braille music program 
independent of a school for the blind and one of only two in the country -- the 
other is in New York -- where blind students are taught to read music in 
Braille, said Krolick, who lives in Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most blind students go to sighted schools," Krolick said. "But the sighted 
schools don't have teachers familiar with the (Braille) music code. There's 
been a tremendous need for this. Many college students graduate from schools 
with music degrees that are meaningless because they are still illiterate." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of Braille instruction forced Nenita Dround, a 37-year-old blind 
singer, to drop her music instruction at Los Angeles City College. It had been 
too frustrating to learn without being able to see the notes on paper, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dround, of Tarzana, wants to learn Braille music so she can better run the 
choir at her local church. She started taking lessons from Taesch about three 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only 75 Braille music transcribers in the United States, a 
profession so rare that when Taesch became certified in 1992, he was the only 
person to do so that year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Taesch's students comes from San Diego for her lessons. He has also 
received an inquiry from a French student who was interested in joining the 
program while studying in a Northern California school. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his first students was Johnston. "I was in the wrong place at the wrong 
time," Johnston said about his being shot on a residential street in Burbank. A 
man who had a history of mental problems had picked him randomly. Although 
Johnston was declared dead three times after the shooting, he recovered but for 
the loss of vision and some shotgun pellets still in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his guitar he discovered a love for music. He also discovered religion 
and his interest in music changed from his adolescent interest in Eddie Van 
Halen to blues and Texas swing. Now, Johnston is married with a 3 1/2-year-old 
daughter, has written 18 songs and sings at his church and at coffeehouses. ED

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; TESTIMONY BACKS TAX RELIEF FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valley residents and business owners on Monday presented testimony at a state 
Assembly committee hearing in support of a state bill that would provide tax 
relief to earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the bill will allow quake victims to deduct the full amount of 
their losses, minus $100, when filing taxes. Current law permits survivors to 
deduct only quake losses that exceed 10% of a household's adjusted gross 
income, less $100. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a household with a $35,000 adjusted gross income would not be 
able to deduct the first $3,600 in property destroyed or damaged in the 
earthquake. The legislation would allow the same household to deduct $3,500 of 
the $3,600 earthquake loss.  
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony to the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee, state Sen. 
Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), the bill's author, said that state tax law 
provides more incentives for people to move than it does for them to rebuild 
from the quake, according to Rosenthal aide Dan Flynn. The law allows a 100% 
deduction for moving expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really optimistic" about the chances for the bill's passage, Flynn 
said. "We think the Legislature will recognize the need for the bill and will 
also be able to offset any cost associated with this bill by other changes in 
the tax code." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will vote on the bill Monday. If it is successful, it will be 
sent to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee and the full Assembly before 
being sent to the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
 Before flying to Sacramento to present his bill, SB 561, Rosenthal unveiled 
the proposal Monday to residents at a press conference in Sherman Oaks, one of 
the communities hit hardest by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal was joined by City Councilman Hal Bernson, community leaders Richard 
Close and Gerald Silver and business leader Wayne Adelstein at the event, which 
took place in front of a crumbled condominium complex at 4637 Willis Ave. KAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; WINNING STUDENTS TO DISPLAY ARTWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-two of the winning entries from the fourth annual Pacoima Pride arts 
project went on display Monday for a month at Van Nuys City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be on display at the Los Angeles Children's Museum starting June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples of the second-place artworks and those that received honorary mention 
will also be shown June 3 before the Los Angeles City Council, said Elizabeth 
Nielsen of Transworld Bank, which sponsors the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to continue the tradition of showcasing the children's artwork and at 
the same time want to try to educate them about local government," Nielsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, which involves about 2,000 children, was conceived as a creative 
way of getting Pacoima's youths to think about their community. This year's 
event included children in kindergarten through eighth grade at Pacoima 
Elementary, Haddon Avenue Elementary and Mary Immaculate schools and Vaughn 
Next Century Learning Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the past had painted portraits of Pacoima that included 
bullet-scarred buildings and people committing drive-by shootings on 
spaceships. But this year's entries were overwhelmingly positive, said muralist 
Manuel Velasquez, who was one of the judges. Among this year's works are 
drawings of families holding hands, green hills and smiling suns. MIGUEL

PROSECUTORS SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR PANAH; VIOLENCE: ATTORNEY FOR WOODLAND HILLS 
MAN ACCUSED OF MURDERING 8-YEAR-OLD NICOLE PARKER ASSAILS THE DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The attorney defending a Woodland Hills man accused of murdering an 8-year-old 
girl, whose body was found in the man's closet, on Monday assailed a decision 
by prosecutors to seek the death penalty against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter S. Berman announced his plans to seek capital 
punishment for Hooman Ashkan Panah, 22, during a hearing in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. Panah has pleaded not guilty to seven charges, including 
murder, kidnaping and sodomy in the Nov. 20 death of Nicole Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah's attorney, Robert Sheahen, described the prosecutor's decision as 
"insidious" and "evil" during an interview after the hearing. Sheahen has said 
he will present a psychological defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people in this county with lengthy criminal records who are 
basically horrible criminals who are not subject to the death penalty," Sheahen 
said. "For this young man with no criminal record and a history of mental 
hospitalization, it's outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman disagreed, noting the nature of the crime and saying he views Panah's 
"history of mental illness" differently than Sheahen. Berman said a committee 
of senior prosecutors reviewed the case and agreed with his recommendation to 
pursue the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Nicole Parker's nude body in a suitcase hidden in Panah's bedroom 
closet under a pile of clothes on Nov. 21, one day after dozens of volunteers 
searched for her after she disappeared from the courtyard of the Ventura 
Boulevard apartment complex where her father and Panah lived. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury also charged Panah, who on Monday was clad in a blue jail jumper 
with his hair in a ponytail, with four special-circumstance allegations, 
including murder in conjunction with kidnaping, sodomy, child molestation and 
oral copulation. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of any of the special circumstances, Panah could face death or 
life imprisonment without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 A May 27 trial-setting date has been scheduled, when reports by two 
court-appointed psychologists assigned to evaluate Panah should be complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said a plea agreement in the case is possible, but unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not that sure they're going to make us an offer we'll entertain. . . . 
This is a very serious case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a plea agreement is not reached by the May 27 hearing, the case is 
scheduled to be sent back to Van Nuys Superior Courthouse for trial.

GRANDMOTHER FACES TRIAL IN SLAYING OF SON-IN-LAW; CRIME: JO LULU HAYNES, 74, 
ALLEGEDLY LURED KENNETH LISI TO HER HOUSE UNDER THE PRETENSE OF PICKING UP HIS 
CHILDREN, THEN SHOT HIM. 
</P>

<P>
 A 74-year-old grandmother was ordered to stand trial Monday on charges of 
murdering her estranged son-in-law, whom she allegedly lured to her house under 
the pretense of picking up his children. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing emotional testimony from the victim's father, who witnessed the 
shooting, Van Nuys Municipal Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers ruled there was 
enough evidence against Jo Lulu Haynes to warrant a Superior Court trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes is accused of murdering Kenneth Lisi, 43, who was gunned down last 
Halloween night on the porch of a Northridge home where he once lived with his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisi was in the midst of a bitter divorce battle with his wife, Pamela, 
centering on custody of the couple's two daughters, ages 4 and 11 at the time. 
Pamela Lisi's attorney contended that the father was sexually molesting the 
younger daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But a judge had ruled in August that the charges were groundless and awarded 
custody of the children to Kenneth Lisi. 
</P>
<P>
 He was killed less than two months later after being summoned to pick up his 
children at his wife's house in the 7700 block of Louise Avenue, according to 
testimony at Monday's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Lisi, the victim's father, testified he had spent the day with his son 
in Lancaster, where Kenneth Lisi moved after separating from his wife. Kenneth 
Lisi received a phone call and reported to his parents that he had to 
unexpectedly pick up his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me to follow him down to his old house in Northridge because he had 
to go pick up the kids," Ernest Lisi said, "and he liked to have me there in 
case there was any type of problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Kenneth Lisi went to the door, he stopped by his parents' car. His 
father told him that "if he needed me, (he could) call me and I'll come right 
out," according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Lisi knocked on the door twice before anyone answered, his father 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "That lady came out with a gun in her hand," Ernest Lisi said, pointing at 
Haynes. "And of course I jumped out of the car, (Ernest's wife) Faye jumped out 
of the car -- but it doesn't take long to fire a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes fired one shot into Kenneth Lisi from about three feet away, and he 
fell to the ground face first, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime, I was running out of the car," Ernest Lisi said, struggling 
to maintain his composure. "She bent over him, or stooped over him, and shot 
him once, twice, a couple more times, I wasn't counting the shots at that 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes was firing "right at his back," according to the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrestled the gun out of her hand and ran inside the house to call 911," 
Ernest Lisi said. "I had the gun in my hand and was on the phone with 911 when 
she came in after me, I guess wanting to get the gun, and I told her that if 
she came any closer, I would shoot her." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Lisi pushed Haynes away, according to his testimony, and his wife 
grabbed her around the neck. Faye Lisi took the gun and ran outside, eventually 
turning the weapon over to paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, according to Ernest Lisi, he heard a message on his 
answering machine asking Kenneth Lisi to pick up his children: "Pam's car broke 
down and she can't bring the children up to Lancaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Joel Price testified that Pamela Lisi told him 
that she was out trick-or-treating with the children in West Los Angeles that 
night. He also said that her car was in working order and that she checked into 
the Beverly Hills Hotel with the children within hours of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Renee F. Urman said the phone call was "a way to lure 
Kenneth Lisi to her house so she could execute him." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the evidence concerning the phone call, Silvers also ordered Haynes 
to stand trial on a special circumstance allegation of lying in wait. A 
conviction on that charge can lead to one of two possible sentences: execution 
or life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Michael Duffey said Haynes was driven by "her belief he was 
molesting the children, that became a compelling obsession." 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes, who is being held in County Jail without bail, is scheduled to be 
arraigned May 16.

NICHOLSON SETTLES CASE; COURTS: ASSAULT AND VANDALISM CHARGES AGAINST ACTOR ARE 
DROPPED. VICTIM OF GOLF CLUB ATTACK TELLS JUDGE HE WAS COMPENSATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Vandalism and assault charges were dropped against Jack Nicholson on Monday 
after the man the actor attacked with a golf club following a traffic dispute 
told a judge that he had been compensated and did not wish to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing "the violent nature of the attack," prosecutors opposed the decision by 
Van Nuys Municipal Judge Martin Suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Suits found that a civil compromise had been reached, in which Nicholson paid 
Robert Scott Blank an undisclosed monetary settlement. Under state law, the 
finding effectively dismisses the charges and prevents authorities from 
prosecuting later. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in the judge's chambers, Blank "spoke quite forcefully" in favor 
of the civil compromise, according to Nicholson's attorney, Charles R. English. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's over," said Blank's attorney, Charles E. Ruben, as he quickly moved past 
a gathering of reporters. Blank, a 38-year-old Hollywood resident, refused to 
comment on any aspect of either the civil or criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson did not appear in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscar-winning actor was charged with misdemeanor assault and vandalism in 
a Feb. 8 attack near the intersection of Moorpark Way and Riverside Drive in 
Toluca Lake following a minor traffic dispute. Nicholson admitted that he used 
a 3-iron to repeatedly strike Blank's Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 English said Nicholson had "some extraordinary circumstances going on in his 
life on the morning this happened," citing a rigorous shooting schedule on his 
latest film and the recent death of one of his closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that Nicholson "went a step too far," English said civil 
compromises "happen all the time in courts throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
 With overcrowded criminal courtrooms, "the public can be happy it's over 
because an insignificant case was taken out of the criminal justice system," 
English said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Jeff Harkavy said Nicholson should be prosecuted because he 
first hit the roof of the car, then he swung the golf club "toward the victim's 
face," striking the windshield. The prosecutor said Blank suffered minor 
injuries when glass from the windshield struck him in the face and he received 
"some minor cuts on his nose." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office either supports or opposes civil compromises based 
on an assessment of the seriousness of the criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
 English said prosecutors strenuously opposed the civil compromise because of 
Nicholson's fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It only reached this level because Mr. Nicholson is Mr. Nicholson," English 
said, reasoning that prosecutors were justifiably concerned with the chance 
that the public would perceive that the actor received special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, Mr. Nicholson has been treated differently," English said. "He's 
been treated more severely than an ordinary citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson, a star of the film "A Few Good Men" and many others, won an Academy 
Award in 1975 for his portrayal of a mental patient in "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest."

VALLEY INTERVIEW: CLAS TEST OPPONENT SAYS HIS GROUP PROTECTS PARENTS' RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Moeser, Times Special Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System test has been hailed by its 
supporters as a revolutionary method of testing students, providing a way to 
measure students' critical thinking skills. But the test, given for the first 
time last year to about a million fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grade students, has 
come under increasing criticism, with opponents of the costly test saying it 
asks students personal questions and fails to measure basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the primary agitators in the controversy that has erupted over CLAS is 
Gary Kreep. Through his Escondido-based United States Justice Foundation, 
Kreep, 43, sent letters to each of the more than 1,000 school districts in the 
state threatening them with lawsuits if they did not seek consent from parents 
before giving the test to their children. Kreep contends that Education Code 
Section 60650 makes parental consent necessary because the test asks personal 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state Department of Education maintains the 1994 CLAS does not 
ask personal questions so there is no requirement for consent, the rising 
opposition to CLAS led William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent of public 
instruction, to last week notify school districts that they may allow parents 
to exempt their children from the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the department's actions, Kreep is not satisfied. His foundation has 
filed lawsuits against nearly two dozen school districts. And his threat even 
led one school district to simply refuse to administer the test, something that 
will, in turn, probably prompt legal action by the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Kreep was interviewed by Times special correspondent Sharon Moeser. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is the United States Justice Foundation and what is your 
connection to it?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: USJF is a conservative, nonprofit, public-interest, legal action group 
established in 1979. I am executive director and the only staff attorney, 
although there are about 70 attorneys all over the country who donate some time 
each year to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How is the foundation funded?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We have a contributor list of about 73,000 people, just common, everyday 
people. Our public records show we raised approximately $1 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Before CLAS, what did the foundation do.  
</P>
<P>
 A. We litigate issues of public import from a conservative viewpoint, although 
a lot of things we do are not court cases. A lot of people call, saying, 'my 
rights have been violated, what are my rights?' We also do 
public-education-types of projects such as distributing copies of the Bill of 
Rights and the Pledge of Allegiance to parents and children all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How did the foundation get involved in CLAS?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We were contacted by parents who were irate over the CLAS test. They had 
seen copies of the test and they didn't think it was suitable. They thought it 
was intrusive and depressing and not the kind of thing they wanted their 
children to be reading. They came to us seeking legal advice on what to do 
about it. That was last August. There was a statewide task force on education 
made up of a lot of moms. We were invited to join and started doing some legal 
research in regards to CLAS and started advising parents of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time there was an attempt being made to work with the state Board of 
Education to deal with the objectionable materials in the test. Assurances were 
given by the board, but ultimately those assurances proved to be false. So we 
started saying we're going to start filing lawsuits. That was early to 
mid-March. I sent letters to all 1,007 school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are your specific problems with the test?  
</P>
<P>
 A. From a legal point of view, the questions contained on almost every example 
of the test I've seen violate Education Code 60650. They're asking questions 
about personal things, about the children's lives. When you're talking about 
things like death or marriage, you're talking about issues that not only have 
moral consequences, but religious significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The Department of Education has said that many of the items you and other 
CLAS opponents are calling test questions are in fact not from the test.  
</P>
<P>
 A. They've actually said that none of what we're passing around has ever been 
on a CLAS test. I can tell you that I have seen parts of the 1994 CLAS test, 
and things from the 1993 test. I'm not going to get too specific, but they can 
misstate all they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The state has worked very hard to keep the tests secret in order to ensure 
their validity. How are you getting copies?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Parents are reporting to us what's on the test because their children tell 
them. There are some people within the educational establishment so incensed by 
this that copies are being sent out. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What makes an attorney or a conservative public interest foundation an 
expert in education?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I'm not an education expert, but I can read the law and I can use my own 
good judgment and I can read what these questions ask. It doesn't take a rocket 
scientist to see how they would violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your motivation?  
</P>
<P>
 A. To protect parents' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The Department of Education has repeatedly said its attorneys reviewed the 
1994 test and concluded the rights of parents and students are not violated.  
</P>
<P>
 A. I don't know what those department attorneys saw, but I've shown test parts 
to other attorneys who are not employed by the Department of Education and 
they've agreed with me that this stuff appears to violate the Education Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You sent a letter in March to every school district in the state 
threatening them with legal action and the possibility of the district having 
to pay "substantial attorneys' fees" if they did not seek parental consent 
before giving the test. Why not just advise the districts that you believe 
consent is necessary?  
</P>
<P>
 A. The idea of including the threat was to make them understand they just 
can't blithely ignore the law and that if we make them obey the law they're not 
going to get off without damages. Even with the threat, many superintendents 
did not take it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Some say that you represent a "vocal minority" and not the majority of 
parents. How would you respond?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I'm speaking multiple times a week all around the state and, with one 
exception, every parent who has looked at the test has been appalled. That one 
parent was someone that helped develop the test. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of uproar. It's not just me and a few parents, it's a lot of 
parents, and the legislators are starting to get interested in this too. This 
is not just some issue that is going to quietly die away after a couple days. 
If it is a minority who are objecting, it is because the parents don't know 
about the test because of all the secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The Department of Education last week reversed its earlier position and 
informed school districts it will not take action against those that adopt 
procedures allowing parents to exempt their children. Why is that not enough to 
meet your concerns?  
</P>
<P>
 A. That still doesn't comply with the law. Education Code section 60650 is 
very specific. They're still violating parents' rights so as long as we keep 
getting plaintiffs, we'll keep suing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Would you ultimately like the test to be abandoned entirely?  
</P>
<P>
 A. My personal views are really not the issue. The issue to me is compliance 
with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. CLAS has been hailed by its supporters as offering a revolutionary new way 
of testing, specifically by being able to measure what students have learned 
and their ability to apply that knowledge. Should that be done?  
</P>
<P>
 A. This is getting into an area where I don't pretend to have any real 
understanding or abilities to comment. That's for the educational expert and 
I'm not an educational expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why not file a suit against the state Department of Education since it is 
the agency saying the test must be given? Aren't you sticking the school 
districts in an untenable situation?  
</P>
<P>
 A. The law is very clear that it's the districts that administer the test and 
the districts are the ones that are under the restrictions of Education Code 
section 60650. 
</P>
<P>
 Districts are being put in the position of doing what the department tells 
them or following the wishes of their constituents and the parents in respect 
to students' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do you feel about the decision of the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District to not administer the test, a decision they made after you sent them 
your letter and spoke to them at a public meeting?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Their decision went far beyond what we were asking them to do, but they 
made their stand. Now we're going to see if that one incident, that one vote, 
leads to a major decision on the CLAS test. Between that and the Beaumont 
district suing the Department of Education, we may get a legal determination as 
to whether districts are actually required to give the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The Department of Education has said what the Antelope Valley district did 
is in violation of the law.  
</P>
<P>
 A. I've been arguing with that all along. The law says districts shall 
administer a statewide test. The state Board of Education passes other tests as 
statewide tests. There is no mandate in the law that the CLAS test must be 
given. That has been the decision and demand of the state Department of 
Education, but that doesn't make it the law. They don't make law, the 
Legislature makes law.

KILLER OF ARMORED CAR GUARD GETS LIFE IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A parolee convicted of murdering an armored car guard during a robbery of a 
Home Depot hardware store was sentenced Monday to spend the rest of his life in 
prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen imposed the sentence that had been 
recommended by a jury for Sean Darnell Slade, 27. The jury, which deliberated 
for three days, could have recommended that Slade be executed for the fatal 
shooting of guard Edwin (Eddie) Maldonado during a July 29, 1992, robbery at 
the San Fernando store. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, his hands handcuffed behind him, showed no emotion during the brief 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Slade's attorney, Bruce Hill, said Slade's testimony 
during the penalty phase of the trial may have swayed some jurors to vote 
against the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some jurors did tell me that his testimony did have an impact on them 
different than when he testified during the guilt phase," Hill said. Slade 
testified during the penalty phase that he was innocent and therefore felt no 
remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the life sentence, Coen added 14 more years for the use of a 
gun in the murder and for Slade having a prior felony conviction. The 
additional years point to the "severity of the crime," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Jeff Jonas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonas also said that even though Slade has been sentenced, the case remains 
open because three or four accomplices remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not give up trying to find the other perpetrators," Jonas said. 
"There is at least the getaway driver and another man with a gun. We also 
believe he had help from the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Slade testified that he had nothing to do with Maldonado's 
death, and blamed his predicament on the mother of a man he killed in 1987 over 
an alleged drug deal. The mother had called police and said that Slade was the 
man in a police composite drawing circulated after the 1992 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade, who was convicted of manslaughter for the 1987 shooting, had been on 
parole for 25 days before shooting Maldonado.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STUDENT PLACES 2ND IN DESIGN CONTEST

 A Hart High School student placed second in a national architecture 
competition Monday for his design of a community youth center. 
</P>
<P>
 David Duarte, 18, won a tuition scholarship worth $27,500 to the New Jersey 
Institute of Technology, which sponsored the competition.Sixty-two high school 
students entered the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte received the award Monday night at a ceremony at the school in Newark, 
N. J. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we had to design was a community youth center including a gymnasium, a 
classroom, a game room, a library and other small rooms on the site of our 
choice," Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte sketched a 17,000-square-foot center to be located near the city's 
civic center, between the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station and Valencia 
Town Center mall. Stacey Hersh, an NJIT spokeswoman, said judges were impressed 
with his choice of location and color to match the surrounding landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The school received more than 700 requests for packets to enter the 
competition, but most failed to enter in time due to the complexity of the 
project, Hersh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte said he has wanted to become an architect since the age of 14 and 
"loves entering contests." As a freshman he placed third in a high school 
competition to create a city civic center, and he built a waist-high, 
wheelchair-accessible garden planter for a Valencia senior center.HART HIGH

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FEMA OKS $5 MILLION FOR SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Federal officials have so far approved the city's requests for about half the 
estimated $12 million of federal disaster assistance needed to repair public 
facilities damaged by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5 million that has been approved will cover the costs of 19 out of 95 
rebuilding projects slated in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is hoping that all of the projects can be completed entirely with 
funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Adele Macpherson, city 
emergency preparedness coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects include removing debris and operating transit buses after the 
quake, running the city's emergency operations center and making repairs to 
roads, bridges, drainage facilities and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the projects approved include: $507,000 for road repairs in Valencia; 
$301,000 for collecting and removing debris; $251,000 for engineering and 
repairs along Tourney Road; $237,000 to fix roads and medians in Canyon 
Country; $150,000 for safety inspections; and $146,000 for emergency traffic 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has turned down only one project that the city has proposed: A request of 
$22,500 to repay the city for having to relocate its cowboy poetry festival 
after the quake damaged William S. Hart High School auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 A FEMA spokesman said events are not eligible for the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has also agreed to repay the city for $663,909 of sewer repairs in the 
Four Oaks neighborhood where flooding occurred a year ago.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; METROLINK SHORTENS L.A. RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Metrolink has cut 18 minutes off its Lancaster to Los Angeles commute with the 
installation of new rails, switches and signal equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The faster ride began Monday and is the first of several improvements planned 
along the 50-mile leg of the Santa Clarita line, said Peter Hidalgo, Metrolink 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The route opened one week after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake as transit 
officials tried to provide transportation around the collapsed Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains have been running on rails previously used for freight, which 
are safe for passenger trains but too curvy to allow for high speeds, Hidalgo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing rail sections with straight tracks has cut the commute time from two 
hours and 25 minutes to two hours and seven minutes. Additional improvements 
are expected to cut another 45 minutes off the ride and should be completed by 
June, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction is funded by a $40-million grant from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. Work would normally take a year, but overtime efforts have 
moved up the completion date by about six months, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this strategy is a move that will definitely help us maintain our 
ridership base," Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter rail ridership has increased from an initial 1,000 daily riders on 
the line between Santa Clarita and Los Angeles. The extended line, including 
Lancaster, now serves about 5,500 passengers per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, no Metrolink line had been planned between the Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys for at least 10 years, Hidalgo said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; POISON SUSPECT RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A 15-year-old boy accused of poisoning a Littlerock teacher by pouring 
cleaning fluid in her can of soda was released from custody Monday, but was 
ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, whose name was not released because of his age, had been in custody 
since his arrest on April 12. The high school sophomore will remain free on 
electronic surveillance pending the outcome of his trial on two felony charges, 
including assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial had been slated to begin Monday but was postponed to give 
prosecutors and defense attorneys more time to prepare. The trial has been 
rescheduled to start June 6.  
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock High School teacher Susan Ennis became violently ill last month 
after drinking the contaminated can of Diet Pepsi laced with several drops of 
cleaning fluid. Ennis was hospitalized for six days immediately after the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old teacher entered the hospital again last week with pneumonia. 
Ennis said her doctors told her the pneumonia was probably related to the 
poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably caused by aspirating, I was vomiting so much," Ennis said 
during a telephone interview from her Palmdale hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, who was released Monday afternoon, was reluctant to discuss her 
feelings about the release of the student accused of poisoning her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no control over the fact he's been released," she said, adding that 
she believes it is good he will be monitored. "I would like to see that he not 
hurt anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County probation officials said it is uncommon for a judge to 
order a juvenile to be electronically monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have argued he should have stayed in custody another seven days," 
said Andy Reynolds, deputy district attorney. "But you can't hold him 
indefinitely. He's not a danger to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court referee Eugene E. Siegel ordered the boy released from Sylmar 
Juvenile Hall Monday. The youth will wear an electronic surveillance band on 
his ankle and remain at home unless he has the permission of probation 
officials to go out. The youth must be accompanied by his parents if he does 
leave the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father declined to comment on his son's release or on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald V. Taylor, the boy's attorney, said the family is happy about the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth "continues to deny any participation" in the poisoning, Taylor said, 
noting the boy will probably not return to Littlerock High while he is being 
monitored but will instead receive home instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy faces charges of adulterating a beverage and assault with a deadly 
weapon. If convicted of both felonies, he could face up to eight years in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis said what she wants most is for whoever is guilty to learn compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the best sentence would be for him to have to spend a year cleaning 
up animals who have been poisoned by toxic waste or toxic spills," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the physical effects of the poisoning, Ennis said she and her three 
children, ages 2, 5 and 11, have suffered emotional trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children are in therapy," she said. "It's been very hard on them. I've 
been seeing (a therapist), of course." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ordeal, Ennis said she plans to return to her teaching job as soon 
as her doctors allow her to. So far, however, "my doctors tell me they don't 
know when that will be."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA CITY HALL REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen weeks after the Northridge earthquake battered City Hall, the Valencia 
building reopened Monday with an abundance of stacked boxes and scattered 
furniture the only evidence of its ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs cost about $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers are still unpacking much of their equipment and supplies, but all 
regular services are again available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Pederson officially reopened the building with a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony and announced new City Hall office hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting May 13, City Hall will be closed on alternate Fridays. The office 
will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. every other Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hours are meant to help Santa Clarita meet South Coast Air Quality 
Management District standards that call for organizations with 100 or more 
employees to reduce car trips to work. Santa Clarita has about 185 full-time 
city employees.

L.A. PLANS CASH INFUSION TO REVIVE QUAKE GHOST TOWNS; REBUILDING: OFFICIALS 
HOPE LOANS CAN SAVE RAVAGED AREAS AND STOP SPREAD OF BLIGHT. OWNERS, BANKS MUST 
ALSO HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The crumbled foundations and cracked facades of 17 empty apartment buildings 
that line two blocks of Willis Avenue in Sherman Oaks represent one of the 
greatest concentrations of damage from the Northridge earthquake. Now city 
officials fear that those silent hulks could become epicenters of further 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Without rapid public intervention, they said, Willis and other such 
earthquake-ravaged stretches of Northridge, Hollywood and East and South Los 
Angeles could remain ghost towns for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are neighborhoods where real potential for multiple walkaways and 
disinvestment will make it hard to bring them back," said Gary Squier, general 
manager of the city's Housing Department. "They are still good neighborhoods, 
but have the potential for sliding downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 As it has elsewhere, blight created by disaster could spread from abandoned 
neighborhoods, causing nearby stores to close and making adjacent areas 
undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city, already reeling from recession and riots, cannot afford the five 
years or so that it has taken other regions to rebuild after hurricanes, fires 
and floods, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 They cautioned that state and federal programs will not be enough to get the 
job done quickly. So Los Angeles needs to embark on an ambitious program of its 
own to revitalize the ghost towns that threaten the city's economy and spirit, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major feature of the program, developed at the urging of Mayor Richard 
Riordan, calls for loaning property owners and banks at least $150 million in 
the coming months to make repairs on quake-damaged properties. By comparison, 
the city in recent years has loaned about $50 million annually to jump-start 
the creation of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new strategy, the city would loan money -- received from federal 
earthquake aid and from city-issued bonds -- to private real estate investors 
who might otherwise abandon apartment buildings rather than make costly 
earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 To fend off blight, the city plans to conduct building-by-building, 
block-by-block assessments, targeting those loans to areas with the greatest 
damage. The city Community Redevelopment Agency and the state government are 
also planning loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledge that this ambitious but untested strategy could face 
serious political challenges if it appears to favor certain districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's success hinges on the city's ability to enlist enough property 
owners to participate and on getting enough lenders to partially forgive 
mortgages. It also depends on moving quickly, before lethargy sets in. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such intervention, UC Berkeley architecture professor Mary Comerio 
thinks the ghost towns could linger for a decade or more. "It has nothing to do 
with the economy and nothing to do with the economic health of L.A. It's the 
simple fact that it will take five years to rebuild once somebody starts," said 
Comerio, who studied the rebuilding effort after the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake in Northern California. Signs of Blight 
</P>
<P>
 Already some Los Angeles property owners are giving up and related symptoms of 
neighborhood decline are appearing. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a third of the apartments and condominiums in a several-mile-long 
area that includes Willis and flanks Ventura Boulevard were so badly damaged in 
the quake that they remain uninhabitable. Those 2,200 units were occupied until 
Jan. 17 by middle- and upper-income renters and condo owners who patronized 
neighborhood hardware stores, markets, hairstylists and framing shops. Although 
green-tagged, meaning inspectors have approved them for use, such nearby stores 
as The Gap and Banana Republic are still closed and will not publicly commit to 
reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials now worry that those businesses could fail if nearby apartments are 
not repaired or rebuilt soon to house potential customers. That, in turn, would 
drive down property values and fuel further middle-class flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for decay is greatest, city officials fear, in areas of 
concentrated damage. Thirty-eight census tracts had 100 or more housing units 
destroyed and many more than that left temporarily vacant and in need of 
repair, according to the report. In the 13 tracts most at risk -- 12 in the San 
Fernando Valley -- more than 15% of the housing stock is now shuttered or in 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 In 11 of those tracts, a strong majority of residents are white and median 
household incomes range from about $32,000 to $53,000 a year. The two other 
tracts are home to very large Latino populations, and median incomes are much 
lower -- about $26,300 in a Van Nuys tract and about $15,000 in a Westlake one. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Willis, untended grass in front of fenced-off buildings grows knee-high, 
graffiti is sprouting on nearby businesses and a cushionless sofa molders at 
the curb. In east Hollywood, parts of a once vibrant ethnic neighborhood are 
still vacant, and remaining residents fear gang incursions. In Northridge, rats 
and bugs are infesting the ghostly rows of red-tagged apartment buildings along 
Lassen Street and Zelzah Avenue, just across from Cal State Northridge, and 
squatters are spotted too. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine the quality of life for the next three or four years if these 
buildings stay like this. Something has to be done," said Arnie Mitchnick, who 
lives in a single-family home on the same Northridge block as those shattered 
apartments. Aid Plans 
</P>
<P>
 To bring those areas back quickly, housing officials hope to spend at least 
two-thirds of $99 million the city received in federal Community Development 
Block Grant funds for earthquake aid, which could otherwise go toward repairing 
public structures and providing social services. U.S. Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development Henry Cisneros has waived a number of rules to give the city 
more spending flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Another federal program, which usually focuses on repairing housing, will kick 
in $50 million more for the city's ghost-town busting efforts. And funds from 
city-issued bonds are to provide at least $30 million more. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the loans attractive, the city plans to offer easier terms than under 
earlier housing programs. In some cases, repayment can be delayed until a 
building returns to profitability or is sold. Also to be relaxed are some rules 
requiring that apartment owners who receive government loans keep the units 
affordable for low- and moderate-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 In allied efforts, the Community Redevelopment Agency proposes to spend $7.9 
million for earthquake recovery, mostly low-interest loans for low- and 
moderate-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the state Department of Housing and Community Development plans to 
offer about $160 million in low-interest loans to rebuild multifamily apartment 
buildings with low and moderate rents and $415 million in loans to 
single-family homeowners if voters approve a recovery bond issue in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The city might form redevelopment zones to condemn, level and get properties 
rebuilt, but only as a last resort and only with neighborhood agreement, 
according to John Maguire, the CRA's deputy director for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the whole strategy needs City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, chairman of the council's Housing and 
Redevelopment Committee, said that he can understand the need to focus on the 
most hard-hit neighborhoods, but that other damaged areas should not be 
neglected. "I'm prepared to resist that," said Ridley-Thomas, who represents 
some areas struck by the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 One justification for this vast and potentially risky public investment in 
private housing lies in sheer volume -- $1.15 billion in damage to more than 
65,000 buildings citywide. About 84% of all damaged units were in multifamily 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a five-year-long slide in property values has left many owners 
owing more than buildings are worth. Even before the earthquake, officials 
said, the number of apartment buildings being seized through foreclosures had 
gone from a handful to hundreds annually, especially in lower-income areas. 
Now, saddled with earthquake repairs, as many as 10,000 houses and buildings 
containing nearly 20,000 apartments could wind up abandoned, the Housing 
Department study said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment building owners may face more hurdles than single-family homeowners 
in receiving federal aid. They are not eligible for federal emergency housing 
grants and their rental income may be too small to qualify them for federal 
Small Business Administration loans. And matters are complicated by the lack of 
earthquake insurance or high deductibles. Cooperation Required 
</P>
<P>
 Even optimists concede that bringing hard-hit areas back will require 
unprecedented cooperation among property owners, lenders, insurers and 
government. Also necessary will be a lot of money, innovation and patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Several badly damaged census tracts, including one along Lassen Street where 
nearly 40% of the apartments remain vacated, flank Cal State Northridge. Even 
though the built-in demand from students gives the building owners incentive to 
rebuild, many are facing financial ruin if they have to rely solely on SBA 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Jones is still awaiting a final answer from the SBA about how much 
money she and her co-owner might be able to borrow to repair the $1 million in 
damage to their 112-unit complex at Plummer Street and Reseda Boulevard near 
the campus. Jones said she expects to get only $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Without city help, she said, "we couldn't do it. We not only must have that 
additional money, we must have it at a low enough interest rate that we can 
afford to operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby businesses are feeling the loss of customers. "It's scary, it's very 
creepy to be the only life form around," complained Jan Kelson, manager of the 
Northridge Video Store several blocks away on Lassen. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis Avenue has the same eerie feel to it. "At first it felt like a ghost 
town. . . . It was just me and the birds," said 82-year-old Lil Stein of her 
post-quake return to a new apartment in the neighborhood where she has lived 
for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, her world remains disrupted, her previous apartment destroyed, her 
friends scattered, some of her favorite stores on nearby Ventura Boulevard 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Stein, a retired university office manager, is optimistic that the once 
vibrant street will come back. She sees trash bins and growing curbside piles 
of debris as positive signs of rebuilding. And, she said, "I'm seeing more and 
more people on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Sherman Oaks apartment buildings that commanded relatively 
high rents are more likely to be rebuilt than those in less affluent areas. 
However, many nearby condominium projects on Vista del Monte, Natick and 
Colbath avenues, face the financial and insurance complications that arise from 
having multiple owners in one building. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to wonder whether it's worth it" to rebuild, said George L. 
Ophoff, Western regional manager of National Catastrophe Adjusters, which 
advises banks about damaged properties. Pre-Quake Troubles 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhoods that were troubled by abandoned buildings, gangs and drugs 
before the quake present more intractable problems. For example, before Jan. 
17, city housing officials had made some progress in improving the square-block 
area of Northridge known as Roscoe-Schoenborn. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the small, mostly run-down apartment buildings that had been abandoned 
by its owner was boarded up to keep out gang members. High-intensity, 
bullet-resistant street lights had been installed along the mid-block alley to 
discourage drug and gun sales. And police had stepped up patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the area had improved before the earthquake, but "it's slid back" 
since, said Glenn Blackshaw, who owns a quake-damaged building in the 17900 
block of Roscoe Boulevard. Gang members use an adjacent building as a virtual 
headquarters and several others in the area already have been abandoned by 
their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Blackshaw's own building remains unrentable while he tries to work 
out how to finance more than $35,000 in repairs not covered by insurance. He 
said his lender won't even return his telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any financial help the city could come up with would be great," he said. 
"Otherwise, they're going to end up bulldozing all those buildings and lose all 
those units." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA architecture and urban planning professor Jacqueline Leavitt is worried 
that the earthquake damage, on top of unemployment, middle-class flight, ethnic 
changes and overcrowded housing, could push such neighborhoods downward and 
worsen the city's already desperate shortage of affordable rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can separate the natural disasters and man-made disasters," 
said Leavitt, an expert on urban abandonment issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas Black, a resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a Washington, 
D.C.-based real estate think tank, said the impact of the earthquake in such 
neighborhoods does not have to be permanent. "As long as the area economy is 
doing well . . . I don't think it will have a long-term effect." Role of Banks 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders are key to the revival of ghost towns, city officials said. To win 
their cooperation, city delegations have promised banks less red tape and easy 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is not going to have the resources, and never will, to substitute 
for the private financial community. There is too much destruction here," 
stressed Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes 
hard-hit Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lenders welcome the city's efforts. "Frankly, anything the city or the 
state can do . . . to share some of the risk of the loans" would help, said 
Rick Hall, senior vice president of Home Savings of America, the affected 
area's largest residential lender. 
</P>
<P>
 But housing officials suggest that some other banks may simply sell off 
damaged properties to "bottom fishers," speculators who buy buildings at deep 
discounts, make minimal repairs and re-rent them at cutthroat prices. And some 
apartment building owners have said that lenders are resisting making any 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's aggressive approach to recovery may help the city 
rebound more quickly than other areas have after natural disasters, some 
officials said. Yet even if the city's plans go smoothly, residents and 
landlords must be patient, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all 3,000 single-family homes damaged or destroyed in the Loma Prieta 
earthquake had been repaired or rebuilt a year later, according to a UC 
Berkeley study. Half of the multifamily units, however, remained uninhabitable 
four years later. And downtown Santa Cruz's shopping district remains pocked 
with empty lots. 
</P>
<P>
 A wait such as that "is . . . devastating to the local community if you are 
sitting next to an abandoned building," said Comerio, who co-authored the 
study. "It depresses property values in the whole area, which then makes it 
even harder to redo the property, because you can't get the rents or loans you 
need. It's a potentially vicious cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the rebuilding effort in the quiet woodsy hills above Oakland, where 
2,500 expensive houses were incinerated in a 1991 wildfire, is making slow 
progress. As of last month, a third of the houses had not even begun to be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recovering slowly from disaster is the southern Florida area hit by 
1992's Hurricane Andrew, where a study predicts that it will be next year 
before even half the 47,000 housing units are replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with low-interest loans, some landlords still walked away, recalled Bill 
Finley, an official leading the revival effort in Homestead, Fla. "The costs 
were so high and the rents were stable," he said. "There was no way there could 
be economic sense in refurbishing." Pockets of Destruction 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake created pockets of intense damage to apartment 
buildings and single-family homes that officials fear could remain virtual 
ghost towns for years. Here are the 10 census tracts in Los Angeles with the 
greatest number of heavily damaged or destroyed housing units. 04,25,12,12,09 
Multi- Single family family % Census tract units lost units lost renters 1) 
1152.01 Northridge 793 2 71% 2) 1412 Sherman Oaks 773 8 69% 3) 1413.01 Sherman

1 64% * City's Strategy 
</P>
<P>
 Although state and federal earthquake aid is available, city housing officials 
are concerned it won't be enough to ensure the recovery of especially hard-hit 
neighborhoods. So officials are proposing the following strategy: 
</P>
<P>
 * Workers will go door-to-door to find out whether building owners can afford 
to repair their property. Talks also will be held with lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Low-interest loans will be offered directly to banks to underwrite the 
repair and resale of buildings that they have foreclosed on. 
</P>
<P>
 * Up to $15,000 per apartment will be loaned to owners who invest in repairing 
damaged properties. Repayment would start after five years, but only if the 
building had become profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the lender agrees to forgive part of the mortgage on a damaged property, 
the city will loan up to $30,000 more per apartment for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * To encourage banks to extend repair loans, the city will partially guarantee 
the loan repayments.

COLUMN ONE; BENEATH THE NOT SO SILENT SEA; BIG SHIPS, OIL EXPLORATION MAKE THE 
OCEAN SO NOISY THAT SOME RESEARCHERS SAY BIG SUR LOUDSPEAKER TEST WOULDN'T MAKE 
MUCH DIFFERENCE. CRITICS FEAR WHALES, OTHER CREATURES ALREADY ARE AT RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget the notion of the silent deep. The ocean of today is a noisy place 
filled with the sound of human activity -- an aquatic wilderness that is 
becoming urbanized. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge cargo ships make a tremendous subsurface racket; some supertankers are so 
loud they can be heard underwater a full day before they appear on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the continental shelf, the rhythmic pounding of seismic air guns used in 
oil exploration can travel hundreds of miles. Even louder are explosions during 
offshore construction and naval weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a silent sea. It's a cacophony," said Darlene Ketten, a Harvard 
Medical School specialist in marine mammals and hearing. "The ocean is a 
phenomenally noisy environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial, military and scientific use of the ocean has reached such a pitch 
that some scientists and whale lovers worry that human noise pollution may 
threaten the well-being of marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent proposal to study global warming by repeatedly transmitting a loud, 
low-frequency rumble across the Pacific Ocean has aroused public concern that 
the din would disturb whales, dolphins and other animals highly dependent on 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the scientific community, the experiment has touched off a heated 
debate over how much ocean noise is too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists say human-made noise could endanger an entire ocean ecosystem 
that depends on sound, driving animals from their habitats and making it harder 
for members of a species to locate each other and reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a bunch of whale-huggers who are upset about losing a few 
whales," said Sylvia Earle, the former chief scientist at the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration and a critic of the ocean sound tests. "The 
issue is a much more profound question of what the impact of large pulses of 
sound on the ecosystem may be." 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists, including those who support the global warming experiment, 
argue that marine animals have adapted well to loud natural sounds -- such as 
underwater volcanoes and cracking polar ice -- and would not be unduly 
disturbed by the loud rumble from the global warming experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very tiny addition to the background noise created by the 
international shipping fleet," contended Andrew Forbes, deputy director of the 
sound experiment. "We're not contributing even as much disturbance to the upper 
ocean as a single ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Between natural and human-made sounds, a constant buzz of background noise 
drones through most parts of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quietest regions -- areas of the South Pacific where there is little 
human activity -- the typical background noise of wind and waves is 80 
decibels. This is about the same as the sound level in the desert on a quiet 
night. By contrast, many human sources of ocean noise exceed 180 decibels -- 
including supertankers and explosions -- a level 10 billion times louder since 
the decibel scale is geometric. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwater, sound is the most efficient means of communication for both man 
and beasts. Sound travels five times faster in water than in the air and can 
carry across an entire ocean through what scientists call the deep sound 
channels -- regions about 3,000 feet deep where temperatures and intense 
pressure combine to guide sound waves over great distances. Navy submarines 
have long used the sound channels to talk to each other and spy on enemy subs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to communicate anything in the ocean, you're going to do it 
by sound," said John Potter, a marine acoustics specialist at the Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. "It's the natural mechanism for the 
transfer of information in the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as people rely primarily on sight, marine creatures depend on hearing to 
navigate, communicate and hunt. Now, scientists are discovering that some of 
the largest whales use sophisticated sonar in the same low-frequency range of 
most noise pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant blue whale emits a deep, loud call that can travel great distances 
through the deep sound channels, bouncing off land masses hundreds of miles 
away, said Christopher Clark, a Cornell University marine biologist who has 
been hired to study how the global warming experiment may affect marine 
mammals. Similarly, he said, finback whales systematically probe their 
surroundings with rhythmic sound pulses. 
</P>
<P>
 But so little is known about these creatures that scientists cannot say for 
sure how they are affected by the noise of humans, particularly the cumulative 
effect of low-frequency sounds. No one is certain, for example, how deep most 
whales dive, what range of frequencies they hear or even how many whales there 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 "This dearth of scientific evidence makes it virtually impossible to predict 
the effects of low-frequency sound on marine mammals. . . ," concluded a recent 
study by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwater explosions, fishing nets and collisions with large ships claim the 
lives of many marine mammals each year. But Earle and other scientists worry 
that the effects of ocean noise are more insidious. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests done earlier by researchers off Monterey show that migrating gray whales 
will alter their course to avoid an underwater sound source of 120 decibels or 
more. Another study indicates that some whales can suffer temporary hearing 
loss when exposed to sounds as low as 150 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 Supertankers are the largest human-made source of ocean noise, according to 
the National Research Council study. These ships can produce low-frequency 
sounds of up to 232 decibels -- equivalent in the air to a military jet. Some 
shipping noise enters the deep sound channels and carries for long distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kraus, associate scientist at the New England Aquarium in Boston, said 
rising noise levels may help explain why 30% of all right whale deaths in the 
North Atlantic result from collisions with ships. These slow-moving whales may 
have become used to the sound of shipping traffic and have difficulty picking 
out the sound of individual ships bearing down on them until it is too late, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the shipping industry, however, was surprised that anyone was 
even questioning vessel noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do they want, no ships in the ocean?" asked Ernest Corrado, president of 
the American Institute of Maritime Shipping, which represents most of the 
nation's major shipping companies. "We have water pollution, air pollution -- 
the latest thing was our ballast water. Noise pollution? That's a whole new 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Even louder than individual supertankers are the seismic exploration ships 
that search for oil deposits by firing air guns every 10 or 20 seconds at the 
ocean floor. The guns, which simultaneously release bursts of air bubbles, can 
reach 240 decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists who monitor acoustic activity in the ocean with hydrophones say 
they can hear the repeated firing of air guns as far as 500 miles away. 
"Frankly, that would drive me nuts," said Potter, who has spent many research 
hours listening to the air guns booming away. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil industry officials, however, say studies have found no evidence the noise 
harms marine life. Whales that don't like the sound can avoid areas where 
survey ships are operating, said Jeff Wilson, a spokesman for the Western 
States Petroleum Assn. Air guns, he noted, are an improvement over the days 
when dynamite was used. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that air guns used in marine geophysical surveys injure 
or disturb whales," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the loudest ocean noises is the sound of blasting during construction 
of piers and other marine facilities. In 1992, at least two humpback whales off 
Newfoundland were killed in an explosion during pier construction. Ketten, the 
Harvard expert, examined the whales after they became entangled in fishing nets 
and found they had suffered from severe ear trauma, including shredded eardrums 
and crushed ear bones, that would have deafened them. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists also said the explosions -- later calculated to have reached 296 
decibels -- may have caused other humpback whales to suffer hearing loss, 
impairing their ability to detect obstacles; after the blasting began, 
fishermen in the area noticed a sudden increase in the number of humpbacks 
snared in their nets. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1972 federal law designed to protect marine mammals requires the National 
Marine Fisheries Service to issue permits for the incidental harassment of 
whales. But the Navy, shipping and commercial fishing are largely exempt from 
the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since World War II, the Navy has conducted weapons tests -- such as ship shock 
tests off the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary using 10,000-pound 
bombs -- and high-decibel acoustic experiments in the ocean under a cloak of 
secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, with the end of the Cold War and a growing emphasis on research for 
civilian purposes, are such tests becoming public. The global warming 
experiment is one of the first to go through the process of obtaining a federal 
permit for harassment of marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial plan to take the ocean's temperature with underwater sound 
waves is the brainchild of Walter Munk, one of the world's leading physical 
oceanographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 75, he has worked with the Navy on and off since World War II, when he 
correctly predicted the magnitude of waves for Allied invasions of North Africa 
and Normandy. Later, he assisted the Navy by analyzing how Bikini Island 
nuclear weapons tests affected the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, Munk has worked on mapping the sea through acoustic 
tomography -- a sort of ocean CAT scan using 185-decibel sounds transmitted 
over distances of 600 miles to learn about temperature, tides and currents. 
</P>
<P>
 Munk, based at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said he developed the idea 
of using sound to study ocean temperatures after hearing how a scientist 
dropped dynamite into the ocean near Australia and picked up sound of the 
explosion off Bermuda. "Using sound in the ocean, if done properly, is a most 
powerful tool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since sound travels faster in warmer water, Munk hopes to measure average deep 
sea temperature changes of as little as one five-thousandth of a degree across 
the Pacific basin. If the study shows the thermometer rising, he said, it could 
provide clear evidence of global warming and help governments plan how to 
reduce the atmospheric carbon gases believed responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial $35-million, two-year experiment is sponsored by the Defense 
Department, which will have access to all the data for military use, such as 
improving submarine surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 Munk and his colleagues have applied for federal permits to place loudspeakers 
about 3,000 feet deep on the ocean floor off Big Sur and the Hawaiian island of 
Kauai. These would transmit low-frequency, coded signals of up to 195 decibels 
across the Pacific. A hearing on the California permit is set for May 16 in 
Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the speakers might not be as loud as air guns or some supertankers, 
test sponsors acknowledge they would produce the dominant human-made sound in 
the regions where they are placed -- the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary 
and a breeding area for humpback whales off Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Munk said he has tried to use the softest noise possible, noting the signal 
would be so faint when it reaches New Zealand it must be plucked out of the 
background noise by high-tech Navy listening gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists agree that any effect on animals will occur near the loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Within about 500 feet of the speakers, project scientists estimate, the sound 
will remain at 150 decibels or above, potentially loud enough to cause 
temporary hearing loss in some whales. But they say it is highly unlikely any 
animals would stay within that range long enough to affect their hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 For 18 miles in all directions, however, the volume would be at least 120 
decibels -- the level known to produce an aversion response among gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
 Off Big Sur, the oceanographers estimate that as many as 677,000 marine 
mammals, including a number of endangered species, live in or would pass 
through that circle of sound and could be disturbed by the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the experiment, Munk has brought in leading marine mammal 
researchers to see how the noise affects key indicator species, such as 
humpback whales and the deep-diving elephant seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers will monitor a sample of these animals from land and from 
airplanes at least 1,000 feet above the water. They want to see if the 
creatures alter their behavior when the sound is on. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, the Cornell marine biologist, insists the animal-watchers will be able 
to determine whether the sound is disruptive. And Munk promises to halt or 
modify the test if they discover the noise is harming animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say the effort is flawed because insufficient data has been 
gathered ahead of time about the normal behavior of these species. And, they 
say, it will be hard to see from the air or the coast what effect the noise has 
on creatures that spend their lives underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative, some critics have called for non-invasive methods of 
measuring ocean temperatures, such as using large numbers of thermometers that 
could be monitored by satellite. At the very least, they say, the loudspeakers 
should be moved to locations with fewer marine mammals and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "To those who say it doesn't matter, I say it matters to all of us," Earle 
said. "The ocean is being subjected to many stresses. We don't know what the 
outcome of our actions may be on the ocean ecosystem, but it is not likely to 
be in our best interest to disrupt things unnecessarily." Sounding Off 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists worry that the addition of new human noises to the ocean may 
disturb marine creatures that are highly dependent on sound. Because scientists 
use different starting points to measure sound in water and in air, the decibel 
scale for underwater sound begins at 61.5 decibels, instead of zero. The 
decibel scale is geometric, so an increase of 10 decibels signifies a sound 
that is 10 times louder, an increase of of 20 is 100 times louder. Here are 
some typical peak levels for low-frequency sound sources in the ocean: 
</P>
<P>
 Background noise in quiet ocean far from shipping: 80 db 
</P>
<P>
 Background noise in ccoastal region near shipping: 105 db 
</P>
<P>
 The point at which a whale would head away from the sound: 120 db 
</P>
<P>
 Small motorboat: 135 db 
</P>
<P>
 Ice noises in polar region: 140-155 db 
</P>
<P>
 Whale vocalizations: 150-195 db 
</P>
<P>
 The global warming sound test loudspeaker: 195 db 
</P>
<P>
 Geophysical phenomena (earthquakes, volcanoes): 160-240 db 
</P>
<P>
 Large ships and supertankers: 170-230 db 
</P>
<P>
 Large underwater explosion: 250-295 db

GNATCATCHER TAKEN OFF THREATENED SPECIES LIST; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS FAILURE TO 
DISCLOSE DATA WAS IMPROPER. RULING MAY OPEN DOOR TO ORANGE COUNTY DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In what environmentalists termed a significant setback to protection of 
imperiled species, a federal court in Washington Monday vacated the Department 
of the Interior's listing of the California gnatcatcher as threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, in a lawsuit filed in 1992 by the Southern California Building 
Industry Assn. and Orange County's tollway agencies, leaves the habitat of the 
tiny songbird -- mostly coastal sage scrub in Orange and San Diego counties -- 
exposed to the plans of developers who are eager to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the developers who have fought the Department of the Interior's decision 
to list the gnatcatcher as threatened and the environmentalists who have tried 
to ensure its protection agreed that the implications of the ruling by Judge 
Stanley Sporkin could be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge victory," said Rob Thornton, attorney for the Orange County 
Transportation Corridor Agencies. "The court obviously vindicated our position 
. . . which was that there was a significant question about the scientific 
merits of the study upon which the listing was based." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton said the ruling "effectively repudiates" what he called the efforts 
of environmentalists "to illegitimately twist the Endangered Species Act into a 
tool for stopping development in general, and specifically halting construction 
of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor" in the coastal hills of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Reynolds, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
which had petitioned the Interior Department to list the gnatcatcher as 
threatened, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely a step in the wrong direction, one that could have a 
devastating impact on the habitat planning program" to protect endangered 
species, Reynolds said. "The listing of the gnatcatcher is the foundation upon 
which the conservation efforts in Southern California have been based." 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt declined to comment in 
detail before studying the decision but suggested that an appeal was likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the information we have indicates that the California gnatcatcher 
meets the criteria for listing under the Endangered Species Act," Babbitt said. 
"We will therefore take the steps necessary to guarantee its protection." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision centered narrowly on the openness of the process involved 
in the Interior Department's March, 1993, decision to list the gnatcatcher as 
threatened under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit, the builders raised three issues: that they were denied 
access to the raw data for a report that the government used to conclude that 
the California gnatcatcher was a unique species whose declining population 
warranted a listing under the Endangered Species Act, that Babbitt acted with 
bias in reaching the listing decision, and that certain procedural requirements 
of the Endangered Species Act were not followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that the last two points lacked merit, but he agreed that the 
Interior Department was wrong when it declined to make the raw scientific data 
available to ornithologists hired by the builders to challenge the government's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 What the builders had sought were the scientific notes and calculations of 
Jonathan L. Atwood, a Massachusetts ornithologist who had spent several years 
studying California gnatcatchers. He compared various characteristics of the 
tiny songbirds, such as the size of their bills and the lengths of their tails 
and toes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Atwood wrote a scientific paper in which he concluded that the 
California gnatcatchers were essentially no different from the gnatcatchers 
found in large portions of Mexico and the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After this paper was severely criticized by other scientists, Atwood went back 
to his data, and wrote in a 1990 report that his first conclusions were wrong 
and that the California gnatcatchers were indeed distinct from the Mexican 
birds. Atwoods' 1990 report was the primary scientific evidence that the 
government relied upon in listing the gnatcatcher as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the fact that (Atwood) had analyzed the identical raw data in 
1988 and 1990 and had come to different conclusions," the court ruling said, 
the scientific validity of the second study was challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Building Industry Assn. demanded access to the raw data that Atwood used 
to reach his conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department declined to provide the data, saying it did not have 
the information and that it had relied solely on the finished 1990 report. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said the Interior Department was wrong. "Where an agency relies upon 
data to come to a rule-making decision, it generally has an obligation under 
the Administrative Procedures Act to provide such data for public inspection," 
the ruling said. California Gnatcatcher 
</P>
<P>
 The California gnatcatcher is found on sagebrush mesas and dry coastal slopes. 
It has a distinctive call, a rising and falling kitten-like mew. Only about 4.5 
inches in length, the gnatcatcher is blue-gray on top, with lighter-colored 
feathers underneath, and has a longish black tail.SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

L.A. COUNTY ASSESSOR SUED OVER MAILINGS TO OPPONENT; COURTS: KENNETH P. HAHN 
ADMITS SENDING UNSIGNED NOTES TO MAN HE UNSEATED. HE CALLS THE MATERIAL A JOKE. 
</P>

<P>
 In politics, there's nothing new about sore losers. But county Assessor 
Kenneth P. Hahn stands accused of being a sore winner. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strange twist to his upset victory at the polls four years ago, Hahn is 
being sued by former Los Angeles County Assessor John Lynch, who says he has 
been repeatedly harassed with weird mailings since being unseated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, no relation to former county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, acknowledges in a 
sworn deposition that he sent a half-dozen notes and bogus applications to 
Lynch's home since Hahn's election to the $151,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the mail Hahn sent anonymously to Lynch's home was an employment 
agency application on which Hahn scrawled: "John, you're a loser, always were 
-- always will be. Use this to get a new career." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the brightest thing I've done," Hahn said in an interview, adding 
that he has apologized to Lynch. "It was a practical joke. I thought he'd just 
crumple them (the mail) up and throw them in the trash can. . . . I thought 
that would be the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn defended his actions by saying they were no worse than tactics employed 
by Lynch when he was assessor and Hahn was a deputy in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lynch, he says Hahn's actions are, at best, "unbecoming of an elected 
official. . . . What's with this guy? He won, and now he's mad at me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch filed suit last June, after handwriting experts helped him establish 
that Hahn was the source of the mailings. The Los Angeles Superior Court 
complaint alleges that Hahn "committed a series of acts with the objective of 
deliberately and repeatedly harassing, humiliating, embarrassing, injuring and 
invading the privacy" of Lynch and his wife. "Such acts include . . . 
anonymously sending offensive correspondence to plaintiffs' home, forging the 
name of John Lynch and falsely submitting John Lynch's name and address as a 
purported client to various vendors." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch is seeking compensation for his alleged suffering and an order by the 
court to keep Hahn away. He has further asked that Hahn and the county be 
forced to turn over telephone records to see if the assessor is responsible for 
scores of menacing phones calls that Lynch says he has received. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn has admitted under oath to making only one phone call to Lynch's home. 
But Lynch says such an acknowledgment is like pleading that you are "a little 
bit pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn has responded to the suit by contending that, while he did send the 
offending mail, there has been no damage to Lynch and that there is no basis 
for a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalating legal battle is just the latest in a series of personal tangles 
between the two dating back to the mid-1980s, when Lynch first ran for assessor 
and Hahn was backing a rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Their feud is certain to spill over into other, more public venues as Hahn and 
Lynch prepare to face off again at the polls. Both have joined a crowded field 
of 15 candidates running in the June 7 primary election for the obscure but 
important post of county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County assessor, one of only three officials elected 
countywide, oversees the largest property-taxing jurisdiction in the nation in 
terms of land value. The assessor, with a staff of 1,800 employees and an 
annual budget of $85 million, is responsible for determining tax bills for 2.2 
million commercial and residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn's campaign consultant, Harvey Englander, said the allegations and the 
lawsuit are purely political. "Lynch has blown this out of proportion," 
Englander said. "He filed (the lawsuit) when he started running for 
(reelection)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, meanwhile, says Hahn has only himself to blame. "He forced me to do 
this," said Lynch, who was particularly angry about receiving a Great 
Expectations dating service application after Hahn had put Lynch's name on a 
request. "My wife . . . feels this guy is trying to break up our marriage by 
signing my name to the dating service (application)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said his wife, Eulalia, has had to seek medical treatment for stress and 
tension as a result of the mail and repeated late-night phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Hahn's mailings appear more whimsical than overtly threatening. In 
one, Hahn sent a copy of his office newsletter, in which he is depicted in a 
drawing as Santa Claus in a space ship. Across the page Hahn scribbled: "Thanks 
for the pay raise Ace! You made it easy to be elected to My office." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch acknowledges there is a political side to his battle with Hahn, which he 
has been discussing in news releases. "This is about character and competence," 
Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, however, also has a reputation for volatility. During his term in 
office, he made headlines by throwing county auditors out of his office and was 
accused of assaulting an employee during a heated argument over the employee's 
union activities. Lynch denied the assault allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The personality clash between Hahn and Lynch dates to 1986, when Hahn says 
Lynch threatened him during an argument over a bumper sticker that Hahn 
displayed in support of a candidate running against Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn also alleges that after being elected in 1986, Lynch would "gaze 
menacingly at me" whenever the two met and that Lynch attempted to derail a 
promotion Hahn was expecting. Hahn did receive the promotion as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn challenged Lynch in the 1990 election, and in a fluke that many political 
analysts attributed to his having the same name as the hugely popular 
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, won in an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 The duel between Lynch and Hahn is not likely to end anytime soon. As their 
actions have shown, the outcome of the June election will probably not settle 
the score, regardless of who wins. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle is just as uncertain. So far, Judge Kathryn Doi Todd has 
ruled that she "cannot conclude that . . . the allegations do not constitute 
extreme and outrageous conduct." But then, she has not ruled that they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Hahn's mailings are found to be harassment, Todd warned in one 
procedural ruling, Lynch will likely be entitled to nothing.

JOYOUS MANDELA CLAIMS VICTORY: 'FREE AT LAST!'; SOUTH AFRICA: ANC'S COMMANDING 
LEAD WILL MAKE HIM THE NATION'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT. TOWNSHIP STREETS ARE 
FILLED WITH POOR BLACKS CELEBRATING THEIR LIBERATION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela, the enduring symbol of the anti-apartheid struggle and the 
inspiration of a nation, claimed victory Monday night in South Africa's first 
free elections and urged both blacks and whites in this divided land to "loudly 
proclaim from the rooftops -- free at last!" 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional speech before an ecstatic crowd, the silver-haired leader of 
the African National Congress called the success of his political and racial 
revolution "a joyous night for the human spirit" and urged his still-stunned 
country to "celebrate the birth of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am your servant," Mandela told a hotel ballroom packed with cheering 
supporters, many of whom were hunted and imprisoned as terrorists, saboteurs 
and enemies of the state by the racist white rulers in Pretoria less than five 
years ago. "I stand before you humbled by your courage, with a heart full of 
love for all of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, 75, was hoarse from a cold, and his face appeared puffy. He said his 
doctor had ordered him to rest for two days and use his voice sparingly. "I 
hope you will not disclose to him that I did not obey his instructions," he 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
 But he finished his speech with a beaming grin and returned a few moments 
later to perform an impromptu dance on the stage as a majestic choir sang his 
praises and the crowd ululated and swayed to the irresistible African rhythm. 
Balloons in the ANC colors -- black, yellow and green -- cascaded from the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to the side, even the hotel kitchen workers, the black men and women in 
blue uniforms who had prepared a lavish buffet and served a champagne toast, 
suddenly emerged from a side door and danced with glee. 
</P>
<P>
 And soon the township streets of Soweto and Alexandra, where millions of poor 
blacks have finally won the vote and their liberation, were filled with 
celebrating crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only about half the ballots have been counted, Mandela's ANC has 
taken a commanding lead after last week's unexpectedly peaceful elections. 
Mandela is to be elected president by the new National Assembly on Friday in 
Cape Town and formally inaugurated as the nation's first black president next 
Tuesday morning in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The current president, Frederik W. de Klerk, will officially step down then, 
and the formal transfer of power from the white minority to the black majority 
will be complete. De Klerk will work as one of two vice presidents under 
Mandela, a fitting symbol of the titanic shift of authority here after 3 1/2 
centuries of white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk conceded defeat early Monday evening in a gracious speech that 
offered "congratulations, good wishes and prayers" for his rival. "I hold out 
my hand to Mr. Mandela in friendship and cooperation," he told several hundred 
supporters, many of them weeping, at his party offices in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk pledged to continue the policies of reconciliation that led him to 
release Mandela from 27 years in prison in February, 1990, to help dismantle 
the institutions of apartheid and to begin the negotiations that led to 
universal suffrage and last week's historic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last four years, we have proved that we can work together," De 
Klerk said of Mandela. "Despite our differences, our relationship has become a 
symbol of the ability of South Africans from widely different backgrounds to 
cooperate in the national interest. This spirit will be essential to the 
success of the government of national unity." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, who shared last year's Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela, tried to 
reassure the whites who still make up the bulk of his once-all-white party's 
support. "Just as we could not rule South Africa without the support of the ANC 
and its supporters, no government will be able to rule South Africa without the 
support of the people and the institutions that I represent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that the country finally has a government that represents its 40 
million people. "After so many centuries, all South Africans are now free," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 46% of the estimated 22.7 million votes counted since Saturday 
morning, the ANC had 63.5% of the tally to 23.2% for De Klerk's National Party. 
Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party was a distant 
third with 5.9%, followed by the white-supremacist Freedom Front at 2.8%. Other 
parties divided the remainder of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC appeared likely to win eight of the nine new provinces, in some areas 
capturing more than 80% of the vote. After an especially bitter local race, the 
National Party held a strong lead over the ANC in the Western Cape region 
around Cape Town. The province has a majority of mixed-race Colored voters, and 
the National Party successfully played on their fears of black rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC trailed Inkatha in KwaZulu and surrounding Natal province in early 
returns, but votes from ANC strongholds in urban townships around Durban had 
yet to come in. ANC officials predicted they would win the volatile province, 
still ruled under a state of emergency, although with a much closer margin than 
they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, it was still possible the ANC would reach its stated goal of winning 
two-thirds of the vote. It had hoped to gain a clear constitutional majority in 
the 400-member National Assembly to write a permanent post-apartheid 
constitution without compromising with other parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not have done as well as we hoped, but that is how democracy 
functions," said Mandela, who was introduced as "Comrade President," a jarring 
holdover from the ANC's Marxist past. "There should be no tensions in any 
regions in which we have not emerged as the majority party." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela sought to reach out to his opponents, promising to work closely with 
De Klerk and other political leaders. Over the last four years, he said, he and 
De Klerk have "worked together, quarreled, addressed sensitive problems and at 
the end of our heated exchanges were able to shake hands and to drink coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he mentioned the names of leaders of several smaller parties, he 
pointedly omitted any reference to Buthelezi. The temperamental Zulu chief 
joined the elections on April 19 only after months of threats to boycott it and 
spiraling political violence involving rival members of Inkatha and the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela indicated he may offer a seat in his 27-member Cabinet to the radical 
black Pan-Africanist Congress, which thus far has won less than 2% of the vote. 
Under the power-sharing formula, a party must win at least 5% to join the 
government. But Mandela seemed willing to make an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have suffered together with us," he said. "I was in jail with many of 
them. We suffered together in the battlefield, and it has hurt me a great deal 
that they should not be able to make the threshold which other parties have 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mandela also warned the other political parties that he is committed to 
his campaign's ambitious five-year platform to build houses, create jobs and 
boost education, health and social programs. "If there are attempts on the part 
of anybody to undermine that program, there will be serious tensions in the 
government of national unity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela reserved his greatest praise for the millions of voters who stood for 
hours in lines last week, enduring endless administrative foul-ups, to cast 
their ballots in a national rite of passage so cathartic -- or at least so 
distracting -- that crime and political violence ceased for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most important moments in the life of our country," he 
said. "I stand before you filled with deep pride and joy in the ordinary, 
humble people of this country." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd cheered, he added, "Now is the time to heal the old wounds and to 
build a new South Africa." Election Tally

KEVORKIAN IS ACQUITTED FOR ROLE IN SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Kevorkian was acquitted Monday in the first jury test of Michigan's 
assisted-suicide ban by a panel that decided the law allows attempts to relieve 
pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the verdict, Wayne County Prosecuting Atty. John D. O'Hair said 
he does not intend to prosecute any more alleged violations of the law, at 
least until the state Court of Appeals or the Legislature provide further 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court is reviewing the ban, which expires in November. The 
Legislature is supposed to consider how to address the assisted-suicide issue 
by then. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury started its deliberations Thursday by holding hands and standing to 
pray, members said Monday. Then the nine women and three men cried, argued 
bitterly and traded stories about their own experiences with the terminally 
ill. After 9 1/2 hours over three days they finally agreed that Kevorkian's 
only motive in helping 30-year-old Thomas Hyde kill himself last August was to 
ease the young man's battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative 
nerve disorder, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision in the Hyde case is a decision that the Legislature cannot 
ignore," said O'Hair. The prosecutor has been a vocal member of a citizens 
commission advising the Legislature. He has proposed allowing 
physician-assisted suicide under strict conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hair said he brought charges against Kevorkian, 65, "because I do believe 
that the law should be respected and honored." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "It's going to be difficult to obtain convictions in these extreme 
cases. Those who feel strongly opposed to decriminalization should really take 
note that you're still going to have an assisted suicide that is condoned." 
With the current confusion, he said, he would only bring a case involving 
"patent abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, who has attended 20 suicides since 1990 -- five since the ban took 
effect last year -- said he expects physicians now to step forward and publicly 
support assisted suicide and help him set guidelines for the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not rule out helping to end another life in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey N. Fieger, said the verdict "drives a stake 
through (the ban's) heart." Three other trial judges have dismissed similar 
charges against Kevorkian, holding the ban unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian is collecting signatures for a statewide ballot measure to guarantee 
constitutionally the right to assist the ending of intolerable pain by ending 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, prosecutors and jurors alike pleaded for a clear policy from the 
state's judicial and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a Court of Appeals that's been sitting on this case for four 
months," said Timothy Kenny, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let somebody else decide. It's not for me," said juror Gail Donaldson, a 
42-year-old visiting nurse who said she believes suicide is wrong but that a 
loophole in the law as written permitted Kevorkian to act. 
</P>
<P>
 She and the others accepted Fieger's interpretation of a subsection in the 
statute that the ban does not apply when medication or procedures are 
administered "to relieve pain and suffering and not to cause death" -- even if 
the death may be hastened. Kenny argued that the wording was intended to 
protect doctors prescribing experimental drugs or methods. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement from Washington, the National Right to Life Committee condemned 
the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many disabled and terminally ill people who may now be coerced into 
using assisted suicide," said Rhonda Franz, committee president. "Instead, 
society should offer them alternatives to suicide to show them we value their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 During five days of testimony, Hyde's brother and fiancee described the toll 
that the disease had taken on the former landscaper and construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions peaked when Hyde appeared on videotape, recorded during his first 
counseling session with Kevorkian 34 days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde could barely swallow. His left arm hung useless and he struggled to move 
his right. He smiled and grimaced involuntarily. He spent minutes choking out a 
phrase. "I want to end it," he finally was able to explain. "I want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 At least three jurors wept openly. The electrician who would be elected jury 
foreman shielded his face with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought back memories," said Donaldson, who cared for a dying sister and 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing arguments, Fieger asked the jury: "What kind of people are we that 
we would treat Thomas Hyde worse than a pet . . . that we would say to Thomas 
Hyde: 'You must choke to death on your own spit?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, however, he also tried a surprise gambit, announcing that 
Hyde did not die on the island park in Detroit, where Kevorkian surrendered to 
police, but in a parking lot behind Kevorkian's apartment in neighboring 
Oakland County. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde had inhaled carbon monoxide from a canister while lying on a mattress in 
the back of a van. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Recorder's Court Judge Thomas E. Jackson instructed jurors to acquit 
Kevorkian if the prosecutor had not proved Hyde had died in Wayne County. 
</P>
<P>
 If geography had been the pivotal reason for the acquittal, O'Hair said, "this 
decision would have been meaningless." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian himself was unhappy with the tactic. "Do you think I didn't want to 
confront this travesty of a law?" he snapped during a break in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Location was much discussed but not a serious factor in the decision, three 
jurors said in courtroom interviews after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to the way the law was worded," Gwen Bryson, 51, said. 
</P>
<P>
 One holdout wanted to convict Kevorkian until the jury asked for a copy of the 
law and went over its language, Donaldson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson said she thought the jury's makeup -- five were employed in 
nursing-related occupations -- helped determine the outcome. She is a certified 
nursing assistant and often works with elderly patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of suffering," she said.

GRACE MARKS CONCESSION BY DE KLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the beginning, many blacks and whites doubted Frederik W. de Klerk's 
promises. How, they asked, could this white man, this scion of an Afrikaner 
family who helped maintain apartheid, put an end to the system of racial 
separation? 
</P>
<P>
 But no doubters were left in South Africa on Monday, when De Klerk, 
misty-eyed, his voice choking slightly, conceded to Nelson Mandela, the African 
National Congress leader whom he released from prison four years ago. And, with 
the grace and pragmatism that have been his hallmark, De Klerk wished the new 
leader well in one of South Africa's most historic speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top of the hill," De 
Klerk told a quiet gathering of his supporters in words that were broadcast 
live across this country. "A traveler would sit down and admire the view, but a 
man of destiny knows that beyond this hill lies another and another. The 
journey is never complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he contemplates the next hill, I hold out my hand to Mr. Mandela in 
friendship and in cooperation," De Klerk added. The president concluded by 
saying: "God bless South Africa. Nkosi Sikelele iAfrika (God Bless Africa)." 
</P>
<P>
 For South Africa, the clear victory of Mandela's ANC marked the end of 350 
years of white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But for De Klerk, a 58-year-old lawyer, it was the end of a courageous 4 
1/2-year presidential term and the beginning of a new life as an opposition 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Though criticized and threatened by many of his fellow Afrikaners, and doubted 
by many black South Africans, he played a critical role in dismantling 
apartheid and, effectively, negotiated himself out of power. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, who will officially relinquish power to Mandela at the presidential 
inauguration next Tuesday, said the election completed the program he launched 
upon his ascension. But he is by no means gone from the political scene, where 
he has flourished for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 His National Party has polled second behind the ANC, with about a fourth of 
the vote. That is good enough to land him a job as one of two executive vice 
presidents in the new government. (The ANC, by winning the election, is 
empowered to appoint the other.) 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk now will serve in the government of Mandela, with whom he shared the 
Nobel Peace Prize last year. And perhaps, he has hinted, he will begin 
preparing a campaign for the presidency in the next election, in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My political task is just beginning," De Klerk said Monday. "The past four 
years have simply been preparation for the work that lies ahead. It will be a 
great challenge to defend and nurture our new constitution . . . and ensure 
that our new democracy takes root and flourishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lodge, a political analyst in Johannesburg, said De Klerk spoke Monday 
"with grace and dignity, but also as a man who is confident that he is still an 
important figure in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk had pulled off what most thought impossible. He unlocked the chains 
of black leaders, freed black political groups and, most important, persuaded 
the majority of whites to accept an all-race democracy in a country where they 
are outnumbered 5-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk was virtually unknown when, as education minister, he was selected by 
the National Party caucus in 1989 to replace President Pieter W. Botha as party 
chief. Of two main candidates for the job, he was considered the more 
conservative and less reform-minded. But the political bookmakers were stunned 
when De Klerk quickly promised dramatic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The president's conservative credentials turned out to be invaluable in 
convincing the white electorate to follow him. "It helped him take actions that 
would be unthinkable, almost unacceptable, from somebody with a slightly more 
liberal hue," said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu. 
</P>
<P>
 F.W., as he is known by friend and foe alike, grew up in the cradle of white 
privilege on a farm a dozen miles west of Johannesburg, part of an Afrikaner 
family that settled in southern Africa in the 17th Century. Politics was more 
than dinner-table conversation in his parents' household. It was part of the 
family album. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 12 years old when the National Party came to power in 1948 and was 
still in high school when the party, citing Scripture as its moral support, set 
out to engineer a new society by legalizing racial discrimination. His father, 
Jan, joined the Cabinet in the new government and his uncle, J. G. (Hans) 
Strijdom, was the party's second prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The young De Klerk studied law at Potchefstroom University for Christian 
Higher Education, a small, all-white campus on a prairie plateau about 90 miles 
southwest of Johannesburg. He remains a deeply devout Christian and member of a 
small, politically liberal and theologically conservative Afrikaner church. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, a married father of three, took his first leap into politics in 
1972, winning the Vereeniging seat in the white Parliament. Six years later, he 
was tapped to join the Cabinet of Prime Minister B. J. Vorster. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts have tried without success to place a neat label on the 
president's ideology. As education minister, De Klerk threatened to close the 
country's universities in 1987 for allowing anti-apartheid protests. During a 
1982 party crisis, he tried to keep right-wing whites from bolting by promising 
that the government would never abandon its "own affairs," the government's 
phrase for racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did De Klerk change his mind? 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say one reason is that he was always less interested in hard-core 
political ideology and more inclined toward political pragmatism. Many of them 
describe him as nutger, or "sober-minded" in Afrikaans, the first language of 
De Klerk and the other 3 million Afrikaners. 
</P>
<P>
 And this sober-minded man came to the conclusion that compromise with the 
black majority was the only alternative to chaos and revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be those who will be frightened," De Klerk once told a group of 
Afrikaners. "But you have to understand that there are no other alternatives 
that work."

TENTATIVE OK REACHED ON DISNEY PARK; DEVELOPMENT: ACCORD ON $3-BILLION 
EXPANSION OF DISNEYLAND COMES AFTER LENGTHY TALKS BETWEEN ANAHEIM AND FIRM, 
WHICH REMAINS NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT BUILDING RESORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Capping a year of negotiations, city and Walt Disney Co. officials have 
reached a tentative agreement on the financing and timetable for development of 
a proposed $3-billion expansion of Disneyland, Anaheim officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While Disney remains noncommittal about whether it will build the resort, the 
tentative agreement was hailed as a substantial step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming," said Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the agreement still must be reviewed by lawyers for both sides, Daly 
and others declined to reveal details. But they sketched the broad outline of 
the pact hammered out last week. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * A to-be-announced increase in the 13% tax on hotel room stays, but no city 
tax increase to pay for project costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A strict schedule detailing when Disney would build certain portions of the 
resort and when the city would complete public works projects, such as 
installing sewer lines, placing utilities underground and making street 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 * A commitment by Disney to build the project before the city makes any 
financial outlay. 
</P>
<P>
 * A plan to divert future tax revenue generated from the project to pay for 
bonds floated by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * A guarantee by the city not to touch its general fund to pay for its share 
of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic deal points have been resolved, and now it's up to the attorneys to 
reduce our negotiations into writing," said Deputy City Manager Tom Wood. 
"We've overcome some major hurdles and this is clearly a major hurdle." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth P. Wong, senior vice president of Disney's development division who is 
heading the project, would not confirm Monday that a tentative agreement had 
been reached, but acknowledged: "We are making progress." 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, Disney wants to develop about 500 acres around Disneyland with 
more than 5,000 hotel rooms, a 5,000-seat amphitheater, two of the nation's 
largest parking structures and a new theme park, called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 The final issues apparently were resolved late last week when Disney agreed to 
several remaining points. 
</P>
<P>
 Once attorneys have put the tentative agreement in writing, city officials 
said it would go through an extensive review. At least two public hearings -- 
in front of the city Planning Commission and City Council -- must take place 
before the deal is approved, they said. The entire review process could take 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials cautioned that further issues could arise during the legal 
review and drafting process, forcing additional negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Disney proposed building the project four years ago, it has maintained 
that about $800 million in financial support would be needed from city, county, 
state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the project's potential economic and social benefits, including 
creation of nearly 28,000 new jobs, Gov. Pete Wilson has agreed to contribute 
$50 million worth of state transportation money for freeway off-ramps and for 
one of the parking structures. The federal government has earmarked at least 
$15.5 million and indicated it would provide a total of $131 million for the 
construction of a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved spending $32 
million toward construction of a parking garage. The California Department of 
Transportation and the county also decided in February to go ahead with $50 
million in new freeway off-ramps to support the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the agreement is expected to go smoothly through the Planning 
Commission and City Council, but one group of homeowners has said it plans to 
try to stop the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Anaheim Home Owners Maintaining Their Environment group said they 
will circulate a petition seeking to give Anaheim voters final say on any 
agreement between the city and Disney on the project's financing. 
</P>
<P>
 To put such a referendum on a ballot, the group must gather signatures from 
10% of the city's registered voters within 30 days of the agreement's approval 
by the council, said Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White.

EXPLOSIVES LEFT BEHIND DELAY MILITARY BASE CONVERSIONS; WEAPONS: AT LEAST FIVE 
CALIFORNIA FACILITIES ARE PLAGUED WITH UNEXPLODED MUNITIONS RESULTING FROM 
DECADES OF TARGET PRACTICE. TRANSFER OF THE PROPERTIES TO PUBLIC USE COULD BE 
STYMIED FOR YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Widespread contamination of military bases with unexploded hand grenades, land 
mines and other munitions is delaying conversion of bases to civilian use and 
could cost taxpayers billions of dollars to clean up, government officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexploded ordnance, left over from decades of military target practice, poses 
such a safety threat that large tracts of land transferred to public use will 
remain closed off for years, experts testified at a hearing of the House 
Natural Resources Committee in Seaside. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five California bases slated for closure are plagued with unexploded 
munitions, including nearby Ft. Ord, where at least 8,000 acres of coastal land 
will have to be set aside indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue that's been kept very quiet because it's been in the 
military's hands," said Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), committee chairman. 
"All of a sudden, we have a major contamination problem on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 600 military bases nationwide are strewn with unexploded ordnance, 
said Lewis D. Walker, a deputy assistant secretary of defense. For bases that 
are being closed, the problem of removing live munitions looms as large and as 
costly as cleaning up toxic contamination, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't hide from the fact that many of these projectiles have our markings 
on them," Walker said. "We can't hide from our responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Since World War II, the armed forces have trained soldiers and tested weapons 
by firing vast quantities of ammunition onto target ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the ordnance exploded. On impact, some shells became lodged many 
feet deep, then began slowly working their way to the surface as a result of 
soil erosion or vibration. 
</P>
<P>
 When the military transfers a site to the public, it sweeps the surface to 
remove unexploded ordnance. But years later, live ammunition can appear and 
pose a danger. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, two 8-year-old San Diego boys were killed when they discovered a live 
shell in a canyon near their suburban housing tract, the site of a former 
military base. It exploded when one of the boys banged it on a rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of acres are contaminated with ordnance, including munitions from 
pistols, rifles and artillery, as well as bombs from naval, aerial and ground 
bombardment," Miller said. "The potential use of these lands is clearly limited 
if unexploded ordnance remains." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has no solid estimate of how much land on the bases marked for 
closure is contaminated with unexploded ordnance, Walker said. But of the 22 
California bases to be shut down, the most serious problem is at Ft. Ord, near 
the site of the committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wang of the California Environmental Protection Agency testified that it 
would cost $800 million to remove live ammunition up to 10 feet deep just at 
Ft. Ord. Even then, he said, the base's 8,000-acre target range would not be 
completely clean because some ordnance would remain embedded as deep as 20 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army training base since World War I, Ft. Ord will be closed in October. 
Part of the 28,000-acre base will be turned over to the California State 
University system for a new campus that will open in fall, 1995. Army officials 
insist that live munitions will not pose a threat to students because the 
campus will not be located on any part of the target range. 
</P>
<P>
 The target range will be permanently set aside as part of a wildlife habitat 
to be administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The Army plans to clean 
unexploded ordnance from the site over a 10-year period, working slowly to 
minimize disturbances to such endangered species as Smith's butterfly and the 
legless lizard that managed to survive years of bombardment, said Col. Tom 
Ellzey, base commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Other California bases scheduled to be closed that are contaminated with 
unexploded ordnance include Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, Sacramento 
Army Depot, Treasure Island Naval Station and the Presidio in San Francisco, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main problem in dealing with the munitions is that the technology for 
locating ordnance is very primitive. Despite the use of radar, sonar and 
surveillance air, no cheap and reliable method has been developed for locating 
live shells. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, newly developed weapons programmed to explode when they sense certain 
sound frequencies or the presence of metal can be especially difficult to 
disarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said some former target ranges may be kept off limits for decades 
until the technology is developed to locate and destroy live munitions cheaply. 
 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10 million acres of onetime target ranges transferred to the 
Department of the Interior are potentially contaminated with unexploded 
ordnance, testified David Nawi, the department's solicitor for the Pacific 
Southwest region. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these lands are very remote and the cost of cleanup -- sometimes more 
than $100,000 an acre -- is more than the land is worth, he said. To prevent 
injuries or fatalities, the department restricts access or provides no services 
in areas where munitions may surface. 
</P>
<P>
 This includes property administered by the Bureau of Land Management and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Unexploded bombs, which have a tendency to skip 
when they hit the ground and travel considerable distances, are also scattered 
on Native American lands near bombing ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the problem of unexploded ordnance has become greater in 
California with increasing demand for land. "Our changing defense needs lend 
greater urgency to our search for successful ordnance cleanup technologies," he 
said.

HELP TO BE ASKED IN PROBE OF CHIEF'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mayor said Monday that he will ask Mexican federal police to join the 
investigation of last week's assassination of the city's police chief, which he 
said appears to be the work of organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 At an emergency meeting in which the City Council approved the designation of 
a former judge as the new chief of police, Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime said there 
has been little progress in the murder of Jose Federico Benitez Lopez and his 
bodyguard during a highway ambush Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the killers used machine gun-type weapons, Osuna said he will ask the 
governor of Baja California to request the intervention of the federal judicial 
police. Federal authorities investigate crimes involving drugs and illegal 
heavy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are activities of organized crime, we feel, and it should be the 
federal authorities who investigate," Osuna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mayor said it is not clear whether the city's powerful drug 
cartels were involved, he said of Benitez's murder: "We know that, perhaps 
without realizing it, we came into contact with very powerful interests." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's comments reinforced reports from law enforcement officials on both 
sides of the border who say Benitez was apparently killed in retaliation for 
anti-drug operations by the municipal police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform-minded chief was cut down by seven shots from a passing 
four-wheel-drive vehicle as he drove home. Seven suspects were arrested, but 
six were released and the seventh is being held on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The state judicial police are investigating Benitez's death because homicide 
is a violation of state law. In an interview Monday, state police Cmdr. Jorge 
Alvarez Barriere said 12 detectives are working on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive appears to have been revenge, Alvarez said, and the scenarios have 
"something to do with (Benitez's) work: guns, seizures and, yes, drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Alvarez did not say whether investigators have down their suspicion 
exclusively to drug traffickers. Nor did he say whether they have eliminated a 
connection to the assassination last month of ruling party presidential 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. That theory has received widespread attention 
because Benitez had considerable information on the Colosio case, had expressed 
doubts about the federal investigation, and was providing periodic reports to 
the governor on what he had learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Osuna said that, as far as he knew, Benitez had not gathered sensitive 
information on the Colosio assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Osuna also confirmed that he received a death threat Friday in which a caller 
said: "The mayor is next." He has beefed up security at City Hall as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez's replacement is Victor Manuel Vasquez Fernandez, 44, a former judge, 
deputy attorney general and supreme court justice.

SETTLEMENT REQUIRES NAVY TO REASSESS SITES FOR EXPLOSIVES TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Three days after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction against a 
Navy plan to detonate tons of explosives in an undersea area rich with marine 
life, the Navy and five environmental groups have settled their legal dispute 
over the tests, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, approved Friday by U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson but 
not announced until Monday, requires that the Navy conduct at least eight days 
of new aerial surveys of the proposed testing area near the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the surveys will be compared to others taken 18 miles farther out 
to sea, an area environmental groups have recommended as a better site for the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy also must prepare a full environmental impact report on the proposed 
"ship-shock" testing -- a federally mandated procedure to test crew 
survivability and the strength of warship hulls and electronics packages under 
battle conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 To simulate those conditions, the Navy wants to detonate as many as 270 
underwater explosives near the ships over a five-year period, with individual 
charges weighing as much as 10,000 pounds. Navy officials have acknowledged 
that the tests may kill a small number of marine mammals and harass or injure 
hundreds of others, some of which are federally listed as endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement effectively puts the full testing program on hold for nine 
months to a year, as Navy officials prepare the environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 The five environmental groups, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
called the agreement a victory in their quest to stop or move the testing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This agreement) serves notice that even the military must respect and 
preserve our natural resources," said Joel R. Reynolds, a senior attorney for 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Whales, the American Oceans Campaign, the Humane Society of the 
United States and Santa Monica-based Heal the Bay joined the council in a suit 
that led to the preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has focused on whether the tests should be conducted farther 
offshore in deeper waters where the concentration of marine life is not as 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Friday's settlement, the Navy received permission to proceed by the 
end of June with one ship-shock test of the John Paul Jones, one of the Navy's 
new Aegis-class destroyers. A total of four 10,000-pound underwater detonations 
will be allowed under the terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy's testing area is approximately 20 miles southwest of Navy-owned San 
Nicolas Island and about 85 miles southwest of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons 
Station in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said they could live with the terms of the agreement negotiated 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that a suitable compromise was worked out," said Lt. Cmdr. 
Frank Thorp, a Navy surface fleet spokesman in San Diego. "What we are not 
pleased about is some of the characterizations that have labeled us as not 
caring about the marine environment. The truth is that we have gone to 
extraordinary lengths and costs to reduce the risks posed to marine mammals 
during these tests."

UC TO SELL LAND WITH REDWOODS TO LOGGING FIRM; ENVIRONMENT: UNIVERSITY, SAYING 
ANCIENT TREES NEAR SANTA CRUZ SERVE NO ACADEMIC PURPOSE, TENTATIVELY OKS DEAL 
FOR $2.38 MILLION. ALTHOUGH SOME GIANTS WILL BE SPARED, CONSERVATIONISTS ARE 
UPSET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move being assailed by residents and environmental groups, the University 
of California tentatively has agreed to sell a stand of ancient redwoods near 
Santa Cruz, some of them 1,200 years old, saying the trees serve no academic 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sale is approved by the UC Board of Regents later this month, Eel River 
Sawmills Inc. of Humboldt County, which bid $2.38 million for the land, will 
have access to nearly 2 million board-feet of old growth timber. A conservation 
easement imposed by the university, however, would prevent some of that timber 
from being logged. 
</P>
<P>
 The redwoods, ranging in age from 700 to 1,200 years, are scattered across the 
410-acre site, half of which the university acquired in a 1940 bequest. The 
rest was purchased in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't being used for research. It was costing us money to hold. The 
university has budget problems. So it was declared surplus," said Gordon 
Schanck, a senior real estate officer for the university. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and area residents have condemned the 
university's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dewitt, executive director of the San Francisco-based Save-the-Redwoods 
League, likened it to selling off rare books or archeological artifacts in 
order to meet short-term financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragedy that the university is selling an antiquity that can't be 
replaced," Dewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the ancient trees, the acreage includes younger redwoods, Douglas fir 
and oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Keosheyan, whose property borders the site, said she and other neighbors 
are heartsick at the prospect of losing the trees and fear logging will worsen 
erosion problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get up to 80 inches of rain here, and mudslides are already a constant 
danger," Keosheyan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Save-the-Redwoods, which has donated $76 million since 1910 so state parks 
could acquire redwoods, also bid for the Santa Cruz property. The offer was 
about $240,000 less than the timber company's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving the sale, the regents are bound by a state law requiring them to 
accept the best price and the best deal, said Michael Houlemard, director of 
community planning for UC Santa Cruz. He said maintaining the property was 
costing the university $15,000 to $20,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is that it is a shame that something couldn't be worked out (with 
Save-the-Redwoods)," he said. "But state law says we have to accept the bid 
with the best combination of price and terms. Either that or reject all bids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, that's not in the best interest of the trees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Houlemard pointed out that a 17-acre conservation easement, as well as 
logging limits imposed by the California Department of Forestry, would protect 
some trees. Under the department's restrictions, 40% of all trees larger than 
18 inches in diameter would be left standing. 
</P>
<P>
 The university decided to sell the land, Houlemard said, after determining it 
had no academic value that was not being provided by its other forest land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The academic folks took a hard look to see if it had any value, and frankly 
there wasn't any as an academic resource," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is 35 miles from the Santa Cruz campus. The school occupies 2,000 
acres, including nearly 1,000 acres of redwood forest. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, said Schanck, UC owns at least 140,000 acres of land as part of its 
natural reserve system -- land held for research purposes. It includes "very 
fine old growth stands in Big Sur and elsewhere," Schanck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the timber sale probably will go toward scholarships and other 
student programs, university officials said.

MEAGER SNOWPACK FORCES DROUGHT WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state declared a drought watch Monday after a meager winter Sierra 
snowpack left California's water supply with a precariously thin margin for 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration will have no immediate effect on water deliveries but puts 
users on notice that another critically dry year would plunge the state into a 
full-fledged drought emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Resources Secretary Douglas P. Wheeler made the announcement at Echo Summit 
near Lake Tahoe as the state's snow survey team began its final assessment of 
the Sierra snowpack. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven years in this century have produced less runoff from mountain 
snowfall than this year's forecast for the Sacramento River Basin, through 
which much of the state's water flows. As of March, the snowpack was barely 
more than 40% of average. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year was dismal," said Anita Garcia-Fante, a spokeswoman for the state 
Department of Water Resources. "We're very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's runoff into the Sacramento, Feather, Yuba and American rivers is 
expected to total 8.5 million acre-feet, less than half the annual average. 
(One acre-foot is enough water to supply a family of five for a year.) 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, 1993's snowfall produced 22.5 million acre-feet of runoff. The 
heavy precipitation ended six years of drought and filled the state's 
reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
 As of April 25, the state's 155 major reservoirs averaged 90% of capacity. But 
as the dry months stretch on, that stored water will be depleted, and the state 
expects the reservoirs to be down to an average of 70% by the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia-Fante said individual California water users probably will not face 
rationing this summer. However, the state and federal projects that ship water 
to agricultural irrigation districts in the Central Valley will be cutting 
back. Some districts, she said, will receive just 35% of their normal 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is exploring the possibility of mobilizing a water bank, through 
which districts that have more than enough water can sell their surplus to 
areas that need it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking Californians to do everything they can to conserve," 
Garcia-Fante said.

CHRISTOPHER CONVEYS SYRIA'S REPLY TO ISRAELI PROPOSAL; MIDEAST: OFFICIAL SAYS 
JERUSALEM IS ENCOURAGED BY RESPONSE TO PEACE INITIATIVE -- BUT NOT READY FOR 
TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Amid a growing backlash here against Israel's new peace initiative with Syria, 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held two rounds of talks with 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday to convey the reply from 
Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli official later said the government is encouraged by the "serious, 
comprehensive and detailed response" from Syrian President Hafez Assad but that 
the response is not yet enough to jump-start mediation that has bogged down 
since the 1991 peace conference in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one more round of Christopher shuttle diplomacy will be needed in 
mid-May before direct talks resume between Israel and Syria, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "for the first time, the Syrians have presented a comprehensive package to 
counter (Israel's proposal) that addresses the major issues and does so with a 
degree of detail and concreteness that in some respects has been absent to 
date. That's a novelty," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside is that the response "established a gap (with the Israeli offer) 
and it's considerable on most issues. And it's not a comfortable gap to begin 
negotiating with," he said at a briefing for the American press. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting that negotiations will be long and arduous, he said that Israel is 
in "no hurry" to answer back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis are also concerned that the Syrian response does not integrate 
all critical elements -- including timing of a land-for-peace swap in the Golan 
Heights, security guarantees and the issue of 15,000 Israeli settlers -- as the 
Israeli proposal did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have something to hold on to, but no huge gaps have been bridged. There 
were no concessions," another Israeli official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis are seeking a more high-profile Syrian contact for negotiations 
and gestures to reciprocate their recent actions. Rabin was reportedly 
particularly disappointed that Assad was unprepared to make the gesture on 
peace that he did last month -- at a cost, politically -- when he indicated a 
willingness not to let Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights stand in the way 
of peace with Syria. The strategic heights were captured by Israel in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's second visit to Israel came amid increasingly contentious debate 
and demonstrations over the idea of abandoning the Golan Heights -- in stark 
contrast to public consensus on a deal with the Palestinians on the occupied 
Gaza Strip. Rabin is scheduled to fly to Cairo today for a final meeting with 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat to resolve the final 
issues on Palestinian autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic signing of the formal pact is set for Wednesday; there will be 
about 2,500 invited guests and 40 foreign ministers from around the world -- an 
assemblage surpassing the pomp of the signing of the initial agreement on the 
White House lawn last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the Golan Heights issue, Rabin is already facing resistance that could 
become one of the biggest challenges of his career, Israeli officials and 
political scientists here say. 
</P>
<P>
 A stormy debate raged in the Israeli Knesset on Monday as the right-wing 
opposition introduced three no-confidence motions. And seven members of Rabin's 
own Labor Party strongly criticized the Golan initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The center of the criticism is that Israel is making serious offers and 
potentially endangering its own security but receiving little in return. In the 
Labor Party, some denounced any retreat from full Israeli control of the Golan 
Heights, while virtually all complained that Rabin is telling them nothing 
about negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent Israel's bargaining position from becoming public and arousing 
further opposition, the ever-secretive Rabin has brought only four Israeli 
officials into the negotiations: Shimon Peres, foreign minister; Lt. Gen. Ehud 
Barak, chief of staff; Itamar Rabinovitch, Israel's ambassador to Washington 
and chief negotiator with Syria, and Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, military commander 
on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Knesset, Peres vowed that the government "will not be frightened or 
scared off" by the criticism. And to an angry caucus from his Labor Party, 
Rabin countered that a further stalemate in negotiations with Damascus would 
bring the risk of an alliance uniting Syria with Iran and perhaps even Iraq -- 
an alliance that could well have nuclear capability in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who insist that Israeli settlements, whether in the Golan Heights, 
the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, are an important element in the country's 
security, Rabin replied, "Settlements have a minor security value -- minor, 
minor, minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the Israel Defense Force that brings security, not settlements," he 
said. "I am outraged that I have to keep an entire battalion of paratroopers in 
Hebron and am unable to use it to fight terrorism. . . . We are paying in blood 
for ruling over another people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the three no-confidence motions were defeated, few opponents within 
the Knesset or the Labor Party appeared to be placated.

LAW ENFORCEMENT; LATEST ANTI-CRIME GADGETS NOW GO TO LOCAL OFFICERS; PENTAGON, 
FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES SHARE TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY. RISK OF INJURY 
IS REDUCED TOO.

 A suspect breaks into a run, hoping to escape and avoid a hail of police 
bullets. But an officer armed with a flame-thrower-like gun squirts him with a 
thick stream of sticky foam. 
</P>
<P>
 The goo expands and clings to the man like tar, entangling his legs and arms. 
Running becomes difficult, then impossible. Unable to flee or fight, he can 
only await his capture -- and the baby oil needed to remove the foam. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest in cyberfiction? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon, secretly developed for the Defense Department, is among a host of 
technological advances that the Pentagon has agreed to share with law 
enforcement agencies across the country now that the Cold War is over. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the federal government's new push to fight crime, and it 
involves the Treasury and Justice departments as well -- with such agencies as 
the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms and the Secret Service agreeing to share access to breakthroughs 
that can save police departments time and money -- and reduce the risk of 
injury to officers, bystanders and suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials from Justice, Defense and Treasury joined Vice President Al Gore 
recently to announce the cooperative effort, which stems in part from Gore's 
"reinventing government" program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Together these agreements will help make the advanced technologies of the 
future available on the streets of America for the law enforcement officers and 
the police officers throughout this country who are in the front line in the 
fight against crime," Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of how the equipment can help law enforcement, Gore was given a 
firsthand demonstration of a gadget used in many police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president briefly placed his hand on a pane of glass, leaving his 
fingerprints behind. Then a small device known as a "Magic Wand" was passed 
over the prints, dying them and binding them with super glue. It provided a 
more accurate image than traditional dusting, and in a fraction of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore also hopped into the driver's side of a "smart police car" on a test run 
with a Maryland police department. A mobile data system in the car 
electronically links officers to their stations through a small terminal. 
Officers can file reports, look through files and call up maps without having 
to return to the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Other advances displayed included an automated booking system, used 
exclusively by the DEA since 1990, that records fingerprints, mug shots and 
evidentiary photos by computer in one-sixth the usual time. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATF demonstrated a system operating in the Washington metropolitan police 
department called Operation Cease-Fire, which uses lasers and computers to 
"read" bullets recovered from crime scenes by recording the markings guns leave 
on every bullet they fire. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparing the readings from various crime scenes, a process that takes four 
seconds, police can determine if the same gun was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the system, in place since last year, 
has already connected 10 shootings in the D.C. area and led to three arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Another device is a miniature shoulder-mounted video camera that transmits 
images back to headquarters instantly. With the camera, police officers in the 
field could send pictures of suspects back to the station, where computers 
could determine quickly if the person is on file or sought by authorities. 
Military medical teams also can use the cameras to get advice from doctors 
about how to treat victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Other technology that will be shared includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Body armor that is lighter and more effective against bullets and knives. 
</P>
<P>
 * Night-vision devices that would help law enforcement authorities capture 
suspects in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 * Substances placed in gasoline or oil to destroy their ability to power or 
lubricate vehicles, and viruses that can cripple computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Devices that temporarily stun suspects, such as the noise simulators that 
aided in the U.S. military's capture of former Panamanian strongman Manuel A. 
Noriega in January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Technologies federal agencies are trying to develop, or increase the use of, 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Virtual reality simulators that can create a fictional hostile environment 
to aid in training officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drugs that inhibit or calm the nervous system to more easily control 
dangerous or suicidal people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electronic monitoring devices that can be inserted in fleeing cars so police 
can track them without chases.

LEGISLATION; WHERE THERE'S SMOKE: GREAT TOBACCO WAR RAGES IN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two centuries ago, when the U.S. Capitol was under construction, tobacco was 
king. It was so highly prized that architects used tobacco leaf designs in the 
Capitol's walls and ceilings, where they remain as a reminder of the importance 
of this valuable export crop to the economy of the infant United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the tobacco industry is not only not celebrated, it is under attack on 
Capitol Hill. An epic struggle is under way between the industry's defenders 
and a determined band of lawmakers who want to place unprecedented restrictions 
on smokers and extensively regulate the making and marketing of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who has declared the White House a smoke-free zone, has 
taken a leading role. The Pentagon has declared a no-smoking policy for the 
armed forces, and the Labor Department has proposed a wide-ranging ban on 
smoking in workplaces. Clinton has asked for a 75-cent-a-pack increase in the 
cigarette tax to help pay for health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The main battleground now is the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on 
environment and health. Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), a former 
smoker, is the latest point man against the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Waxman who summoned seven chief executive officers of tobacco firms to 
a hearing recently and demanded to know why they were increasing the nicotine 
content of cigarettes. Their answer -- that it was done to improve flavor -- 
was widely derided. 
</P>
<P>
 But, despite scientific findings about the deadly effects of smoking, no one 
in Congress has suggested an outright ban on cigarettes, now being used by 50 
million Americans. Even reducing or eliminating nicotine -- the ingredient 
scientists believe makes cigarettes addictive -- lacks widespread support. 
</P>
<P>
 So Waxman and his allies are searching for ways to promote health by 
discouraging people from beginning the habit, finding a way to stop people from 
smoking and shielding nonsmokers from the effects of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tobacco industry, once considered invincible, is still a formidable 
foe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco lobby has not only the members from tobacco states but has 
befriended other members of Congress in key positions," said Rep. Richard J. 
Durbin (D-Ill.). "It's still very powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Whip Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.), for one, is a staunch advocate 
for tobacco interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco companies have contributed heavily to campaigns. Even so, tobacco is 
no longer politically untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question, the tobacco industry is embattled," said Rep. Thomas J. Bliley 
Jr. of Virginia, who represents a tobacco-growing district and is the ranking 
Republican member of Waxman's subcommittee. "It's politically incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 Bliley thinks a report by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1993, which 
declared that secondhand smoke could cause cancer in nonsmokers, gave 
anti-tobacco forces momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the anti-smoking drive in Congress began long before that. The first major 
restriction was imposed in 1987, when Congress voted to ban smoking on airline 
flights of less than two hours. In 1989, Congress banned smoking on all 
domestic flights. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, an amendment to the Goals 2000 education bill barred smoking in 
all schools that get federal funds, day care centers, Head Start classrooms and 
centers for Women, Infants and Children nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention now is riveted on Waxman's subcommittee, where he is pressing for 
action on a bill to ban smoking in virtually all public places. So far, he 
lacks the 13 votes needed to get it approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman twice has scheduled meetings to take up the bill but has had to cancel 
them when he came up short of votes. A major obstacle is the nine Republicans 
on the committee, who have been lining up with Bliley against the bill. While 
there are 15 Democrats on the panel, not all are willing to support Waxman's 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the bill as currently written will become law -- it's too 
sweeping," Bliley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rep. Scott L. Klug (R-Wis.): "If they figure out a way to build in some 
exceptions, I'd be glad to support it. It's a little far-reaching to say that 
every bowling alley and tavern in Wisconsin be smoke-free."

MOST N. KOREANS ON BRINK OF STARVATION, DEFECTOR SAYS; FAR EAST: EX-SECURITY 
OFFICER DESCRIBES RAPIDLY WANING SUPPORT FOR REGIME. HE AND FAMILY FLED VIA 
CHINA. 
</P>

<P>
 A desperate food shortage has pushed most North Koreans to the brink of 
starvation, fueling refugee flight to China and the beginnings of popular 
protests, a North Korean defector said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tearful account of the grim life in the world's most secretive, isolated 
Communist nation, Yo Man Chol, a 48-year-old former security force captain, 
said people are dying in the fields and that support for Kim Il Sung, the 
authoritarian regime's leader, is rapidly declining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kim regime, whose suspected development of nuclear weapons has attracted 
international concern, had placed the nation on a war alert but recently 
stopped full-scale military exercises, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 (South Korean President Kim Young Sam ordered his nation's 650,000 troops on a 
24-hour alert Monday after unusual military moves by the north, including 
amassing more soldiers and weapons at the tense inter-Korean border than are 
allowed by international agreements.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yo, flanked at a packed news conference by his wife and three children, said 
that so many North Koreans are near starvation that the normally repressive 
government has begun issuing internal travel permits to people to search for 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 Using such a permit, Yo made his way to the Chinese border and headed for the 
city of Shenyang after crossing the frozen Yalu River under cover of darkness 
with his family six weeks ago. He then defected to the South Korean Consulate 
in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided it was better to die trying to escape the north than of 
starvation," said Yo, who was working as a driver in the port city of Hamhung 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-security official said he also defected because he had been blacklisted 
in 1989 for taking a bribe in a case involving a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, Kum Ju, 20, was fired from her job as a typist because of his 
deed, and he worried his children would have no future. 
</P>
<P>
 Yo said "uprisings must be imminent" over the food crisis. Most people have 
been forced to subsist on nothing more than pickled vegetables or one bowl of 
corn porridge a day since last August, when the strapped government sharply 
reduced food supplies. He also said that several people in his apartment 
building had died of starvation and that people have begun demanding that 
military food supplies be released to the public, although such demands are 
treated harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman in a neighboring village was reportedly executed for crying, "I wish 
there was a war!" while standing in line at a food supply center, because she 
was fed up with the lack of food, Yo said, noting, "People are eating corn 
paste that they use to put wallpaper on their living room walls. They live on 
pine tree bark. Old parents are a burden because it only means one more mouth 
to feed." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Lee Ok Kum, 45, said tearfully: "At night, my children would ask for 
a bowl of gruel to stop the hunger, but I have nothing to give them. I am a 
mother, but I couldn't feed my children." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's elder son, Kum Ryong, 18, said most students are so tired from 
malnutrition that they lie at their desks with their heads down and doze off. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the collapsing economy, Kim's personality cult is on the wane, 
Yo said. Although nearly all North Koreans used to wear a lapel badge with 
Kim's picture on it, only about 20% do today. "Patriotism is a thing of the 
past," he said. "You can't riot in public, but people do it quietly. People 
talk at home." 
</P>
<P>
 He said North Korean radio dials are welded down to prevent listeners from 
picking up overseas news broadcasts. But several people have learned to fix the 
dials and listen to South Korean radio at night under their blankets. "When we 
heard South Korean farmers were fighting against rice imports, we knew they had 
enough rice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yo said he had no concrete information about Pyongyang's nuclear weapons 
program. He said he had heard there was a test blast of a nuclear bomb the size 
of a match head, as well as test firings of multiple-stage missiles in the 
northern area of Hamgyong, but he provided no details. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving in Seoul on Saturday, Yo and his family were given a $24,000 
donation to help them start their new life by an anonymous South Korean who 
defected from the north during the Korean War. "My wish is to be of some 
assistance to poor North Koreans, to help free them from poverty," Yo said.

EMERGENCY AID PLAN EARMARKS $1.2 BILLION FOR PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, Europe and other donors are preparing to launch a 
three-year, $1.2-billion emergency aid program for the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
to help ensure the success of Palestinian self-rule, the World Bank said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the peace process has any hope of success, the Palestinians need to see 
improvements in their living conditions very quickly," World Bank Vice 
President Caio Koch-Weser said."The international community is betting that 
this program can jump-start the Palestinian economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are expected to sign an 
agreement Wednesday ushering in Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank district of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year program, which was drawn up by the World Bank in close 
consultation with the Palestinians and with donor nations, aims to rebuild the 
dilapidated economy of the occupied territories and reignite growth. Under the 
plan, about $200 in annual aid per person would flow into the West Bank and 
Gaza over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.2 billion in emergency assistance is the first installment of a 
$2.4-billion, five-year program of aid for the occupied territories. The 
European Union is contributing $600 million to that plan; other large 
contributors are the United States with $500 million and Japan with $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the $1.2 billion in emergency aid will be earmarked for 
improving such basic services as transportation, water supply, housing and 
education.

 A middle-aged Indian beheaded his young daughter last week in the western 
Indian state of Gujarat to appease a Hindu deity, United News of India (UNI) 
said Monday, quoting police officials. 
</P>
<P>
 UNI said Hemu Vasrambhai confessed to killing his teen-age daughter last 
Wednesday. He reportedly said he had had a dream in which a goddess asked him 
to make a human sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested on murder charges after the victim's uncle reported the matter

4 GERMAN YOUTHS HELD IN FIREBOMBING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four young right-wing extremists have been arrested for firebombing a 
synagogue, German authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 25 attack in the northern port city of Luebeck was the first time a 
Jewish house of worship had been set on fire since the Nazi era.It charred two 
front rooms of the synagogue, where the city's small Jewish community was 
planning to hold its first Passover Seder since the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Five tenants sleeping in apartments above the synagogue were not hurt in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The four suspects, all from Luebeck, plotted the firebombing "out of hate 
against foreigners and against Jews" and are being held on suspicion of 
attempted murder, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The firebombing shamed and enraged many Germans.

CLINTON SEEKS TO 'STRENGTHEN' CHINA TIES; DIPLOMACY: PRESIDENT TELLS VISITING 
VICE PREMIER THAT IMPROVEMENT DEPENDS ON BEIJING'S HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES. BUT 
HE IS CRITICIZED FOR NOT 'SOUNDING TOUGH.' 
</P>

 President Clinton told an emissary from Beijing on Monday that he wants to 
"strengthen" U.S. ties with China, a White House spokesman said. But in the 
40-minute Oval Office meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, the 
President added that China still must make progress in its human rights 
policies if relations are to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said Zou did not offer Clinton anything new 
from the Chinese regime and did not promise any of the policy changes the 
Administration has been seeking, such as the release of dissidents and an end 
to the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts. "He did not bring anything with 
him," one Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting underscored the Administration's increasingly frenetic effort to 
head off a major conflict with China over human rights and trade. It was also 
the highest-level contact between Washington and Beijing this year, and 
possibly the last such session before the President decides what to do about 
China's trade privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton must decide before June 3 whether to extend China's 
most-favored-nation trade benefits, under which it enjoys the right to export 
to this country with the same low duties as most other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the President signed an executive order that said China should 
make "significant overall progress" on human rights if it wants to maintain its 
trade benefits after July, 1994. But the Chinese regime has said it will not 
respond to U.S. pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Beijing has taken steps seemingly aimed at defying the 
Administration's human rights policies. China arrested several dissidents 
during a Beijing visit by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and since has 
announced it is again detaining China's top democracy advocate, Wei Jingsheng. 
He was released from jail last September, when China was hoping to land the 
2000 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said Monday night that Clinton told Zou the United 
States is not trying to impose its views on China. Rather, the President said, 
it is asking China to fulfill its human rights obligations under the U.N. 
Charter. 
</P>
<P>
 This official said the President acknowledged to Zou that China has made 
progress on human rights. But he said he is waiting to see what other progress 
there might be between now and June 3, when he must make the decision on 
China's trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch (Asia), 
criticized the Administration's handling of Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton should have come out sounding tough and like he means it. I'm very 
disappointed that Wei wasn't even mentioned" in public statements after the 
meeting, Jendrzejczyk said. Administration officials "are letting the 
hard-liners know that we'll look the other way if they simply give us some 
cover to save face for Clinton. . . . The Chinese respond to strength, not 
weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is studying the possibility of penalizing China for human 
rights violations by targeting specific products from state industries. One 
approach being considered would be to use a provision of a 1988 trade law that 
allows the United States to retaliate against nations that violate labor 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Zou is both vice premier in charge of China's state planning apparatus and a 
member of the Communist Party Politburo. He was invited to Washington by 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. 
Knowledgeable sources said Brown has actively pushed for the Administration to 
change its policy toward Beijing in a way that will help U.S. companies land 
more contracts in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given his rank, we thought it was important that the President should see 
him," one U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oval Office meeting, Clinton was joined by other top-level U.S. 
officials, including Brown, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, National 
Economic Council chief Robert E. Rubin, Acting Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord.

PERRY BACKS U.N. MISSION IN RWANDA; AFRICA: THE DEFENSE SECRETARY PROMISES U.S. 
SUPPORT BUT NOT TROOPS. THE STATE DEPARTMENT DISPATCHES TWO ENVOYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry on Monday endorsed a proposal for a U.N. 
military expedition to stop massacres in Rwanda and promised American support 
-- short of combat troops -- for such a venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the carnage in the tiny Central African country as "a world-scale 
humanitarian tragedy," Perry told Times reporters at a breakfast meeting here 
that U.N. Security Council action to reduce the bloodshed there should be "a 
top priority." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks amounted to the first positive response by the Clinton 
Administration to a call Friday from Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
for a large U.N. force to quell the frenzied ethnic conflict in Rwanda. Because 
the United States has veto power, American support, or at least acquiescence, 
is vital for any new Security Council action. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as thousands more terrified refugees flowed from Rwanda into a 
squalid camp in Tanzania, it remained unclear what the Security Council could 
or would do in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, which dispatched two envoys to the area, focused its 
energies on trying to arrange a cease-fire rather than galvanizing the Security 
Council into launching a large peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The warfare, which may have killed as many as 200,000 Rwandans, began a month 
ago after the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi died in a 
mysterious plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of refugees in Tanzania have been members of the Hutu tribe 
fleeing the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a rebel army dominated by warring Tutsis. 
The rebels have nearly encircled the capital of Kigali and seized huge slabs of 
territory, including the border with Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that John Shattuck, assistant 
secretary of state for humanitarian affairs, and David Rawson, the U.S. 
ambassador to Rwanda, would depart shortly to discuss the crisis with Secretary 
General Salim Ahmed Salim of the Organization of African Unity and other 
officials in Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania. Shattuck and Rawson hope to revive 
peace negotiations between the Rwandan government and the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most commonly discussed suggestions for a solution to the crisis -- 
an expeditionary force of African troops set up by the United Nations and the 
OAU -- was belittled by Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary general in 
charge of peacekeeping, at an unusual briefing of a Senate Foreign Relations 
subcommittee on Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the limitations of the OAU, if we want urgent and immediate action, I'm 
not sure that is the organization to turn to," Annan said Monday. "The only 
African country that could . . . contain the situation and help bring about law 
and order probably would be South Africa, but it's too soon to turn to them." 
The South African government is undergoing reorganization following historic 
all-race elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Annan said, any troops dispatched to Rwanda would have to depend on 
the American military to get them there. "The United States is one of the few 
countries . . . able to move . . . assets that can get people into situations 
like that very quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry echoed the sentiment, saying that -- although combat duty in Rwanda is 
more appropriate for U.N. forces than U.S. troops -- "U.S. forces might . . . 
be called upon to provide some special resources, some areas where we have 
special capabilities" -- for example, a "specialized airlift." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post, in a graphic report from the Tanzanian border, told of 
scores of mutilated, bloated corpses floating down the Kagera River and over 
the Rusumo Falls. Reporter Keith B. Richburg also wrote of how Tanzanian 
authorities had created a huge pile of machetes and knives, which they 
collected from refugees before they were allowed to enter the country.

 Before the outbreak of violence, the United Nations had stationed 2,500 troops 
in Rwanda. The Security Council voted 12 days ago to reduce the number to 270. 
About 450 U.N. peacekeepers are still in Rwanda. But on Friday, Boutros-Ghali 
asked the Security Council to expand the force to a size large enough to quell 
the violence.

RWANDA CONFLICT SHUTS GORILLA PARK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities in Uganda have closed a forest park where rare mountain gorillas 
live, fearing that fighting could spill over the frontier from neighboring 
Rwanda and threaten tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have closed the Mgahinga National Park to tourists basically for their 
safety.Chances are very high fighting might spill over into the park," an 
official of the state-run Uganda National Parks said of Monday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Mgahinga, in southwestern Uganda, is part of a chain of forests that stretch 
through northern Rwanda and eastern Zaire and are home to the world's last few 
hundred mountain gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
 A parks official said troops of Uganda's National Resistance Army were 
patrolling the border with Rwanda, where fighting erupted after Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana and President Cyprian Ntayamira of nearby Burundi 
died in a mysterious plane crash April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 A few gorillas have crossed into Uganda in recent weeks, the parks official 
said. He said they could have crossed from either Rwanda's Volcano Park or 
Zaire's Virunga Park.

WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE FIRINGS BUNGLED, GAO SAYS; GOVERNMENT: ACTION AGAINST 
SEVEN GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF INAPPROPRIATE POLITICAL PRESSURE, IT FINDS, ADDING 
THAT NO LAWS WERE BROKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House bungled the firing of seven travel office employees last May, 
giving the appearance of inappropriate political pressure on the FBI and undue 
influence by a Hollywood crony of President Clinton's, but apparently breaking 
no laws, congressional auditors say. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Accounting Office, in a report released Monday, said White House 
officials acted within their authority in dismissing the seven longtime travel 
office workers, because all seven served at the sole discretion of the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 But the GAO criticized the roles of Hollywood producer Harry Thomason, air 
charter executive Darnell Martens and Catherine Cornelius, a young third cousin 
of President Clinton, who initiated an investigation of the travel office early 
in the Clinton Administration in hopes of landing the travel business for 
themselves, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomason and Martens held White House passes and were given free rein within 
the executive complex. The access heightened "the appearance of inappropriate 
influence" by the Hollywood producer and his business associate, Martens, the 
GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
 After an outcry over the firings in the press and Congress, other federal jobs 
were found for five of the seven workers. The two most senior travel office 
employees have retired. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the dismissals, White House officials said that the action was 
being taken because of alleged "gross mismanagement" in the office, which 
coordinates travel for White House staff and for members of the press who cover 
the President. The press charter business alone results in billings of more 
than $7.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said it could not determine whether the allegations by the 
Administration of fiscal mismanagement in the travel office were true because 
that question remains under Justice Department criminal investigation. The GAO 
said it could not interview Thomason, Martens or any of the fired employees 
because of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House welcomed the GAO's report, saying that its findings are 
consistent with an internal investigation last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO and White House investigations found considerable evidence of sloppy 
bookkeeping, poor oversight and lax cash management in the travel office. Some 
of the deficiencies have been corrected, the GAO said, but financial management 
problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also learned Monday that the GAO's conclusions match those of the 
Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, which looked into 
two aspects of the travel office matter. 
</P>
<P>
 One was the assertion in a suicide note left behind by White House lawyer 
Vincent Foster that "the FBI lied," an accusation presumed to relate to the 
FBI's handling of the investigation into the travel office. 
</P>
<P>
 The other was whether the White House had misused the FBI in the inquiry by 
summoning the official in charge of the FBI's congressional and public affairs 
to a meeting to discuss what the press should be told about the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The twin investigations by the Justice Department office, the department's 
internal watchdog, are expected to be released later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate criminal investigation by the department's public integrity section 
is still underway, officials said Monday. It is looking into the actions of the 
two most senior travel office employees.

SEWAGE SPILL IN TIJUANA CONTINUES TO KEEP SAN DIEGO AREA BEACHES CLOSED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Area beaches remained closed Monday after a pipe break in Tijuana sent at 
least 24 million gallons of sewage pouring into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican officials are estimating they will fix it, maybe, by late (this) 
afternoon," said Dan Avera, San Diego County's deputy director of environmental 
health services. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs warned swimmers of high bacteria levels at beaches from the U.S.-Mexican 
border north about 15 miles to North Island Naval Air Station, at the entrance 
to San Diego's harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The closed areas included Imperial Beach, the Silver Strand and the shoreline 
of affluent Coronado, where President Clinton and his family vacationed a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish President Clinton were here today. I think he'd see things a little 
differently," said City Councilman Juan Vargas, one of many local politicians 
expressing disgust at the region's continued problems with Mexican sewage. 
</P>
<P>
 The untreated sewage is flowing out of a 42-inch pipe that broke Sunday 
morning near a treatment plant in Tijuana.

3 L.A. MEN HELD ON $100,000 BOND IN VEGAS CASINO ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three Los Angeles men charged in the April 24 robbery of the casino cage at 
Harrah's Hotel in Las Vegas were ordered held on $100,000 bond each, with the 
provision that a judge must approve any bond posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemeo Wright and Maurice Carter, both 19, and Damon Littlejohn, 20, appeared 
Monday in Las Vegas before Justice of the Peace William Jansen in their first 
court appearance on the robbery charges.They were ordered held on bond pending 
a May 16 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were arrested minutes after the robbery, along with two 
17-year-olds, also of Los Angeles. The two were released from the Clark County 
Detention Center on Friday and turned over to juvenile authorities, according 
to Las Vegas Metro Police Lt. Mike Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen said he did not want Wright, Carter and Littlejohn released without his 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my understanding there's several hundred thousand dollars still 
outstanding," Jansen said. "If anybody attempts to come in with $100,000 bail, 
it's not to be accepted until I review it and determine where the money comes 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 The five Los Angeles residents were arrested at the end of a police chase 
shortly after the Harrah's robbery. About $100,000 was reported taken in that 
robbery, and $158,000 was stolen from the Flamingo Hilton casino cage 48 hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins said the money was passed off to one or more suspects who escaped and 
has not been recovered.

VOTE TODAY WILL TRIM FIELD FOR NOLAN'S SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican voters from Glendale, Burbank, Los Feliz and Silver Lake will try 
to identify an heir to former state Assemblyman Pat Nolan in a special election 
today, while local Democrats groom a champion they hope will wrest Nolan's old 
district away from the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 The special election, featuring four Democratic candidates, two Republican 
candidates and a Libertarian -- was triggered by Nolan's forced resignation in 
February after he pleaded guilty to one count of political racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 If any candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, he or she will fill out the 
last seven months of Nolan's term, which expires Dec. 5. But such an outcome is 
seen as unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this many candidates chasing the job, it's going to be very difficult to 
win outright," said Sheila McNichols, campaign manager for one of the GOP 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring the unexpected, the top vote-getter from each party will square off on 
June 28 in a special election runoff for the 43rd Assembly District seat. The 
winner will serve until December. 
</P>
<P>
 But the election derby in the 43rd District doesn't end there. Still up for 
grabs will be the new two-year Assembly term that begins Dec. 5. Regular 
elections to fill that seat will be held June 7 (the primary) and Nov. 8 (the 
general). 
</P>
<P>
 All seven candidates in today's election will also be running in the June 7 
primary. In addition, two more Republicans and one more Democrat will be in the 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale-Burbank area has been a GOP bastion for decades, but there are 
signs of change. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest reapportionment of the district eroded GOP strength by adding 
Silver Lake and Los Feliz. Before the remapping, the district was 47% 
Republican, 42% Democratic; now, it's 44% Democratic and 42% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, red flags went up in GOP quarters when Bill Clinton, Dianne Feinstein 
and Barbara Boxer carried the district, albeit by narrow margins. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP candidates are James Rogan, a Glendale Municipal Court judge; Julia 
Wu, a member of the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees; David 
Wallis, an engineer and activist; and Joseph Pietroforte, a retired public 
accountant. The Democrats are Adam Schiff, a former assistant U.S. attorney, 
and Ken Kulpa, a broadcaster. The Libertarian candidate is Willard Michlin, a 
real estate broker.

CITY COULD SAVE MILLIONS ON CLAIMS, TASK FORCE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles could reduce by nearly a third the $140.5 million it 
pays annually to settle lawsuits and workers' compensation claims if it handled 
the cases more like private businesses and some other public agencies, a 
private task force said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles suffers a much higher rate of claims for workers' injuries than 
other cities and counties and does insufficient investigation before paying 
most of the demands, the task force concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by a group of attorneys, accountants, insurers and consultants, was 
made at the behest of Mayor Richard Riordan and City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Risk Management Task Force said the most significant reform in 
reducing the city's legal and workers' compensation bills would be holding city 
department heads responsible for the expenses their agencies run up, said 
attorney Terry Christensen, who chaired the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Top bureaucrats would do more to reduce payouts if the city took the money out 
of their departmental budgets, instead of from a general reserve account, the 
task force reasoned. That, in turn, would force them to reduce the number of 
workers' compensation claims. About 15% of Los Angeles city employees file such 
claims, compared to an average of 11% for other government agencies nationwide, 
Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the claims are demands that go mostly unchecked before they are paid, 
the task force said. The group also said the city's expenses might be driven up 
by policies that allow some employees to make more money on disability than 
they do if they work. 
</P>
<P>
 About $32 million could be saved on workers' compensation if the city's rate 
of claims were reduced to the national average, the report said. Another $7.5 
million could be saved by imposing a litigation reduction program like that 
used by the parent company of the Southern California Gas Co., the task force 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office already has proposed installing a computer system in the city 
attorney's office and providing bonus pay for city lawyers who succeed in 
reducing litigation costs.

BOY GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER IN CLASSMATE'S DEATH

 A Simi Valley eighth-grader who fatally stabbed a 14-year-old classmate near a 
school bus stop was convicted of involuntary manslaughter Monday by a judge who 
expressed doubt that the boy intended to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele, acting as a Juvenile 
Court judge, decided that the boy was guilty of the least serious homicide 
charge, which carries a maximum sentence of four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had sought a second-degree-murder conviction, which could have 
sent the boy, now 14 years old, to the California Youth Authority until his 
25th birthday for the slaying of Chad Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard, a popular school baseball team member, was stabbed in the chest just 
after classes at Valley View Junior High School on Feb. 1 and died a short time 
later at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had charged the juvenile with one count of murder. But at the 
start of the two-week trial, prosecutors acknowledged that Hubbard had started 
the fatal altercation by punching the defendant and challenging him to a fight. 
They argued, however, that the boy had no legal right to stab Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense said the accused boy was only defending himself when he stabbed 
Hubbard, who was portrayed in court as the larger and stronger of the boys.

HIGH COURT'S TRASH RULING A BLOW TO CITIES; LAW: ASH FROM INCINERATORS MAY BE 
HAZARDOUS, NEEDING SPECIAL LANDFILLS, JUSTICES SAY. THE IMPACT IN CALIFORNIA IS 
NOT SEEN AS ESPECIALLY SEVERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a costly setback for cities that burn their trash, the Supreme Court ruled 
Monday that ash left by garbage incinerators may be hazardous waste and as such 
requires disposal in expensive special landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Monday, city officials and the Environmental Protection Agency had 
maintained that federal law exempted municipal incinerators from requirements 
governing hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a strict reading of the law, the high court said the exemption set by 
Congress applies only to trash that goes into an incinerator, not to the ash 
that comes out. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling will have its greatest impact in such cities as Chicago and New 
York, which dispose of much of their garbage through incineration. 
Trash-burning plants have not been as popular in California because of the 
state's problem with air pollution. However, the decision may affect 
incinerators in Long Beach and Commerce, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, incinerators burned 34 million tons of municipal trash, or about 17% 
of the nation's solid waste. Advocates of the giant trash burners say that they 
save space in landfills while creating energy -- the equivalent of 31 million 
barrels of oil per year. Incinerators reduce trash by 90%, leaving the 
remaining 10% as ash for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The ash is typically dumped in regular landfills. But critics argue that it 
may be toxic and hazardous because it includes metal from cans, batteries and 
other discarded items, and should instead be disposed of in much safer, and 
more costly, hazardous waste dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the court's ruling, operators of incinerators will be required to test 
their ash. If it is found to be high in metals, such as lead and cadmium, the 
material will have to be treated as hazardous waste. City officials say it 
costs an average of $452 per ton to dump hazardous waste, more than 10 times 
the $42-per-ton average cost for dumping in a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creates a real disincentive for the use of incinerators," said David B. 
Hird, a Washington attorney representing the National League of Cities, which 
joined in opposing the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists hailed the ruling and said that it will encourage 
conservation and recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Other environmentalists said municipal operators can comply with the law by 
screening out heavy metal items before they enter the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 As a legal matter, Monday's ruling illustrates the strict literalist approach 
championed by Justice Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the conservative court would be thought more likely to side with the 
cities and against environmentalists. But Scalia has insisted that the court 
follow the wording of the law, regardless of who wins or loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress in 1984 said the hazardous waste rules do not apply to a municipal 
incinerator that is "treating, storing, disposing of or otherwise managing 
hazardous wastes." 
</P>
<P>
 But the court was asked what should be done with facilities that also 
"generate" waste of their own in the form of ash. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ruling in the case (Chicago vs. Environmental Defense Fund, 92-1639), 
Scalia wrote that, because the law "significantly omits the word 'generating' . 
. . we think it follows from the carefully constructed text . . . that its 
generation of toxic ash" is not exempted from the hazardous waste rules. 
</P>
<P>
 His opinion said nothing about the possible broad impact of the ruling and it 
deliberately ignores congressional statements on the House and Senate floor or 
in committee reports suggesting that municipal incinerators were intended to be 
shielded from the hazardous waste rules. Repeatedly, Scalia has said that he 
will only follow the actual words of the law and will not be guided by 
lawmakers' intent. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, the court let stand a state court ruling that bars the 
University of Colorado from forcing its student athletes to undergo regular, 
unannounced drug tests (University of Colorado vs. Derdeyn, 93-1410). The 
Colorado Supreme Court called these tests an unreasonable search. By contrast, 
the California Supreme Court has upheld such drug tests.

FIRED 'SEXUAL ADDICT' LOSES HIS BID TO GET TEACHING JOB BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former college teacher who said he was discriminated against because of his 
"sexual addiction" lost his bid to get his job back when the Supreme Court 
rejected his final appeal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald B. Winston, a veteran English instructor at Central Maine Technical 
College, asked an 18-year-old female student to meet privately with him in 
1989.Rather than discuss her schoolwork, however, he talked about sex and 
kissed her. 
</P>
<P>
 When she complained, school officials learned of four previous incidents. 
While the teacher said that his encounters with students were "consensual," he 
admitted he was "sexually obsessive" and needed counseling. Instead, he was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston then sued the college, contending that he suffered from the "mental 
handicap of sexual addiction." His dismissal violated the federal law that bars 
discriminating against "individuals with disabilities," he maintained. A 
psychiatrist testified that the teacher indeed suffered from an "impulse 
control disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 But a trial judge and the Maine Supreme Court ruled that sexual addiction is 
not among the disabilities covered by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal, he had asked the high court to reopen the case (Winston vs. 
Maine Technical College System, 93-1114). 
</P>
<P>
 The state's lawyers scoffed at the claim, noting that no court had recognized 
his "addiction" as a legal disability. To do so "would run a serious risk of 
undercutting society's efforts to combat sexual harassment," they said. DAVID

SEARCH BEGUN FOR CUBS OF COUGAR BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED RUNNER

<P>
 The cubs of a slain mountain lion probably cannot survive more than a week 
without their mother, according to state experts who searched for their den 
Monday in the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The cubs' mother, believed to be responsible for the April 23 mauling death of 
marathon runner Barbara Schoener, 40, was killed Sunday after a weeklong hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said the mountain lion, which probably gave birth within the 
past four to six weeks, was a threat to public safety and had to be destroyed. 
They said as many as six cubs, but probably fewer, could be awaiting her return 
to the den. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their chances of surviving beyond a week would be relatively rare," Terry 
Mansfield of the Fish and Game Department said Monday. He said the cubs, if 
found, would be turned over to zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the 2- to 3-year-old mother cougar struck Schoener from 
the rear, knocking her from a popular jogging path and repeatedly attacking 
her. The site of the attack is about 45 miles northeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoener was the first person killed in a mountain lion attack in California 
this century. In 1909, a woman and child died of rabies in Santa Clara County 
after a mountain lion attack.

FRUSTRATED CISNEROS SEEKS TO MERGE, TERMINATE 59 HUD PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a public airing of his agency's troubles, Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros charged Monday that his department is so mired in 
bureaucracy that it fails to accomplish its goal of housing the nation's 
poorest people. 
</P>
<P>
 Accusing Congress of helping to create the agency's problems, he proposed that 
59 HUD programs be merged, terminated or replaced. He said many of the failed 
programs were created by Congress over the years to placate various special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Although criticism of HUD has become a staple of new administrations, 
Cisneros' statements were notable for their frankness, congressional aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros warned Congress that, unless he is allowed to drop most of the 
programs he has targeted, he will be limited to "tinkering at the margins as 
opposed to making some profound difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros commented as he released the results of a study conducted by the 
agency at the request of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on veterans 
affairs, HUD and independent agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is a good first step," said Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), 
the subcommittee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikulski agreed with Cisneros' assessment that too many HUD dollars are 
allotted based on the agendas of special-interest groups. And she stressed the 
need to "let communities use precious federal resources on the needs they 
believe they have, not those driven by Washington bureaucracy or interest 
groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the answer, Cisneros said, is to streamline the process through which 
local governments apply for HUD funds and to give local officials more 
discretion over how they use the money. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, local communities trying to address the needs of the 
homeless often must apply for federal aid in six different HUD programs. He 
hopes to merge them into one. 
</P>
<P>
 In another proposal, Cisneros said he hopes for congressional approval to use 
HUD's public housing modernization program to generate federal loans that could 
be used to tear down crime-infested high-rise apartment buildings and replace 
them with low-income units scattered in economically mixed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he has suggested spending $1 billion for high-rise demolition, 
as part of the Housing and Community Investment Act of 1994. The idea has met 
with particular interest in Chicago, which has a plethora of troubled 
high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 In a note to President Clinton, Cisneros described the current state of public 
housing in Chicago as "as close to the approaches of hell as I have seen in 
America."

GNATCATCHER TAKEN OFF THREATENED SPECIES LIST; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS FAILURE TO 
DISCLOSE DATA WAS IMPROPER. RULING MAY OPEN DOOR TO O.C. DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In what environmentalists termed a significant setback to efforts to protect 
endangered species, a federal district court in Washington on Monday overturned 
the Interior Department's listing of the California gnatcatcher as a threatened 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling in a 1992 lawsuit filed by the Southern California Building 
Industry Assn. and Orange County's tollway agencies leaves the tiny songbird -- 
prevalent in southern Orange and northern San Diego counties -- exposed to the 
plans of builders eager to develop much of its coastal sage scrub habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, by U. S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin, represented a major 
victory for the Southern California building industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides in the dispute -- the developers who have fought against listing 
the gnatcatcher as threatened and the environmentalists who have tried to 
ensure its protection -- agreed that the ruling could have enormous 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely a step in the wrong direction, one that could have a 
devastating impact on the habitat planning program" to protect endangered 
species in Southern California, said Joel Reynolds, a senior attorney with the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, which had successfully petitioned the 
Interior Department to list the gnatcatcher as threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The listing of the gnatcatcher is the foundation upon which the conservation 
efforts in Southern California have been based," Reynolds said. "To remove that 
underpinning may throw the entire planning process into disarray." 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt declined to comment in 
detail before studying the decision, but he suggested that an appeal was 
likely. "All of the information we have indicates that the California 
gnatcatcher meets the criteria for listing under the Endangered Species Act," 
he said in a statement. "We will therefore take the steps necessary to 
guarantee its protection." 
</P>
<P>
 California developers, meanwhile, expressed elation at the judge's decision, 
which at least temporarily removes the 4 1/2-inch, gray-and-black songbird from 
protection under the Endangered Species Act, the nation's most stringent 
environmental law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge victory," said Rob Thornton, an attorney for the Orange County 
Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is planning a number of toll roads in 
Orange County. "The court obviously vindicated our position . . . which was 
that there was a significant question about the scientific merits of the study 
upon which the listing was based." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton said the ruling "effectively repudiates" what he called the efforts 
of environmentalists "to illegitimately twist the Endangered Species Act into a 
tool for stopping development in general, and specifically halting construction 
of the San Joaquin Hills" tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision centered narrowly on the openness of the process involved 
in the March, 1993, decision to list the gnatcatcher as a threatened species, 
which effectively halted all development plans in the areas where the birds 
nest -- some of the most desirable ocean- and canyon-view land in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In their lawsuit challenging the listing, the developers and tollway agencies 
raised three issues: 
</P>
<P>
 * That they were denied access to the raw scientific data supporting a report 
the government relied upon in deciding that an estimated 3,000 pairs of 
California gnatcatchers were part of a unique species whose declining 
population warranted a listing under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 * That Interior Secretary Babbitt acted with bias in reaching the listing 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * That certain procedural requirements of the Endangered Species Act were not 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that the last two issues lacked merit, but he agreed that the 
Interior Department was wrong when it declined to make the raw scientific data 
available to ornithologists hired by the builders to challenge the government's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 What the builders had sought were the notes and calculations of Jonathan L. 
Atwood, a Massachusetts ornithologist who had spent several years studying 
gnatcatchers, comparing various characteristics of the tiny songbirds, such as 
the size of their bills and the length of their tails and toes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Atwood wrote a scientific paper in which he concluded that the 
California gnatcatchers, which live in Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties and on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County, 
are essentially no different from the 2.5 million pairs of gnatcatchers that 
are found in large portions of Mexico and the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After the paper was severely criticized by other scientists, Atwood went back 
to his data and wrote in a 1990 report that his first conclusions were wrong 
and that the California gnatcatchers are indeed distinct from their Mexican 
cousins. Atwood's 1990 report was the primary scientific evidence that the 
government relied upon in deciding to list the gnatcatcher as a threatened 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the fact that (Atwood) had analyzed the identical raw data in 
1988 and 1990 and had come to different conclusions," the court ruling said, 
the "scientific validity" of the second study was challenged, and the Building 
Industry Assn. demanded access to the raw data that Atwood used to reach his 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interior Department declined to provide the data, saying that it did not 
have the data and had relied solely on the finished 1990 report. 
</P>
<P>
 In making that decision, the judge said, the Interior Department was wrong. 
"Where an agency relies upon data to come to a rule-making decision, it 
generally has an obligation under the Administrative Procedures Act to provide 
such data for public inspection," the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs, the judge wrote, "were deprived of important and material 
information from which they could make meaningful analysis in order to provide 
their views" on the issue. He returned the matter to the Interior Department 
for "further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by telephone at his Massachusetts home Monday, Atwood declined to 
discuss the question of his willingness to release his raw scientific data 
regarding the gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was the end of the process, I would be disappointed," Atwood said, 
adding that he would be surprised if efforts to preserve the bird and its 
habitat in the sagebrush mesas and coastal hills of Southern California would 
"just go away" as a result of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmentalists and state and federal fish and wildlife officials 
expressed concern about the impact of the decision on the Natural Communities 
Conservation Program. The program, developed by Gov. Pete Wilson in 1991 and 
adopted last December by the federal government, encourages landowners to 
voluntarily set aside habitat for the gnatcatcher and other rare animals and 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, property owners can speed approval to develop the rest of their 
land without having to go through the time-consuming -- and often litigious -- 
endangered species process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a cooperative planning process that was years in the making and that 
was premised upon the protected status of the California gnatcatcher," said 
Reynolds of the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the decision to list the gnatcatcher as threatened involved "the 
most open and searching rule-making on a listing that anyone can recall. To 
conclude that nevertheless it was inadequate is very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Klinger, spokesman for the western regional office of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, said Monday that federal wildlife officials continue to 
believe that the inclusion of the tiny bird on the list of threatened species 
is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to look at the court's decision to see where we go from this point 
on," Klinger said. "We want to take some time with it and make certain we fully 
understand the court's direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mantell, the undersecretary of resources for the California Resources 
Agency, expressed concern about the immediate impact of the decision on the 
voluntary conservation program, questioning whether developers might choose not 
to participate in the wake of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision throws into question how you go about dealing with the interim 
controls and protection for threatened species," Mantell said. "We hope they 
will stay at the table to complete plans" for Orange, Riverside and San Diego 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Mantell said his office plans to hold meetings within the next few weeks with 
all participants -- environmentalists, developers and government officials -- 
to decide how best to proceed with interim planning. "The real question is what 
happens to the habitat until these plans are completed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jacobs, lead attorney for the Building Industry Assn., which includes 
some 1,800 developers, said he expects varied responses to the ruling among 
association members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people had been going through the process, trying to develop habitat 
areas on their properties," he said. "A number of those people undoubtedly will 
say they don't want to have any part of that in the wake of this ruling, while 
others will voluntarily decide to stay in." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is expected to benefit large landowners, such as the Irvine Co., 
Orange County's largest private landowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Thomas, a company vice president, said top officials had not seen the 
ruling and had little comment, but he said the company continues to abide by 
the terms of the Natural Communities Conservation Program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see the ruling and determine what, if any, impact it has," he 
said. "Nobody feels comfortable commenting until we see what the ruling was 
based on and how broad or narrow it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Gaynor, a spokeswoman for the Santa Margarita Co., another of Orange 
County's largest private landholders, also declined to comment on specifics of 
the ruling or its potential implications. Regardless of Monday's decision or 
any future legal action, she said, the company remains committed to the Natural 
Communities Conservation Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Laer Pierce, a spokesman for a coalition of Orange and San Diego county 
developers involved in the conservation planning project, said he expects the 
program to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really glad we won this one. But in the long run, most developers will 
continue moving in the same direction -- toward a new concept of voluntary 
habitat preservation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working to identify the most critical habitats and preserve them, while 
at the same time identifying the less critical habitats and develop those, 
instead of just trying to preserve every beak and feather."

ANAHEIM AND DISNEY MAKE TENTATIVE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping a year of negotiations, city and Walt Disney Co. officials have 
reached a tentative agreement on financing, public works improvements and a 
timetable for development of the proposed $3-billion expansion of Disneyland, 
Anaheim officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 While Disney remains noncommittal about whether it will actually build the 
resort, the tentative agreement was hailed as a substantial step forward. "It's 
great news," Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said. "It's been a long time coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the agreement still must be reviewed by lawyers for both sides, Daly 
and others declined to reveal details. But they sketched the broad outline of 
the pact finally hammered out last week. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * A yet-to-be announced increase in the 13% tax on hotel room stays, but no 
tax increases on city residents to pay for project costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A strict schedule detailing when Disney builds certain portions of the 
resort and the city completes public works projects, such as installing sewer 
lines, placing utilities underground and making street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 * A commitment by Disney to build the project before the city makes any 
financial outlay. 
</P>
<P>
 * A plan to divert future tax revenue generated from the project to pay for 
bonds floated by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * A guarantee not to touch the city's general fund to pay for its share of the 
project costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic deal points have been resolved and now it's up to the attorneys to 
reduce our negotiations into writing," said Deputy City Manager Tom Wood. 
"We're pleased by the progress to date. We've overcome some major hurdles and 
this is clearly a major hurdle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm comfortable so far with the conceptual points," Daly added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth P. Wong, senior vice president of Disney's development division who is 
heading the project, said Monday that he would not confirm that a tentative 
agreement had been reached, but acknowledged: "We are making progress." 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, Disney wants to develop about 500 acres around Disneyland with 
more than 5,000 hotel rooms, a 5,000-seat amphitheater, two of the nation's 
largest parking structures and a new theme park, called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 The final issues apparently were resolved late last week when Disney agreed to 
several remaining deal points that the city was proposing. Attorneys from both 
sides still need to translate the deal points of the extensive development 
agreement into document form. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the document is drafted, city officials said it would go through an 
extensive review, consisting of at least two public hearings -- in front of the 
Planning Commission and City Council -- before it is officially approved. The 
entire review process could take several months. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials cautioned that further issues could arise during the legal 
review and drafting process, forcing additional talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project is very important to the city's future," Wood said. "Much is yet 
to be done as we work through the language issues. We look forward to bringing 
this to the City Council and Planning Commission this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Disney originally proposed building the project four years ago, it has 
maintained that about $800 million in financial support would be needed from 
city, county, state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the project's potential economic and social benefits to the state, 
including the creation of nearly 28,000 new jobs, Gov. Pete Wilson has agreed 
to contribute $50 million worth of state transportation money for freeway 
off-ramps and one of the parking structures. The federal government has 
earmarked at least $15.5 million and indicated it would provide a total of $131 
million for the construction of a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved spending $32 
million toward construction of the parking garage to accommodate the project. 
The California Department of Transportation and the county also decided in 
February to proceed with construction of the $50 million in new freeway 
off-ramps it planned in support of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the garage improvements and off-ramp plans are going ahead even without 
Disney's commitment to build the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the agreement is expected to go smoothly through the Planning 
Commission and City Council, but one group of homeowners has already said it 
plans to try to thwart the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Anaheim Home Owners Maintaining their Environment, or HOME, said 
they would circulate a petition seeking to give Anaheim voters the final say on 
any agreement between the city and Disney on the project's financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White has said the group is entitled to seek a 
referendum on the development agreement. He said HOME would have 30 days after 
the agreement is approved by the council to gather signatures from 10% of the 
registered voters in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group that will be anxious to review the development agreement will be 
the new Anaheim Area Hotel/Motel Assn., which supports the Disneyland resort 
project, but is concerned about how a proposed increase in the hotel occupancy 
tax will be spent.

STRIKE CRIPPLES SERVICES AT SCHOOLS IN O.C.; LABOR: TRANSPORTATION AND CHILD 
CARE ARE SNARLED AS 400 ORANGE DISTRICT EMPLOYEES LEAVE JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 400 non-teaching employees of the Orange Unified School District 
staged a first-ever strike Monday, crippling after-class child-care and bus 
service so that hundreds of parents had no choice but to pick up their children 
from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the district's 26,000 students, about 7,000 depend on bus service. But on 
Monday, only about 10 of 71 buses operated during the day, although union and 
district officials dispute the exact number. 
</P>
<P>
 What buses remained were restricted to special education students, which 
forced hundreds of angry parents to wind through jammed parking lots, past 
dozens of union pickets, at each of the district's 37 schools. The district 
serves areas of Orange, Villa Park, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Silverado and Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took damn near a half-hour to get in and out of this parking lot this 
morning," said Don Patterson, looking out at the backed-up parking lot at the 
Crescent Elementary and Intermediate schools, which his two children attend. 
"It's just been chaos. . . . The Orange Unified District is screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout was staged by the district's classified employees union, whose 
ranks include bus drivers and maintenance, food service and clerical workers. 
The workers have not had a pay raise since 1988, and took a 2.59% pay cut last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's job action was the first strike to hit Orange Unified since a six-day 
teachers' walkout in the spring of 1988. Classified workers also threatened to 
strike that year over health benefits, but stopped short of walking out. 
</P>
<P>
 With exact numbers in dispute, Monday's strike also appears to have shut down 
more than half of the district's 24 child-care centers. Dave Geer left his 
towing company about 1:30 p.m. to retrieve his second- and sixth-grade 
daughters, who go to the Crescent schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big inconvenience," said Geer, who will try to arrange a car pool 
with other parents during the strike. "I just don't think it's fair that kids 
should have to suffer because the adults can't settle things." 
</P>
<P>
 There seemed little hope Monday that the stand-off between representatives of 
the California School Employees Assn., Chapter 67, and district officials would 
be resolved soon. The union represents 1,160 workers, but only about 600 are 
dues-paying members. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials pledged Monday to stay on strike as long as necessary to 
pressure the district into renegotiating a contract that cuts health benefits, 
imposes furloughs and empowers the district to lay off and reduce the hours of 
workers without notice. Union leaders have denounced the contract, which went 
into effect April 10, as "union-busting." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be out until we get this resolved," union President Becky Mayers 
said. "I guess we need to show them we are essential employees after all." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, district officials maintain that contract negotiations with 
the union are over, and vow that schools will remain open during the strike. 
The district is urging parents to arrange for their children's transportation 
and not to rely on school child care during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has established a strike hot line for parents to call. The number 
is (714) 532-6987. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials conceded that the strike caused logistic and administrative 
headaches Monday, but said classrooms experienced few if any substantial 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are in class and that is our No. 1 priority," said Assistant Supt. 
Gretchen Hanson, who assumed duties of superintendent Friday. "The school 
system is functioning fine because this is not a classroom strike." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials defended their decision not to reopen contract talks with 
union representatives Monday. They said the contract saves the district 
$485,000 and is crucial in offsetting a $2.2-million shortfall in its 
$107-million budget this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not negotiating," said Jack Elsner, head of district's personnel 
department. "The board's position is firm on that." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials, however, said Monday that they are willing to discuss 
charges of unfair labor practices recently leveled by union officials. The 
district has denied charges of unfair negotiating during nearly a year of 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Mayers said workers have refused to sign the contract that 
district officials have offered: "What we object to is that (the district 
board) implemented their proposal. They think it's a contract, and we don't. 
It's a proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are willing to resolve the charges," said Elsner. "But we have to have 
something specific and concrete to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Union members voted 338-50 on April 7 to authorize leaders to call for a job 
action. The strike on Monday followed a sickout last Tuesday in which an 
estimated 900 workers called in ill. Monday's walkout was triggered by a 
canceled meeting Friday with district officials regarding the unfair labor 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the anger over the contract, union workers who picketed 
throughout the district Monday explained that they went on strike because they 
were directed to take three mandatory furlough days and a cut in benefits. The 
contract deducts up to $80 per paycheck in some cases for workers to maintain 
their current level of health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't asking for more, we are just trying to keep what we have," said Don 
Davis, a district maintenance worker for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Baker, a district secretary for 16 years, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a terrible decision to have to make, we have never been out on 
strike before," she said. "But this contract is really hitting our pocket books 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 A pivotal issue for union representatives is a contract clause that gives the 
school district authority to lay off union employees or cut their hours without 
notice. Union officials fear the district will try to save on health benefits 
by laying off full-time employees and hiring part-time workers to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't fight over this this year," Mayers said, "there won't be anything 
to fight over next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials say union fears that the district will use the clause to 
arbitrarily dismiss workers are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the intent," board President Maureen Aschoff asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Aschoff said the clause gives the board "more flexibility" in resolving future 
budget shortfalls and would allow the district to avoid imposing layoffs by 
reducing workers' hours instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an advantage for them," said Aschoff. "But I know they have a 
different perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's strike piqued the moral conscience of many teachers and principals, 
who grappled with crossing picket lines. Dave Reger, president of the teachers 
union, sacrificed a day's wage Monday to honor the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of conscience," said Reger, who joined a knot of pickets in 
front of district headquarters Monday morning. "I believe in the union concept. 
I won't cross the line." 
</P>
<P>
 But most teachers and principals reluctantly crossed picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hard thing to see employees on the street and you have to cross their 
lines to get in to the job you have to do," said Cheryl Cohen, principal at 
Crescent Intermediate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, because of the strike, many school cafeterias experienced delays in 
serving food, which was cold Monday, rather than hot. For some students it was 
an unwelcome change. 
</P>
<P>
 "They usually don't have such good food regularly," said David Aminzadeh, a 
fifth-grader at Crescent Intermediate. "But the sub sandwiches today were 
terrible, so hardly anybody bought them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went hungry," added the 10-year-old.

FUTURE UNCERTAIN FOR TEAM STAFF; IMPACT: A COACH AND A LONGTIME EMPLOYEE WORRY 
ABOUT WHAT A RAMS DECISION TO MOVE OUT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WOULD MEAN FOR 
THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Milan (Mickey) Dukich has invested 38 years as a Rams employee, running the 
team's video and game-film operations. For him, it's difficult to imagine the 
Rams playing somewhere else after next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started in 1956, when Elroy Hirsch, Tank Younger, all the legends were 
playing here," he said. "I've always felt that the Rams were part of L.A., and 
L.A. was part of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would really hate to see them go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dukich knows that could become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Rams will invoke the 15-month escape clause in their Anaheim 
Stadium lease, allowing the National Football League team to entertain offers 
from ownership groups in other cities. Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis, Hartford 
and San Antonio have shown interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The club also began preparations for the coming season, perhaps its last in 
Anaheim, with the NFL draft and a three-day mini-camp that ended Sunday. But 
the topic of discussion at Rams Park often turned to the team's possible move. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches and players say they will go wherever the club goes, but what will 
happen to employees such as Dukich, who has lived in Southern California almost 
40 years? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like working," Dukich said, "and this job is all I know. If the team moves, 
I'll probably retire, maybe take a part-time job on a golf course somewhere. 
They say you have to stay active when you retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Perry, Rams defensive backs coach, said he understands that moving is part 
of coaching and playing football, yet he wonders how his oldest son, Rodney, a 
Mater Dei High freshman and a standout athlete, would handle an adjustment 
should the family have to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would like to stay in one place and get your children through high 
school," Perry said. "But if and when that time comes, if the team moves, then 
we'll have to sit down and talk about it more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 "My other son, Ryan (age 8), is still young enough that he can adapt easily to 
a move. And Rodney hasn't talked that much about it, but he would like to stay 
at Mater Dei and would love to finish out his senior year there." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rams coming off four consecutive losing seasons, interest in the team 
is at an all-time low. A rally to support the Rams, organized by the city last 
weekend, drew only 200 people. Season-ticket sales are down 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 Dukich wonders whether Anaheim could lure another team, should the Rams leave. 
He has been with the team through winning and losing seasons but can't remember 
a time when the stands were so empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize it's not like it was 20 years ago," he said. "We have two 
hockey teams now, two basketball teams, two baseball teams. There's the beach, 
volleyball, skiing. There's a lot of competition for the sports dollar today." 
</P>
<P>
 Dukich said friends and neighbors often ask him about the team's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them I have no idea what's going on," he said. "I really don't know 
what the front office is doing with this. They are hiding their emotions quite 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said he hasn't had time to contemplate the possible move and the 
approaching deadline. He has been too busy with the draft and the team's 
mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just try to do your job and let (the front office) work this out," Perry 
said. "You have to go where the employment is. The nature of this business is 
that you'll move every three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that coming in."

APPEALS COURT REJECTS SUIT BY O.C. TOLLWAY OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appellate court has rejected a lawsuit filed by environmentalists who 
argued that the UC Board of Regents was required to file a separate 
environmental impact report when it approved the sale of 1.7 acres for the San 
Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written ruling released Monday, the 4th District Court of Appeal said the 
report was unnecessary. The court ruled that the parcel in question had been 
included in separate environmental impact reports previously certified by the 
San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The tollway agency paid UCI $10.5 million in 1992 for 25 acres intended as 
part of the planned 17.2-mile tollway. The 1.7 acres that were the subject of 
litigation were included in the 25 acres. The smaller parcel is also included 
in a plan to establish a coastal sage brush habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Resources Defense Council and local environmentalists argued in a 
1993 lawsuit that UCI was obligated to either prepare a new environmental 
report for the sale of the 1.7 acres or file a supplemental report to a 1989 
environmental plan adopted by the UC regents. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge agreed with the environmental coalition and ordered the 
regents to prepare a supplemental environmental impact report. The regents 
joined the transportation corridor agency in appealing the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the appellate court overturned the trial judge's order, ruling that 
the parcel in question had already been included in separate environmental 
reports certified by both UCI and the transportation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the court found that there has been no change in the tollway's 
proposed alignment. "Accordingly, no additional environmental analysis is 
either warranted or required by law," the justices said in the five-page 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Joie Jones, a UCI professor of radiology and a member of the environmental 
coalition that filed the lawsuit, said he was very disappointed by the 
appellate ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not over yet," he said. "This is something we're still very concerned 
about and are going to consider all options. We think it's an incorrect 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the regents in Oakland referred calls to UCI officials, who 
were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway agency spokesman Mike Stockstill said officials are pleased with the 
appellate court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a reinforcement of what we've said all along, that the environmental 
work we've done on this corridor has been done properly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockstill said the lawsuit has not delayed tollway construction. But despite 
the favorable ruling, he said, building on the disputed parcel still cannot 
begin because it is included in another lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by 
environmentalists. A federal judge has issued an injunction on that phase of 
the construction.

VERDICT SPLITS THOSE WORKING WITH O.C. TERMINALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who work with the terminally ill in Orange County were either appalled 
or thrilled by a Michigan jury verdict Monday that Dr. Jack Kevorkian broke no 
law by assisting in the suicide of a 30-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was welcomed by those who hope it will advance the cause of 
freedom of choice for the dying but decried by those who fear it may give 
doctors a too-easy option to finding ways to relieve the pain of the terminally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was a very logical and mature decision in light of the status of 
medical treatment which permits people to live in a situation of pain and 
suffering far beyond the time they have a meaningful existence," said Dr. 
Warren Bostick, former dean of the UC Irvine College of Medicine and former 
president of the California Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bostick, who was an outspoken advocate of a failed 1992 ballot initiative to 
legalize physician-assisted suicide in California, predicted that the Michigan 
decision is "the beginning of a modest but steady tide that will move from 
state to state and finally develop the kind of alternative within a framework 
that will be acceptable to people in general." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in Holland, the idea of physician-assisted suicide for the 
terminally ill was accepted by the courts long before the country's legislators 
passed enabling legislation. Perhaps, he said, the United States will follow 
the same path. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Ronald B. Miller, director of the Program in Medical Ethics at the UCI 
College of Medicine, said he believes the jury was mistaken if it was convinced 
by Kevorkian's argument that his main objective was to stop his patient's 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one were intending to relieve muscle pain, one would use morphine and not 
carbon monoxide," he said. "Carbon monoxide is a lethal gas and not a 
medication used to relieve pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said while it may be ethically justified for a physician or nurse to 
increase the dosage of morphine to lessen the pain of a dying patient, even if 
there is a chance that a higher dose might suppress breathing and hasten death, 
there is no justification to use carbon monoxide, which will inevitably cause 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Melvyn Sterling, president of the Orange County Medical Assn. and director 
of the Visiting Nurse Assn. of Orange County's hospice program, said although 
he opposes the legalization of physician-assisted suicide, he greatly respects 
Kevorkian and believes he has done a service in making the medical profession 
more aware of the need to alleviate the pain of the dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Dr. Kevorkian is a brave man," Sterling said. "I think he is a smart 
man, and he has focused national attention on the problem of providing 
appropriate palliative care. But I personally think it is more appropriate for 
us to devote our energies to relieving suffering rather than taking the easy 
way out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling and Miller said while there are methods for relieving the pain of 
terminally ill patients, many doctors and nurses don't use them effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public is speaking loud and clear, and this jury is speaking loud 
and clear, that we are not doing our job adequately," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who supported the jury decision was Craig B. Coogan, executive 
director of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center of Orange County, who 
said his position had been shaped in part by his close contact with people 
suffering from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, you are more sensitized to what disease does to the human body 
and human spirit, and this ruling implies those people now have control," 
Coogan said. "The implication (of the jury decision) is that people are now 
being given the dignity to choose how they live and how they die."

EMERGING MASTER OF METAMORPHOSIS; ART: TOM FRIEDMAN'S WORK IS OBSESSIVELY 
COMPLEX, CONVERTING ORDINARY OBJECTS INTO EXTRAORDINARY SCULPTURES. HIS 
MIND-BENDING PUZZLES ARE AT THE LANNAN FOUNDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALISA TAGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sweat socks, Lifesavers and trash bags are some of the unlikely materials from 
which Tom Friedman constructs his delicately refined sculptures and 
installations. He says that he likes to let his materials determine his 
processes. He chews bubblegum, unravels string and crumples paper. Although 
these sound like common actions, when Friedman does them, they are not. He is 
an obsessive who inexhaustibly converts ordinary objects into extraordinary 
sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lannan Foundation's current exhibition, "Percept/ImageObject," 
Friedman, 28, is exhibited alongside such art world luminaries as Robert Irwin, 
Ad Reinhardt and Gerhardt Richter. The young Connecticut-based artist not only 
holds his own amid this prodigious company, but actually raises the stakes in a 
what-you-see-is-not-what-you-get game. 
</P>
<P>
 In this show of elegant works that artfully challenge perception, Friedman's 
sculptures stand out because his materials are so goofy. His trash bag stuffed 
to capacity with other trash bags raises many of the same issues as other 
paintings, sculptures and installations in the show. Although Friedman's 
objects share something in common with the spareness and simplicity of 
minimalism and the loftiness of conceptualism, they are furtively funny. He 
challenges the notion that art can lead to transcendence by grounding his 
objects in their commonness. They are mundane and compelling, ridiculously 
simple and obsessively complex. 
</P>
<P>
 His works are mind-bending puzzles that often require double- and triple-takes 
to determine what they really are and how they got to be that way. One piece 
looks like a paper towel casually pinned to the wall. In reality, Friedman took 
an ordinary sheet of typing paper and, with the same pin that holds it to the 
wall, pierced it thousands of times, stopping only when there was no room left 
for another pinhole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to let my materials define the limits of my obsession. If I had 
continued to poke the paper, the chances are that it would have ripped. . . . I 
like to think about fragility in my work. The fact that it is fragile makes you 
more aware of its existence. People tend to consider something more when they 
know it's fragile or has been labored over," he said on a recent visit to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the eccentricity of his work, Friedman in person is very low-key and 
boyish. He insists that his obsessive style of art-making doesn't spill into 
other aspects of his life -- it is a method, not his personality. He explains 
that "it becomes a meditative process, but it's not necessarily relaxing or 
fun." This is easy to believe when you look at his perfect circle made of 
eraser dust collected from what must have been myriad mistakes, a perfect cone 
of carefully wrapped masking tape and a geometrically exact sphere of chewed-up 
bubblegum. 
</P>
<P>
 A piece that looks like a tiny rippling tube of white marble is made of a roll 
of Lifesavers. Friedman sucked each piece a little longer so that it is a 
little smaller than the one before it. Then he glued them together with sugar 
and saliva (these are peppermint Lifesavers since wintergreen disintegrated in 
his mouth). Although there are 12 candies in a pack, there are only 11 in the 
piece since one broke in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman usually makes his works out of items associated with daily rituals 
and cleaning routines. He elevates materials like laundry detergent, toilet 
paper and toothpaste to a realm of formal rigor. These are things that we 
frequently use without stopping to consider their inherent formal qualities, 
but, in Friedman's hands, they become strangely beautiful. Sweat socks have 
never looked as good as they do in his interlocked circle of socks, which 
resembles a Brancusi sculpture more than a bunch of footwear. Although we may 
use socks every day, Friedman makes us consider them anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently in the midst of a two-year teaching appointment at Wesleyan 
University in Middletown, Conn., where he says his works in progress will force 
the viewer to look even harder. "My new works have a lot to do with the amount 
of information with which we are presented and the ability to process it," he 
says. "I'm thinking a lot about the phenomenon of experience . . . about 
information, categories and disinformation." 
</P>
<P>
 For a piece he is working on now, he wants to write every word in the English 
language on a 48-inch-by-48-inch sheet of paper. He says that when it is 
completed it will look like a piece of cloth on the floor. Taking text-based 
art to its logical limit, Friedman simultaneously negates and celebrates 
language. "This piece is taking a long time. It's definitely the most obsessive 
thing I've ever done. I hope I can get all the words on the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Friedman's work can be seen in "Percept/ImageObject," at the Lannan 
Foundation, 5401 McConnell Ave., (310) 306-1044 , through May 22. Hours are 
Tue.-Sun., 11 a.m.-5 p.m.

FILLING A SEAT NOT YET SPOKEN FOR; TELEVISION: AMERICA'S TALKING, A 
24-HOUR-A-DAY TALK-SHOW NETWORK THAT WILL PREMIERE JULY 4, IS CONDUCTING A 
NATIONWIDE SEARCH FOR A HOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although it at times seems otherwise, not every man, woman and child in this 
country has hosted a talk show. But if a new cable network, America's Talking, 
has anything to say about it, we'll be much closer to citizen/talk-show parity 
by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 America's Talking, which will premiere on July 4 (which, as its press notes 
observe, is "America's birthday," and therefore a day usually given to outdoor 
barbecues and baseball more than channel surfing), will be a 24-hour-a-day 
talk-show network featuring 14 hours of original, er, new chatting a day. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its start-up preparations, the channel is conducting a nationwide 
talent search: One nobody from our country will become a Somebody, hosting his 
or her own program and pulling in $75,000 a year (a hefty sum, to be sure, but 
certainly nowhere near the celebrated David Letterman's $14 million annually or 
the paycheck Oprah Winfrey brings home on a weekly basis). 
</P>
<P>
 That national talent search came to the Century City Shopping Center last 
Thursday and Friday, as a steady stream of aspiring celebrity hosts (including 
this reporter) did their best not to humiliate themselves in front of a 
smattering of disinterested witnesses. The winner of the nationwide contest 
will host his or her own show from the network's corporate offices in Fort Lee, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the drill: Bring your own videocassette, and they tape you for 10 
minutes. Spend your first minute describing the kind of show you'd do for them. 
With the rest of your time, give them a glimpse of your winning stage presence. 
They give you back your tape, which you mail off with your own stamps. (You can 
also send in a homemade audition, but do so before May 16.) 
</P>
<P>
 With all the hopefuls, America's Talking won't have to worry about blowing its 
budget on nearly blank videotapes anytime soon. But its moguls better invest in 
a few "Applause" signs -- the early-morning audience Thursday was spotty and 
unenthusiastic. Not to say that those of us auditioning gave them anything to 
cheer about, but that never stopped the audiences for Maury Povich or Chevy 
Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something liberating about dying on someone else's time," observed 
one of the participants after meeting with silence from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspirants seemed fairly divided between earnest folks thinking they might be 
able to bring something valuable to their audiences, people in it for fame and 
fortune and jokers out on a lark. Heidi Hendler, 29, a motivational lecturer, 
was one of the former: She suggested a series titled "You!" that would 
"emphasize the individual" and deal with matters of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so crucial for us to put smiles on people's faces," she said. "So many 
shows focus on tragedies -- we should focus on ourselves." (If my audition had 
done that, it would have focused on tragedy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though the fledgling network's executives have to be happy with the turnouts 
-- which has drawn in the thousands to some of the cities they've visited -- 
they might be less than sanguine about attitudes expressed about the talk-show 
format at the auditions. "I'm sick of these talk shows!" said one member of the 
audience at the audition when called on stage by one of the applicants. A 
couple of auditions focused on whether it was possible to do anything new or 
interesting with the talk-show format.  
</P>
<P>
 Bennie Thornton and Emmy Daniels spent much of an audition discussing whether 
the world even needed another talk show, which was sure to win over America's 
Talking's judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, 22, a comic and actor who said his name is Emmy because he hopes 
someday to win one, called the late-night talk-show wars "ridiculous" and had 
harsh words for the afternoon talk shows that find their hosts darting around 
the studio audience. "You should focus on the guest, not the audience," he 
said. "That just incites more turmoil and tension, and you don't draw any 
conclusions, you don't solve anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously enough, however, the subjects the hopeful hosts most wanted to 
interview on their shows were other interviewers. Oprah Winfrey was mentioned 
most often. "I'd ask her if she thought I had a shot," Thornton explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the folks who didn't take it quite so seriously. Rob Siegel, 
26, a waiter and aspiring writer, opened his audition by tracing many of his 
childhood traumas to the TV series "Hello Larry," then got into an extended 
discussion over the art of bagging groceries with Daniels, who quickly became 
the other applicants' guest of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Muratore, 29, and Tymon Shipp, 29, both actor-comics, attended together, 
each interviewing the other for his audition, turning each into a fairly 
entertaining mockery of the process. "Anyone want to share half a toothpick?" 
Muratore, a guy with a more-than-passing knowledge of Howard Stern, asked, 
proffering the chewed-up stick from his mouth, before launching into subjects 
like pornography, transvestites and homelessness ("If you're going to be a 
homeless guy, be a happy one," he advised). 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp, on the other hand, transformed his audition into an infomercial for 
Muratore's dating service. Shipp said he'd like to date Halle Berry or Angela 
Bassett, to which Muratore responded, "Oh, we can hook that up, that's easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though their audience seemed more bewildered than amused, the two didn't 
seem to care. "Where else can a comic find stage time in the afternoon?" 
Muratore asked after the audition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've performed before worse," Shipp nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk shows stink," Muratore said. "It's bizarre -- I can't even watch them 
anymore. It's so sad, you want to kill yourself." He said his guests would be 
"freaks -- I'd get the people who were the survivors of 'Faces of Death.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get that guy who goes into water with the crocodiles," Shipp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geraldo's the only guy who's into freaks, but he goes too far. He grills 
people," Muratore added. "Geraldo is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 That's America Talking. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a poll commissioned by the upstart network, 29% of Angelenos said 
they thought they'd make a good talk-show host. I was not one of that 29%. I 
lost points immediately, with my declaration of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program will operate on the assumption that we are a civilization in 
decline," I portentously intoned, "proof of which will be the existence of the 
show itself." I introduced my dog, too big to be a lap dog but in my lap 
nonetheless, explaining that I hoped to get her on the payroll, kind of like 
Tom Arnold, even though she wouldn't do much, but the camera could cut away to 
her if the interview got boring. 
</P>
<P>
 My guest and I discussed the Nixon funeral ("My favorite part," my interviewee 
ruminated, "was the recorded message from Courtney Love followed by the 18 
minutes of silence") and Bob Dole's declaration that the latter portion of the 
20th Century will go down in history as the Age of Nixon ("He was right," my 
subject observed, "except for the '90s, which will be the Age of Urkel"). 
</P>
<P>
 We smoothly segued from Nixon to the only topic capable of following a fallen 
world leader: the Olsen twins, the lovable blond moppets of TV's "Full House." 
Who, my informed source relayed to the world, are not robots. ("A scoop, and 
right here on this stage," I boasted. "Just imagine what we'll unearth on the 
real show.") 
</P>
<P>
 The audience, shockingly enough, sat in dazed silence. "This is one of those 
interviews where there would've been a lot of cutaways to the dog," I 
summarized. Nonetheless, we did inadvertently discover what might have saved 
"The Chevy Chase Show": an affable, well-behaved pooch. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most curious of all was the fact that none of the applicants had any 
trouble with moving to New Jersey if they got the gig. As Patrick Steinfeld, a 
lawyer wearing a jacket that could only be described as red , put it, "I live 
in Santa Barbara, which is known for its beaches and girls in thong bikinis. 
I'm looking forward to New Jersey's freezing weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Which just goes to prove the lengths to which people will go for a little 
fame.

KING'S RANSOM: AUCTIONING ELVIS; A 50-CENT GIFT CERTIFICATE WORTH $500? PRESLEY 
MEMORABILIA ON DISPLAY THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's largest individually owned collection of Elvis Presley memorabilia 
goes on display here Wednesday, a preliminary step in the international process 
of auctioning more than 600 items the music legend once owned or inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 The King's blue suede shoes won't be on the block at Butterfield & 
Butterfield, but some of his other personal belongings will, including his 
wedding band, a Bible, his American Express card, his parents' marriage license 
and even the birth record kept by the doctor who delivered him. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection, from Elvis museum owner Jimmy Velvet, will be on display at 
Butterfield & Butterfield's Los Angeles gallery Wednesday through Sunday before 
it previews in London and San Francisco and is auctioned off on June 18 and 19 
at the Las Vegas Hilton.  
</P>
<P>
 Rock fans will be able to see Presley's wedding photo album, his corduroy 
smoking jacket, two cars he once owned and even an artificial tree that once 
decorated his living room at Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
 While sale organizers estimate the singer's birth record will sell for up to 
$80,000, relatively inexpensive promotional materials also will be sold, and 
the collection includes some of Presley's paintings and television sets. 
Perhaps the oddest item is a 50-cent McDonald's gift certificate Presley gave 
his cousin Billy Smith for Christmas as a joke. Auction organizers think it 
will fetch between $500 and $700. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of interest already, and the catalogue has only been out a 
week," said Donna Humphrey, Butterfield & Butterfield's memorabilia specialist 
in charge of the sale. "The interest we've had has been from serious 
collectors. . . . There are things that fans can afford. Elvis has broad 
appeal."  
</P>
<P>
 Velvet, a musician and friend of Presley who changed his name from Jimmy 
Tennant after recording "Blue Velvet" in 1957, set up his first Elvis museum in 
Memphis in 1978, a year after the singer died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some things he had given me over the years, and when we opened in 1978, 
people started (selling) us things," Velvet says. "Back in those days I was 
buying everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Velvet spent an estimated $6 million building a collection he says is second 
only to the one at Graceland, Presley's Memphis home that is now the rock 
legend's shrine, and Velvet eventually opened Elvis museums in Honolulu, 
Orlando, Nashville and Kissimmee, Fla. Velvet has consolidated his operation 
and now operates two Legends and Superstars Hall of Fame entertainment museums 
in Nashville and Branson, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Velvet bought much of his collection, including one of Presley's Bibles and 
his Mercedes-Benz limousine, at auctions or from collectors, but he bought many 
of the King's more personal items from people who had known him.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven days before Presley died, according to Velvet, he gave his platinum and 
diamond wedding band -- long believed to be lost -- to his stepbrother David 
Stanley and Stanley's wife, Angie, in the hope that it would help their 
marriage. It didn't, and Angie sold the ring to Velvet in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the gems of the collection -- and the item with the most interesting 
story behind it -- is the record of Presley's birth kept by William Robert 
Hunt, the doctor who delivered him.  
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Velvet read in the Memphis Press-Scimitar that the doctor's 
daughter had inherited it, he went to her house to buy it from her. He was too 
late -- the record had been stolen the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'They didn't steal this to burn it,' " Velvet says. "Some day it's 
going to pop up." He agreed to buy the record from her, giving her half of what 
he describes as a very low price. When the record surfaced in a museum two 
years later, he proved it was his and added it to his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Velvet isn't sure who will buy the items in his collection, but he says 
interest in Presley is always strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elvis is a legend," Velvet says. "This is a fantastic opportunity for 
restaurants chains and museums to (buy things) to draw crowds to their own 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The Elvis Presley Museum Collection will be displayed at Butterfield & 
Butterfield, 7601 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday 
through Saturday, and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. (213) 850-7500, ext. 251.

BANNED ENTRY TAKES TOP HONORS AT SINGAPORE FILM FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singapore's fourth annual film festival, designed to showcase the latest wave 
in Asian cinema, has ended on a surreal note with an entry banned by censors 
walking off with top honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Khoo, a young Singaporean filmmaker, won back-to-back awards for best 
director and special achievement in the short film category for his film 
"Pain," which deals with a man's obsession with enduring pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were given by a jury of filmmakers and critics from India, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Britain and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which apparently contains some graphic scenes of violence, was 
banned from exhibition by the Singapore government film censorship board. All 
films and videos must be submitted to the censorship board even for private 
screenings and films containing graphic sex or violence are frequently cut or 
banned in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 When Khoo was called to receive his awards by the master of ceremonies on 
Saturday night, the hall darkened for the expected film clip, but a voice 
intoned, "I'm sorry, this film is banned by the Singapore government." The 
audience whistled and booed. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoo, obviously pleased to have won two awards, said after winning his second 
silver medallion, "I hope the film censorship board will change its mind about 
my film." 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to Singapore," joked actress Rani Moorthy, who hosted the evening's 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 When Singapore journalists asked British producer Donald Ranvaud, a member of 
the jury, why they had given two awards to a banned film, he replied: "All the 
more reason it should be recognized. None of us really recognize censorship 
where you keep people from having their own opinions in making what they feel 
is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore novelist Gobal Baratham, who writes a column for the 
government-controlled Straits Times newspaper, then again stunned the audience 
when he rose to present the International Federation of Film Critics award for 
best film. Baratham said he was an unusual choice to make the presentation 
because he has boycotted the movies in Singapore for the past 25 years "because 
I refuse to watch censored films." The audience cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner was "The Blue Kite," a Chinese production that is banned in China. 
The movie also won for best Asian actress, Lu Liping, and for best director, 
Tian Zhuangzhuang. 
</P>
<P>
 Another film banned in China, "Beijing Bastards," shared the special jury 
prize with a film from Taiwan, "Rebels of the Neon God." 
</P>
<P>
 When the "Blue Kite" and "Beijing Bastards" were shown at a film festival in 
Hong Kong recently, the Chinese government delegation walked out en masse in 
protest.

THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS; YOUR MEDICINE CABINET SHOULD CONTAIN LOTS OF 
IMPORTANT THINGS -- BUT MEDICINE ISN'T ONE OF THEM. BATHROOM HEAT AND HUMIDITY 
CAN TAKE THE PUNCH OUT OF YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS. 
</P>

 Face to face with the medicine cabinet of a new date , Jerry snoops and is 
sorry. On the shelf sits a tube of fungicide, which Jerry pockets, obsessed 
with finding out which body part is plagued. After many plot twists and turns, 
it turns out the medicine is meant for the woman's . . . cat! -- "Seinfeld" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are three lessons to be learned here. 
</P>
<P>
 One: Snooping in medicine cabinets is not nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Two: Snooping in medicine cabinets can lead to wrong conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Three: Fungicide is one of the few things that belong in a medicine cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's pharmaceutical lesson will focus on No. 3 and the fact that, despite 
the name, the medicine cabinet is not the proper place for many medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, that's because of the barometric conditions in a bathroom -- a source 
of humidity and heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The moisture from the shower and bath can break down some medicines, experts 
say. Carol Taketomo, pharmacy manager at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, cites 
as an example carbamazepine (Tegretol), an anti-seizure medicine. Studies show 
humidity can sap much of its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 A bathroom's high temperatures can also weaken potency and alter chemical 
stability, says pharmacist Chris Green of Zweber Pharmacy in Downey: "Capsules 
might start to melt." 
</P>
<P>
 Other heat-related no-no's: Don't leave pills in a hot car and keep medicines 
away from direct light. (Some medicines could also become harmful if exposed to 
heat and moisture.) 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription and over-the-counter medicines, including aspirin and 
acetaminophen, are best kept in a cool, dry area, Green says. But don't overdo 
it and store medicine in the refrigerator unless the label so instructs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've opened medicine, throw away the cotton plug (which keeps the pills 
from rattling to powder during shipment); it attracts moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine cabinet alternatives include a bedroom cabinet or drawer, or a 
kitchen cabinet -- if it's not next to the sink. (Be careful to use childproof 
caps and locks to prevent poisonings if young children are around.) 
</P>
<P>
 Once your medicines are in their proper places, "go through everything twice a 
year and throw out expired products, both prescription and over-the-counter," 
suggests pharmacist John Tilley, who finds that most people keep medicine long 
past its expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
 So what should go in your medicine cabinet -- in case you're now despairing 
that it has no redeeming qualities? You can keep your toothbrush, toothpaste 
and make-up there, along with shaving essentials and other grooming aids. 
Over-the-counter creams (tightly capped) and thermometers hold up in medicine 
cabinets, as do bandages -- and, of course, fungicides.

A NEW STAGE, NOT THE SAME OLD STORY; PERSONHOOD: BETTY FRIEDAN, WHO'LL TALK TO 
THE AARP CONVENTION IN ANAHEIM WEDNESDAY, SEES A BARRIER SHE CALLS 'THE AGE 
MYSTIQUE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feminist Betty Friedan has a suggestion for the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons, which begins its three-day national convention here today: It should 
change its name to the American Assn. of Resurgent Persons. 
</P>
<P>
 With people living longer than ever before, Friedan said, Americans are 
undergoing a "paradigm shift," a move away from a negative model of old age to 
a more positive one. 
</P>
<P>
 So forget the terms retired persons, the elderly and senior citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 "They all have a connotation of something different, something not life, not 
human, not person, " said Friedan, 73. "I'm talking about the personhood of 
people all through life, and what we now think of (old) age is another stage of 
life to be lived." 
</P>
<P>
 People in the future, she maintains, won't retire -- they'll leave one thing 
to do another, whether it be in the public or private sector, for pay or as 
volunteers. Further, she envisions "whole new patterns" in the way people view 
the important areas of their lives in the later years -- from love to work to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's still a formidable barrier to universal enlightenment: Friedan 
calls it "the Age Mystique." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Age Mystique is more distorted, obsolete, pernicious and pervasive than 
the Feminine Mystique, which kept us from seeing the reality of women," said 
Friedan, whose 1963 book "The Feminine Mystique" served as one of the catalysts 
for the women's movement. "We have to move from the accepted view of age as a 
programmed decline from youth to terminal senility and therefore only as a 
problem for society. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when we break through that Age Mystique and look at this new stage in 
terms of its possibilities, then everything is changed. And choice is every bit 
as important in this new third of life as it was in the earlier stage of life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friedan, who is scheduled to speak at the convention on Wednesday, will 
undoubtedly find a receptive audience for her message. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering, which is open to the public, is expected to draw up to 30,000 
people over the next three days. Conventioneers will be able to view more than 
200 exhibits, including of cars and RVs, fitness products, clothing, exercise 
equipment, travel and information from service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big draw will be the more than two dozen educational sessions 
featuring a host of nationally known figures speaking on issues of interest to 
those who have reached the AARP target age of 50 and over: everything from 
substance abuse and Alzheimer's disease to patient rights and good nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 That's in addition to "Firing Line" host William F. Buckley Jr. speaking on 
talk show politics, Dr. C. Everett Koop on health care trends, "Wall Street 
Week" host Louis Rukeyser on the economy, former U.S. Atty. Gen. Elliot 
Richardson on the world today and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ruth Westheimer will be on hand today to participate in a panel on "Love, 
Sexuality and Aging." And America's best-known psychosexual therapist has good 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older people can be sexually active if they are healthy until a very late 
stage in life," the enthusiastic Dr. Ruth said in her familiar German accent. 
"They might not be able to engage in all the positions -- they might not be 
able to hang from a chandelier -- but older people need to touch and be 
touched." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking by car phone during a limo ride to a speaking engagement in New York 
City last week, Westheimer said that "scientifically validated data" negates 
the perception that sexuality ceases with old age. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly why I'm flying to Anaheim," said the 65-year-old Westheimer. 
"It's important to give good information, especially in this youth-oriented 
country of ours because now we are going to have a graying of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. It barely seems possible, but the first baby-boomers will turn 50 in 
1996. And they'll soon be followed by 77 million fellow boomers.  
</P>
<P>
 Friedan, who says she overcame denial of aging while writing her recent book, 
"The Fountain of Age," views the influx of the former "don't trust anyone over 
30" crowd this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby boomers will be the troops that make the great social revolution at 
the end of the century. And just as that generation made the new music in the 
youth movement of the 1960s, in the 1990s they will make the new songs of age." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, said AARP executive director Horace Deets, the number of Americans 50 
and over will double from about 66 million today to about 130 million in the 
next 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Deets, needless to say, agrees with Friedan's contention that Americans must 
change their negative view of aging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living longer, but we also are more healthy and active on average than 
ever before," he said. "I think we need to get away from the stereotype that 
says aging equals infirmity and decline. We've got to see life as a continuum." 
</P>
<P>
 Deets, who is 56, noted that when people turn 50 they receive birthday cards 
"that imply they're 'over the hill' and other such insults. In reality, when 
people turn 50 they have more than half their adult life ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The normal life expectancy in this country is about 75, he said, "so at 50 
you've got 30 years of adult life behind you, but you're going to actually have 
more than 25 more" years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, few Americans turn 50 without receiving a card from Deets inviting 
them to join AARP. 
</P>
<P>
 For an $8 annual membership fee per household, members receive Modern 
Maturity, a bimonthly magazine. (With 22 million copies, it has the largest 
circulation of any magazine in the country.) 
</P>
<P>
 AARP also offers educational material -- from pamphlets and booklets to audio 
and videotapes -- on a variety of subjects ranging from retirement planning to 
long-term health care. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300,000 AARP volunteers nationwide also serve as instructors for mature 
driving classes and help people with retirement planning, mid-life career 
changes, finances and overcoming the loss of a loved one. This year about 
30,000 volunteers, in conjunction with the IRS, helped nearly 2 million older 
individuals fill out their tax returns.  
</P>
<P>
 AARP is a nonpartisan organization -- "Given the diversity of our membership, 
it has to be that way," Deets said -- but volunteers represent members' 
interests at both the state and federal level. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do is provide information to our members as to what is happening on 
the legislative front," Deets said. "We urge members to communicate directly 
with their elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1958 as an outgrowth of the National Retired Teachers Assn., AARP had 
more than 1 million members in 1967 when founder Ethel Percy Andrus -- a Los 
Angeles educator -- died. It now boasts 33 million members. That's about 50% of 
all Americans age 50 and over. The association's name, however, is a misnomer: 
About 37% of its members are still working full or part time. 
</P>
<P>
 Deets said the organization's growth is the result of its being responsive to 
the diverse needs and interests of people over 50. "Most people join to get 
information about dealing with their retirement -- or they're planning for 
retirement -- or they want information on aging, consumer issues and health." 
</P>
<P>
 Deets said AARP is looking at how to respond to the growing and increasingly 
diverse population of Americans 50 and over. In the meantime, he said, "we have 
an awful lot on our plate already." 
</P>
<P>
 The main issues facing older Americans, he said, are health care, jobs 
("there's still age discrimination in the workplace"), economic security and 
consumer issues such as housing, transportation, safety and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attend the convention, Deets said, "will get a sense of the scope of 
activities that AARP offers, and an important component of that is older 
people: Volunteers and employees represent a tremendous resource for the 
country."  
</P>
<P>
 And in the future, he said, "it isn't just that there's going to be increasing 
demand for resources, but there will be an increasing pool of educated, 
talented and experienced people who can -- either through the work force or 
through volunteer activities -- be an extremely productive segment of our 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Friedan, Deets doesn't care for the term senior citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many variables to comfortably label such a big group of 
people," he said. "And perhaps it's just as well we don't. If we can put a 
label on something, we tend to stereotype it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically are trying to get people to understand that life is not easily 
divided into youth, middle age and old age -- that it's more of a continuum 
than a series of snapshots, and what your capabilities are at any given age are 
often going to be affected by your health and the opportunities that are 
presented to you." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he said, "age is not necessarily going to be the barrier."

WARRIOR DREAMS?; JAMES GIBSON THINKS OUR LOSS IN VIETNAM TRIGGERED FEELINGS OF 
ANGST AND VISIONS OF RAMBO IN SOME MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The boy, 11 years old, slams a shell into a double-barrel 12-gauge, swivels, 
and shoots from the hip. Out in Lytle Creek wash, a battered plastic milk jug 
jolts and skitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the chalky dust has settled, the boy reloads and fires again. And 
again. Despite the shotgun's roar, his pink-cheeked face remains a blank slate 
of sang-froid. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty feet away, a fellow in a polo shirt and freshly pressed chinos pulls up 
in a sports car, sets an uncorked bottle of red wine out in the dirt, then 
opens up on it with a semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 This man, too, is expressionless, as are most of the hundreds of people 
blazing away in this designated free-fire zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But James William Gibson has a hunch about what's on these shooters' minds. 
Surveying the Sunday morning mayhem in this scruffy strip of the San Bernardino 
National Forest, Gibson, an associate professor of sociology at Cal State Long 
Beach, sees ample evidence to support the title of his book: "Warrior Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 From ex-Marines sniping at a refrigerator to the gangster types drawing down 
on the realty signs, soccer balls, microwave ovens and bowling pins they have 
hauled out as targets, Gibson sees hints that would seem to bolster his theory: 
In the wake of this country's losing war in Vietnam, American males latched 
onto Rambo fantasies, embracing a mythic battle against evil by men who must 
step outside the bounds of an unappreciative society. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same morning Gibson tours this designated shooting area near Fontana, 
in fact, federal officers are rounding up suspects across Southern California, 
accusing them of vague but ominous paramilitary-type activity. Gibson's not 
surprised by the next day's stories, which make it sound as if the fatigue-clad 
"warriors" were training for some sort of mercenary activity, real or imagined. 
 
</P>
<P>
 As he sees things, America's paramilitary fantasy plays itself out in behavior 
that runs the gamut from dorky to dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 His interest in the subject is not purely academic. An incident from his youth 
still reverberates in his conscience -- and, it might be assumed, in the pages 
of his book. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson grew up in Ft. Worth, Tex. His father, a World War II veteran, "had 
seen enough of weapons," Gibson says. So the boy did his hunting with an uncle 
or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 His youthful passion for blood sport ended one evening when Gibson was about 
17. That night, he and some pals put on camouflage gear, darkened their faces, 
and set off armed to the teeth in imitation of the scenes they'd seen in 
countless war movies and on television shows such as "Combat." 
</P>
<P>
 Up in the rolling hills of north-central Texas, they came upon a tree full of 
raccoons. The teen-agers took up positions and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The raccoons all fell out of the tree, but we hadn't killed them," Gibson 
says. "The noise they made, their crying, sounded just like human babies. We 
spent hours chasing them down and trying to put them out of their misery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt so bad," says Gibson, 42. "I realized I'd sacrificed those raccoons 
for my childish fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Gibson's last mock battle until he began researching "Warrior 
Dreams." In the meantime, he earned his doctorate in sociology from Yale and a 
student deferment from serving in the military during Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the war had an impact on Gibson. In 1986, he published a book about 
U.S. military technocracy in Vietnam: "The Perfect War -- The War We Couldn't 
Lose and How We Did."  
</P>
<P>
 Research for that scholarly effort immersed him in the mythology of warfare. 
But what he discovered, he says, is that most of the soldiers who saw combat 
quickly rejected John Wayne movie romanticism as bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one positive thing that came after Vietnam," Gibson says, "is that the 
war movie definitely died out." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the early '80s, Gibson points out, a new breed of movie rose up to 
glorify a new breed of warrior: the Rambos, Road Warriors and Conan the 
Barbarians.  
</P>
<P>
 Morbid fascination and scholarly instincts fused. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to understand this new version of the soldier and the resilience of 
war mythology, he says: "What gave it the power to resurrect itself 10 years 
after it was crushed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson subscribed to Soldier of Fortune magazine and hung out with the 
warriors and wanna-bes at one of that mercenary magazine's gun-ho gatherings. 
He pulled on camouflage, painted his face and engaged in elaborate paint-ball 
battles in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 He also plunged into an activity for which only a small percentage of the male 
population has the guts, the time or the tastelessness: reading 
survivalist-style potboilers with such titles as "Vigilante," "Mack Bolan, the 
Executioner" and "Casca, the Eternal Mercenary." 
</P>
<P>
 The themes he turned up in film, books and in one-on-one interviews disturb 
him.  
</P>
<P>
 America's defeat in Vietnam, coupled with the growing influence of women and 
minorities, have left a segment of the male population feeling impotent, he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 The new warrior came to see himself preparing for, or engaged in, a "New War." 
The enemy forces, Gibson says, include not only crooks and communists, but also 
the "liberals" whom the warrior believes run the country. It is significant and 
disturbing, Gibson says, that unlike the heroes of WWII legend, who fought to 
preserve society, the new warrior feels betrayed by his society and fights 
outside it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's warriors have only one purpose. They exist to keep fighting. Fighting 
any enemy is seen as the best of all possible lives. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior dreams seeped into American thinking at every level in the 1980s, 
Gibson says. In the broadest sense, the mythology remained dilute: Millions of 
people enjoyed the Ramboesque films, and some absorbed their political 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 On another level, a relative few new warriors swaggered around with the fancy 
assault-style weaponry that manufacturers aggressively marketed to their 
new-found tastes, Gibson says.  
</P>
<P>
 And from time to time over the past 15 years, he adds, a hard-core minority of 
new warriors have acted out their aggressions in racist organizations or 
individually, in the sort of lone-gunman mass murders that make headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gibson's view, though, the ultimate expression of new warriorism was the 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations' foreign policy, from the 
invasion of Grenada to the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious manifestation of new warrior thinking -- that the good guys 
must now fight outside the constraints of the system -- surfaced during the 
Iran-Contra affair, Gibson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Oliver North testified in July, 1987," Gibson writes, "he was speaking 
to a nation saturated with New War fantasies and actual political-military 
programs, both of which made war and the warrior essential to America's 
salvation and survival." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the people Gibson considers key contributors to the new warrior 
mythology agree that there are wanna-be warriors afoot and that their behavior 
can be pretty goofy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert K. Brown, the founding editor of Soldier of Fortune, doubts that 
these people -- other than the few oddballs -- pose much of a problem. "Does he 
get the same heartburn from people who dress up and re-enact Civil War battles 
or Revolutionary War battles?" he wonders of Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 He also doubts the origins of this species: "The idea that all this has 
occurred because of Vietnam trauma is a bunch of bull. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 John Milius, who wrote and directed the archetypal warrior movie "Red Dawn," 
takes a similar view: "There's always been stuff like that. I don't think it's 
particular to this time. . . . The Black Panthers were a paramilitary 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cooper, the articulate and notoriously opinionated owner of the Gunsite 
Ranch shooting school in Arizona, would almost certainly place Gibson among the 
domestic enemies of the United States, which he lumps together as CLAMS -- 
"Congressional Left, Academics, Media." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gibson has proved that he ain't just another liberal wienie. Signing up 
for Gunsite in 1988 without revealing his trade, Gibson joined police officers, 
federal agents and all variety of wanna-be gunslingers in a weeklong combat 
shooting course. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the professor blasted his way to the third-highest ranking for 
his class. In the process, he was momentarily transformed into "the armed man . 
. . the reborn warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cooper's philosophy of violence had become part of me," he writes in "Warrior 
Dreams." "Political ideas, shooting techniques, and flesh united to form a cold 
killing machine. . . . It felt like the energy roared down my arms until it 
formed a tunnel that extended out to wherever I aimed my weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles into the national forest, Gibson watches shooters of every 
description fire weapons of every description at targets of every description. 
He is particularly unsettled by the group blasting away at a pink stuffed 
bunny, a stuffed dog and a teddy bear that had been propped up in the rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's sacrilege," he says, as the snap, crackle and ca-boom of 
gunshots float on the wind and echo like thunder down the side of canyons. When 
questioned, none of the shooters in Lytle Creek say they are lost in warrior 
reverie or imagine themselves killing liberal foes as they squeeze the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 As one man with a legal AK-47 says: "If I'm shooting at a tire, I'm shooting 
at a tire. I'm focusing on that target." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson is skeptical. To him, the type of weapons -- not to mention the 
symbolic targets such as teddy bears -- suggest that many of the shooters 
fantasize about killing as they fire. 
</P>
<P>
 That repulses him. At the same time, he understands the allure of the warrior 
myth. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia on this Sunday morning, Serbian soldiers slaughter Muslims. In 
Rwanda, tens of thousands of gallons of blood flow. And just a few miles from 
Lytle Creek, young men in suits of armor joust and engage in mock sword fights 
at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think a need for challenge, adventure, risk is biologically wired 
into men," Gibson says. "The question is, do you make the warrior identity the 
only symbol of manhood?"

THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS; THE TEMPTATION TO SNOOP IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BATHROOM 
CABINETS CAN BE IRRESISTIBLE. VISITORS IN YOUR HOME JUST MIGHT BE DOING THE 
SAME THING UNTO YOU.

 The party started more than an hour ago. Now, your host's house is brimming 
with interesting characters chatting against a backdrop of soft music. 
</P>
<P>
 And there you are . . . in the bathroom . . . slowly unlatching the small 
mirrored door above the wash basin . . . giving the toilet a quick flush with 
your free hand to muffle any telltale sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 You draw in a breath and hold it, afraid a bottle or two will come crashing 
into the sink. But the door opens with nothing more than a click . 
</P>
<P>
 Yesssss, you say to yourself while taking inventory, you are a low-life, an 
incorrigible medicine cabinet snoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do generally upstanding, respectable folks -- who wouldn't lie, cheat or 
steal -- find it perfectly OK to root through your medicine cabinet like DEA 
agents with a search warrant? 
</P>
<P>
 We went to the experts to get the scoop on snooping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some of us, "there's a certain thrill in breaking any kind of rule," says 
Gary Emery, a Los Angeles psychologist who has "occasionally" looked in others' 
medicine cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeking, he says, "has a kind of voyeuristic quality." It might also be a 
backward way of trying to get to know someone better -- a kind of mission to 
find out personal details, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medicine cabinets are where you find secrets," agrees Dr. Troy Thompson, 
chair of the psychiatry department at Jefferson Medical College and Hospital in 
Philadelphia. "People are naturally curious, and they like to know things about 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has tackled this burning issue. In the 1991 movie, "Father of the 
Bride," Steve Martin rifles through the medicine cabinet of his prospective 
in-laws. More recently, Ann-Margret sneaks a peek at the medicine cabinet of 
her neighbor Jack Lemmon in "Grumpy Old Men." 
</P>
<P>
 "Medicine cabinets are treasure troves," Thompson says. "Look in, and you can 
find out if someone has a disease, a medical condition requiring treatment, 
their contraceptive practices and how vain they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Jeanne Curran, a professor at California State University, 
Dominguez Hills, cites another motivation for snooping. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, people are having a terrible problem with trust," she says. "A 
medicine cabinet contains objects, and we have a weird faith in objective 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Its contents can verify information. For example, he says he's into preventive 
health; you spot his vitamin supply. She says she can't meet you for lunch 
because she has an eye doctor appointment; her cabinet stores her contact lens 
cleaning solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The innards of a medicine cabinet also reveal a thing or two about fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say she says she loves you and you alone, but when you open the medicine 
cabinet, you find a razor that definitely is not your razor, nor are the little 
shavings your shavings. 
</P>
<P>
 Or he says you are the only one for him, but when you go inside the medicine 
cabinet to retrieve your Chanel No. 5, you notice there's a bottle of Jean Nate 
on the bottom shelf, next to two toothbrushes -- his and not yours. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the attraction to medicine cabinets? After all, this story isn't about 
rummaging through glove compartments or socks drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 Face it, bathrooms are fertile ground for snooping. Your poking around is 
unseen by others, you can take as much time as you need, you generally are 
uninterrupted, and running water from various sources is a natural muffler as 
you proceed full throttle on your search-and-discover mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some peeking is nosiness, pure and simple, as Curran well knows. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, she kept a plastic Venus de Milo statue, made up with lipstick, in 
her bathtub with the curtain drawn. When she had guests, she made it a point to 
watch their expressions as they exited her bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could always tell who had drawn back the curtain," she says, "by the looks 
on their faces."

BODY WATCH; STATE HEALTH CHIEF KIMBERLY BELSHE HAS HER SHARE OF CRITICS. THEY 
RAILED AT HER OPPOSITION TO AN ANTI-SMOKING INITIATIVE. NOW IT'S HER PROPOSED 
USE OF AGENCY FUNDS. BUT TOUGH TIMES, SHE SAYS, CALL FOR . . .; TOUGH CHOICES

<P>
 Kimberly Belshe strides through the day-care center in Irvine and spots a 
group of tots munching on raisins. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good!" praises the tall woman in the red blazer as she wags a finger, 
mommy-style. "Eat your five a day." 
</P>
<P>
 "Five a day" is the state's campaign to encourage Californians, big and small, 
to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the 3-year-olds don't give a raisin that this advice comes from the 
director of the state Department of Health Services herself, something about 
Belshe's manner causes them to turn and peer quizzically at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this day, at the Sporting Club in Irvine, she presides amiably over a 
group of older schoolchildren who are building the world's largest salad as 
part of an American Cancer Society event on healthy eating. 
</P>
<P>
 The new director of the DHS has a way of getting people's attention, no matter 
what their age -- although with adults, Belshe has had to put up with some back 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gov. Pete Wilson appointed the 34-year-old to direct the DHS in 
November, Belshe has had to defend herself repeatedly against a firestorm of 
criticism questioning her position on the state's anti-smoking campaign and her 
job qualifications -- she is not a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly the deputy secretary of the Health and Welfare Agency, Belshe 
(pronounced Bel-SHAY) is known in Sacramento as a straightforward and smoothly 
professional administrator. But she has kept a low profile in her first six 
months on the job, either because of her massive workload as chief of the 
5,000-employee department or the opposition her appointment triggered. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with her recent Senate confirmation, Belshe is ready to talk about her 
agenda -- and the item on her resume that threatened to derail her nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 While at the San Francisco public relations firm Ogilvy and Mather six years 
ago, Belshe helped the tobacco industry oppose Proposition 99, the landmark 
1988 anti-smoking initiative that increased the tax on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 This little factoid floored observers when it came to light in November and 
led some health leaders to charge that Belshe would be unable to reconcile her 
past position with her current duty to lead Californians to better health. 
</P>
<P>
 During a lengthy interview, Belshe does not shy away from addressing this 
paradox. She even sighs with some relief: "It's so nice to actually be asked 
that question." Her critics, she says, have not bothered to give her the 
opportunity to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's like this, Belshe says: She worked at Ogilvy and Mather for only a few 
months after finishing grad school. She wasn't working directly for the tobacco 
industry, but in a lobbyist role for a coalition, including the Republican 
Party and the California Taxpayers Union, which opposed Proposition 99. She is 
a nonsmoker who dislikes smoking and thinks that it's bad for your health. But 
she viewed Proposition 99 as a tax initiative, not a health initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 She says her thinking about Proposition 99 has evolved considerably since 
1988, and she now praises the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not, she states emphatically, a tobacco-industry sympathizer who is 
insincere about her public health agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I say to folks when this issue comes up -- and it's rarely acknowledged 
-- is I would hope that my commitment to educating the public about the adverse 
consequences of smoking . . . be judged not on a three-month stint working for 
a public affairs firm but be based upon my demonstrated record while in 
positions of authority over the course of the past 3 1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe is angered that her sincerity is questioned even now. 
</P>
<P>
 "My critics point out that it is just unconscionable that I could have done 
public affairs work opposing the tax initiative," she says. "That inference I 
find extremely disconcerting because it's really questioning my integrity, when 
if anything, I think I have demonstrated over the last three years (as deputy 
secretary) that I am someone with a lot of honesty and openness." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 99, which taxes cigarettes to raise money for anti-smoking 
education programs and media campaigns, is recognized by many as one of the 
most ambitious, innovative and successful public health campaigns in the 
nation. It is credited with reducing the number of adult smokers in the state 
by 28%.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, a debate has arisen about how to spend the Proposition 99 
revenues (which usually amount to about $700,000 yearly) under a 
reauthorization the bill. Anti-smoking proponents charge that the Wilson 
Administration wants to divert a significant share of the funds to other health 
programs instead of anti-smoking programs and that Belshe -- again under fire 
-- supports this.  
</P>
<P>
 Says Mark Pertschuk, co-director of the Berkeley-based nonprofit group 
Americans for Nonsmokers Rights: "There are two things we would have wanted 
from Belshe. The first is a clear, public statement that (her 1988 opposition 
to Proposition 99) was a mistake. And the second is an opposition to the 
diversion of funds from Prop. 99, which she has supported. We consider that a 
violation of the voters' will and an extremely bad public health policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Other anti-smoking leaders say they believe that Belshe will support whatever 
Wilson wants, even if it is not in the best interest of public health goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belshe may be privately committed (to anti-smoking efforts), but I don't feel 
this Administration is," says Carolyn Martin, an American Lung Assn. volunteer 
and vice chairman of the Tobacco Education Oversight Committee, which reports 
to the Legislature on anti-smoking programs.  
</P>
<P>
 "This Administration has procured a budget that decimates the smoking 
education program. This is the premiere prevention program in the United 
States, and we are on the brink of extinction. We need strong, courageous 
leadership, and whether (Belshe) has the courage to publicly question some of 
Wilson's decisions, I can't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy thrusts Belshe into a debate on how important anti-smoking 
programs are in comparison to the other state health programs competing for 
funding, such as immunization, control of tuberculosis, school-based health 
programs, HIV prevention and treatment, sexually transmitted diseases, violence 
and health screening for low-income children. 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe says these are all high-priority programs and she supports Wilson's 
proposal to share the Proposition 99 funds. "Arguably, all of the programs 
funded by (Proposition 99) moneys are being used in a manner consistent . . . 
with the initiative overall," she says. "What this whole debate boils down to, 
from our perspective, is a very very difficult decision we have to make in 
terms of balancing competing public health priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's in this difficult context that friends and colleagues say Belshe 
shines. 
</P>
<P>
 She is known as someone who can bring opposing factions together in pursuit of 
a compromise. And she has a reputation for her ability to make hard choices 
while withstanding the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "She listens very closely to both opposing and supporting arguments about 
policy decisions," says her good friend and former colleague Kassy Edgington 
Perry, now with Greenbaum Public Relations in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not an ideologue in a sense that 'this is the conservative way to do 
this.' Yet at the same time, she is very tough about what she believes in."  
</P>
<P>
 Belshe's smooth passage through her confirmation hearings reflects the respect 
lawmakers have for her administrative abilities, says Assemblyman Phil Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe "understands policy implications intuitively. And she is not a 
bureaucrat," Isenberg says. "That does not mean I agree with everything she 
does. But she does not come up with reams of paper and a cadre of excuses in 
order to say, 'Nothing can be done.' And in government, believe me, that's 
rare." 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe also comes across as fun-loving and good-natured. A fifth-generation 
San Franciscan, she is an athlete who loves tennis, golf and workouts at the 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for the health director to set a good example," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 She is single, and although she puts in long hours -- at a salary of $95,052 
-- she argues that she is not, by nature, a workaholic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I continue to work these hours, I will probably always be single," she 
says with a laugh. "People say, 'How do you like your job?' I say, 'I love my 
job. I hate my personal life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe was attracted to politics early on, majoring in government as a Harvard 
undergraduate. She became interested in health care economic issues while 
pursuing her master's in public administration at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 A thin woman with a no-nonsense short haircut and soft brown eyes, Belshe says 
she must rely heavily on the physicians in her department for guidance on some 
issues. Most DHS directors -- such as her predecessor, Molly Joel Coye -- were 
medical doctors. (Coye resigned to take a job in the private sector). 
</P>
<P>
 But Belshe contends that some of the biggest decisions for the department 
today are fiscal ones. The Proposition 99 funding controversy is typical of the 
hard choices that must be made by the state's leaders in an era of shrinking 
budgets and fiscal crisis, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "That truly has been the biggest challenge: How do you structure innovative 
and creative and compassionate solutions to what are clearly some very, very 
compelling problems in the health care arena at the same time you are enacting 
millions and millions and millions of dollars in reductions? It hasn't been 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Belshe has made health care reform a top priority, continuing Coye's work to 
restructure MediCal into a more cost-effective, managed-care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 She also emphasizes prevention, such as immunization programs and an ambitious 
program to reduce teen pregnancies, Education Now and Babies Later. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Belshe says, the state has worked diligently to thwart a resurgence 
of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she differs from many public health leaders when it comes to spending 
money on undocumented immigrants, taking the hard line that the federal 
government -- and not the state -- is responsible for health care of 
undocumented people. For example, the state recently cut a program to provide 
prenatal care to undocumented women. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for emergency care and efforts to limit the spread of communicable 
disease, Belshe says undocumented immigrants should be denied services from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line? Tough budget times, tough choices," she says.

 Before assuming that your circle of family and friends is too high-class to 
stoop to snooping, consider these results of a random, unscientific medicine 
cabinet survey of 15 Angelenos (9 of whom are admitted snoopers): 
</P>
<P>
 * "I look," says one woman, "but just for dental floss." 
</P>
<P>
 * Another looks in her mother-in-law's medicine cabinet "just to be sure she 
is taking all her medication."

<P>
 * Of the six respondents who say they do not snoop, two are snoops in 
recovery. One felt guilty, the other was bored from never finding anything 
exciting. KATHLEEN DOHENY

'REALITY BITES' BRINGS ANOTHER KNACK ATTACK; POP MUSIC: THE FILM AND ITS HIT 
SOUNDTRACK ALBUM HAVE PROPELLED THE GROUP BACK ON RADIO AND ON VH1. THE BAND 
PLAYS THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Knack is back. Like some weird, foggy memory from a long-forgotten dream, 
like a living reincarnation of simpler and more naive times, it has returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The original, meteoric rise and fall of the prototype "power pop" group was 
unusually extreme, even by today's fickle, rock 'n' roll flavor-of-the-month 
standards. But the fact that the sunny, goofy Knack, of all groups, is once 
more a hot item during the heyday of such dark musical statements as grunge and 
gangsta rap proves that fate and public taste are curious and unpredictable 
things, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost anyone between the ages of 18 and 47 will feel a twinge of nostalgia 
when they turn on the radio today and hear the Knack's "My Sharona" pumping 
from the speakers. When the song was released in the summer of 1979 as the 
first single from the group's "Get the Knack" debut album, it sold 2 million 
units in less than a month and held the top position on the charts for six 
weeks, helping usher in the new wave era. 
</P>
<P>
 The pounding, simple-but-eminently-memorable guitar hook of the song, coupled 
with the "m-m-m-my-my-WOOOO!" vocal refrain was classic rock 'n' roll in all 
its blissful ridiculousness, a successor to the rave-up traditions of "Louie, 
Louie," "Wild Thing," and "Twist and Shout." Seemingly overnight, "My Sharona" 
propelled the Los Angeles quartet to the front lines of the international rock 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who got the Knack in 1979 had apparently had enough of them by 1980; 
a critical and popular backlash against the group set in as quickly as had the 
fame. A follow-up album, coyly titled "But the Little Girls Understand," 
performed poorly, and in 1981, the Knack called it a night. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief and abortive reunion 10 years later seemed the final, belated nail in 
the coffin -- until the release of the film "Reality Bites" earlier this year. 
Included in the movie (and the hit soundtrack album) is "My Sharona," which 
has, curiously, found another niche on radio and on VH1. A hopeful Knack has 
once again reformed and is in the midst of a national tour, which brings the 
band to the Coach House tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, what this says is that the music has value, and we always knew it 
did," said Knack front man Doug Fieger in a recent phone interview. "It's just 
a nice reminder. We didn't have any plans on touring until this happened, and 
it happened completely organically. We got a call from a rather big agent, 
saying, 'We're getting a lot of response from this. Do you guys want to do 
something with it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The newfound demand for the group came at a propitious time for Fieger, now 
41. The singer-guitarist recently put the finishing touches on a solo album, 
which includes such guest musicians as Don Was, Nicky Hopkins, Jim Keltner, 
Billy Preston, Ray Manzarek and Benmont Tench. A renewed interest in the Knack 
can do nothing but help Fieger's prospects for landing a sweeter solo album 
deal and tour support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The album will come out eventually; it's just that it's probably better to 
wait a little while because of what's happening with the Knack," Fieger said. 
"I'd love to go out and tour with a band for the solo album, but I also 
understand the reality of piquing people's interest. The way the system's set 
up these days, there's no proving grounds anymore. In order to be able to tour, 
there's got to be public interest, people have to know who you are. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that I'm in the Knack can't help but introduce me and what I'll be 
doing other than the Knack. But at the same time, I'm really enjoying playing 
these songs that I haven't played in years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Successfully going back in time must be a sweet measure of revenge for Fieger. 
After the original success of "My Sharona," the Knack was knocked by the press 
for being a vacuous, cynical product of hype, a group that vaingloriously 
attempted to retrace the steps of the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever one's opinion of the Knack's musical merit, this rap against the band 
seems particularly vicious and unfair in retrospect. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's music bore more resemblance to other British hit-makers such as the 
Kinks and the Who than it did the Beatles, and virtually dozens of other new 
wave acts took nods of their own to British beat groups without any criticism 
at all. And while the back cover of "Get the Knack" was a play on the Beatles' 
"Hard Day's Night" album, this was obviously done more as a good-natured wink 
than any serious attempt to compare themselves with the fabled mop tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "The criticism leveled at the Knack was specious from the get-go," Fieger 
said. "The reality is that if we had sold 50,000 albums instead of 5 1/2 
million, everybody, especially the critics, would have gotten that (Beatles) 
joke and loved it. The backlash was about our success, not what we were doing. 
Once you sell a lot of records, you're no longer cool. They said we were a 
bunch of hype, but I think Capitol Records spent a total of $50,000 promoting 
the first album, which is nothing. The perception of us, because it happened so 
fast, was that it couldn't be real. But it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also think L.A. critics have a tendency not to root for their local bands. 
If something comes from England or Seattle or Athens or wherever, they're more 
likely to jump on the bandwagon. There's not a real feeling of community or 
camaraderie here." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the Knack -- at least for the time being -- is functioning as an 
oldies act, performing material from nearly decade-and-a-half-old albums on the 
road. But Fieger is the first to realize and admit that the fans come out 
mostly just to hear the one song he'll forever be identified with, and he seems 
comfortable enough with that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways it's frustrating because you want people to listen past 'My 
Sharona,' " he said. "But I love 'My Sharona.' I think it's a very interesting 
record and a very well-constructed rock 'n' roll song. I don't think it's the 
best song I've ever written, but I guess it will probably be the most 
successful song I'll ever have." 
</P>

Juan Capistrano. The Muffs open at 8. $17.50. (714) 496-8930.

SLIDE IN PRICE OF OIL LEADS TO BUST AND BOON; ENERGY: LOCAL COMPANIES FARE 
DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR ROLE IN THE INDUSTRY. SOME ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE 
THEIR OUTLOOK BY DIVERSIFYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A sharp drop in oil prices over the past year has hurt two local oil producers 
and a drilling equipment company, but the change has also helped a maker of 
liquid asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 The production companies -- Benton Oil and Gas Co. in Oxnard and Agoura 
Hills-based Fortune Petroleum Corp. -- both reported large losses in 1993, due 
in part to the decline in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula-based H&H Oil Tool Co., which supplies drilling equipment and 
services to oil and gas producers, has seen its profits and revenues climb even 
though its business has slowed in some areas because low oil prices have 
contributed to a slowing of certain drilling activities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Huntway Partners in Valencia had a profit turnaround in the latter 
part of 1993, after losses in 1992 and the first half of last year. Part of the 
reason for the improvement is that crude oil is the key ingredient in the 
liquid asphalt Huntway makes, so low oil prices amount to big cost savings for 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices, notoriously vulnerable to political events, spiked as high as $40 
a barrel during the Gulf War in 1991. But in the past year, prices have been 
held down by worldwide oversupply as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries has failed to reach agreement to cut production. The price of crude 
oil hit about $13 a barrel in early April, down from $20 about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although oil prices have risen to about $16.50 currently, many analysts expect 
them to remain soft for some time. John M. Selser, an oil and natural gas 
analyst at the investment firm Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs in New 
Orleans, expects that oil prices will remain in the $15-to-$16-a-barrel range 
for the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton Oil and Fortune Petroleum say they've responded to falling oil prices 
by spending more money exploring for natural gas, which has had relatively 
strong prices recently. The price of natural gas is currently about $2.15 per 
1,000 cubic feet, compared with as little as $1 a couple of years ago. Analyst 
Selser thinks gas will reach $2.25 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Local oil companies have had other troubles as well. Benton Oil last month 
reported a $4.8-million net loss for 1993, compared with a year-earlier loss of 
$2.9 million, while its revenue fell 9%, to $7.8 million from $8.6 million in 
1992. The big loss and revenue decline last year was mostly due to lower 
domestic oil and gas production, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benton Oil spokesman Gregory Grabar said declining oil prices probably 
accounted for 10% of the drop in revenue. This year the company is curtailing 
its domestic oil activities, centered in the Gulf Coast region of Louisiana, 
and is instead planning to drill four to six deep natural gas wells there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as a company right now are about 90% oil," said Grabar. "We'd like to 
change that mix and get more natural gas production." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Benton will also cut capital expenditures on its Russian joint venture 
in western Siberia because of a $4.70-per-barrel oil export tax imposed by the 
Russians -- which Benton and other American oil companies are hoping will be 
rescinded -- coupled with low oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Grabar said Benton will continue to emphasize its oil and gas 
projects in its third production area, in Venezuela. Benton doesn't actually 
own the oil and gas reserves from its Venezuelan drilling operations, but 
rather is paid by the country under an agreement that gives Benton some 
protection from the ups and downs of the prices of those commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling oil prices were cited by Fortune Petroleum as a major reason for its 
big 1993 loss. The company took a one-time, $1.9-million charge in the fourth 
quarter because of lower oil prices, which contributed to its $3.65-million 
loss for the year on a 31% increase in revenue to $2.83 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone J. Fairbanks, Fortune's vice president and chief financial officer, 
said that his company derived 80% of its revenue from California oil production 
a few years ago, but it has shifted focus and made acquisitions to lessen its 
dependence on oil. It is now positioned to receive about 75% of its revenue 
from natural gas production in Texas, he said, which should begin showing up in 
the company's financial results this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairbanks said there are other factors making natural gas more attractive. The 
demand for natural gas, a relatively clean-burning fuel, will strengthen as 
states and municipalities enforce clean-air requirements and if auto makers 
ever mass-produce natural-gas vehicles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite intently focusing on natural gas and not on oil production," 
Fairbanks said. "We want to make sure Fortune is positioned for what the future 
is going to bring." 
</P>
<P>
 H&H Oil Tool President and Chief Executive Henry H. Rushing said that low oil 
prices combined with California's discouraging regulatory climate has hurt his 
business renting drilling and production equipment. "We can't make it if the 
oil companies can't make it," he said. Indeed, 75% of H&H's revenue last year 
came from California, but Rushing said its California operations were not 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 H&H did report a $1.55-million profit for 1993, compared to a year-earlier 
loss of $1.76 million, while its revenue rose 9% to $21.7 million from $19.9 
million. But Rushing said all the earnings were generated by its operations in 
Rocky Mountain states such as Utah and Wyoming that it acquired over the past 
few years. Natural gas and even some oil production has continued in the Rocky 
Mountain region, he said, because the costs for complying with regulations 
there are far lower for oil exploration companies than in California. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Rushing said that H&H will continue to emphasize its 
out-of-state business. Last year, the company spent half its capital budget 
outside California; this year, it will be 75%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While some companies have been hurt by low oil prices, for Huntway Partners 
the price drop has provided needed relief. A year ago, the company revised its 
loss for the first nine months of 1992 to $10.9 million, compared to a 
$1.9-million loss it had reported earlier. It said its former chief financial 
officer had misstated inventories, accounts payable and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntway has since restructured its debt and shut down its Arizona liquid 
asphalt refinery operations to cut costs. It recovered with a $1.09-million 
profit in the fourth quarter of last year, although for all of 1993 it lost 
$18.7 million on a 4% decline in revenue to $100.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren J. Nelson, Huntway's executive vice president and chief financial 
officer, hired after his predecessor was fired for the accounting errors, said 
that oil prices are critical to the company because crude oil is the main 
ingredient in its products and its biggest cost item. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter of 1993, Nelson said, Huntway's average price for crude 
oil was about $3 a barrel cheaper than in the second quarter. With sales of 
about 1.2 million barrels a quarter, that represents a savings of $3.6 million. 
Although some of those savings dissipate as Huntway lowers prices on its 
asphalt products, much of it goes to the bottom line, Nelson said, and so has 
helped the company regain profitability.

HANGING ON BY A THREAD AFTER HALF A CENTURY; TEXTILES: BURGLARIES, FIRE, RIOT 
AND RECESSION HAVE SO FAR NOT MANAGED TO FINISH THE LEVINE BROS. 
TAILORING-SUPPLY AND FABRIC COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, Allan Franklin and Sidney Penchansky really mean it. The 
brothers-in-law say if they can't turn around their family textile business in 
the next few months, they will give up and sell, ending three generations of 
family ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go on at this rate," said Franklin, who with Penchansky is vice 
president of Levine Bros. Inc. Battered by burglaries, a fire, the Los Angeles 
riots, the recession and the earthquake, Levine Bros.' sales of tailoring 
supplies and wool fabric have dropped 50% since 1992, Franklin said. The 
brothers are making their last stand in North Hollywood, having ended the 
company's half-century in Downtown Los Angeles' garment district. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Levine Bros. has come close to closing. Franklin's 
father-in-law, who died in 1990, planned for years to wind it down, convinced 
that the market for the custom-tailoring supplies he sold was receding before a 
tide of ready-made suits. He never quite got around to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, after a $1.5-million fire gutted the building on South Los 
Angeles Street in Downtown's garment district, family members again resolved to 
sell the assets and close the business. But there seemed to be no end to Levine 
Bros.' payments to collect and inventory to liquidate. And there was the 
problem of selling the damaged store, Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 So last fall, the brothers bought a new store on Lankershim Boulevard, with a 
$500,000 mortgage, in the hope that this anachronistic business that depends on 
the market for custom-made suits could make a strong comeback. Franklin, 57, 
who gave up his printing business to try to salvage Levine Bros., still can't 
talk about the decision without pressing his hands to his face. "I guess of the 
two of us, I'm the optimist," he said, wanly. "I think we can turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine Bros. sells fine woolen cloth and sewing equipment to custom tailors, 
alteration shops, dry cleaners, department stores and Hollywood costume houses. 
Although 70% of Levine Bros.' sales are by mail order, the company's highest 
profit margins and what Franklin calls "the beauty of the business" are from 
its in-store sales of fine cloth -- tweeds, crepes, gabardines and wool 
cashmeres -- to walk-in tailors. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of sales is related to the entertainment industry; fabric from 
Levine Bros. has made costumes in movies such as "Indecent Proposal" and 
"Bugsy." Other buyers of custom-made suits from Levine Bros. customers are the 
wealthy, and those who wear odd sizes not easily found in department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin is clearly at home selling cloth. He is a man who says he "goes 
bananas" if there isn't exactly one-half inch of shirt cuff protruding from his 
sleeve. He used to dress mannequins for department stores, and although he's 
polite about it, he can't disguise a little dismay at what most people consider 
comfortable attire. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Penchansky, 48, who gave up his taxi business to run Levine Bros. -- 
are hoping an updated mail-order catalogue, a change in the region's economy, 
and, if they're lucky, a revival of custom-tailored clothes, will help the 
company survive. "It all depends on the next couple of months," Franklin said. 
He said the company needs a 50% increase in sales this year to put it back in 
the black. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Levine Bros. building on South Los Angeles Street -- now blackened and 
boarded up -- is owned outright by the firm. But the building needs about 
$600,000 in repairs, which the brothers-in-law plan to complete with the help 
of insurance so they can put it up for lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The company they are trying to keep alive was founded in New York in 1923 by 
six brothers of a Russian immigrant family, said Elaine Franklin, Allan 
Franklin's wife. In the early 1930s, the Levine brothers moved to Los Angeles' 
garment district, where the company thrived, even opening branches in San Diego 
and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers weren't fabulously rich, but they lived well. They passed the 
business on to their nephews while still living, and the last of the original 
six was in his 90s when he died just over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the store's success always hinged on demand for close-fitting, tailored 
clothes, a demand that has waned in the decades since stars like Cary Grant 
wore suits that made their torsos appear to have been chiseled from stone. 
"Everyone has decided to wear tennis shoes and jeans," said Franklin wearily, 
himself impeccable in a houndstooth jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company once had a score of competitors, today there are only 
about half a dozen companies in the country that cater to custom tailors, he 
added. Levine Bros. now has 15 employees, down from 25 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, Franklin and Penchansky made healthy gains when they took over 
the business in 1990. They computerized the company, settled old debts, 
switched to cheaper insurance, doubled the inventory to $800,000 and 
concentrated on customer service. They were rewarded by about a 15% increase in 
sales the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Downtown L.A. neighborhood was getting increasingly rough. A burglary 
per month was the norm. Customers were afraid to come to the store because of 
crime. Those who did come often found their cars had been burglarized while 
they shopped. Employees never dared stay past 5:30 p.m., Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although L.A.'s garment district was growing, its character had changed. 
Franklin said that clothing manufacturers, and cutters, dyers and finishers -- 
who were important customers of Levine Bros. -- had slowly been replaced by 
swap shops and retail outlets that did little to enhance his business. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on April 19, 1992, shortly before the riots, the store caught fire. 
Franklin believes the fire was set by burglars, although the Fire Department 
said there was too much damage to determine a cause. The building was unusable, 
and tens of thousands of dollars of inventory was destroyed by water. Franklin 
braved the smoke to carry out a few yards of his finest cashmere-blend cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 The business took up temporary residence in a leased warehouse down the street 
from the boarded-up store, surviving on its mail-order business until it moved 
to its new quarters. "I didn't want to go Downtown any more. My heart wasn't in 
it," said Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Levine Bros. departure from Downtown has been repeated by many of 
the district's garment manufacturers and related businesses in recent years. 
Crime, high rents and parking problems have prompted many to move. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with this dispersal is that garment manufacturers do better in 
clusters: "It's very much an industry where you need kind of a critical mass of 
companies together in one spot," said Barry Sedlik, manager of business 
retention for Southern California Edison, which is looking at ways to keep the 
garment industry in L.A. "If someone told us where the garment district is 
moving, we'd go there," echoed Franklin, adding that the company's new spot in 
North Hollywood is at least close to many studios' costume houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Garment making employs more than 100,000 people in Los Angeles County and is 
growing. But Sedlik contends the industry often gets scant attention because it 
is organized as a constellation of small, marginal companies, including design 
houses and their subcontractors. He thinks the city needs to learn better ways 
to address the problems of small firms like Franklin's or risk losing them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Franklin is watching for news that the economy is changing, 
and thumbing through trendy women's clothing catalogues for signs that the new 
season will bring a return of the tailored look he favors. In those pages he 
sees mostly loose-fitting, unstructured jackets and skirts. But he holds out 
hope that good tailoring, and good taste, can make a comeback.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VERITEC NAMES CHAIRMAN, DECLARES REVERSE STOCK SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veritec Inc., the Chatsworth maker of product-marking codes similar to bar 
codes, has named New York attorney W. M. Starosolsky chairman and acting chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Veritec said it has declared a 1-for-10 reverse stock split -- raising 
its price per share by a factor of 10, while decreasing the number of shares 
outstanding by the same factor.The company said the reverse stock split is 
designed to attract more investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is still seeking a permanent chief executive. The job had been 
vacant following the collapse of a recent agreement with William V. Botts, who 
was named to the post but never served due to disagreements with the company. 
Starosolsky was named to the board of directors earlier this month as part of 
an agreement in which he helped the struggling company secure short-term 
financing, including a loan of up to $1 million at 10% annual interest from Mid 
America Venture Capital Fund Inc. The company said it is still seeking 
additional long-term financing.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: IWERKS ENTERTAINMENT REPORTS $891,918 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a Burbank supplier of special-format movie theaters 
and virtual-reality attractions, reported a loss of $891,918 for its fiscal 
third quarter, contrasted with a profit of $2.31 million in the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported, earnings in the three months ended March 31 were hurt 
by higher research and development costs, delayed closings of expected 
sponsorship contracts for its touring theater system and reduced theater system 
sales.Revenue in the latest quarter fell 11%, to $10 million from $11.2 million 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Through three quarters ended March 31, Iwerks' loss totaled $2.81 million, 
against a profit of $2.28 million a year earlier. However, revenue was up 31% 
in the latest nine-month period, to $25.6 million from $19.6 million a year 
earlier.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MATTHEWS REPORTS 19% RISE IN SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matthews Studio Equipment Group, a Burbank company that rents and sells camera 
and lighting support equipment to the entertainment industry, said its fiscal 
second-quarter profit rose 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter that ended March 31, Matthews earned $365,772, compared with a 
year-earlier profit of $308,474.Its revenue in the latest three months 
increased 14%, to $6.58 million from $5.79 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews said the second-quarter results included a doubling of its rental 
income, which it attributed to the added equipment from its acquisition of 
another rental company a year ago, and to a steady increase in industry 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six months, the company's net income gained 19%, to $848,046 from 
earnings of $713,530 a year before. Its six-month revenue was $13.1 million, up

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: FABRIC FIRM PINDLER & PINDLER RELOCATING TO MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pindler & Pindler Inc., a Redondo Beach firm that claims to be the West's 
largest distributor of fine fabrics for the furniture and interior decorating 
industries, has purchased a building in Moorpark and plans to relocate to 
Ventura County early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, scheduled to be completed by June 6, will bring 75 jobs to the 
county, according to Bill Crawford, Pindler's executive vice president. He 
expects about half of the current employees to stay with the company, with the 
remainder being replaced by newly hired workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already started hiring some new people in Ventura County," Crawford 
said. "We're training them in Redondo Beach so they'll be ready to go to work 
as soon as we open the new plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford said Pindler & Pindler is leaving its present location because of the 
quality of the lifestyle and labor force in Ventura County. "We've been 
searching for the right building in Ventura County for two or three years. We 
needed something that could be used as a warehouse, distribution center and 
corporate headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is acquiring a 75,000-square-foot structure on Poindexter Avenue, 
near the interchange of the Moorpark and Simi Valley freeways. Neither Pindler 
nor its broker, Daum Commercial Real Estate Services, would disclose the 
purchase price. The seller is Kenney Manufacturing Co., a distributor of 
mini-blinds and other window coverings that formerly occupied the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Pindler is a privately held concern that purchases fabrics for furniture, 
drapery, bedspreads and other uses from domestic and foreign mills. The 
fabrics, costing as much as $100 a yard, sometimes feature patterns created by 
Pindler's designers. The company distributes the fabrics to furniture 
manufacturers and professional decorators who serve both residential and 
commercial clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Pindler & Pindler has a nationwide network of 12 showrooms, including one in 
the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. The firm does not disclose its 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Pindler's president, Curt Pindler, has already purchased a home in Ventura 
County, Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first several months after the move, the company will use vans to 
shuttle employees from the Redondo Beach area to the Moorpark plant, Crawford 
added.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: OXNARD RADISSON HOTEL FACES BANK FORECLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard's Radisson Suite Hotel, where the Los Angeles Raiders stay during their 
annual summer camp, reportedly is faced with bank foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's owner, Ventura-based Westland Co., is in default on $18.8 million 
in loans and interest payments owed Manufacturers Bank, according to Oxnard 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank isn't commenting, but Alan Holmberg, a lawyer representing the city, 
says the final deadline for payment has passed. In addition, the hotel's owner 
reportedly is behind in its payments on a $9-million bond the city issued to 
build the facility in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Hartman, Westland's general partner, did not return a phone call for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 250-room hotel at the River Ridge Golf Course probably will remain open 
even if the bank loan is foreclosed, officials said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: MOTHER'S DAY KEEPING FLOWER GROWERS BUSY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Next Sunday, Mother's Day, will wrap up the busiest selling period of the year 
for flower growers everywhere, including Oxnard-based Pyramid Flowers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mother's Day rush, which lasts about two weeks at Pyramid, has been strong 
this year, reports Yolanda Van Wingerden, the company's sales and marketing 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our industry lost a lot of business on Secretaries' Day because the President 
declared it a day of mourning for Nixon's funeral," she says. "A lot of offices 
closed, so a lot of bosses didn't buy flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Wingerden says Pyramid, whose president is her brother, Fred, has had to 
get out of the chrysanthemum business because that field has been taken over by 
growers in Colombia and other Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyramid now concentrates on bouvardia and other so-called novelty flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Wingerden, 29, a native of the Netherlands, has just been named so-called 
Pacific link for young executive members of the Wholesale Florists & Florist 
Suppliers of America.

 STAR, a federally funded program that prepares at-risk youths for employment, 
is seeking Ventura County businesses to hire 125 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, aged 16 to 21, face such obstacles as early parenthood and 
learning difficulties, according to Michelle Clisby of Tomkinson & Associates, 
an Oxnard firm that coordinates the program in the county. "Children in our 
community shouldn't grow up without hope," Clisby said. To contact STAR -- 
which stands for Skills Training and Retention -- call 385-3671.

ALREADY RIDING THE HIGHWAY; WHILE OTHERS TALK, GTE SAYS IT HAS BEEN MAKING 
INROADS IN COMMUNICATIONS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While most everyone in the telecommunications business has been talking 
urgently about the coming of the information superhighway, where has quiet GTE 
Corp. been? 
</P>
<P>
 Building the information superhighway, GTE says. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE was, in fact, one of the first to test complicated interactive voice, 
video and data services, such as home banking, shopping, education and movies 
on demand, in a five-year experiment in Cerritos. Run by GTE California, the 
Thousand Oaks-based unit of the parent company, the Cerritos project is now 
ending, and is regarded as a sobering lesson by some observers who say it cast 
doubt on consumers' willingness to pay for additional entertainment and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly chastened by Cerritos, Stamford, Conn.-based GTE, the nation's 
largest independent phone company, is now charting a conservative course in the 
mad race among phone, cable, software and wireless communications companies to 
transform themselves into the communications providers of tomorrow. 
Contributing to the chaos is that Congress and federal regulators haven't 
decided on the ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while other phone and cable companies tried to make mega merger deals to 
be ready for an interactive multimedia future, GTE waited. In November, 
California's other regional phone company, Pacific Telesis Group in San 
Francisco, announced an ambitious six-year plan to spend $16 billion bringing 
consumers interactive video and data services, and other phone companies 
quickly followed with similar announcements. But GTE California made no such 
financial commitment, and its parent company said only that it would follow up 
Cerritos with another test of interactive phone, video and data services in 
Manassas, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that various phone-cable deals are crumbling -- including Bell Atlantic's 
proposed acquisition of cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc., which was 
scuttled in February -- GTE looks wiser. GTE's quietness, said A. Michael Noll, 
a professor at USC's Annenberg School of Communication, "implies sense" because 
it didn't rush into an expensive merger deal before the benefits of such a 
transaction are known. 
</P>
<P>
 While displaying caution, GTE must also prepare itself for a future that's far 
from clear. As phone monopolies are dismantled and technology improves, local 
phone companies such as GTE want to become providers of not just voice 
communications but all sorts of services, including entertainment and 
educational video on demand, large-volume data transfers, and communications 
links between businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 In transforming itself, GTE faces plenty of potential competition from cable 
concerns, long-distance phone companies and wireless communications providers, 
which are also spending billions on new equipment and technologies. Movie 
studios, newspapers and computer software firms, too, are trying to figure out 
where they will fit in to the predicted explosion of information for businesses 
and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, despite all its reserve, GTE is now beginning to market some information 
superhighway products. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, GTE rolled out a group of business services called the World Class 
Network. Along this network, companies, universities and government agencies 
can tap into video conferencing, transfer high volumes of computer data over 
fiber-optic phone lines, and make three-way phone calls. These services aren't 
entirely new, but with technology gains, GTE can now make them better, faster 
and cheaper. Targeting Businesses 
</P>
<P>
 The information highway "happens first in corporate America," GTE California 
President Larry Sparrow said. "It is happening there today." 
</P>
<P>
 Because data communications -- transmitting massive amounts of computer data 
-- is projected to grow four times faster than voice communications, GTE is 
tailoring its marketing efforts accordingly and telling businesses that it can 
save them money. 
</P>
<P>
 The key here, GTE says, is that its new fiber-optic lines are cheaper to 
maintain than old copper phone wires, and each fiber strand, thinner than a 
human hair, can carry vast amounts of information at very high speeds compared 
to a copper wire. GTE California engineers say that hospitals, for instance, 
could link up with their suppliers and vastly increase their ability to share 
data. A publisher could transmit 50 pages of a book over phone lines in less 
than a second, and the time it takes for credit card transactions to be 
approved could be reduced from 30 seconds to five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Big investments over the past several years are allowing GTE to provide these 
services. Last year alone, GTE's capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion -- 
$500 million in California -- much of it spent on technology and equipment 
upgrades. Over the past several years, it has laid 650,000 miles of fiber-optic 
cable throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, GTE has been laying fiber-optic cables in big rings in urban 
areas, allowing it to reroute transmissions along one side of a ring should the 
other side fail -- a big selling point to corporate customers who require 
reliable service. GTE has also installed super-fast digital switches that can 
route mind-boggling amounts of data. In California, 94% of GTE's network will 
be digital by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "GTE is in real good shape in terms of having the pavement down on the 
highway," said analyst Frederic H. Dickson at the investment firm D. A. 
Davidson & Co. in Great Falls, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE California will be a big market for these information highway services, 
Sparrow said, by virtue of its sheer size. California provides about 15% of GTE 
Corp.'s $20 billion in revenue and, in recent years, has accounted for 11% to 
22% of its operating profit. Los Angeles is one of eight areas targeted for the 
World Class Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Steve Harris, external affairs vice president at Pacific Bell, Pacific 
Telesis' phone company subsidiary, said the World Class Network gives little 
insight about GTE's real plans for the information highway. "We're all sort of 
waiting to see what it means." Company 'Has to Move' 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts suggest that GTE has been reticent so far because it is still 
paying for its $6-billion 1991 merger with telecommunications company Contel 
Corp. But outsiders expect that GTE will get more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PacTel announcement changed the landscape for everyone" because Pacific 
Telesis said its costs of providing interactive services to homes would be a 
fraction of what was previously assumed, said Jonathan Seybold, publisher of 
the Digital Media newsletter in Malibu. Now GTE "has to move." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sparrow hinted that an announcement about GTE's plans to bring 
interactive voice, video and data services to consumers would be made within 
weeks. A GTE alliance with another company to provide programming for the 
information highway is also in the cards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparrow denied that the Cerritos experiment dampened GTE's enthusiasm for the 
information highway. He insisted that the company achieved its goal of learning 
about technology and how consumers react to a sudden growth of services, and 
GTE will use this information as it begins marketing multimedia products in 
earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assure you," he said, "we would not be investing a dime in this technology 
if we didn't think we could sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 As GTE and other companies spend the money and jockey for position, however, 
Congress and regulators are still grappling to set policy. Local and 
long-distance phone companies and cable operators all want free access to each 
other's markets and, although there are many bills in Congress, little has been 
decided as yet. As a result of the final decisions that come out of Washington, 
Sparrow said, "we will either have the super information highway or not have 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 As GTE hopes to compete in new markets, analysts point to its strength in the 
cellular phone business as evidence that GTE can be opportunistic. GTE is the 
nation's second-largest cellular phone provider in a market that's expected to 
grow from $12 billion to $50 billion in five years, and could play an important 
role in providing information highway services. GTE won praise for its recent 
announcement of a low-priced pocket phone service, called Telego, which will be 
capable of transmitting data as well as voice. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE also plans to bid in upcoming Federal Communications Commission auctions 
for licenses for personal communications service, a wireless technology that 
offers phone, paging and data transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 So when will the payoff come? For GTE, analysts say, technology and service 
investments are paying off already in increased efficiency. They say the money 
GTE has spent sprucing up its network was needed as much as a defense against 
new rivals as to prepare for multimedia services that might never come to pass. 
If business customers sign up for GTE's World Class Network, profits could come 
in a year or two, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the profit potential of the vast information superhighway remains unknown, 
and years away at best. Companies will likely need to alter plans many times, 
and product life spans will grow ever shorter as technology improves. The 
dilemma for companies like GTE is "what they deploy now could be obsolete in a 
year, but if you don't deploy now, you lose," said analyst Robert B. Wilkes of 
the New York investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Sparrow said, GTE must be as efficient as possible. The parent 
company plans to lay off 17,000 workers nationwide over the next three years; a 
big reason for the cuts, Sparrow said, is that new technology has reduced 
manpower needs. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE's biggest challenge now, he said, lies in "changing the culture of our 
company out of that regulated mentality to one of a fully competitive, 
marketplace mentality. We need that sense of urgency, the sense of 'We ain't 
good enough, we've got to get better.' "

ROBINSON: TIME TO TAKE ON THE NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson returned to his hometown Monday to say he is ready for the NBA, 
where he is expected to be one of the brightest -- and wealthiest -- young 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the rickety house where he grew up, in the high school 
gym where teammates called him Lurch before Purdue fans called him Big Dog, the 
Boilermaker All-American announced that he will forgo his senior year to try 
his hand at the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, college basketball's player of the year, probably will be the No. 1 
pick in the NBA draft, and his agent speculates he could sign a contract of 
close to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson said money is not the reason he is leaving college. 
</P>
<P>
 It is simply the right time to take his game to a higher level, and Gary 
Roosevelt High was the right place for his long-awaited announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want everyone to know in the city of Gary that I'm leaving because I'm in a 
unique situation," Robinson, who led the nation in scoring with a 30.3-point 
average, told about 300 people. "A lot of people don't have the opportunity to 
go into the (draft) lottery, or maybe be the No. 1 pick." 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly more nervous behind a cluster of cameras and microphones than in 
front of 20,000 basketball fans, the 6-foot-8 forward probably can expect 
another uncomfortable day at the NBA draft June 29 in the Indianapolis Hoosier 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 He is among a talented group of underclassmen who have declared their 
eligibility, including Jalen Rose and Juwan Howard of Michigan, Donyell 
Marshall of Connecticut and Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray of California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson is considered by many the best player in that group, and Donnie 
Walsh, the Indiana Pacer general manager, said he never even got a chance to 
show his full range of skills in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "He obviously can score, but I really believe he has better all-around 
abilities than have been shown at this point," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was the Big Ten's leading rebounder in 1993-94, averaging 10.2. It 
was the first time the same player had led the league in both scoring and 
rebounding since Minnesota's Mychal Thompson in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson led an otherwise average Purdue team to a 29-5 record, the conference 
championship and the top-seeded status in the NCAA's Southeast Regional. Purdue 
advanced to the regional final, losing, 69-60, to eventual NCAA runner-up Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the eighth-leading scorer in Purdue history with 1,706 points. He also 
is the only Boilermaker with at least 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 100 steals, 
100 assists and 50 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh compared Robinson with Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, and Robinson said 
he hopes to have the same impact in the NBA that Michael Jordan had when he 
joined the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe Robinson's contract could top the packages Chris Webber and 
Anfernee Hardaway signed last year. Webber agreed to a 15-year, $74.4-million 
deal, and Hardaway signed a 13-year, $65-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's agent, Dr. Charles Tucker, said a longterm deal pushing $100 
million is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything is realistic nowadays," he said. "I would certainly say he is worth 
that because he brings more than basketball to the game. He brings a 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said he hopes to use his fortune to help Gary, a crumbling steel city 
with double-digit unemployment and the highest murder rate in the nation last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he didn't say so Monday, Robinson has been critical of the cold 
shoulder pop star Michael Jackson gave Gary after leaving as a child star in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with basketball camps for youths and a big new house for his mother and 
stepfather, Robinson said he would like to build a recording studio in Gary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Gary, and I don't think the people in the past have served their 
community after they left," Robinson said. "I'm going to turn that around."

WHO'S ON FIRST? TWICE, NO ONE AS DODGERS LOSE; BASEBALL: L.A.'S FIELDING 
BLUNDERS DURING THE FIFTH INNING HELP THE EXPOS SCORE THEIR SIXTH CONSECUTIVE 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't quite the homecoming Delino DeShields anticipated when he climbed 
out of a taxi in front of Olympic Stadium on Monday night. For the first time 
in more than a week, DeShields was able to play all nine innings without 
physical injury, but the mental anguish he and the Dodgers suffered during 
their 10-5 loss to the Montreal Expos was bad enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an ugly, ugly game," third baseman Tim Wallach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos extended their winning streak to six, which is not unremarkable, 
considering the Dodgers had won only four of the 24 games they had played here 
the last four seasons. But it is the demoralizing way the Dodgers lost this one 
that will provide some haunting memories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers gave the Expos six outs in the fifth inning, and the Expos 
appreciated the generosity, scoring five runs to take a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It started when Kevin Gross, who said his shoulder felt as good as it has all 
season, said he got "vapor locked" and failed to cover first base on a routine 
grounder in the fifth inning. Sean Berry had led off with a double and starter 
Ken Hill grounded to Eric Karros, who made a good stop on the ball and would 
normally have flipped the ball to Gross for the out. But Gross wasn't close to 
the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was just a terrible play," Gross (0-1) said. "I didn't see the ball come 
off the bat and I thought Hill hit it into the stands. Then I turn around and 
see Eric with it and I was just standing there vapor locked." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was safe on first and Berry advanced to third. Mike Lansing, who is 10 
for 24 since asking the Expos to play Van Halen's "Right Now" instead of Bon 
Jove's "Dead or Alive" before he bats, followed with a line drive that scored 
Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it for Gross, who was replaced by Omar Daal, and the inning got 
worse. Cliff Floyd hit a grounder to the right of the mound and Daal fielded 
it, looked Hill back at third and made a perfect throw to first base, but no 
one was covering. Two runs scored, putting the Expos ahead, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I caught the ball and thought Eric was at first base," Daal said. "Nobody 
told me not to throw it." 
</P>
<P>
 Karros had come in to help field the ball and DeShields was about 5 feet from 
the bag.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was hit right to the pitcher and for some reason the first baseman 
thought, well, the ball was hit right to the pitcher," Manager Tom Lasorda 
said. "It's hard to say who should have been there, the pitcher had the ball 
and nobody was there, and he assumed somebody is going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Karros saw it differently. "It was a bouncer and Omar is a left-handed pitcher 
and we have a guy on third and if it gets by him we are in trouble," Karros 
said. "I was the guy out there." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields saw it another way. "I probably should have been there, but I didn't 
expect (Omar) to throw it with a guy on third," DeShields said. "I don't think 
we lost the game on that particular play." 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort replaced Daal and, after a groundout, picked off Larry Walker, 
who had been intentionally walked. But the Dodgers faltered again when Moises 
Alou hit a hard grounder that Jose Offerman made a good stop on, but bounced 
his throw to first under Karros' glove, and Floyd scored. Alou scored on a 
double down the left field line by Darrin Fletcher before Wil Cordero flied 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't continue to make mistake after mistake," said Wallach, who was 
hitless in four at-bats. "We have to forget about this one and get back to 
playing solid baseball and bear down. Everybody needs to take care of their job 
and that's how you do it, period." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored three runs in the first inning against Hill (5-1) on a 
two-run triple by Henry Rodriguez and a grounder by Mike Piazza. DeShields led 
off the game with the first of three consecutive singles, but the joy of 
scoring the first run in front of his former hometown crowd was long lost by 
the end of the night. His head still hurts from the concussion he suffered more 
than a week ago, and he said he feels like he is in slow motion in the field. 
"I'm just trying to play through it," DeShields said.

 Dave Maggard, the former University of Miami athletic director, didn't have to 
think twice when he was offered the job of director of sports for the 1996 
Olympic Games in Atlanta. 
</P>

 First Pittsburgh was eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs by the 
Washington Capitals, then, in the aftermath of a party to drown their sorrows, 
charges were filed Monday against Penguin defenseman Peter Taglianetti and 
strength coach John Welday. 
</P>
<P>
 A man charged that Taglianetti punched him and that Welday head-butted him at 
a Pittsburgh bar Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both face charges of aggravated assault, and goaltender Tom Barrasso faces a 
charge of making terrorist threats against the man, David Miness. Miness, a 
student at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, told police Taglianetti struck him 
after Miness had complained about being bumped repeatedly and that Welday then 
butted him, breaking his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Miness said he told Barrasso he was going to sue the bar and the Penguins and 
quoted Barrasso as responding: "What's it going to be like with broken knees? 
I'm serious."

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; SHARKS SWARM ON GOAL TO DEFEAT MAPLE LEAFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Jose Sharks are the team that came into the playoffs with the worst 
record among the field's 16 teams, a team that had not been in a playoff game 
until about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks suddenly find themselves the NHL's darlings, thanks to the kind of 
teamwork that showed on their game-winning goal Monday in a 3-2 victory over 
the Maple Leafs in the Western Conference semifinal series opener at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Johan Garpenlov's goal with 2:16 to play gave the Sharks the victory, and all 
five San Jose skaters touched the puck on the play. Toronto's Bill Berg had 
lost his stick as the Sharks swarmed toward goaltender Felix Potvin. Igor 
Larionov set Garpenlov up for a relay into an open side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no chance to shoot because there was a defenseman in front of me," 
Larionov said. "I looked over and saw Johan and passed the puck to him." 
</P>
<P>
 "The other guys did a good job getting the puck to me," Garpenlov said. "I had 
an open net and couldn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the problem, said Toronto Coach Pat Burns, who was upset Garpenlov 
was so open. Burns' six defensemen have been an important part of the team's 
success but they slipped several times Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big Six weren't the big six tonight, that's for sure," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Igor Larionov and Pat Falloon also scored for the Sharks, who twice trailed. 
Wendel Clark and Mark Osborne scored for the Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maple Leafs wasted a chance to take a 2-0 lead when they failed to get off 
a shot during a two-minute, 23-second power play that included 97 seconds with 
a two-man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for a turning point, that might have been it," said Shark 
Coach Kevin Constantine. "We were really lucky to escape that situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 6, Dallas 4 -- Martin Gelinas scored off a faceoff with 4:39 to play 
and the Canucks held on for the victory over the Stars at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Lafayette won the faceoff and passed the puck directly onto the stick 
of Gelinas. Gelinas sent a 25-foot slap shot past goaltender Darcy Wakaluk's 
stick side for the game-winning goal after the Stars had rallied from a 
three-goal deficit to tie it, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Linden scored for the Canucks with 16 seconds to play after Dallas had 
pulled its goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks built a 4-1 lead, but Dallas scored two late goals in the second 
period and tied it at 16:03 in the third on a rebound shot by Mike McPhee. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Bure's short wrist shot shot after a perfect drop pass by Trevor Linden 
and defenseman's Jyrki Lumme's power-play goal put the Canucks up by three 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas came back on a power-play goal by Richard Matvichuk and McPhee's first 
playoff goal when he rebounded his own shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars and Canucks, meeting in the playoffs for the first time, will play 
in the second game of the best-of-seven series on Wednesday night at Reunion 
Arena.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; LEAGUE CASTS A WARY EYE ON MCNALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Official word was that Bruce McNall, the flamboyant and free-spending owner of 
the Kings, voluntarily resigned as chairman of the NHL's Board of Governors. 
You can be sure no one tried to talk him into staying. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL officials, although aware of McNall's legal entanglements, were surprised 
to learn that a federal grand jury is investigating whether he falsified loan 
documents. They had supported him, mindful of the huge debt they owe him for 
bringing Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles and invigorating the league, but that 
news made them fear the NHL's image would suffer if he remained. As they 
reasoned, how could he run the board when he couldn't run his own businesses 
and couldn't meet a payroll without aid from his prospective partners? 
</P>
<P>
 Those partners, Joe Cohen and Jeffrey Sudikoff, were said to be extremely 
unhappy that McNall had painted a rosier picture of his finances than what is 
emerging. To soothe them, and to avoid the embarrassment of a team in the 
country's second-largest market plunging into bankruptcy, Commissioner Gary 
Bettman has been to Los Angeles three times in three weeks. NHL counsel Jeffrey 
Pash has established an L.A. beachhead to sift through the details of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously some issues have to be resolved," Bettman said. "Anything beyond 
(saying Pash's mission is) fact-finding is speculation at this point. I've been 
in constant touch with all the parties and we're in the process of evaluating 
where things stand and what we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall always wanted the best -- a private jet for his team, the right to brag 
that he gave Gretzky the NHL's highest salary -- but when it came time to pay 
up, he had nothing left but his credibility. That's gone now, too. 
</P>
<P>
 We've said it before, we'll say it again and we'll probably say it again 
sometime: Hockey survives despite the people who run it. ROUND 2 
</P>
<P>
 On to the quarterfinals -- or conference semifinals, if you insist: 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers are deep enough to overcome the Washington Capitals' 
tireless checking, as shown in their 6-3 romp Sunday. Washington's Dave Poulin 
did a marvelous job on the Penguins' Mario Lemieux in the first round, but even 
if Poulin shadows Mark Messier, the Capitals still must stop Adam Graves, 
Alexei Kovalev and a mobile, prolific defense. They won't be able to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches are a fascinating contrast. Mike Keenan motivates the Rangers 
through tyranny, whereas Jim Schoenfeld is a rah-rah back patter. Keenan has 
been to the finals three times. Before this spring, Schoenfeld had 20 games of 
playoff experience, all in leading the New Jersey Devils to the semifinals in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers in five, but with a few bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Every game in the Devils-Bruins series probably will be as defense-oriented as 
Sunday's 2-1 Boston victory. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey rookie goalie Martin Brodeur passed his first playoff test against 
Buffalo, but he didn't have to face the cannons of Ray Bourque and Al Iafrate 
at the points. Boston's Jon Casey surprisingly outplayed Montreal's Patrick Roy 
late in the first round, and Casey must be that good again for the Bruins to 
advance. He was Sunday, when he made 34 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 The top seeded teams in the West are gone, thanks to the San Jose Sharks' 
elimination of the Detroit Red Wings and the Vancouver Canucks' rally from a 
3-1 series deficit -- and a 3-2 deficit in Game 7 -- against the Calgary 
Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 In springing the biggest upset in years, the Sharks proved that defense wins 
games -- hear that, Barry Melrose? -- and that they're cool under fire. 
Latvian-born goalie Arturs Irbe has generally been, as he says, "like wall," 
and veterans Sergei Makarov and Igor Larionov provided poise and key goals. 
They're a dynamic team, fun to watch and coached well by Kevin Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto is a stronger, more skillful version of the Sharks. Goalie Felix 
Potvin recorded three 1-0 victories against Chicago and Doug Gilmour was a 
workhorse, despite a sore right ankle, averaging 35 minutes and winning a high 
percentage of faceoffs. However, the Maple Leafs' offense was spotty -- 
defensemen scored five of their 15 goals -- and Dave Andreychuk wasn't a force 
on the power play. If Gilmour isn't hobbled, they'll win a low-scoring series 
in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's proof that 50-goal scorer Mike Modano has become a complete player: 
Coach Bob Gainey let him kill penalties in Dallas' sweep of the Blues -- and 
there's no higher honor from Gainey, a superb defensive forward in his day. The 
Stars have a pesky offense and a rugged defense, although they miss Mark 
Tinordi, out because of a broken leg. Vancouver stayed alive against Calgary 
when right wing Pavel Bure woke up and scored three goals in the last three 
games, then won when goalie Kirk McLean turned promise into performance. 
Canucks in seven. AU REVOIR, MARIO? 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Penguins' first-round loss was no shock, given their lack of 
discipline and speed. Few players were willing to grind it out, and the thin 
defense was overwhelmed. Jaromir Jagr and Kevin Stevens had no points until 
Game 5 and Mario Lemieux didn't score in Games 3-5, his longest playoff 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux, who has overcome Hodgkin's disease and a back injury in the last two 
seasons, again said he might retire. However, his agent, Tom Reich, said 
Lemieux will take a long rest before considering his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's drained," Reich said. "He's not sure how much of the fatigue was a 
consequence of the Hodgkin's (treatment) radiation. He was able to pick and 
choose which games he'd play so he wouldn't be drained in the last quarter of 
the season. In the playoffs it's all or nothing. He's got a legitimate concern 
about his health. His back is one thing and his endurance is another." ROY 
DIDN'T HAB IT 
</P>
<P>
 In Montreal, they called him "St. Patrick" when Roy left his hospital bed with 
a sore appendix and stopped 99 of 102 shots in Games 4 and 5. They removed his 
halo when he gave up three soft goals in Game 7 and Boston ended the Canadiens' 
Stanley Cup reign, but he wasn't to blame. Without Roy, the under-sized, 
underachieving Canadiens would have lost sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy didn't cite his appendicitis to explain his fade at the finish, but it 
must have weakened him. He has always been a fierce competitor, and he had the 
added incentive of making Bruin General Manager Harry Sinden sorry for 
disparaging remarks about Roy after Game 6. Roy had no strength to answer this 
time, but he will next time. Count on that. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Sad to see the Blackhawks shut out in their final game at Chicago Stadium, but 
that sour ending was washed away by a flood of good memories. The roar, the 
thundering organ music, the building rocking when the crowd got going -- it was 
a blast. . . . The Flames' inexcusable loss will trigger major changes. They 
probably won't be able to re-sign defenseman Al MacInnis, who will be a free 
agent without compensation and is seeking $3 million. Defenseman Zarley 
Zalapski and goalie Trevor Kidd will also be free agents; Theoren Fleury, Joe 
Nieuwendyk, Joel Otto, Robert Reichel, Mike Vernon and Frank Musil are entering 
their option years. . . . Still one of the best moments in sports is the 
handshaking ceremony after each series, no matter how intense the rivalry.

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; UNIFORMS NEW, BUT IT'S THE SAME OLD CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing friendly about the confines of Chicago's Wrigley Field these 
days. Even Cub tradition has taken a beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, they wore blue for the first time at home, white having brought them 
no luck. But blue didn't make the Cubs pitch or hit better. They dropped a 9-0 
decision to Cincinnati, their 11th consecutive home defeat, a Chicago record 
and one that means the Cubs are 0-for-the-season in Wrigley. That's a National 
League record for season-opening futility in the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is still a great lineup out there," Smiley said of the Cubs, who 
had only two hits. "Sometimes you get in a bad slump and it's tough getting out 
of it because you're pressing a little bit too much. It's still a good lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as good as Chicago first baseman Mark Grace implied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to blame the Cubs' poor play," Grace said. "I'm going to give 
every ounce of respect to John Smiley. He could have beaten the 1927 Yankees 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 He had no trouble with the 1994 Cubs, who, at 6-17, have the worst record in 
baseball -- so bad they seemed to want to spend the night incognito. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the blue jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a different look," Manager Tom Trebelhorn said. "People want me to 
change the lineup. I'm not going to change the lineup, I'm going to change the 
jerseys." 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Boone drove in four runs for the Reds, who scored five times after two 
were out in the third inning to make an easy night for Smiley (3-2), who struck 
out six. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 10, New York 3 -- Mark Portugal tripled and singled during a 
nine-run third inning and also pitched two-hit ball for seven shutout innings 
at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-out error by Met shortstop Jose Vizcaino made all nine runs in the third 
inning unearned. Matt Williams hit his major league-leading 12th homer after 
the error. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal drove in two runs during the inning, the biggest for the Giants since 
they scored nine runs on Aug. 18, 1982, at Pittsburgh. The Giants combined six 
hits, two errors, two walks and a wild pitch in the burst. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal (3-2) struck out three and walked five. Bobby Jones (3-2) lasted 2 
2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 7, San Diego 2 -- Lenny Dykstra, who bruised his back crashing 
into the wall a day earlier, doubled three times, stole two bases, drove in two 
runs and scored twice for the Phillies in Philadelpia. 
</P>
<P>
 The benches emptied in the fourth inning when the Phillies' Mariano Duncan, 
who was hit on the arm by a pitch in the second, was knocked down with a 
high-and-tight pitch from Andy Ashby (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan started to walk toward the mound, but was blocked by catcher Brad 
Ausmus. Duncan then pushed Ausmus just below the neck, triggering the brawl. 
Duncan and Ausmus were ejected, as were Philadelphia's Pete Incaviglia and Jeff 
Juden. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Jackson (3-0) pitched his second complete game, allowing six hits and 
and striking out nine. AMERICAN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 10, Texas 8 -- Pinch-hitter Kirk Gibson connected for a three-run 
homer with one out in the 10th inning for the Tigers at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit blew a 7-3 lead in the ninth inning and fell behind, 8-7, in the 10th. 
But the Tigers rallied for their third consecutive victory, their longest 
winning streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second three-run homer in two days for Gibson, who hit the right 
field roof with a ball that bounced out of Tiger Stadium on Sunday.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK STRUGGLES IN DOUBLE-A START

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park made his third start for the double-A San Antonio Missions on 
Monday night, and he didn't fare well. In three innings, Park threw 80 pitches 
and gave up two earned runs, five walks and struck out five. Fred Claire, 
Dodger executive vice president, attended the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Park pitched, he called Manager Tom Lasorda and told him that he was 
feeling well, but missed Los Angeles. "He told me he missed me, and I told him 
how much I miss him and can't wait to see him again," Lasorda said.

 "He could pitch here right now, there is no doubt in my mind," Lasorda said. 
"We just didn't want him sitting around here and not pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 In Park's previous two starts with San Antonio, he pitched a combined 8 2/3 
scoreless innings, with 14 strikeouts and two walks.

 Rookie Cliff Floyd is not only hitting .289 for the Expos, but playing the 
best defense at first base since the team had Andres Galarraga. In the fourth 
inning Monday night, he made a great play when he dived at a grounder down the 
first-base line by Jose Offerman and flipped the ball to pitcher Ken Hill for 
the out. 
</P>
<P>
 In nine games since Floyd was moved to the No. 2 spot in the batting order, 
the Expos have scored 56 runs and have a 9-1 record.

 The Expos' Sean Berry left the game because of a bruised elbow after Darren 
Dreifort hit him with a pitch in the sixth inning. . . . The Dodgers claimed 
right-handed pitcher Jeff Williams off waivers from the Seattle Mariner 
organization, where he had an 0-1 record with an 11.37 earned-run average in 6 
1/3 innings at triple-A Calgary. He will join triple-A Albuquerque. Williams, 
25, was the Baltimore Orioles' second-round draft pick in 1990. MARYANN HUDSON

 Vicente Palacios, a few months removed from pitching for the Yucatan Lions and 
the Aguascaliente Railroadmen in the Mexican League, will make his first start 
in the major leagues in two seasons tonight for the St. Louis Cardinals at 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios, 30, helped the Pittsburgh Pirates' 1991 National League East 
championship team, going 6-3 with three saves and a 3.75 ERA. He underwent 
shoulder surgery the next season, then was released by the Pirates and the San 
Diego Padres last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed on his feet in his native Mexico. There's such a shortage of 
pitchers in the major leagues that it's far from the last stop anymore. He 
helped himself by throwing a no-hitter in the winter-league playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jorgensen, the Cardinals' director of player development, missed the 
no-hitter. But he saw another performance pretty much like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him down there, he was dominating," Jorgensen said. "Plus, his 
statistics were impressive, which indicated he was doing it on a consistent 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios showed enough to be invited to spring training as a non-roster 
player. It didn't take Manager Joe Torre and pitching coach Joe Coleman long to 
determine he would help the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt he could be a backup closer, a middle reliever or a starter if the 
need came up," Coleman said. "The big thing was he showed us he was healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I went back to Mexico, to try to get my shoulder back 100% and 
work hard," Palacios said. "I've put everything together and I'm very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 He began the year as a setup man, became a spot starter when Rick Sutcliffe 
went on the disabled list because of a hamstring injury April 25, then went to 
No. 4 starter when Rheal Cormier went on the disabled list because of a bone 
bruise to his shoulder Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's climbing the ladder without even playing a game," Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios has a 3.65 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 12 1/3 innings. If there is any 
concern, it is control. He has walked a team-leading 10, most of them in a few 
early outings.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Twin right-hander Scott Erickson isn't kidding himself about facing 
the same Milwaukee team he held hitless last Wednesday in tonight's start. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, the game the other night is over," Erickson said. 
"You can't get caught up in it. I've got 31 starts left. The best time to throw 
(a no-hitter) would be the last game of the season, so you don't sit there and 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one player in major league history, Johnny Vander Meer of the 1938 
Cincinnati Reds, has pitched back-to-back no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said the idea that he could duplicate Vander Meer's feat against the 
Brewers "is a joke." He hasn't even won back-to-back decisions since September 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not even worth talking about," Erickson said. "It's been done before, 
but it's dumb to even think about it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan was hitless in four at-bats for the double-A Birmingham Barons, 
lowering his batting average to .250. . . .Infielder Willie Greene, who started 
nine games for the Cincinnati Reds this season, has been optioned to triple-A 
Indianapolis. Greene was batting .216. . . . The Chicago Cubs placed outfielder 
Willie Wilson on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained left quadriceps 
and recalled Kevin Roberson from triple-A Iowa. Roberson was batting .313 in 19 
games at Iowa. . . . Baltimore Oriole shortstop Manny Alexander, on the 
disabled list since having a growth removed from a leg in spring training, was 
activated and optioned to triple-A Rochester.

PREP ROUNDUP; LAGUNA BEACH SWEEPS NO. 2 HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Laguna Beach came back from a disappointing loss last week to San Clemente, to 
sweep Huntington Beach, 15-8, 15-13, 15-3, in a nonleague boys' volleyball 
match Monday at Laguna Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake was a potential higher seeding in the Southern Section playoffs, 
scheduled to start May 13, and the fourth-ranked Artists (12-1) put in their 
bid with a dominant performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Dan Styles led Laguna Beach with 20 kills and 6-foot-9 
middle blocker Szilard Kovacs solidified the defense with five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a tremendous team effort from everyone tonight," Artist Coach Michael 
Soylular said. "Our serving was good and we just played like a team." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-ranked Oilers (13-2) rallied only once, when they went on an 8-1 
run in the second game to catch Laguna Beach, 12-12. However, the Artists 
regrouped and won the game when Nick Ziegler's spike found the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach pounded away at the Oilers in the third game and led, 10-3, when 
Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli was ejected after disputing a call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see Rocky get ejected in such a good match," Soylular said. "He's a 
good friend of mine." DAN ARRITT

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; AT 70, CRAVENS CUP PROVES A WELL-AGED SCOTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before professional sports moved into the area, the unique Cravens Cup 
golf tournament was a major event each May in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Club golf tournaments were big around here. The Cravens, involving most of the 
top amateurs, was something special. It commanded widespread interest and the 
attention of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of horse racing, the Rams, Dodgers, Lakers and Angels, 
amateur golf was shunted to the back -- or ignored completely. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cravens Cup, generally known now as the Cravens Invitational, has 
survived nicely. The Scotch foursome tournament, now 70 years old, is still 
going strong. Without the fanfare of pre-World War II days, more than 400 
amateur golfers, in two-man teams, still participate. This year it will be 
played May 11-14 at San Gabriel Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Walker Cup players have been among the winners -- Johnny Dawson, Bruce 
McCormick and Dr. Bud Taylor. Former Ram Merlin Olsen, Stanford and 
professional basketball star George Yardley and football's Bob Chandler, John 
Elway and Glenn Davis have played in it. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a team of special interest this year to USC football fans and 
alumni. Pat Haden and J.K. McKay, who gained fame as one of the great passing 
combinations in Trojan history, will compete. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a grueling event. To win the championship, a team might have to play as 
many as 108 holes, counting the qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
 There is considerable pressure too. The first arrives after the qualifying 
ends May 12. There are openings in the championship flight for 32 teams. Often 
several spots have to be determined by four-hole shootouts. There have been 
years when as many as 20 teams battled for the last two positions. By the time 
the playoffs start, there is always a big gallery. For many, the gallery 
presents a big problem. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cravens, a Southland sportsman, got the idea for the event when he saw 
two-ball foursome matches in Scotland. He staged the first tournament at the 
old Midwick Country Club, now a housing project, in 1924. It was moved to San 
Gabriel Country Club in 1943 and has been there since. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are simple. Each player must have a handicap under 12 (11.2 index) 
and be an amateur. The winners of each match are based on net scores. There is 
no riding on carts except to reach tees to begin a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 It differs from Scotch foursomes only in that one member of the team hits the 
drive on the odd holes, the other on the even. In pure Scotch play, each player 
hits every other shot. The change makes it important for both players to be at 
the top of their game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Kirkpatrick, who played for USC in the 1960s, and David Mendez of Friendly 
Hills Country Club have won the championship flight the last two years. Their 
success helped bring a change in the rules. Each player, instead of using his 
current handicap, will use his lowest rating in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time only twosomes from Southern California clubs were sent 
invitations. But it has become worldwide.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been only 11 Cravens chairmen since the tournament shifted to San 
Gabriel. The first was Tex Schramm, father of the former president of the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 New chairman Frank Haltom, a San Marino real estate executive, said that 550 
invitations had been sent out for this year's tournament. A field of more than 
200 teams will begin qualifying rounds on May 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The final two days, in which winners must play two 18-hole matches, usually 
draw big crowds to the Las Tunas Drive course. Haltom said there will be about 
35 San Gabriel teams, now working with club professional Michael John Kelley 
and teaching pro Jim Petralia, in the hopes of returning the championship to 
the home club.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: CAL POLY POMONA WOMEN SEEKING TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One couldn't call it unexpected if Cal Poly Pomona's women's tennis team wins 
its third national title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have essentially the same team returning, but it's always luck and 
timing," Pomona Coach Ann Lebedeff said. "After winning back-to-back titles, I 
think the expectation last year was like: 'We've done it before and it might 
come easy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it didn't. We finished third -- which a lot of teams would have been 
happy with. But the team was disappointed. So I think that pushed them this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 All teams should get such a push: Pomona heads into this weekend's NCAA 
Division II national championships as the top-ranked team with a 19-1-1 record. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's squad might have been a little immature. The roster had five 
juniors, a sophomore and two freshmen. A season of seasoning seems to have made 
a difference.  
</P>
<P>
 Pomona swept through the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season with a 
6-0 record and all six of Pomona's singles' players made the All-CCAA team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're in the best position we've been in here for a while," Lebedeff 
said. "This is really a team and not a collection of individuals. People like 
to say tennis is not a team sport, but the team wins or loses by the play of 
all the kids. If someone is a prima donna, it affects tennis teams just like 
any other team sport." 
</P>
<P>
 But they have had no such problems -- possibly because of finishing third last 
last year and losing to UC Davis earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't care less about records, so I think it was good to lose," Lebedeff 
said. "I think you learn more by losing. In winning, you're on this cloud where 
you think you can do anything -- it's unrealistic. Sometimes I think (losing) 
is the best thing that can happen to a team." 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, a lot of good things have been happening to Pomona's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The team tournament will be held May 6-8 at the Industry Hill Sheraton Resort 
in the City of Industry. The singles and doubles tournament is set for May 
9-12. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cal State San Bernardino hired a men's basketball coach, Denny Aye, ending a 
tumultuous year under former coach Reggie Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Aye coached the last nine seasons at Columbia College, a junior college in 
Northern California, where he had a 247-65 record -- an average of nearly 29 
victories a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Columbia, he coached two of the best Division II players of the last two 
seasons: Tyrone Davis and Roheen Oats. Davis and Oats led Cal State Bakersfield 
to consecutive national championships the last two seasons. Davis was the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. player of the year in 1993 and the NCAA 
Division II tournament MVP that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aye said Cal State San Bernardino has great potential, in part because of a 
5,000-seat arena that is under construction and a growing community that can 
support the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great area that is untapped," he said. "It will be nice to be at a 
four-year school with scholarships, so I can recruit based on athletics and 
academics. At Columbia, the second question we asked was, 'Do you qualify for 
financial aid?' because there are no scholarships at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 Aye also has the advantage of coming into a program with relatively no 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine what it's going to be like for the next guy going into 
Bakersfield? How can you follow that? I don't have that situation here." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris leaves the program with a 37-41 record. 
</P>
<P>
 More than likely, the impetus for a change came from an incident before the 
season started. Develle Walker, a former CCAA player of the year, and current 
player Wayne Williams were playing in a pick-up basketball game at the school 
gym in September and the two fought. Williams allegedly pulled a gun out of his 
gym bag and threatened Walker with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino County district attorney declined to pursue the case, but 
the program was under scrutiny by the San Bernardino media. There were charges 
of a cover-up because Williams was San Bernardino's best player and that the 
case was mishandled by the school police. 
</P>
<P>
 True or not, the school was getting publicity it did not want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the incident that happened this fall was a deciding factor for the 
administration," Morris said shortly after being informed that the job would be 
opened to other applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's next? I'm wide open," Morris said. "Sometimes you have to go through 
these experiences. I always wanted to be thought of more as a mentor than as a 
basketball coach. I don't want it to be all about wins and losses." 
</P>
<P>
 College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 UC Riverside pitcher Scott Tebbetts set a school season-record by getting 11 
saves this season. The old record was nine by John Vigrass in 1991. . . . Cal 
Poly Pomona's senior catcher, Brian Dennis, was hit by two more pitches last 
weekend. That's 15 for the season and he is only three away from from the 
career mark of 38 set by Jason Shapiro of UC Davis in 1991-93. Dennis set the 
NCAA season record by getting hit by 20 pitches last season. . . . A pivotal 
three-game series between UC Riverside (34-15, 16-9 in CCAA) and Cal State 
Dominguez Hills (33-15, 15-9) will start Thursday. Dominguez Hills will be 
without outfielder and leading hitter (.384) Ray Judy, who suffered a broken 
finger and will sit out the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Pomona-Pitzer's baseball team swept a series from cross-campus 
rival Claremont-Mudd for the first time. Pomona-Pitzer (20-12 overall, 13-7 in 
conference) will finish with a winning record for the first time since 1969, 
and a winning record in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference for the first time since 1957. Cal Lutheran won the SCIAC title with 
a 21-1 record (28-5-1 overall).

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: FINANCE COMMITTEE CLEANS UP THE MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many other California businesses, the CIF Southern Section has suffered 
financial hardships this past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Things came to a head in October when Stan Thomas was asked to resign because 
of expense account excesses. From 1991-93, the section reported deficit 
spending of $155,000, which wiped out most of its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy continuing to struggle and no statewide corporate sponsor in 
sight, the outlook was bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 That might explain why the section's Executive Committee was all smiles last 
week when it announced that it expected to stay within its budget this year, 
and perhaps have a little cash left. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dean Crowley replaced Thomas, he was looking at another year of deficit 
spending. But a 25% reduction in staff, including Thomas' $85,800 annual 
salary, and a profit from the basketball playoffs have helped turn things 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 The section's newly formed Finance Committee has done a good job of curtailing 
expense-account spending and eliminating frivolous expenditures. A company car 
for the commissioner was one of many items eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's proposed budget includes a modest increase, from $1.2 million to 
$1.25 million. There will be no staff increases or raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to be in this position after looking at such grim prospects in 
October," said Tom Triggs, principal of Buena Park High and head of the Finance 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley, 59, was promoted from associate commissioner to acting commissioner 
when Thomas resigned. The Executive Committee will decide next month whether to 
keep Crowley in the job until he's ready for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring last-minute problems, Crowley is expected to be allowed to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section will begin next football season with several questions 
regarding the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to agree on final league placement for several of its 11 divisions, the 
section's council postponed a decision last week until its next meeting in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Late appeals by Miramonte, Tri-Valley and Empire league representatives forced 
the council to reconsider its groupings. Appeals will be heard in June with 
final recommendations voted on in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became evident that geographic equity was important to several leagues, so 
we'll try to rework the divisions to meet those demands," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said the recommendations in June will be used to complete the football 
schedule, but acknowledges changes could be made before the season is complete. 
He expects minor inconveniences, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a difficult season for the Simi Valley baseball team, an annual 
playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers lost two Marmonte League games last week to drop their record to 
14-6. With two weeks remaining in the regular season, they will be fighting for 
a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation was made worse when Bill Scheffels, a top pitcher and first 
baseman, was suspended from school indefinitely last Wednesday for allegedly 
taking part in a bomb-threat prank at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels is leading the league with a .517 batting average, and he is 6-1 
with a 2.66 earned-run average. His status with the team is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Sam Sullivan decides to stay on as boys' basketball coach at Fremont, he 
probably will be looking for a new staff. Assistants Keith Young and Irv 
Robertson were ordered to disassociate themselves from the program last week 
for allegedly recruiting players. Another assistant, Michael Houston, is under 
investigation for his part in a fight during a state playoff game in Fresno in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 If the district attorney's office in Fresno files charges against Houston, the 
City Section Rules Committee is expected to ask him to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan is a veteran in the City Section, having coached at Fremont the last 
17 years. His teams are traditionally among the section's best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate being made a sacrificial lamb," Sullivan said last week. "My program 
is paying the price for a lot of other teams in the City." 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC lost out on a top football and track recruit last week when Andre 
DeSaussure of Woodland Hills Taft signed a letter of intent with Washington. 
DeSaussure was expected to sign with USC, but the Trojans stopped recruiting 
him last month when the NCAA questioned his participation in a 400-meter relay 
at the Quincy Watts Invitational at the school in March. The Taft senior ran a 
leg on the relay, which included Watts, and competed against other college 
teams. The NCAA interpreted the action as a possible rule violation and made 
him ineligible to compete at USC. The NCAA later cleared USC of any wrongdoing, 
but it apparently was too late for DeSaussure, the defending City Section 
champion in the 100, 200 and 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Scholastic Outdoor Track and Field Championships, held at Van 
Nuys Birmingham High the last three years, have been moved to North Carolina 
State. The meet will be held June 19. . . . Darryl Stroh, longtime football 
coach at Granada Hills, said next season will be his last. Stroh guided the 
Highlanders to the City Section Division 4-A title in 1987. . . . Jason 
Medearis of Newhall Hart, one of the state's top hurdlers, signed a letter of 
intent with Wyoming last week. . . . Steve Popovich, who coached Cherokee Parks 
at Huntington Beach Marina, has resigned to become an assistant at Saddleback

SYLMAR TRIMS POLY, 1-0, IN EAST VALLEY PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a test of baseball's checks and balances. Hard-hitting sluggers versus 
virtually unyielding pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Sylmar and Poly high baseball teams faced off in a key East Valley 
League matchup Monday, 15 starters came into the game batting .300 or 
better.And the two starting pitchers each had an earned-run average of less 
than a run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Sylmar's top batter, Art Diaz, ended the pitchers' duel with a 
run-scoring single in the eighth inning to give the Spartans a 1-0 victory over 
Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Spartans relied heavily on senior right-hander Carlos Velazco, 
who allowed just two hits in eight innings and helped Sylmar notch its 16th 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco (9-1), who struck out six and did not walk a batter, helped the 
Spartans put a little more distance between Sylmar (20-3, 11-0 in league play) 
and second-place Poly (17-3, 9-2), which will conclude the two-game series on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's Tommy Mitchell led off the eighth with a base hit to left, advanced 
to second on Steve Zamora's sacrifice bunt and moved to third on Hiram 
Damwijk's groundout, setting the stage for Diaz's heroics. PAIGE A. LEECH

VALLEY/VENTURA DIGEST: PITCHER LEAVES SIMI VALLEY HIGH

<P>
 Bill Scheffels, The Times' Ventura County pitcher of the year last season, 
dropped out of Simi Valley High on Monday rather than face an expulsion hearing 
for making a prank bomb threat last week at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels, a senior, enrolled Monday in the Simi Valley Adult School and 
Career Institute, apparently ending his high school baseball career. He plans 
to finish his four remaining courses through independent study and earn his 
diploma over the next few months, his father, Gene Scheffels, said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scheffels' status remains unclear. Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers called 
Scheffels on Monday night and told him "to give him one more day" before 
dropping out of Simi Valley High, Gene Scheffels said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Scheffels) is going to the adult school," Scyphers told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Scheffels was confused about Scyphers' call, because he said his son had 
already turned in his books and completed the paperwork to drop out of Simi 
Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he's enrolled at the adult education program," Gene Scheffels said. 
"He's scheduled to go over there in the morning. But Coach Scyphers called for 
Bill and he said to just give him one more day." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels decided to enroll at the adult school because all indications were 
that Principal Kathryn Scroggin was going to recommend to the school board that 
Scheffels be expelled, his father said, and the board was unlikely to oppose 
Scroggin's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Scheffels said school board administrators told him after his son dropped 
out Monday that the board would not pursue an expulsion hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels' scholarship to UNLV will not be affected as long as he earns a 
diploma, Gene Scheffels said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play baseball," Scheffels said, "but unfortunately it didn't work 
out that way. I just want to graduate and move on now." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels, who was leading the Pioneer baseball team in batting and in 
pitching victories, was suspended from school indefinitely Wednesday after he 
made a phony bomb threat from a cellular phone during a morning English class. 
</P>
<P>
 Another student dialed the school's main number and handed the phone to 
Scheffels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely (regret it) now," Scheffels said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in connection with the case but the police are still 
investigating, a Simi Valley police spokesman said Monday. JEFF FLETCHER

 Frank Cantu will return to Alemany High as the school's baseball coach, 
succeeding Jim Ozella, who announced earlier this year that he will resign at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantu, 40, coached at Alemany for five years in the 1980s but left the school 
to become the principal at St. Didacus Elementary School in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years as the junior varsity coach, he led the varsity for three 
seasons. In 1981 he coached the team into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantu will remain as principal at St. Didacus. Basketball

 Ventura College's Brandon Jessie, the state junior college basketball player 
of the year, has signed a letter of intent to play at Utah, Pirate Coach Philip 
Mathews said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, a 6-foot-5 1/2 forward, took trips to Utah, Georgetown, Arizona State 
and Nevada Las Vegas. Mathews said Jessie might have been swayed because Utah 
Coach Rick Majerus came to Ventura to visit him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews said Duke and UCLA were among the schools that recruited Jessie, but 
they dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, who averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds per game last year for the 
Pirates, is a two-time All-Western State Conference selection. JEFF FLETCHER

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER: STEP ASIDE OSCAR, HERE'S THE GOLDEN ANTEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The year that was and the first Golden Anteater Awards: 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Performance by a Male Athlete in a Leading Role -- Point guard Lloyd 
Mumford, who seldom followed the script, wins for his brilliant ad libs during 
a Jan. 27 overtime loss at Long Beach State. Mumford's Harlem Globetrotter 
routine began after halftime, when he made eight of 13 mostly spectacular 
shots, scored 25 points and had six assists and three steals in the final 25 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Performance by a Female Athlete in a Leading Role -- The Anteater goes 
to junior Jinelle Williams. Only 5 feet 9, she rose above the crowd Feb. 26 and 
grabbed a school-record 23 rebounds against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Performance by a Male Athlete in a Supporting Role -- Carlos Bustos, 
hobbled by a knee injury for the first two days of the UCI Tennis Classic, 
limped out for the finals, beat South Alabama's Kal Petersson in three sets and 
Irvine won the tournament, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Performance by a Female Athlete in a Supporting Role -- Anteaters all 
around for the women's soccer team defense. Goalkeeper Amee Chapman went 270 
minutes without giving up a goal, but she had to make only 22 saves during that 
six-game period. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Costume Design -- Rod Baker for his dapper courtside ensembles. No 
other nominees need apply. Now, if the team only looked as good as he does . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 * Best Direction -- Accepting for Ray Smith is  
</P>
<P>
 . . . Smith has since been fired, but his ability to teach defense was the 
reason the women's soccer team had the best record in school history (12-8). 
Opponents scored 25 goals in 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Debut -- Laura Monson ran 30 seconds faster than her previous best time 
to win her first collegiate 3,000 meters at the Long Beach Relays Feb. 19. Then 
she won her next four 3,000-meter races. And Thursday night, she turned in the 
sixth-fastest 5,000 in Irvine history at the Penn Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Dialogue by a Guy in a Wig -- Volleyball player Leland Quinn's costumes 
were corny, but his critique of basketball officials and opposing players -- 
delivered in a booming voice perfect for theater -- was always razor sharp, 
funny and usually good-natured. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Script -- Dan Guerrero wins for his compelling tale of a second-year 
athletic director who deals with changing academic standards, minority and 
gender-equity issues, the great conference shake-up and, of course, shrinking 
revenues and still manages to smile. "All those constraints and barriers make 
it difficult to just keep pace, so sometimes your plans to grow and develop get 
compromised. It's frustrating, but that's how it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vote of confidence: The men's volleyball team finished the season with a 2-20 
record, but Coach Andy Read must have done a heck of a job on the two nights 
they won. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a program that won't be able to make a significant jump overnight 
because of the conference they're in," Guerrero said, "but we're taking the 
kind of steps we need to take. I feel real good about that program. Andy's got 
a good handle on what needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vote of confidence II: Colleen Matsuhara has won only 12 games during her 
three-year tenure as coach of the women's basketball team and 1993-94 was the 
final year of a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Matsuhara will return next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very young team that played a very difficult schedule," Guerrero said. 
"By the end of the year, the freshmen were playing like sophomores and the 
sophomores were playing like juniors. At the end of the season, we showed we 
could play with the best teams in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vote of confidence? Guerrero, on the Anteaters' run to the finals of the Big 
West basketball tournament: "Very positive, but can we sustain that kind of 
performance over the course of a season? That's the big question. That's what 
we'll be expecting next year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State of the Irvine: Guerrero, completing his first full year as athletic 
director, is a master of the positive spin. Forget that only a few of Irvine's 
19 sports teams produced winning records in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we established the aspects that are fundamental to our success," 
he said. "A foundation, a philosophy of recruitment and academics, a mindset 
for coaches, staff and administrators, the parameters in terms of expectations 
for their programs, a blueprint for our future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We raised a little more than $300,000 in our fund drive and our contract with 
the World Cup (as a training site) and bringing the Rams back for training camp 
will help us generate more dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not where we want to be by any stretch of the imagination, but I feel 
very positive about UCI athletics right now."

DRUG MERGER SENDS DOW INDEX UP 19 AS INTEREST RATES CLIMB; MARKETS: THE YIELD 
ON THE THREE-MONTH TREASURY BILL TOPS THE 4% LEVEL, THE HIGHEST RATE SINCE 
1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 News of a drug industry megamerger on Monday contributed to a rally in stocks 
led by economically sensitive cyclical shares and pharmaceutical issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, short-term interest rates rose to their highest level in more than 
two years, with the yield on the three-month Treasury bill topping the 
psychologically important 4% level. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates also rose, pushing bond prices lower, as upbeat 
economic news fanned fears of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, but tumbled against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.33 points to 3,701.02. Rising issues 
outnumbering declines by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, with more 
than 297.13 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's advance was sparked by a bid to take over Palo-Alto Syntex Corp. 
for $5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Roche Holding AG, based in Basel, Switzerland, agreed to pay $24 a share for 
Syntex, a maker of treatments for arthritis and skin diseases. Syntex surged 8 
1/4 to 23 1/2 and was the most active stock in U.S. composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Although health care stocks led the way, technology and other issues most 
sensitive to the economic cycles followed closely behind. Many of the day's 
best performers were from the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which 
rose 6.84 to 740.68. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the key 30-year bond yield rose to 7.33% from Friday's 
7.30%, while its price was down 9/32 point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face value. 
Prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Treasury sold $11.4 billion of three-month bills at an average 
discount rate of 4.00%, up from 3.85% last week. Another $11.5 billion of new 
six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 4.41%, up from 4.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-month bill rate was the highest since they sold for 4.08% on March 
30, 1992. The six-month bill rate was the highest since they averaged 4.5% on 
Nov. 25, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 On the economic front, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its 
April index rose to 57.7% from the previous month's reading of 56.7% and higher 
than the 56.3% reading economists had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 And the widely watched price component of the index showed prices did not rise 
as rapidly in April as in the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some reassurance from the report that price pressures are under 
control," said Michael Metz, investment strategist with Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending 
rose a modest 0.8% in March, after declining during an unusually stormy winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about inflation has driven down both bond and stock prices in recent 
weeks and pushed the Federal Reserve to nudge short-term interest rates higher 
three times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong economic growth brings the threat of inflation, which erodes the value 
of fixed-income securities such as treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 And stocks often look to bonds for direction because the higher interest rates 
that come with falling Treasury bond prices make shares less attractive and 
increase the cost of money to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar slid as stocks and bonds weakened in morning 
trading on the purchasing managers' report. But as stocks and bonds recovered 
later in the day, the dollar didn't necessarily rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 101.65 Japanese yen, up from Friday's 101.50 
yen. The U.S. currency was at 1.649 German marks, down from 1.6535 on Friday. 
That's the lowest point for the dollar vs. the mark in New York since a 1.6395 
rate on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cyclical stocks helped the Dow's rise. Alcoa added 3 to 70 1/2, DuPont rose 
1 3/8 to 58 1/2, and General Motors gained 1/2 to 57 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastman Kodak, another Dow component, shot up 3 to 44 1/2 on rumors that the 
company may announce it will sell all or portions of its Sterling Winthrop 
pharmaceutical unit. Kodak said it would make a significant announcement this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks surged as takeover speculation ran through the group. Eli Lilly 
rose 2 1/8 to 51 3/8, Schering-Plough gained 3 5/8 to 64, Upjohn added 1 3/4 to 
28 1/2 and Dow component Merck advanced 1 1/2 to 31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks and computer networkers were also strong. Cisco Systems 
rose 2-3/16 to 32 1/2, Wellfleet Communications gained 3 3/4 to 77 5/8 and 
Chipcom ended up 2 3/8 to 49 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casino operator Caesars World tumbled 4 7/8 to 43 3/4. It said its 
third-quarter earnings would fall below a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets were mixed. Mexico's Bolsa index fell 63.37 points to 
2,230.73 as investors continued to sell shares in response to last week's rash 
of poor corporate earnings reports, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average ended at 2,268.65, up 22.67 
points. The London stock exchange was closed for a market holiday. Tokyo's 
225-share Nikkei average slid 155.04 points to 19,570.21. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 Oil futures prices rose moderately, led by news of an emergency at a North Sea 
platform that halted production. Light sweet crude oil for delivery in June 
settled at $17.16 per barrel, up 26 cents, in light trading on the New York 
Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold fell on the New York Comex to $376.20 an ounce, down 40 cents. Silver 
fetched $5.298, down from $5.338 Friday.

THE TRIALS, TRIBULATIONS AND TRIUMPHS OF A SALES FORCE; THE FORCE BY DAVID 
DORSEY ; RANDOM HOUSE $22, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a practitioner and fan of "process books," I'm here to tell you: It is not 
as easy as it sounds.  
</P>
<P>
 A process book is supposed to show the reader how something works -- a 
computer company, as in Tracy Kidder's "The Soul of a New Machine"; the 
building of a new house, as in Kidder's "House"; a movie studio, as in John 
Gregory Dunne's "The Studio." The author works hard to be as unobtrusive as 
possible, to observe the conditions he or she hopes to document without in any 
way affecting them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough. David Dorsey covered Xerox for seven years for a Rochester, N.Y., 
daily newspaper, so he knew a great deal about the company. But when he stepped 
into position to write about the Xerox sales force in Cleveland, he was on 
foreign turf. He had to establish relationships with the members of the team, 
he had to take notes on everything until the story began to emerge -- and he 
had to fashion a story that moved, out of a reality that doesn't always move. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, for the Cleveland office, was to sell enough copiers to exceed its 
quota. The year hadn't been promising; by May, the team had made only 35% of 
its projections. But Dorsey and his subjects got lucky (who, after all, wants 
to read about a bunch of all-American losers?), and the plot takes an 
appropriately Rocky-esque turn, just in time to save the force -- and to save 
the force behind the force, district manager Fred Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomas' marriage to the beautiful Kathy is suffering from too much 
devotion to task. He's out at dawn and back late, up until midnight thinking 
about his salespeople -- how to motivate them, how to close those deals.  
</P>
<P>
 His behavior may seem heroic, but the task at hand leads even Thomas to the 
occasional bout of self-doubt. Sacrificing one's life to save humankind is hard 
enough, but giving it up to sell a machine? Dorsey does a nice job of capturing 
Thomas' doubts and fears, as well as his public bravado. He also gives us a 
portrait of a frustrated wife, who finally realizes that she'd be happier in a 
smaller house on a smaller budget if she could see her guy from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey got incredible access; sometimes it's painful to imagine him lurking in 
the corner of the Thomases' kitchen as they bare their souls to each other, 
and, because of Dorsey's presence, to the general public. In fact, my one 
hesitation about the book may be a consequence of his access -- then again, it 
may just be the difficulty that comes when it's time to prune one's notes and 
shape them into a story. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to be willing to toss, to throw out a beloved anecdote because it 
doesn't contribute to the tale, or to shape the material and give it a point of 
view. Not a prejudice -- we are talking good journalism here -- but a vantage 
point and a voice.  
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey seems too often to be working for his notes instead of working with 
them. Either he pushes too hard to make a philosophical point, until the reader 
wishes he'd back off and let the story tell itself, or he leaves in too much 
stuff. The writing sounds forced, as though he's afraid the information needs 
plumping. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to make a whole book about selling sound suspenseful. Dorsey writes: 
"One day passed, and then another, and another. All she could do now was wait 
to hear from Cook. Finally the phone rang. She suspected how it would turn out. 
She had just as much instinct and intuition as the rest of them -- at a certain 
point in a deal, you know what's going to happen. . . . Nancy needed this deal 
. . . to keep her self-respect."  
</P>
<P>
 Yep. That's what selling's about. But it can get monotonous. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the salesman's heroism comes through more clearly in Arthur 
Miller's "Death of a Salesman" than in "The Force." Willy Loman had secrets 
that gnawed at him and a desperate yearning to prevail, to save his doomed
