RELIEVED SPRINGER STANDOUT IN RELIEF; BASEBALL: HE GETS FIRST MAJOR LEAGUE SAVE 
AS ANGELS FINISH SWEEP OF RED SOX, 8-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Wednesday afternoon, Russ Springer was slumped in front of his locker, trying 
to explain why he had been replaced in the starting rotation by rookie Andrew 
Lorraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Springer retired 10 of the first 11 batters he faced and 
picked up the first save of his professional career as the Angels beat the Red 
Sox, 8-4, in front of 17,180 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his recall from triple-A Vancouver June 9, the Angels had been trying to 
get Springer to take advantage of his 6-foot-4 stature and pitch more over the 
top -- "downhill," as Manager Marcel Lachemann puts it. Springer had struggled 
trying to make the adjustment, though, and sounded almost relieved to be in the 
bullpen because he also been given permission to return to his natural arm 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just wasn't comfortable," he said. "I wanted to go back to the way I was 
pitching in Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, Springer was back in a comfort zone, pitching with his 
new-old three-quarters delivery, the one that had helped him to a 7-4 record 
with a 3.04 earned-run average in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time this season the Angels had swept a series, and the first 
time they had won three in a row since mid-June. Inconsistent pitching has been 
the key factor in their inability to string a few victories together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels staked Phil Leftwich to a 4-0 lead after two innings, but then the 
game developed into a see-saw, you-score-then-we'll-score affair, and Leftwich 
finally was lifted in the sixth inning after giving up back-to-back doubles to 
Tom Brunansky and Mike Greenwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich left with a 6-4 lead, but given the way baseballs were flying around 
the park, no lead was safe. The two teams had already collected sixteen hits, 
including four doubles and two homers, and they were only one out into the 
sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 So nobody in the stands was waving a broom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Springer, who was 0-1 in four relief appearances before Wednesday night, 
struck out four and gave up three singles. He may not have slammed the door, 
but he managed to push it shut, which is all the Angels can ask for these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel batters continued to hold up their end of the bargain, picking up 12 
hits, including home runs by Chili Davis and Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two Angel hitters -- Chad Curtis and Spike Owen -- scored as the 
Angels roughed up Boston starter Chris Nabholz for two runs on three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 They went ahead, 4-0, in the second inning when Chris Turner and Gary 
DiSarcina had back-to-back singles, Curtis walked and Spike Owen slapped a 
two-run single to left. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich retired the first six Red Sox in order, before designated hitter Wes 
Chamberlain singled off the glove of a diving DiSarcina to open the third 
inning. One out later, Damon Berryhill jumped on a 3-and-2 pitch and lined it 
over the wall in right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis led off the third and got half of the margin back on one swing. He hit a 
rocket in almost the exact same spot as Berryhill's homer. It was Davis' 20th 
homer of the season, the seventh in which he has hit at least 20 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of Boston's night might have come in the fourth inning, when a 
Red Sox pitcher finally managed to keep Curtis off base. Curtis, who had 
reached base 10 consecutive times, was hit by a pitch in the first and walked 
in the second. The streak ended two shy of the club record, set by Bobby Grich 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis' streak ended, but the hit parade didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams scored a run in the fifth and sixth innings. Owen's double, Davis' 
sacrifice fly and consecutive singles by Jackson and J.T. Snow chased Nabholz 
in the fifth. And Leftwich suffered a similar fate in the sixth.

HOW SERIOUS IS LOSS? LASORDA CAN'T EVEN EAT; BASEBALL: NO, IT'S NOT ANOTHER 
COMMERCIAL. IT'S A 5-4 DEFEAT AT NEW YORK, WHERE DODGERS BLOW OPPORTUNITY IN 
NINTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He was fiddling through the drawers of his desk, controlled anger showing on 
his face. There wasn't even a plate of food in front of Manager Tom Lasorda, a 
postgame oddity in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Lasorda leaned back and looked at a group of reporters that stood in 
silence, searching in vain for something to ask after the Dodgers had lost 
their fifth game in seven on this trip East. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is this, a library?" Lasorda quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 But there wasn't much to ask Lasorda, who watched his team lose to the New 
York Mets, 5-4, on Wednesday at Shea Stadium. The loss reduced the Dodgers' 
lead in the National League West to 3 1/2 games over the third-place San 
Francisco Giants, who have won 10 of 11 games. The Colorado Rockies also lost, 
remaining three games out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we aware of the Giants?" Lasorda asked. "Is that what you are asking me? 
We read the paper. Of course we are aware." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only consolation Lasorda had in Wednesday's game was finally getting 
to yell at somebody when third base umpire Jerry Layne called out Brett Butler 
at third base in the ninth inning. Butler represented the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw it, and he missed the play. He was out of position to make the call," 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Layne) kept telling me that if I didn't stop (arguing) he was going to throw 
me out. And I said, 'OK, if that's what you want to do, do it.' Usually an 
umpire runs up and sees the play. He stood back there with those dark glasses 
on and never moved." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, batting against relief pitcher John Franco, led off with a double down 
the left-field line. Delino DeShields then laid down a hard-hit bunt toward the 
first-base side of the pitcher's mound. Franco fielded it cleanly and threw to 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 "The umpire said I was out, and you can ask Bobby Bonilla and we'll see how 
honest he is," said Butler, who hit his seventh home run of the season in the 
third inning and scored in the Dodgers' two-run seventh on a triple by 
DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was out, Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 With pinch-hitter Mitch Webster at bat, Franco picked off DeShields, who was 
trying to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going all the way," said DeShields, who also scored two runs. "After 
that call at third, I figured I had to get in scoring position. But I guessed 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers didn't play well throughout. Ramon Martinez, who had lasted only 4 
1/3 innings in his last start, three days earlier, made it through five 
innings, leaving the game for a pinch-hitter in the sixth with the Dodgers 
trailing, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest mistake was giving up a two-run homer to Bonilla in the third and 
contributing to a two-run fourth inning, when Martinez failed to catch a 
double-play ball throw from Rafael Bournigal at first base. Bournigal was 
charged with a two-run error, but his throw wasn't that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sixth inning, Eric Karros was on third base with one out after a 
triple. But the Dodgers failed to score. They had 11 hits, the sixth 
consecutive game in which they have had 10 or more, and the fourth game during 
that stretch in which they have stranded eight or more runners. 
</P>
<P>
 In their last three games, they have stranded 35 and have won only once. The 
Dodgers scored all four runs and had nine hits in 6 1/3 innings against Bret 
Saberhagen (11-4), who is 6-0 against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only positive thing was the bullpen, which took over in the sixth 
and held the Mets the rest of the way. It wasn't pretty, but Rudy Seanez got 
out of a bases-loaded jam and pitched two scoreless innings and Jim Gott gave 
up two hits and overcame an error by Raul Mondesi when Mondesi, who bobbled a 
single to right field with one out, recovered to throw Ryan Thompson out at 
home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the bullpen did will get lost because of what actually happened in the 
game," Roger McDowell said. "They (Seanez and Gott) allowed us to have the 
opportunity to come back and win, but it gets lost because it's not a blown 
save." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who have lost both series on this trip, left New York for 
Montreal, where they have a 5-20 record in the last four seasons. The 
three-game series begins Friday, followed by another three-game series at 
Candlestick Park against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to take the day off (today) and empty our minds of what's gone 
on and hope things will be different," Butler said. "If we go at it any other 
way, we'll lose our minds."

PALMER'S 69 TIES HIM FOR BRITISH SENIOR LEAD; GOLF: JACKLIN ENDS A MISERABLE 
DAY WITH DISQUALIFICATION IN HIS SENIOR DEBUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Arnold Palmer shot a three-under-par 69 in the Senior British Open on 
Wednesday and tied for the first-round lead with Liam Higgins of Ireland and 
Alberto Croce of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer played the last 14 holes in six under par, with an eagle at the 15th, 
where he used a driver, a one-iron and one putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Former British Open champion Tony Jacklin was disqualified for signing an 
incorrect scorecard at the Royal Lytham and St. Annes, the same course on which 
he won the Open 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his debut on the British seniors circuit, Jacklin signed for a four at 
the 13th hole, where he had actually taken five strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the culmination of a disastrous afternoon for Jacklin. 
</P>
<P>
 He took an eight at the par-five 11th hole after his ball rebounded onto his 
chest as he tried to escape from a greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 He was uncertain of the penalty, but after some discussion it was agreed he 
should add two shots to his total. Jacklin completed his round in 81, nine over 
par. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the trouble I had at the 11th, and getting the penalty for that 
sorted out, I hadn't checked my card closely enough," Jacklin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who had been three strokes worse than Jacklin after four holes but 
played the next 14 in six under, was sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened to Tony is too bad," he said. "It does happen occasionally. I 
think he was just a little despondent about his round."

MUSIC REVIEW; MOZART CONCERT RESTORES THE CALM AT HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Van Cliburn is back on the road, blithely playing an abbreviated version of 
the massive comeback program he aborted at Hollywood Bowl last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Itzhak Perlman is concentrating on the fiddle again, having completed his 
stints as hypergushing TV host and pops-concert soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 The three tenorissimos are home counting their bucks and preparing the coffers 
for an orgy of instantly glorious reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 Music lovers who managed to buy tickets for recent Los Angeles galas are 
beginning to think about paying off their new mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 The chartreuse rain forest in the pavilions has been dismantled, waterfalls 
and all, and Dodger Stadium is beginning to look like a ballpark again. 
</P>
<P>
 The quasi-artistic byproducts of soccermania are receding into a haze of 
nostalgia. For some, the recession comes not a second too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, it was business as usual, once again, at Hollywood Bowl. 
Relief. Mozart be praised. 
</P>
<P>
 It was lovely business, quiet business, sensible business, sensitive business. 
It was unpretentious business, even elegant business. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that business better than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Philharmonic, appropriately reduced, played host to an 
unfamiliar conductor and a pianist barely remembered from the distant past. 
Although both would be welcome guests in any context, they seemed especially 
welcome after all those toots and whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 The visiting maestro was Matthias Bamert, director of the London Mozart 
Players as well as the Lucerne Festival in his native Switzerland. He isn't 
exactly a podium superstar. More important, however, he is a musician equipped 
with a solid technique and a stylistic conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 The soloist was Maria Tipo. Never mind that the program heralded her as Mario. 
 
</P>
<P>
 When she last (and first) appeared with our orchestra, playing the Beethoven 
First Concerto, the perceptive Times critic found her "a pianist of exceptional 
qualities." He went on to laud her "clean and facile fingers," her "sharply 
defined sense of rhythm, and effective . . . command of color contrasts." 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1956. The critic was Albert Goldberg. Our orchestra was still 
playing in Philharmonic Auditorium downtown. The conductor was Eduard van 
Beinum. Tipo was 24 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 She remains a pianist of exceptional qualities. As her career progressed, she 
has concentrated on teaching in addition to playing. Hers never became a 
household name, but, with the passage of time and the thinning of ranks, Tipo 
did became something of a connoisseur's pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 Her performance of the Concerto No. 21 in C, K. 467, was an object lesson in 
the fusion of pathos and grace, and a triumph of informed understatement. Here, 
at last, was an artist who respected the ebb and flow of Mozart's rhetoric. 
Here was an artist who could project lyricism without fussiness, intimacy 
without preciousness, speed without haste. 
</P>
<P>
 Her phrasing was always supple, her shading always subtle -- even in the wide, 
open spaces. She introduced her own spiffy cadenzas -- organic yet concise -- 
and she made an ethereal nocturne of the "Elvira Madigan" andante without 
resorting to romantic excess. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian pianist found a sympathetic ally in Bamert, a conductor who knows 
exactly when to follow and when to lead, and who does both without calling 
undue attention to himself. For once, the word collaboration seemed to mean 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamert opened the rather lengthy program with the Cassation in G, K. 63, a 
half-hour set of minuets, marches and other manifestations of Salzburg 
street-music cranked out by Mozart when he was a lad of 13. The lightweight 
formula pieces may threaten to wear out their welcome before the final cadence, 
but they certainly deserve to be heard once in a while. On this occasion, 225 
years after their creation, they were being heard for the first time by a Los 
Angeles Philharmonic audience. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, Bamert and his responsive players brought wry and easy 
charm to the F-major Divertimento, K. 138 (written when Mozart was a mature 
16). Turning to the great Symphony No. 39, K. 543 (written when Mozart was an 
old man of 32), they reinforced the essential urgency without compromising 
either clarity or wit. 
</P>
<P>
 It should always be like this. 
</P>
<P>
 Official attendance figures: 10,733 patrons, six airplanes.

 Museum's Satellite Plans: Highland Park's Southwest Museum, known for its vast 
collection of Native American art and artifacts, on Wednesday announced plans 
for a second museum site in Santa Barbara. The satellite would be near the 
city's waterfront in the proposed 18-acre Cabrillo Plaza complex, which would 
also include a maritime museum and aquarium, and an IMAX theater and 
auditorium. "The extraordinary breadth and quality of the Southwest Museum's 
collections . . . make it possible for us to develop a first-class American 
Indian museum in Santa Barbara," said Thomas E. Holliday, the museum's board 
president. "A second Southwest Museum facility would allow us to reach new 
audiences, expand our educational mission and display a greater proportion of 
our magnificent collections." Officials of the museum, founded in 1907, 
previously investigated opening a similar satellite facility in the Palm Desert 
area. The entire Cabrillo Plaza proposal, including the Southwest Museum site, 
goes before the Santa Barbara City Council on Tuesday.

 'Tenors' Encore: KCET-TV Channel 28 will bring the "Three Tenors" concert back 
to the air tonight at 8, with a repeat broadcast of Saturday's Dodger Stadium 
program. A spokeswoman for KCET said the broadcast, which was not planned to 
repeat again until August, was brought "back by popular demand." However, the 
station will also use tonight's airing as a fund-raiser, since Sunday's two 
broadcasts have already brought in a record $571,000 in audience pledges. The 
performance will still repeat in August.

 Playhouse's Season: The Pasadena Playhouse has announced a winter/spring 
season consisting of "Radio Gals," a '20s tale from Mike Craver and Mark 
Hardwick, creators of "Pump Boys and Dinettes" and "Oil City Symphony." "Radio 
Gals" is scheduled for Jan. 15-Feb. 19; Tom Dulack's Mafia comedy "Breaking 
Legs," March 19-April 23, and Frederick Knott's "Dial 'M' for Murder," May 
14-June 18. Playhouse officials hope subscriber responses will help them 
through a financial crisis. The city of Pasadena last week loaned the Playhouse 
$200,000 to sustain its cash flow until subscription renewals come in.

 New Cartoons: Warner Bros. has ordered 65 episodes of "The Sylvester & Tweety 
Mysteries," the first new cartoons featuring the classic characters to be 
produced in more than three decades. "Sylvester & Tweety," along with a new 
animated series from director Steven Spielberg called "Freakazoid!" and 
Spielberg's already existing cartoon "Animaniacs," will be featured in "Kids 
WB," a new programming block scheduled to launch in September of 1995 on the 
nascent WB Television Network. "Freakazoid!," Spielberg's first animated action 
adventure, is about a small-town teen who is transformed into a hip super-hero 
after an accident in a school science lab. In "The Sylvester & Tweety 
Mysteries," the two characters will traverse the world as they attempt to solve 
great mysteries. Three additional cartoon series will be announced later. Last 
week, Warner Bros. licensed several of its older cartoons, including "Alvin & 
the Chipmunks" and Spielberg's "Tiny Toons Adventures," to cable's Nickelodeon.

 Stones Deja Vu: The lines started forming outside the 1,200-capacity RPM Club 
in Toronto at 8 a.m. Tuesday in anticipation of a surprise performance by the 
Rolling Stones. The fans were rewarded 14 hours later with a rollicking, 
15-song set, ranging from such early hits as "Street Fighting Man" and 
"Tumbling Dice" to five songs from the group's new "Voodoo Lounge" album. "It 
was a dream come true," said Thomas Duncan, 19, after the show. "Seeing them in 
a place this small must have been like seeing the Stones back when they were 
getting started." The band too must have thought that the show -- a warm-up for 
a stadium tour that begins Aug. 1 in Washington, D.C. -- was reminiscent of the 
wild '60s days. Among the items hurled at the group in the room's sweltering 
heat: three bras.

 Caan Investigated: Police said they are investigating claims against actor 
James Caan that surfaced late Tuesday when a woman filed a lawsuit alleging 
that Caan beat and choked her at the Century City Inn earlier this year. Leesa 
Anne Roland, who says she began dating Caan in early 1993, claims in her 
lawsuit that Caan punched her several times, "picked her up by the neck with 
both of his hands, choking her . . . and threw her into the hallway." In March, 
Caan was booked for investigation of brandishing a weapon during an argument. 
He hasn't been charged but faces a city attorney's hearing next week.

 Barren landscapes populated by lost and forlorn people, steeped in mysterious 
everyday sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities in Edward Hopper's paintings inspired playwright-director 
Susan J. Emshwiller to create "Brush Strokes," a set of one-act plays at the 
Met Theatre based on six of the artist's lesser-known paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacularly successful results are due in part to Emshwiller's ingenuity 
in extracting scenarios ripe with drama from telling clues in Hopper's cryptic 
portraits. But just as important is the evocative visual composition in her 
staging. Hopper aficionados will appreciate the fidelity of detail, color and 
tone -- a triumph for set designer Kelly Deco and scene painter Rebeca Lee 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Emshwiller also brings enviable economy and precision to her scripting. There 
isn't a wasted word in dialogue that reveals entire histories without recourse 
to expository narration. 
</P>
<P>
 The structural immediacy is established in the first episode, "Hotel by a 
Railroad." We piece together the invented scenario from distracted snippets of 
conversation on the morning after a one-night stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The man (David Clennon) is about to board a train out of town. The woman's 
(Lynn Milgrim's) reaction to the discovery that he's married tells us all we 
need to know about the strategies and concealments of the evening before. But 
she has some surprises of her own that undermine his smug self-satisfaction as 
the conquering manipulator, and end the scene on a satisfying note of tables 
turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more sparse and enigmatic is the second-half opener, "Sea Watchers," in 
which an argument between a couple at the beach pits the man's (William 
Mesnik's) rational attempts at definition against the woman's (Maxine Fay 
James') hostility to language, until a simple, understated gesture bridges 
their communication impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scenes offer more elaborate story lines, though at times their 
complexity clashes with the paintings' arid stasis. In "Four Lane Road," the 
drudgery of daily chores erupts into a fierce confrontation between the abusive 
owner (David Schultz) of a desolate highway gas station and his defiant son 
(David Joseph). While the story eventually dovetails nicely with the painted 
scene, the dramatic distance required to get there exceeds the performers' 
naturalistic boundaries, and a closing pun only underscores the melodramatic 
artifice. 
</P>
<P>
 Even greater liberties are taken with the event-driven caper scenario brought 
to "Room in New York." The plot seems better suited to "Alfred Hitchcock 
Presents" than to a portrait of Americana, but eerie performances from Susan 
Lee Hoffman and Mark Brady make for an unsettling and effective episode. 
</P>
<P>
 The best balance between a source painting and the play's interpretive license 
is "Hotel Room." Wayne Pere is brilliant as the sinister charmer who plays on 
the innocence of Kim Gillingham's heartbroken naif. The scene ends without a 
final resolution (very true to the tone of a Hopper painting), but we can see 
from Pere's momentary look of regret where things are headed. 
</P>
<P>
 The concluding "Western Hotel" takes its surprisingly affirmative, upbeat 
spirit from the only painting in which the subject, a calm, self-confident 
woman, looks directly back at the viewer. While Tom Bower could have found more 
levels to his role as her companion, Martha Gehman turns the scene into a 
celebration of feminine resuscitation a la Molly Bloom -- voicing the author's 
eloquent rebuttal to Hopper's somber despair.

JAZZ REVIEW; JIMMY SCOTT'S REVERBERATIONS OF THE PAST AT CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you figure the return of Jimmy Scott? Moderately successful in the 
'50s, his eclipse from the popular music scene stretched over nearly three 
decades before he -- like Tony Bennett -- was embraced by a new generation of 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 But his eccentric singing style hasn't changed a bit. Tuesday night, in the 
opening set of a weeklong run at Catalina, Scott devoted most of his material, 
which included songs such as "All Of Me" and "All the Way," to the 
excruciatingly slow tempos and passionately declamatory interpretations that 
have been his specialty since the beginning of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Bennett, Scott's singing is less an expansion and further exploration 
of classic styles than a kind of reverberating echo from the past. Traces of 
Johnny Ray's theatricality, Roy Brown's ardent gospelisms and Elmore James' 
plaintive vocalizing drifted through Scott's readings, modified and 
personalized by his own unique emphasis upon the storytelling qualities of the 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's backup trio of longtime associates Ken Itchi Shimazu on piano, 
Hilliard Green on bass and Brian Kirk on drums added much needed rhythmic 
contrast and shading. DON HECKMAN

CLUB REVIEW; A CULTURALLY DIVERSE MICROCOSM AT BIZERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hip-hop club in a tony Westside mall may seem a bit oxymoronic, but the 
promoters behind Bizerk may be on to something, well, sane. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-style dance club, held each Monday at Renaissance, a two-tiered, 
upscale restaurant and nightclub in Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, is 
one of the only hip-hop clubs currently attracting a wide variety of Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 The probable reason: Hip-hop fans who might be intimidated about venturing to 
a downtown venue at night have no reservations about driving to a mall by the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 This gives Bizerk an unusual edge over other clubs around town. Not only could 
the folks on the dance floor be a microcosm of L.A.'s cultural diversity, but 
the age range of those bumping and grinding to the primarily old-school, East 
Coast music mix favored by Bizerk's deejays is equally dramatic.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortysomething women in cocktail dresses boogie comfortably to Doug E. Fresh 
music beside beanie-wearing Generation Xers. Folks clad in business suits (by 
midnight the ties get a bit looser) share the floor with ripped-jeans rocker 
types. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-month-old club has featured live performances by such artists as the 
Beatnuts, Daddy Freddy and King T.  
</P>
<P>
 Bizerk, which expands around midnight when a wall of the dance area disappears 
to include Renaissance's spacious dining patio, may lack the underground, 
gritty vibe of traditional hip-hop clubs, but it's doing some long-overdue 
bridging of the city's cultural gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bizerk, every Monday at Renaissance, 1212 Third Street Promenade, Santa 
Monica, (310) 854-0468. $10 cover. HEIDI SIEGMUND

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A MISGUIDED OUTING FOR A GIFTED CHILDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toni Childs is an immensely gifted singer, but she may not be her own best 
friend when it comes to making artistic choices. Six years after her appealing 
debut, "Union," written primarily on her own, she's come up with an ambitious 
and sorely misguided concept album that any reasonable collaborator would have 
talked her out of. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Woman's Boat," played almost in its entirety and in order, provided the 
gist of Childs' wildly uneven show Tuesday at House of Blues. The song cycle 
emblematically charts a human life from beginning to end, and what passed for 
life between "Womb" and "Death" often consisted of light, not overly tuneful 
world-beat/rock rhythms. They were an undercurrent for successions of 
overwrought and underwritten statements about existence and earnest expressions 
of universal Angst whose baldly primal nature didn't quite substitute for 
songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 The full house nonetheless lapped up the latest offerings from the sultry 
beauty, whose unique chops -- at her best, she's a bona fide white soul singer, 
somewhere between Phoebe Snow and Johnette Napolitano -- can sometimes sell 
even questionable material. Childs wasn't beyond overreaching vocally, too, 
turning her hit "Don't Walk Away" (one of five older numbers) into 
nodule-scratching overkill, but the singer also proved capable of investing 
quieter numbers with a subtlety that made them as touching as intended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Toni Childs plays Friday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano, 8 and 10:30 p.m. $21.50. (714) 496-8927. CHRIS WILLMAN

TV REVIEW; 'HITLER, STALIN' DOCUMENTS BRUTAL REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When CBS' superb "Hitler and Stalin: Legacy of Hate" was first scheduled to 
air last October -- only to be pre-empted by the network's broadcast of the 
final game of the American League championship series -- the siege of Sarajevo 
and the "ethnic cleansing" campaign in Bosnia dominated the news. The timing, 
and the historical connections, could not have been more potent. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, "Hitler and Stalin" is finally being shown -- an 
unforgivable lapse of time for such a striking piece of relevant television 
history. Still, with the now-retired Charles Kuralt and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf 
as hosts, this is a kind of timeless piece of journalism that dramatically 
mirrors the rises, falls and characters of the 20th Century's bloodiest 
tyrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer range of interview subjects assembled by producer and co-writer 
Jennifer Laird is truly epic -- from Holocaust survivor Elisabeth Mann and 
Hitler inner-circle veteran Reinhard Spitzy to journalist (and future theater 
critic) Walter Kerr and U.S. Olympians Marty Glickman and Archie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 More than most network documentaries, the carefully selected, astonishing 
archive footage tends to amplify what Laird's subjects say. Reporters recall 
the frozen soldiers of the bitter, seven-month Battle of Stalingrad, when 
Russia finally spurned the invading Nazis -- and we see the obscenely contorted 
corpses. As military cameraman Tom Priestley shudders telling what he saw when 
he entered the Nazi death camps at World War II's end, we see footage of the 
naked victims of "The Final Solution," footage Priestley himself may have shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, we see how the leading communist and facist of the mid-century 
paralleled each other in important ways. Both killed those in their own ranks 
as freely as their enemies. Both were consumed by paranoia and obsessed with 
bizarre medical notions. Both assumed they knew more than their generals about 
military strategy. Both even posed for postcard shots with little girls and 
raised the cult of the personality to religious heights. 
</P>
<P>
 That the cults remain is nothing compared to the fact that the tactics of 
death camps and extermination have returned. Perhaps the new images of the 
Rwandan mass murder will not make "Hitler and Stalin" nine months too late. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hitler and Stalin: Legacy of Hate" airs at 9 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 
8).

 The Fish School 
</P>
<P>
 The first public school in the New World, in Plymouth, Mass., was partly 
financed from sales of striped bass. Iceberg 100 
</P>
<P>
 This year marks the 100th anniversary of iceberg lettuce, which got its name 
because it could be shipped long distances in refrigerated railway cars. Even 
with refrigeration, traditional looseleaf lettuce varieties would have wilted 
long before they made it to the city. Do You Have Crunchy-Style Fibi? 
</P>
<P>
 A new trend is soft drinks fortified with vitamins and other nutritional 
supplements. Mostly they're made by small-fry companies, but Coca-Cola is said 
to be "monitoring" the field. (And maybe a little more than that; it has 
already introduced a dozen "nutraceutical" drinks in Japan, including Samson V, 
beta carotine-fortified Vegita Bega and Fibi, a fiber drink.) Dukie's Cookies 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being the Prince of Wales, Prince Charles is also the Duke of 
Cornwall; in fact, the 130,000-acre property known as the Duchy of Cornwall 
(most of the land not actually located in Cornwall) is his sole source of 
income until he becomes King. The Duchy is currently engaged in negotiations to 
put the molasses and oat cookies ("biscuits") made from grain grown organically 
at one of his properties in Gloucestershire on the shelves of upscale American 
shops. Any profits from the cookies, handsomely imprinted with the Duke's seal, 
will go to charity. (Don't worry about Chuck -- he gets by on the $6 million a 
year the Duchy brings him.) Wake Up and Smell the Eggs 
</P>
<P>
 If you really, truly can't do anything in the morning, Breakfast Express may 
be your solution. It's a machine manufactured by Welbilt, the bread machine 
company, that you can set to have your coffee ready for you at wakeup time -- 
plus toast and two eggs sunnyside up (there's a dial for firmness). It'll set 
you back about $499, though. Available now from Hammacher-Schlemmer in New 
York; in department stores by October. Foreign Widgets 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people don't know what a widget is, but there is such a thing, 
invented by the Guinness Brewing Co. in 1988; it's a plastic device in the 
bottom of a beer can that releases gas when the can is opened, giving the 
thick, smooth head British Isles beer-drinkers associate with a traditional 
hand-pumped pint. If you think there's no point in making widgets, consider 
this: In England (there's no widgeted beer in this country), people pay as much 
as 70% extra. CHARLES PERRY

 DEAR SOS: I'd like to locate a recipe for chicken baked with garlic and 
artichokes.  
</P>
<P>
 -- CATHERINE 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR CATHERINE: Chicken with 40 cloves of garlic, a recipe inherited from 
James Beard, is made with artichokes. Don't worry about the amount of garlic. 
The sharp flavor dissipates with cooking, leaving a strong but appealing taste. 
CHICKEN WITH 40 CLOVES OF GARLIC 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3- to 4-pound) chicken  
</P>
<P>
 4 heads garlic, broken into cloves 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon mixed herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, oregano, sage and basil 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 6 boiling potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 8 to 10 baby artichokes, trimmed of tough outer leaves, or frozen artichokes 
</P>

bay leaves, 1 sprig thyme 
</P>
<P>
 Flour  
</P>
<P>
 Water 
</P>
<P>
 Place chicken, garlic cloves and oil in 4- to 6-quart lidded casserole 
(earthenware if possible). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add mixed 
herbs. Add potatoes and artichokes. Mix well. Be sure all garlic cloves don't 
fall to bottom of casserole. Bury bouquet garni in middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Place about 1/2 cup flour in mixing bowl and add enough cold water to make 
stiff paste. Roll out paste on floured board, adding more flour to paste if it 
seems sticky. Cut paste into long strips, about 1 1/2 inches wide. Moisten lip 
of casserole and line with dough strips. Moisten inside lip of casserole cover 
and place on top of casserole. Press dough with fingers so that firm seal is 
made between lid and casserole and no air can escape. Bake at 350 degrees 1 1/2 
hours. Makes 4 servings.

LOW-FAT COOKING: OINKLESS TERRINE

 In the summer, when you're trying to cut fat, the best dishes are the ones 
that are not only light, but easy to make. This low-fat turkey terrine can be 
prepared ahead and baked in the morning or evening hours while it's still cool. 
Then it can be kept in the refrigerator, on hand for a quick light dinner when 
it seems too hot to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the labels on the ground turkey package for the fat percentages. We used 
97% fat-free ground turkey. Also in the terrine: fresh chopped mushrooms, 
chopped spinach and nonfat egg substitute for lightness. 
</P>
<P>
 Slice the terrine thin and serve it on French bread with crunchy lettuce, thin 
sliced red onions and tomatoes and a touch of mustard. Served with green 
onions, radishes and cornichons, this makes a great hot-weather lunch or 
dinner. CHILLED FLORENTINE TURKEY TERRINE

BETTER RED THAN . . . WHITE

 Red wine outpolled white by a margin of about 20 to 1 when wine merchants and 
wine collectors were asked to suggest which wines a newcomer to wine collecting 
should seek out when starting a cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, most wine collectors say the only white wines they drink are 
relatively young white Burgundies because most such wines don't age very well. 
</P>
<P>
 However, more than 70% of all wine consumed in this country is white or 
"blush" -- wines that may be consumed very young and are best chilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Another interesting finding: Most West Coast collectors and merchants 
recommend that almost all red wine aged in cellars be consumed within 10 or 12 
years of harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 This follows what I've thought for a long time: American wine lovers, unlike 
their British counterparts, prefer to drink their wines younger, while still 
fresh. Old white wines and even older red wines hold much less fascination here 
than across the pond. DAN BERGER

WINE: CELLARING THE DREAM TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, after last week's section on starting a wine cellar, you're curious about 
what to put in it. What to buy is always a knotty problem. And since I don't 
know your palate, making specific suggestions would take up this entire 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, select wine from producers who have a track record for having made 
great, ageworthy wine over the years, and then select only from vintages that 
are considered great. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, to limit your risk, pick wines from producers who are well enough 
known so that if down the road you find you don't like a wine, there may be 
someone else who will and may be willing to trade you for something you prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd focus on red wine, which is most of what I drink. The wines on the 
following personal "wish list" aren't inexpensive, and some wines are difficult 
to get, but every wine will reward: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bordeaux: Top-growth wines from the 1986 and 1990 vintages. Focus on 
chateaux such as Latour, Margaux, Lafite, Cheval Blanc, Lynch-Bages, 
Cheval-Blanc, Lagrange, Palmer and Ausone. 
</P>
<P>
 * California Cabernet Sauvignon: I prefer elegance over raw power, so start 
with Silverado Vineyards, Shafer Vineyards, Etude, Grace Family Vineyard, 
Caymus Vineyards, St. Clement Vineyards, Markham Vineyards, Hess Collection, 
Arrowood, Laurel Glen, Phelps, Meridien Vineyards (a bargain in this group) and 
Cuvaison. 
</P>
<P>
 Among younger, less-well-known producers, try Cabernets from Staglin Family 
Vineyards, Araujo Estate, Von Strasser Vineyards, and Oakville Ranch Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Burgundy: Most Burgundies from 1990 and many from 1991 will be great in a 
decade. But because of the confusing nature of this district, it's best to ask 
a good wine merchant for ideas. Stick to reputable producers, however; famed 
"sleepers" may turn out, a decade hence, to be dead. In whites, I'd pick any of 
Ramonet's, though a few are a test to the uninitiated. 
</P>
<P>
 * California Chardonnay: Not many of these age well. Those that can include 
Stony Hill, St. Clement, Hanzell Vineyards, Iron Horse Vineyards, Far Niente 
Winery, Grgich Hills Cellars, Woltner Estate and Trefethen. Many of the rest 
should be carefully watched. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Pinot Noir: California makes many great ones. The best, from 
Williams & Selyem, is all but unavailable, so try the great wines of Gary 
Farrell in addition to Calera, Au Bon Climat, David Bruce Winery, Iron Horse, 
Saintsbury, Acacia Winery, Navarro Vineyard and the terrific Domaine Drouhin of 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rhone: Any red wine from Jaboulet, Chapoutier or Guigal is a candidate to 
age, particularly those from the Cote Rotie or Hermitage, but also such lovely 
wines as St.-Joseph and Chateauneuf-du-Pape. 
</P>
<P>
 * Australia: Grange Hermitage is a must, but very difficult to find, so try 
for Penfolds Bin 707. 
</P>
<P>
 * Italy: Barolo from 1989 or 1990, and Chianti Riserva from 1990 and 1991 will 
be excellent within the next decade. The '90 Barolos should be alive and 
kicking for our grandchildren's midlife crises. 
</P>
<P>
 * Port: Any producer's 1963, wines that are still not at their peak. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sauternes: Chateau d'Yquem or Chateau Climens. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Champagne, buy what you need when you need it. Cellaring Champagne is a 
dicey proposition and best left to people who have a long experience with old 
bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I asked a number of people, including wine collectors, wine writers and 
merchants, for ideas. Here are a few of them, with general price ranges listed 
for current wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince DiPierro of Studio City, one of the world's leading collectors of 
Chateau Haut-Brion, suggests we taste a bottle and then store a few more of -- 
what else- 1983 Chateau Haut-Brion, "which is pretty drinkable, but still has 
some life," he says. "Then for comparison, try something like 1985 Spottswoode 
Cabernet, which is from a really great vintage. Both wines are somewhat 
available if you go to a fine wine merchant." 
</P>
<P>
 It's understandable that DiPierro, director of purchasing for Warner Bros. 
Records, would recommend Haut-Brion: His 15,000-bottle collection includes 
9,000 bottles of Haut-Brion. DiPierro, who supports local charities with wine 
donations, has so much Haut-Brion that the chateau calls on him when it needs 
wines it doesn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Golbahar of Twenty-Twenty Wines in West Los Angeles suggests 1990 Chateau 
Lagrange ($35), which he calls "an amazing wine that will improve for at least 
a decade." 
</P>
<P>
 Golbahar is among the few merchants who suggest a white wine, offering 1992 
Louis Latour Corton-Charlemagne ($55). 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Nicoll of Bristol Farms in South Pasadena suggests 1991 Barnett Vineyards 
Cabernet Sauvignon ($24); 1991 Woodward Canyon Cabernet ($30); 1990 Chateau 
Sociando-Mallet ($24), and 1990 Chateau de Marbuzet ($20). 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Coles of Conejo Valley Wine and Provision in Thousand Oaks says: "Any 1985 
California Cabernet is a must. Try to get Caymus 'Special Selection' or 
Shafer's 'Hillside Select.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He says a great older wine that may still be available is 1981 Chateau Rayas 
from Chateauneuf-du-Pape. 
</P>
<P>
 David Breitstein of the Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park says he'd have 
heavyweights like Duckhorn Vineyards "Three Palms" Merlot, Heitz "Martha's 
Vineyard" Cabernet, Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, and Chateau Petrus, regardless 
of vintage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Petrus is expensive," says Breitstein, "but everybody should have at 
least a bottle of Petrus . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Petersil of the Flask in Studio City suggests buyers wait two months and 
then buy quantities of the new 1990 Silver Oak Cellars Cabernet ($32), the new 
1991 Spottswoode ($36), "and, if they have the money, do Opus One ($65). It's 
sensational!" 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Hansen of Hi-Time Cellars in Costa Mesa concurs on the Opus One. "It's a 
killer," he says. The wine will be released Oct. 1. Hansen also suggests 1989 
Shafer Vineyards "Hillside Select" Cabernet ($26) in addition to 1992 ZD Pinot 
Noir ($16) and 1992 Forest Hill Vineyards "Private Reserve" Chardonnay ($26). 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Bialek of Los Angeles Wine Co. in West Los Angeles suggests 1991 Mondavi 
Reserve Cabernet ($50). 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Smith of Northridge Hills Liquor and Wine Warehouse recommends, among 
other wines, Burgundies from Claude Dugat, "just about anything from LeClerc 
and any Jayer Echezeaux." 
</P>
<P>
 He also likes Guigal's Cote Roties such as "La Mouline," and recommends an 
array of Super Tuscans such as Sassicaia, Ornellaia and Massetto. 
</P>
<P>
 David Dobbs of Red Carpet Wine and Spirits of Glendale says his first 
recommendation would be "Burgundy without a doubt, and my top four are Emanuel 
Rouget, Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, Meo-Camuzet and Leroy. And in whites, 
Ramonet." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Hille, a Santa Monica wine merchant, suggests long gold capsule Ausleses 
from J.J. Prum or Fritz Haag. The current releases are $170 per bottle, each, 
"but worth every cent." 
</P>
<P>
 Hille also says: "Then I would add 1990 Armand Rousseau Chambertin ($100) and 
I would put in a case of 1992 Ridge Geyserville ($18)." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fishman of Wally's on Westwood Boulevard suggests any 1990 Barolo, 1986 
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, the 1992 Swanson Merlot ($16), and the new 1992 Iron 
Horse Pinot Noir ($18). 
</P>
<P>
 David Russell of the Wine Cask in Santa Barbara, one of the savviest import 
buyers around, suggests "some of the really top-drawer Piedmontese wines of 
1989 and 1990, such as Aldo Conterno, Domenico Clerico and Elio Altare." He 
also likes the Musigny and Bonnes-Mares of Comte de Voguuee, and the red wines 
of Daniel Rion. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rogness of the Wine Expo in Santa Monica, always looking for esoterica, 
suggested a red wine from Ca' Rome, a Barbaresco producer, whose wine called 
"Da Pruve" is 85% Nebbiolo and 15% Barbera. At $20, Rogness calls it a bargain. 
"It'll age 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'd have a case of Bollinger Special Cuvee and I'd drink a bottle every 
year for 12 years." Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Cypress Chardonnay by J. Lohr Winery ($7.75) -- I'm not a big fan of 
Chardonnays that are so laden with oak they smell like a tree and have such 
weight that they sit on the palate leadenly. So it was a long and dreary day 
for me recently when I blind-tasted 54 Chardonnays and found far too many of 
them made just that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the midst of the process, came this lovely wine, hinting in aroma of 
lime and spice, with a delicate, lean entry, ample fruit on the tongue and a 
crisp yet not acidic finish. The judges all scored this wine right near the top 
of the pack, and when tasted again later with the rest of the winners, it was 
judged clearly a best buy, especially since most discounters will have it for 
$6.50 or even less.

LITE READING; SO MANY COOKBOOKS, SO LITTLE FAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, Stabiner is writing a book about Dr. Susan Love and the UCLA 
Breast Center.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Advocates of low-fat diets can sound impossibly smug, so at the outset I want 
to go on record as an all-American fat lover. In the 1960s, my favorite 
folks-are-going-out convenience meal was a rib-eye steak, tater tots and a 
salad smothered in bottled Thousand Island. Maybe a cupcake for dessert. With a 
nice frosty glass of cold -- whole -- milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain of my friends consider me a pious healthie because I have an honest 
affection for most vegetables, but really: I've never met a gelato I didn't 
like. My husband and 5-year-old daughter occasionally make irresistible 
scrambled eggs smothered in butter. And I love the tell-tale silkiness of 
traditional pesto, the kind that clings to each piece of fettuccine like a 
slinky dress on an oh-so-thin socialite. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are the lean '90s. If the '80s were the decade of excess, of 
towering pastries and junk bonds, then this is the era of nonfat Parmesan 
cheese and a sensible mutual fund. Fat is politically incorrect. Feeding fat to 
your family is a social felony. The only problem is, nobody knows how to cook 
without it. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishing industry, quick to sense an audience in need of guidance, has 
clogged the arteries of the marketplace with a flood of cookbooks aimed at the 
re-education of the American public. We've got nonfat recipes, low-fat recipes, 
"light" recipes (usually a euphemism for not quite so low-fat), celebrity 
cookbooks and gimmicks. "In the Kitchen With Rosie," an appropriately slim 
volume from Oprah Winfrey's in-house chef, Rosie Daley, has sold more copies 
than any cookbook in the history of record-keeping, with a reported 4.2 million 
copies in print. It's almost impossible to avoid: even if you never set foot in 
bookstores, you'll find it at the checkout counter of your local upscale market 
right next to the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like CD-ROM, low-fat cooking is in its gold-rush phase. Eventually it will 
shake out -- but for now there's too much opportunistic product to make much 
sense. How can you grasp, or trust, a category that includes everything from 
the American Heart Assn.'s cookbook to Richard Simmons' "Dial-A-Meal"? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is, with great trepidation. I've examined almost two dozen books 
and can report that they fall into three fairly distinct categories. First, 
there are the books that want to help you change the way you eat, written by 
visionaries who can imagine a brave new world where not every green bean is 
swathed in butter, not every strawberry cloaked in cream. Next, a step down the 
morality ladder, are the books that want to help you eat all the bad stuff 
you've always eaten, but in a low-fat kind of way. Last, there are the gimmick 
books, usually tied into a product or a marketing concept, like Simmons' flash 
cards, video and guide to junk food, or the "Butter Busters" cookbook, which 
relies on products such as Butter Buds, Egg Beaters and both original and brown 
Sweet 'N' Low. 
</P>
<P>
 All the cookbooks offer revised versions of your favorite forbidden treats -- 
wisely, since even the most motivated among us are hardly going to switch cold 
turkey (so to speak) from Western foods to a rural Chinese peasant diet. What 
makes the difference, as with any kind of writing, is imagination. The best 
cookbook writers rethink food and teach us tricks we can use in our own 
repertoire of dishes. The worst writers plug in low-fat substitutes for fatty 
ingredients and expect us to like a literal imitation that only succeeds in 
reminding us of just what we're missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Your taste buds are not stupid. They know that chocolate tofu cheesecake, or 
pasta stuffed with three nonfat cheeses, is not the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a responsible eater to do? Change your flavor and texture expectations. 
Having tried three pestos and their Provencal cousin, pistou , I can attest 
that low-fat pesto does not taste or feel like the real thing. It's chunkier, 
harsher, brighter; it's a pushy dish. But if you unhinge your memory -- to 
borrow from Southern California therapy-speak, if you can live in the moment -- 
you may find that some of this neo-pesto is, in fact, quite good. The trick 
about low-fat food is not to compare it to what you're used to, but to take it 
on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably why the vegetable dishes and entrees are the best thing about 
"In the Kitchen With Rosie," the leader of the low-fat pack. Rosie Daley 
reinvents dishes. She retools a few bad foods, in deference to her boss's love 
of anything fried, but for the most part these are clean new ideas. Fair 
warning: Many of them are labor-intensive, and some call for costly 
ingredients. There are only 50 recipes in the book, so it hardly qualifies as a 
comprehensive instruction manual for a new life. But it's a great start. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Daley calls her tomato-based topping for grilled bread " bruschetta 
," it is a distant cousin to the standard combination of olive oil, garlic and 
tomatoes. Daley's version is completely oil-free, but you hardly feel deprived 
eating it. The juice from the tomatoes plays the olive oil's part, soaking and 
flavoring the bread, and frankly, as we head into fresh tomato season, it's 
nice to give that crimson fruit the leading role. The addition of balsamic 
vinegar gives the acid mix a smooth note, as oil would have. It's my favorite 
of all the dishes I tried. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil-free pesto, moistened instead with lemon juice, is a tougher go, 
though one woman I know says she loves it so much she eats it with a spoon. 
It's not just a matter of texture here. Pesto seems to need a little olive oil 
to balance the flavors, and there really is no room for imaginative 
substitutions. Pesto is pesto. So I cheated and added a single teaspoon of oil, 
which made a huge difference and was still way on the healthy side of the 
half-cup that traditional recipes call for. 
</P>
<P>
 While I was at it, I took a side trip into a couple of other pestos and 
learned a valuable lesson. There is such a thing as going overboard. Julee 
Rosso's "Great Good Food" pesto suffers from too much garlic, though I usually 
think that there is no such thing; her broccoli pesto, soothed with chicken 
broth, is much better. Try instead the pistou in "Provencal Light," where a 
chopped tomato lightens the basil paste. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're going to eat pesto at all, perhaps moderation is success enough: You 
can't fit a Size 10 foot into a Size 5 shoe and pesto, the original recipe of 
which gets something like 90% of its calories from fat, is the definitive Size 
10 foot. The American Heart Assn. cookbook's pesto -- which uses olive oil, 
Parmesan and pine nuts -- can, with a little tinkering, taste great, feel right 
and still come in at a fairly reasonable 16 grams of fat. Some people need to 
give up oil entirely, for health reasons, but the vast majority of us just need 
to use less of it. If I can make pesto with a little oil, and still come in 
near 30% fat, that's plenty of virtue for me. I'll serve my family fresh 
peaches for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daley works her real magic making fake fried foods: The unfried chicken is so 
crisp that one paranoid diner kept lifting up the breading to make sure no skin 
lurked beneath it. It does seem a little silly to be using dried basil in a 
Mediterranean climate, where the fresh stuff grows as easily as weeds, but the 
breading mix relies on a careful balance of dried herbs and spices to trick the 
palate. The compromise is worth it to anyone who hankers for fried chicken, but 
since merely removing the skin from roast chicken makes it just as low-fat as 
chicken cooked without skin, I wonder if the effort is worth it on a regular 
basis. Daley coats French fries in egg whites and spices and then bakes them, 
turning the coating into wispy, crispy -- and grease-free -- meringue. While I 
busily apologized for the way they looked, my husband and daughter devoured 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 If Daley's oatmeal muffins look like hockey pucks and have the consistency of 
old foam rubber, well, nobody's perfect. Baked goods are the bete noire of 
low-fat cookers. The only one who seems to have them licked, consistently, is 
Sarah Schlesinger, whose "500 Fat-Free Recipes" offers plenty of delicious 
nonfat desserts. Honest. Schlesinger, a practitioner of fruit puree 
replacement, makes a strawberry and orange cake that I've yet to sample the 
morning after: It simply doesn't last that long. It looks absolutely 
frightening in the raw -- a globby dough outtake from "The Blob" sunk under a 
thin mix of orange juice, sugar, orange peel and strawberries. But once in the 
oven, the dough puffs and gets porous, the fruit seeps in, and the result is 
something like a guilt-free clafouti . 
</P>
<P>
 Schlesinger's gingerbread, which uses prune puree, made a lifelong gingerbread 
fan think there was hope for the future. And corn muffins made with applesauce 
were reward enough for not making a recipe full of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Schlesinger's pasta dishes and sauces are not as successful, which 
brings me to the crux of the whole low-fat craze. If you want to eat less fat, 
there are two ways to do it: Make dishes that require less fat, or make fatty 
recipes with nonfat replacements. The former is more difficult, but the tastes 
are truer. The latter is as easy as technology, but substitutions don't always 
taste great. I can hide a little nonfat ricotta in a pasta sauce, but I don't 
want Schlesinger's stuffed pasta shells with three nonfat cheeses -- and when I 
asked the clerk at Mrs. Gooch if there even was such a thing as a nonfat 
Parmesan, she shuddered, pointed to a greenish-yellow soy substitute and 
whispered that it tastes terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A smarter, but slightly more treacherous book is Martha Rose Schulman's 
"Provencal Light." Schulman is more of a moderate than Schlesinger; she tries 
to compromise between the need to lower fat and her desire to preserve flavor, 
and some of the dishes are delicious -- like the chicken with tomatoes, garlic 
and olives, whose fat content (10 grams, almost 30% of the dish) would diminish 
a bit if you increased the proportion of pasta or rice. But the white bean " 
brandade ," a garlic-spiked puree, is surprisingly bland -- while the zucchini 
gratin with goat cheese is as predictably tasty as it is high in fat. What is a 
side dish with 13 grams of fat doing, lurking in a "light" cookbook? The author 
suggests we serve it with dishes that are much lower in fat, to compensate. 
Decent advice for the cook who can afford a little leeway. But people tend to 
use these books as bibles; they're afraid to stray from the path. So buyer and 
eater, beware. There are as many definitions of low-fat as there are book 
contracts being signed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also plenty of ethnic books, happy news for the home cook who 
doesn't want to abandon a native cuisine, or for the serious cook hoping for 
variety. One of the best is "Indian Light Cooking," by Ruth Law. Her skinless 
tandoori chicken doesn't have the dark, chewy texture of the real thing, but 
it's a perfectly tender, cleanly spiced dish. And the aloo matar tamatar , a 
mix of potatoes, tomatoes and peas, makes a truly low-fat meal -- 5 grams 
total, for the two dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd rather hunt through any of these for a tasty recipe than resort to what I 
call the consolation books -- those that assume you're suffering without fat 
and try to offer comfort by feeding all your old bad habits. Richard Simmons 
may believe in offering a junk food crib sheet because real people eat lots of 
junk food and need to know when to stop, but it seems like a lot of wasted 
energy. Don't eat a pound of Mrs. Fields cookies, no matter what; there, now 
that's over with. George Mateljan, the founder of Health Valley Foods, has come 
up with "Baking Without Fat," a worthy enough endeavor (yes, the no-fatters 
deserve their own dessert book just like the followers of cake queen Rose Levy 
Beranbaum do) if you still need that nightly sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's a subversive thought. Maybe you can't have your cake and eat it 
too. We live in Southern California, land of bounty, land of farmers markets, 
land, I would argue, of some of the most gorgeous fruit anywhere. You want 
variety for dessert? Try buying whatever's fresh, week to week. And then read 
Daley's book again -- not for the specific recipes, but for the way she works 
with food. Try coating pasta with chicken broth and leaving out most of the 
olive oil. Try any steamed vegetable with the yogurt mustard she serves with 
artichokes, a truly splendid, subtle sauce. Or borrow a trick from "500 
Fat-Free Recipes" and drain the yogurt for two hours before mixing it, which 
will give the sauce the consistency of mayonnaise.

 The real low-fat future rests in our ability to cook it, not to follow single 
recipes. Who wants to live the extended life a healthy diet is supposed to buy 
us, but tied to the printed page?

 OK, these French fries from "In the Kitchen With Rosie: Oprah's Favorite 
Recipes" by Rosie Daley (Alfred Knopf: 1994, $14.95) look a little funny 
sometimes, when the egg whites turn into wispy little feathers that trail off 
the spuds. But they're suitably crisp outside and soft inside, and the spices 
distract your taste buds from the oil-lessness of the endeavor. Children, the 
toughest of judges, inhale them. UN-FRIED FRENCH FRIES 
</P>
<P>
 5 large baking potatoes, to equal 2 3/4 pounds 
</P>
<P>
 2 large egg whites 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon bottled Cajun spice powder 
</P>

<P>
 Beat egg whites and Cajun spice in bowl. Add potato matchsticks and mix to 
coat.  
</P>
<P>
 Place coated potatoes in single layer on baking sheet coated with 3 sprays of

 This mixture of potatoes, peas and tomatoes -- sure, it's the middle of tomato 
season, so why not throw in a little extra? -- is surprisingly bright and 
refreshing. From Ruth Law's "Indian Light Cooking" (Donald I. Fine: 1994, $25).

 This cake, from Sarah Schlesinger's "500 Fat-Free Recipes" (Times Books: 1994, 
$23), is a perfect alternative to artery-clogging shortcake. It's sweet and

it's a lovely summertime dessert that just happens to be healthful.

 Porto's Bakery and Cafe, 315 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale, (818) 956-5996. Open 
Monday through Saturday, 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sunday, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.

 Perhaps only half of the customers at Porto's Cuban Bakery and Cafe are 
actually Cuban, but the place still gives you the impression you're in Central 
Miami. Carefully groomed women with flawlessly polished nails and beauty-shop 
hairdos are gossiping, laughing, kissing goodbye on both cheeks, having 
devoured their rum babas or rich tres leches cakes. Groups of older men wearing 
guayabera shirts, their tables littered with empty espresso cups and half-eaten 
media noche sandwiches, are arguing politics.  
</P>
<P>
 Porto's is a family-owned business on a sedate stretch of Brand Boulevard in 
downtown Glendale, but one thing you could never call the place is dull. A 
constant chattery din of rapid-fire Spanish echoes off the bakery's two-story 
ceiling as customers grab a number for the Cuban sandwich bar, wait impatiently 
for their turn to order pastries and cappuccino or request a certain cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the electric sliding doors, customers exit with armloads of Porto's 
pink boxes filled with the best Cuban cakes and pastries -- indeed, some of the 
best baked goods of any kind -- in all of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery's newly remodeled digs were once a small department store. The 
columned mezzanine above the brightly lit pastry case area gives the modernized 
room below a sense of having been superimposed over a patch of Cuban Colonial 
architecture. This style parallels the business itself: It manages to 
accommodate the appetites of an older generation of Cubans while catering to 
the more modern tastes of its new customers.  
</P>
<P>
 All the traditional Cuban pastries are here: the ones with romantic names such 
as bocado de principe (a bite for a prince) and brazo de gitano (gypsy's arm). 
But recently, the goods in Porto's cases have been taking a contemporary turn. 
White chocolate-raspberry cheese cake, tirami su , even apple-oat bran muffins 
are showing up.  
</P>
<P>
 For the most part though, Porto's maintains a traditional Cuban kitchen. For 
its Cuban sandwiches, the kitchen roasts about 25 garlic-marinated pork legs 
every day. For meat-stuffed potato balls ( papas rellenas ), an old family 
recipe is used for the filling. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the recently remodeled space, Raoul Porto Jr., son of owners Raoul and 
Rosa Porto, and now in charge of the baking, proudly shows off his impressive 
high-tech bakery equipment. The computerized Italian dough mixer and the 
automatic puff pastry dough sheeter, imported from Germany, are the things used 
in the artisanal shops in Europe to achieve hand-made-quality pastries with a 
manageable number of employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Porto Jr. wheels a huge stack of unbaked galletas -- traditional Cuban 
crackers -- into the German rack oven, which rotates the stacks of trays as 
they bake. "These galletas are a pain to make," he says. "But our loyal older 
customers would be upset if we didn't offer them." 
</P>
<P>
 Porto's didn't always have the means for such up-to-date technology. Though 
it's now a fixture in the Cuban community, in 1960, when it opened as a tiny 
shop in the Silverlake area, it had to supplement its Cuban items with Mexican 
pastries.  
</P>
<P>
 Relating a bit of the bakery's history, Margarita Porto-Navarro, another Porto 
daughter in the family business, explains: "My mom, Rosa, actually started the 
business back in Cuba. You couldn't make a decent living there because everyone 
had to work for the government, so people sometimes had businesses on the side. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom used to make wedding cakes and other special-occasion cakes. She became 
sort of famous for these, and after we got settled here, some of her old 
customers, who had come over too, started to request them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa had tried to obtain a job as a cake decorator at Van de Kamp's but 
failed. She opened Porto's instead. The store had only one baker then. Raoul 
Sr., who had obtained his auto mechanic's degree and worked a night shift, 
helped out during the day. The kids all pitched in after school. "I've been 
baking since I was about 17," Raoul Jr. says.  
</P>
<P>
 The business, which now supports four families and assorted employees, has 
been expanding ever since. Shopping List 
</P>
<P>
 SAVORY PASTRIES AND SNACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban-Style Sandwiches: Porto's sandwiches, like Spago's pizzas, bring 
refinement to an everyday specialty. Fresh pork legs that are boned, then 
marinated in mojo de ajo , the famous Cuban garlic condiment. The meat is 
slowly roasted to a juicy tenderness. And, of course, Porto's also bakes the 
long, thin loaves of Cuban bread used in the sandwiches.  
</P>
<P>
 The simplest of the five Cuban-style sandwiches Porto's makes is the pan con 
lechoon, slices of the marinated pork piled into the bread, which is flattened 
and toasted on a double-faced grill. For the Cuban sandwich, pork is layered 
with ham, Swiss cheese, tomato, mustard, mayonnaise and dill pickle slices. The 
media noche, or midnight sandwich, probably got its name from its use as a 
midnight snack. It's almost identical to the Cuban sandwich but made on a 
light, sweet roll instead of Cuban bread.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the more immoderate sandwiches is the media noche preparada, which adds 
home-made ham croquets to the regular media noche. Papa preparada mates Porto's 
stuffed mashed potato balls with Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato on Cuban 
bread.  
</P>
<P>
 Empanada de Pollo: The fragile pastry for these Cuban-style chicken pies is so 
delicious that people love the unfilled pie edges as much as the filled 
portion. The shredded chicken filling has been braised with onion and a little 
tomato and pimiento, which gives it the Spanish flavor found in many Cuban 
dishes. The kitchen turns out individual pies and larger (12x9-inch) shapes 
that people buy to cut into small squares for hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
 Papas Rellenas: These stuffed potato balls, made by rolling mashed potatoes 
around a ground-beef filling, are as addicting as a first-rate pizza. 
Magically, the balls are never greasy inside; although they're deep-fried, 
there's just the thinnest film of crisp potato exterior.  
</P>
<P>
 Croquetas de Jamon: Little bars of ham suspended in a white sauce are lightly 
dusted with crumbs and deep-fried.  
</P>
<P>
 Pastel de Carne: These individual meat-filled flaky pastries are reminiscent 
of French bouchees , those multi-layered pastry cases that chefs in the heyday 
of Continental cuisine usually filled with chicken a la king or creamed 
lobster. However, these pastries are slightly larger and their filling is a 
well-seasoned ground beef cooked with garlic and onions.  
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Tamales: A smooth, pudding-like corn dough infused with the taste of 
pork broth is what gives the Cuban character to Porto's tamales. The long tubes 
of dough are filled with little chunks of marinated pork and an occasional corn 
kernel or wisp of pimiento. Porto's tamales are so popular many customers take 
home dozens to freeze. They freeze very well; to serve, thaw and warm in a 
steamer. 
</P>
<P>
 Galletas: A long, slow rise lasting about two days gives these traditional 
puffed, yeast-leavened crackers a nutty flavor many factory-made galletas lack. 
Usually they're eaten like any cracker, as a snack or with appetizers. But 
spread with dulce de leche , a caramelized milk sweet popular all over Latin 
America, galletas become an impromptu dessert. CUBAN SWEET PASTRIES  
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's notorious sweet tooth was encouraged by the island's traditional 
specialization in sugar and rum -- two commodities almost every Cuban could 
afford. Coconut, pineapple and especially a sweetened puree of guava are also 
trademarks of the Cuban dessert table, and they're used liberally at Porto's. 
</P>
<P>
 Capuchinos: These little cakes get their name from the pointed hood of a 
monk's cape. They are formed in paper cones, and as the cake bakes, a round of 
dough puffs from the wide end to form a little dome; once baked, the capuchinos 
look a lot like ice cream cone sculptures. The cooled cakes are sprinkled with 
a cinnamon-flavored syrup mixed with dry white Spanish wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rum Babas: These babas are not the yeast dough variety but eggy cakes made 
with cornstarch, which creates a light and feathery textured cake. Like the 
capuchinos , they're baked in a paper form: a squat tube shape about the size 
of a napkin ring. Of course, the babas are flavored with rum. 
</P>
<P>
 Coquitos en Almibar: Translated as "little coconuts in caramelized crust," 
these ultra-sweet pastries are almost like a candy. The golf-ball-size rounds 
start with shredded coconut mixed with egg white and honey and are coated with 
a brittle covering of caramel, then anointed with a little syrup and placed in 
a pleated paper cup. This sweet mouthful calls out for a cup of Porto's 
wonderful strong espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 Guava Roll: A cookie-like pastry is rolled around sweet guava paste into a 
loop shape. Guava rolls are only moderately sweet, compared to some other 
Cuban-style pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Strudel: Guava and cheese strudel has white fresh cheese and guava paste 
inside a flaky strudel dough oblong that's slit on top. The combination of 
fruit and mellow cheese is unbeatable. Porto's also makes a coconut strudel. 
</P>
<P>
 Masa Real: Another guava pastry, masa real comes in two forms; both are made 
with the same dough and filling. One looks like a giant thumbprint cookie, 
round with a patch of guava in the center. The other is like a very large 
guava-cookie sandwich, with the guava filling between two layers of the 
cookie-like pastry. 
</P>
<P>
 Tres Leches: Seductive and intensely rich but not overly sweet, this cake is 
called "three milks" because it's made with evaporated milk, sweetened 
condensed milk and fresh cream. The cake portion soaks up the sweet milks so it 
almost has the texture of pudding. A meringue icing is swirled on with a pastry 
bag and toasted very lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bocado de Principe: The name translates roughly as "a taste fit for the 
Prince." This is a yellow cake topped with a thick, creamy layer of 
Spanish-style custard and a dusting of cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
 Panatella Boracha: Most people think of a panatella as a long, thin, flat 
Cuban cigar, but the original meaning of the word describes a long, thin 
biscuit. To make this dessert, Cuban cooks soak sweet, lady finger-like 
biscuits in a rum or liqueur syrup, hence the nickname "drunken biscuits." 
Porto's version consists of two layers of rum syrup-soaked cake filled with a 
ribbon of guava paste, topped with a paper-thin caramel sugar glaze and cut 
into precise squares. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubiertas: Guava appears once again, this time between layers of a white pound 
cake. The loaf-shaped cake is sliced, and each three-tiered piece is covered 
with a thick layer of white sugar icing and sprinkled with multicolored 
nonpareils. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Porto's Cakes: These are the cakes that started Porto's. Though they were 
originally made in the Porto home in Cuba, they're as beautifully finished as 
anything from a Paris patisserie. The base of all these cakes is Rosa's torte, 
a very light, barely sweet cake rich with eggs. The layers are sprinkled with a 
thin sugar syrup that has been boiled with a cinnamon stick and then mixed with 
dry white Spanish wine.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can order your cake with any filling you want," says Betty 
Porto-Kawabata, Rosa's eldest daughter. "Lots of people love the guava or they 
want cherry or chocolate filling." But for their everyday stock, Porto's makes 
the three most popular varieties: custard-filled, with a meringue frosting; 
strawberry-filled, with a meringue or whipped cream frosting; and 
pineapple-filled, with meringue frosting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cake Slices: Because not everyone wants a whole cake, Porto's sells its 
pineapple-custard filled cake with meringue frosting and its layered strawberry 
cakes by the slice. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazo de Gitano: These jelly-roll-style cakes, fancifully named "gypsy's arm" 
(presumably because of their shape), are doused with rum syrup and then filled 
with custard or guava filling. The custard-filled cakes are decorated with more 
custard, while the guava-filled cakes have an apricot glaze, whipped cream 
florets and a margin of toasted coconut on their sides. CONTEMPORARY PASTRIES  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Salazar, Porto's resident European pastry chef, studied his art at the 
California Culinary Institute and at UCLA's culinary program. His pastries are 
more or less California-style, rather than by-the-book French and he's always 
coming up with new ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 Salazar's mango mousse cake is a cloud of not-too-rich mango-flavored cream 
under a clear laminate of mango glaze, balanced on plain yellow cake. His 
triple chocolate mousse cake has layers of white, milk and dark chocolate, 
baroquely festooned with white chocolate curls. Lately he's been making white 
chocolate-raspberry cheese cake and tirami su circled with a picket-fence-like 
row of lady fingers. OTHER SWEETS  
</P>
<P>
 Cuba is famous for its pudim de pan. The country has more recipes for this 
bread pudding than Italy has minestrones. At Porto's, pudim is made with 
buttered bread, shredded and soaked thoroughly with milk, eggs and just enough 
sugar to sweeten it subtly. The result is a dense, rich custard strewn with a 
few raisins, baked in individual cups or bread pans that have a glossy layer of 
caramel at the bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 No Cuban dessert repertoire would be complete without flan. And so Porto's has 
one, a creamy custard not too firm nor too liquid, with a caramel browned to a 
subtle bitter-sweetness.

 The biggest hams I saw last week? No contest . . . that would be the Three 
Stooges -- er, Tenors -- belting " O sole mio " Saturday at a Dodger Stadium 
redecorated to look like the world's biggest tiki bar. The best ham, though, 
was at Nick's Cafe downtown, a plateful of thick slices fried to smoky 
denseness, ribboned with sweet fat, fibrous and chewy in a way that only real 
ham can be and blackened crisp at the rim. There are ham omelets here, 
sandwiches made with ham alone and hard-core sandwiches made with ham and a 
fried egg, but the best way to have the ham may be straight up, doused with the 
restaurant's fine, searing house-made salsa, and a bland pillow of hash browns 
on the side. If the world were just, Nick's should be as renowned for ham 'n' 
eggs as El Tepeyac is for burritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick's, on North Spring by the rail yards, is one of those basic breakfast 
spots that seem to have passed intact from the '40s, a haven of quilted 
aluminum, dad's-den wood paneling and old railroad signs, owned by a couple of 
LAPD homicide detectives -- who are sometimes shanghaied into pot-washing duty 
when an employee calls in sick. A clean, masculine funk of fried ham and strong 
coffee hangs in the air. The shirt-sleeve clientele seems mostly made up of the 
big-city guys who make factories run. A plush pig hangs upside down from its 
cloven hooves; oldies radio blares Sam the Sham; an electric train whirs around 
the small diner on tracks set a foot below the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try our 100% USDA soft tacos with chopped onion and cilantro," a scrawled 
sign reads, touting the token item of Mexican food in a restaurant largely 
frequented and run by Mexican-Americans. "No dog or donkey in these babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, through the window, trains couple and decouple on the tracks, and you 
can look up past Chinatown to Dodger Stadium. Conversation around the U-shaped 
counter may touch on a big mariachi concert or the news from city hall, but it 
always, always turns to the Raiders. There may be plenty of meatloaf, and 
thick-patty hamburgers like Mom used to make, and tuna melts and grilled 
cheese. The hot tri-tip sandwich with homemade gravy and real mashed potatoes 
may put anything at those fancy neo-'50s restaurants to shame, but you won't 
find arugula in the Salad Korner. 
</P>
<P>
 French toast, though made with ordinary white bread, is custard-y and rich, 
crisp at the edges, with an elusive sweetness; pancakes are thick and probably 
a little more liquid at the center than you might like.  
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty much everything is made from scratch here," the waitress says, rolling 
her eyes as if she thinks roasting turkey for the Friday cold-turkey sandwich 
special is an affectation. "I think the only things they buy in packages are 
the condiments, the mustard and catsup."

IN THE KITCHEN; THE PLUM REBELLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The aroma of plum wine told me that while I had spent a week on vacation, the 
garden hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, the tomato plants, shoulder high but with solid green fruit when 
I left, were dotted with fiery red, convoluted Costoluto Genovese tomatoes -- 
the first variety to ripen this year. While most of the summer squash had 
succumbed to an undiagnosed ailment, one zucchini bush was bright-green and 
studded with flowers and squash. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kicker was the fruit tree by the garage -- a temperamental 
hermaphroditic thing that is half plum and half nectarine. Though it had failed 
to bear fruit in the three seasons we've lived in the house, it picked the week 
we went on vacation to dump a massive haul of plums. 
</P>
<P>
 They were everywhere -- under bushes, on top of the picnic table, smashed into 
sidewalks. And so was the ripe, heady smell of tangy red plums fermenting in 
the heat. Waving off hordes of fruit flies, I sorted through the fruit, tossing 
most of it in the dumpster, putting the best to one side. Then I gave the whole 
back yard a nice hosing down. It's amazing how sticky plum smoosh is. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole time I was cleaning, the plums kept falling. Bomp! One came rolling 
down the roof, sounding for all the world like some kind of fruity bowling ball 
on a shake shingle lane. Splat! One hit the ground beside me, splitting along 
one side. Couldn't keep that one, so I brushed it off and stuck it in my mouth. 
Thump! Another landed right in the middle of my wife's new straw hat. 
</P>
<P>
 After the dirty work came the fun. I went to the vegetable garden and picked 
the first tomatoes. This is always one of the special days of the year -- a 
kind of combination of birthday and New Year's -- even when the current cool 
temperatures along the coast had prevented the tomatoes from getting as fully 
luscious as they will a little later. I picked some zucchini too and gave them 
a gentle washing. It was good to feel the itchy scratch of really fresh squash 
after a long period of slick supermarket gourds. 
</P>
<P>
 The zucchini I cut in long wedges and fried in a non-stick pan in some olive 
oil. When they had cooked soft and golden, I beat a half-dozen eggs and added 
them to the pan. When they were barely set, I stuck them under the broiler to 
puff and firm the top. While the frittata was still hot, I scattered torn basil 
leaves over the top and drizzled it with a fine rain of balsamic vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 I served the frittata with wedges of tomatoes that we dipped in coarse salt, 
just enough to bring out their flavors. A single perfectly ripe one -- silky 
and explosive at the same time -- let me know what we are in for in a couple of 
weeks, when the heat comes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Having eaten my fill of fresh plums while cleaning up the yard, I wanted to do 
something different for dessert. So I seeded a couple cups worth and put them 
in a pan with some sugar. (Here's a hint: The cleft in the top of the plum runs 
in the same direction as the pits, which are flat and clingy. If you'll cut the 
plum in half along that cleft, the pit comes out fairly easily.) 
</P>
<P>
 To complement the tart, spicy flavor of the plums, I added a cinnamon stick 
and a couple of cloves. At first, the plums gave off so much juice I thought 
they'd never thicken, but soon the magic of pectin took over and the whole 
thing jellied up into a nice compote. 
</P>
<P>
 This was wonderful simply served with some vanilla ice cream, but it was even 
better spread over these corn crepes and glazed. I'm not sure exactly where the 
idea for combining plums and cornmeal came from. I have a vague memory of 
having tasted it somewhere before, but I can't remember where. Anyway, the 
provenance is not as important as the produce. Get good tangy plums for this 
dish. The edgy sweetness of the cornmeal crepes plays perfectly against the 
tart spiciness of the compote, and the combination of melting fruit and tender 
crepe barely crisped under the broiler makes it a perfect dessert for a fancier 
meal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you want, you can top it with some ice cream and eat it in the back yard. 
Just don't forget to duck. CORNMEAL CREPES WITH SPICED PLUM COMPOTE 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups seeded, coarsely chopped Santa Rosa plums 
</P>

 4 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
 8 Corn Crepes 
</P>
<P>
 Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Combine plums, sugar, cinnamon and cloves in small saucepan and cook over 
medium heat until soft and thickened, about 20 to 30 minutes, depending on 
ripeness of plums. Remove from heat and let cool. 
</P>
<P>
 When cool, spread about 1/4 cup plum compote over crepe, then fold crepe in 
quarters. Sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar. Place on baking sheet and glaze 
under broiler 2 to 3 minutes. Makes 4 servings.

BAKING; HOW TO MAKE A MACAROON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICK MALGIERI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long used as a confection and as an ingredient in other confections and 
desserts, macaroons probably originated somewhere in the almond-growing areas 
of Italy. By the middle of the 18th Century, macaroons were well established 
throughout western Europe. In fact, several towns and convents in France and 
Italy were famous for producing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Americans tend to think of macaroons as coconut cookies, most macaroons 
are made from almonds or from a combination of almonds and apricot kernels. (In 
fact, one famous Italian brand of macaroons is made entirely from apricot 
kernels.) The ingredients for macaroons are simple -- almonds (or almond 
paste), sugar and egg white. But with these few ingredients it is possible to 
achieve a great variety of tastes and textures. I've devised the following 
recipes to represent ancient and modern French, Italian and Swiss macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical French-style macaroons are moist and slightly chewy, with a rounded, 
cracked surface that comes from moistening the macaroons right before they are 
baked. Usually made from almond paste, these are the easiest macaroons to 
prepare. Among the variations of French-style macaroons are gommes (pronounced 
go-MAY); the name derives from the fact that the glaze was originally made from 
gum Arabic -- gomme in French. Gommes are macaroon stars decorated with shreds 
of candied fruit or almonds and glazed with corn syrup as they emerge from the 
oven, so that they have a shiny surface after they cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian macaroons or amaretti tend to be dry and crisp, somewhat like the 
famous amaretti di Saronno , still made near Milan. Though these are typically 
made from apricot kernels, it is easy to approximate them using almond paste. 
Another style of amaretti is made by the nuns at the Santo Spirito Trappist 
convent at Agrigento in Sicily. These decidedly primitive but flavorful 
macaroons are made from almonds ground with sugar, with only the smallest 
addition of egg white. Somewhat irregularly shaped, they are moist and nutty, 
unlike macaroons made with fine almond paste. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Probably made originally with a mortar and pestle, these amaretti are made in 
a convent that has been in virtually continuous operation (with only a short 
break during World War II) since the 13th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss macaroons, called Luxemburgerli ("little Luxemburgers"), are very much 
like crisp almond meringues sandwiched with chocolate filling. To my taste, 
they are the lightest and most delicate of all macaroons. A specialty of 
Zurich's famed Sprungli pastry shop, Luxemburgerli are baked in many flavors, 
but the vanilla-chocolate combination is the most popular. Though the recipe is 
a secret, my experiments have resulted in a close approximation of the original 
Sprungli version. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipe uses whole blanched almonds or almond paste. Whole blanched almonds 
are shelled almonds with the brown skins removed. If only unblanched (sometimes 
called natural) almonds are available, place almonds in a saucepan and cover 
with water. Bring to a boil and drain. Fold hot almonds into a towel and rub to 
loosen skins, then go over almonds one at a time to separate nutmeat from 
skins. Use within a few hours. For longer storage, place in a plastic food bag 
and store in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Almond paste is a smooth paste made from blanched almonds, sugar and almond 
extract. Use only almond paste sold in cans (an eight-ounce can is the retail 
size). Though there are several brands sold in cellophane-wrapped cylinders, 
the canned almond paste has a more vivid flavor and a lower sugar (and higher 
almond) content. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Macaroons are elegant, satisfying cookies. Baking them yourself not only 
results in a beautiful confection, but also in a great increase in quality over 
what is usually available commercially. FRENCH MACAROONS 
</P>
<P>
 1 (8-ounce) can almond paste 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar plus extra for sprinkling 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons egg whites (whites from about 1 1/2 large eggs) 
</P>
<P>
 Granulated or powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Break almond paste into 1-inch pieces. Combine with 1 cup sugar in bowl of 
heavy-duty mixer fitted with paddle attachment. Mix on slowest speed to crumb 
ingredients together. Pour in egg whites in 3 or 4 additions, beating well 
between additions and scraping down bowl frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrape mixture into pastry bag fitted with plain tube that has 1/2- to 
3/4-inch opening. Pipe 3/4- to 1-inch macaroons on 2 baking sheets or 
jelly-roll pans lined with parchment paper, leaving 1 inch between macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wet flat-weave towel (not terry cloth) or napkin and fold into 2-inch-wide 
strip. Hold one end of strip in each hand and lower onto macaroons, one row at 
time, to flatten slightly. Sprinkle macaroons with granulated sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 375 degrees until well puffed and golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on 
rack. To remove macaroons from paper, turn paper over and moisten back. Makes 
about 5 dozen small macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
 VARIATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate Macaroons: Add 3 tablespoons sifted unsweetened cocoa powder with 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Pine Nut Macaroons: Cover moistened macaroons with pine nuts, shaking away 
excess, before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Gommes: Decrease egg whites to 2 tablespoons in macaroon paste. Pipe mixture 
with star tube into star or rosette shapes, decorating centers with almonds or 
pieces of candied fruit. Do not moisten macaroons with towel. Allow to dry 
several hours. Bake at 450 degrees just until lightly colored. Brush tops with 
heated light corn syrup as soon as they come out of oven. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisp Amaretti: Increase egg whites to 1/4 cup (whites from 2 large eggs). Do 
not moisten macaroons with towel. Sprinkle with granulated sugar and bake at 
350 degrees until crisp and dry, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool amaretti on pans. 
Remove from parchment paper and store in tins to keep crisp. SICILIAN AMARETTI

</P>
<P>
 Place almonds and sugar in food processor bowl fitted with metal blade and 
process, pulsing on and off, until very finely ground. Scrape inside of work 
bowl with metal spatula. Add egg white in 4 additions, pulsing between 
additions, until paste is smooth and firm. If paste is dry, add water in 3 or 4 
additions and pulse smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrape paste from food processor to work surface and roll into 12-inch 
cylinder (flour hands if paste is sticky). Cut into 1/2-inch slices, making 24 
equal pieces. Roll each into small ball, flatten slightly and arrange on baking 
sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving at least 1 inch between macaroons. 
Press whole unblanched almond into center of each macaroon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 375 degrees until lightly colored but still moist, about 15 minutes. 
Cool macaroons on pans. Remove from parchment paper and store in tin. Makes 24 
large macaroons. SWISS LUXEMBURGERLI 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup whole blanched almonds  
</P>
<P>

 Whisk egg whites and 1/2 cup sugar in mixer bowl. Place bowl over pan of 
simmering water and whisk until egg whites are hot and sugar is dissolved, 
about 2 minutes. Whip meringue until cooled and fluffy. Add about 1/4 of 
meringue to work bowl containing almond mixture and pulse to mix. Add another 
1/4 of meringue to work bowl and pulse to mix again. Remove blade and scrape 
almond-meringue mixture from work bowl onto remaining whites. Fold into egg 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrape almond-meringue mixture into pastry bag fitted with plain tube that has 
1/4-inch opening. Cover two baking pans with parchment paper. Pipe 24 
(1/2-inch) macaroons on each pan (48 total), leaving 1 inch between macaroons. 
Bake macaroons at 375 degrees until lightly golden, about 15 minutes. (Switch 
pans from back to front and top to bottom once or twice during baking.) Cool 
macaroons on pans. When cool, remove from parchment paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring cream to boil in saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and allow to 
stand 2 minutes. Whisk smooth. Scrape filling into bowl to cool.

BAKING; BAKING DAY ON AN ENGLISH FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE WILLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Why don't you come on Thursday," says Audrey. "That's baking day." 
</P>
<P>
 Baking day! 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I had left our home in France to see my mother and had called 
Audrey, the current occupant of our family farm in Yorkshire, to see whether we 
could arrange a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 With Audrey's words, my mind flew back to my childhood in this part of rural 
England and the excitement of the kitchen where Emily, our family cook, would 
stoke up the range once a week and cook a mountain of pies, cakes and cookies 
to last for seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 First would emerge jam tarts, maids of honor (almond tartlets) and ginger 
cookies and scones, all brown and crisp from the early, searing heat of the 
oven. Then came larger cakes -- pink, white-and-chocolate-marbled sponge, 
checkered Battenberg loaf and seedy cake, an ancient recipe flavored with 
caraway seeds that stuck between the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as the oven cooled, the slower-baked custard tarts and fruitcakes 
emerged. Cherry cake was a particular specialty of Emily's, a pound cake 
studded with whole red candied cherries, the trick being to toss the heavy 
cherries in flour to prevent them from falling to the bottom of the batter. 
</P>
<P>
 We were a small household then, but on the nearby farm where Audrey now lives, 
the farmer's wife cooked three hearty meals a day for up to a dozen people, 
with snacks in between, still known as "10 o'clocks" and "3 o'clocks." These 
were carried into the fields, along with great tin cans of hot tea, baskets of 
scones, pies and Yorkshire tea cakes -- sweet yeast breads flavored with dried 
fruits, candied peel and spices. Plain bread was kneaded on the wooden kitchen 
table, then left to rise in a bowl covered with a damp cloth in front of the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother used a 50-pound bag of flour each week," recalls Audrey. She 
herself is a notable baker, loading the table for us with such treats as fat 
rascals -- sweet currant scones made with a batter soft enough to drop from a 
spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey gives a helpful tip. "Don't overmix them," she warns. "That's the key 
to a light scone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tea, what I'd call supper, is around 6 o'clock. It includes fruit loaf, apple 
pie and perhaps some home-cured ham or cold meat left over from lunch. Jams are 
homemade, and for us visitors Audrey has also whipped up a Victoria sponge 
filled with raspberry jam and cream from the dairy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have another slice," she presses us. "It won't keep, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Baking and preserving are just the beginning of Audrey's tasks. Poultry is 
also her province; she raises turkeys and chickens, with a few geese and ducks 
for the Christmas table. In the past, her mother kept pigs, making the 
trimmings into black pudding (a blood sausage thickened with oatmeal), and 
brawn, a type of head cheese using the pig's cheeks and shanks and perhaps a 
rabbit or chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Wensleydale cheese is world-renowned, and Audrey remembers the 
surplus milk being curdled with rennet and pressed into molds, with the whey 
going to the pigs. Some of the fresh curds would be reserved for curd tarts, 
the local version of cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Any spare time is spent in the garden, Audrey's love, but the climate is 
chilly, so vegetables are limited to roots, onions and cabbages and some peas 
and beans. Mint and sage are the only herbs, reflecting the wholesome Yorkshire 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by good food, you would expect Audrey to be as plump as her currant 
scones. But no. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wives work harder than the farmers," cuts in my mother, who has been 
listening as we talk. She should know. Her mother and grandmother were born and 
raised in this house, moving to the local market town only when the motor car 
-- and my grandfather's new-found prosperity -- opened the way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Made just like scones but with more sugar, fat rascals are a favorite on the 
farm at the 10 o'clock tea break.  
</P>
<P>
 FAT RASCALS 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup unbleached flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup whole-wheat flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup lard or shortening 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup dried currants 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons golden raisins 
</P>
<P>
 Grated zest 1 orange 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup milk, more if needed 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 Sift flours, baking powder and salt into bowl. With fingers or 2 knives, work 
lard into flour to make coarse crumbs. Stir in 3/4 cup sugar, currants, raisins 
and grated zest. 
</P>
<P>
 Make well in center of mixture. Add milk and stir with wooden spoon until all 
ingredients are incorporated into sticky dough. Do not overmix, or cakes will 
be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Using 2 large spoons, drop dough onto greased and floured baking sheet, 
leaving at least 2 inches of space between 8 cakes. Bake at 400 degrees until 
browned and skewer inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in pan heat 1/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water until dissolved to 
form syrup. Brush syrup over cakes while still warm. Cakes are best eaten day 
of baking but can be kept up to 2 days in airtight container. Makes 8 cakes.

BAKING; ONE CAKE FOR THE ROAD

 A few months ago one of my cooking students telephoned with a unique request. 
She and her husband, along with a group of friends, take in the Indianapolis 
500 each spring. They all contribute to a picnic lunch, which they eat en 
route. Typically they buy a honey-baked ham and then cook the side dishes and 
dessert to go with it. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, one person volunteered to assemble a roasted red-skin potato salad, 
another to prepare green beans tossed in a mustard vinaigrette, and someone 
else to bake homemade sourdough rolls and bring minted iced tea. My friend's 
responsibility was dessert, and she asked me to suggest something -- preferably 
chocolate -- that would travel well. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few weeks before, I had included a delicious chocolate-hazelnut cake 
iced with a dark chocolate glaze in one of my classes. This sweet confection 
can be made up to two days ahead, is easily transportable and is uncomplicated 
to put together. Prepare the cake by adding a mixture of melted butter and 
cocoa powder to eggs beaten with both brown and white sugars. After flour is 
incorporated, a touch of coffee and chopped toasted hazelnuts are stirred in to 
add extra dimensions of taste and texture. Make the glaze by heating together 
butter, semisweet chocolate pieces and coffee until smooth, shiny and 
spreadable. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't have to make a journey to our country's most celebrated car race 
to have a reason for enjoying a picnic menu that includes this scrumptious 
torte. A visit to the beach, the mountains, a lake or even to a special spot in 
your own back yard could provide an excuse for entertaining outdoors. 
CHOCOLATE-HAZELNUT CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 Flour 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 
</P>
<P>
 2 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup light-brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon freeze-dried coffee, preferably espresso, dissolved in 1/4 cup 
hot water 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup finely chopped, toasted hazelnuts 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate Glaze, heated until warm and spreadable 
</P>
<P>
 Spray 9-inch round baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. Coat with flour, 
then shake out excess. 
</P>
<P>
 Place cocoa powder and butter in top of double boiler and set over simmering 
water. Stir often until mixture is quite smooth, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from 
heat and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat eggs in bowl of electric mixer on medium speed. Gradually add granulated 
and light-brown sugars in thin stream and beat until mixture is slightly 
thickened. Add vanilla, melted cocoa mixture and coffee dissolved in water. On 
slow speed, add 1 cup flour, salt and baking powder. Remove bowl from mixer and 
stir in hazelnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour batter into prepared pan, spreading top evenly with spatula. Bake at 350 
degrees on center shelf until top is firm and wood pick inserted in center 
comes out slightly coated but not wet, 30 minutes. Remove cake from oven and 
cool to room temperature in pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Run knife around sides of pan and remove cake to serving plate. Slide sheets 
of wax paper under cake. Gently pour Chocolate Glaze on top, carefully and 
quickly tilting cake back and forth to cover evenly. Use thin, flat spatula to 
smooth out icing over top and sides of cake. Remove wax paper. Refrigerate 
cake, uncovered, 20 to 30 minutes or up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature 30 
minutes before serving. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Chocolate Glaze 
</P>
<P>
 8 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut into small chunks 
</P>
<P>
 5 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small chunks 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Place chocolate, butter and coffee in top of double boiler set over simmering 
water. Stir until mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

THE BREAKFAST SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welsh cooking is often a cuisine of mistaken identities, so it's no surprise 
when salmon shows up in interesting new concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 For background, just take a look at some of the national dishes of Wales: 
</P>
<P>
 Welsh cakes aren't really cakes, but rather scones made on a griddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Welsh rabbit is simply cheese and toast. 
</P>
<P>
 Laver bread is seaweed and oats, with no bread in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 And Glamorgan sausage isn't sausage at all but a tasty tube-shaped roll of 
breading, leeks and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon is the beneficiary of a similar kind of switcheroo. It takes the place 
of other traditional fish and meat dishes, especially at the breakfast table. 
And the hearty, savory results make getting up for breakfast worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In faux eggs benedict, smoked salmon replaces the slice of Canadian bacon. In 
kedgeree -- the Indian/English hybrid of curry, rice, tomatoes, hard-boiled 
eggs and cream sauce -- the traditional bit of haddock is replaced with a 
tastier chunk of poached salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking like this -- along with a deft approach to Welsh lamb, partridge and 
free-range ducks raised in a nearby apple orchard -- is what made Nigel Morris 
this year's Welsh chef of the year, according to the national Cookery & Food 
Assn. He's the celebrated head chef at Llangoed Hall, near the town of Llyswen 
in the middle section of Wales, where sheep, hedgerows and castles dot rolling 
green hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Llangoed Hall, a 17th-Century manor house with Edwardian additions, was 
lavishly remodeled and opened as a country house hotel in 1990 by Sir Bernard 
Ashley, widower of Laura Ashley, who founded the world-wide fashion and 
interior design fabric empire that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a place where a hearty breakfast is appropriate. Here, gentlemen gather 
to shoot clay pigeons, form parties for hunting wild game in the fall or fish 
with a river guide, called a ghillie. Morris, a Brit who has cooked throughout 
Britain and Ireland, will occasionally go along on a hunt, then use what he has 
bagged in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 As he slices into a salmon caught 200 yards away on the River Wye, he explains 
the advantage of the wild Welsh salmon over farmed Scottish, which will do in a 
pinch in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "These blokes have to work for a living," he says of the wild salmon. "The 
tail fin is wider, the head is longer and they have a much firmer flesh with 
less fat. They have a smoother, richer flavor and the texture is meatier, 
denser -- more like tuna." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris uses salmon in every which way, from braised to poached to grilled. He 
makes a salmon tartare with lime, chives, mustard and creme fraiche. His own 
version of smoked salmon is cured with salt from French oyster beds, herbs and 
zest from lemons and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 His appealing breakfast dishes can be easily reproduced with good results 
using high-quality smoked salmon from a deli and fresh salmon in season. The 
home cook can choose her own degree of difficulty in the faux eggs benedict, 
which is called "English muffin with smoked salmon, poached egg and Hollandaise 
sauce" on the breakfast menu. All the ingredients, with the exception of the 
poached eggs, can be purchased ready-to-use. More ambitious cooks can make 
their own English muffins using Morris' recipe below. The most accomplished can 
also make the always-tricky Hollandaise sauce from a favorite recipe. FAUX EGGS 
BENEDICT 
</P>
<P>
 2 English Muffins 
</P>
<P>
 4 strips thinly sliced smoked salmon 
</P>
<P>
 4 eggs, poached 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup heated Hollandaise sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Split and toast muffins. Place 2 halves on each plate. On top of each muffin 
half, place slice of smoked salmon and poached egg. Glaze each with 1/4 cup 
heated Hollandaise sauce. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 English Muffins 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 4 1/2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>

bowl and place on lightly floured surface. Knead dough about 10 minutes, adding 
as much of remaining 1/2 cup flour as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Place dough in oiled bowl and cover with tea towel. Let rise in warm place 
until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Punch dough down. Set metal muffin rings 
(greased on inside) on baking sheet and place equal portions of dough in each, 
half-filling each. (If not using muffin rings, press dough to 3/4-inch 
thickness and cut muffins with 3-inch-diameter round cookie cutter. Place 1 
inch apart on baking sheet.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cover and let muffins rise again in warm place, about 30 minutes. Cook on 
greased griddle until browned, 5 to 10 minutes on each side. Makes 10 muffins.

CITY HALL NEWS: SANDSTONE CANYON DEVELOPMENT PLAN OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that bewildered even some who voted for it, the Diamond Bar City 
Council last week approved a development plan that would allow Arciero & Sons 
to begin building on a portion of Sandstone Canyon that has been locked in 
controversy for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent over an hour, and the developer indicated he didn't want any more 
continuances, so out of frustration, I guess, I voted in support of the 
project," Mayor Gary Werner said. "Why did I vote that way? Good question. It's 
not a project that I like, and yet I voted for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved 91 houses and a commercial development on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night, the board of Walnut Valley Unified School District voted to 
purchase adjacent land. That land will be used to deposit dirt that will be 
excavated from the site of the new South Pointe Middle School building, which 
had been delayed because of the debate over the canyon project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arciero development had been controversial because it involved filling the 
canyon with dirt. The fate of the new school had been tied to the development 
because the extra dirt from the school project was to go on the Arciero land. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden decisions appear to settle the contentious battle over the canyon. 
But both school board and City Council members say it was the other agency's 
procrastination that forced the eleventh-hour votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure from the school district forced the council to approve the 
development, believing it would provide a space for the dirt removed from the 
school site, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials, however, claimed the council's inability to reach a 
timely decision threatened the future of South Pointe Middle School and led the 
board to purchase the other piece of land. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal approved last week would allow some filling of the canyon; 
Arciero & Sons won approval to build concrete culverts over the northern end of 
the Sandstone Canyon stream, and may remove historic oaks from the canyon 
bottom, City Manager Terrence Belanger said. However, the dirt will not come 
from the school construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that there was a lot more dealing that we could work on that property 
to make it more environmentally sensitive," said Diamond Bar Councilman Clair 
Harmony, who voted against the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Eileen Ansari, who opposed previous proposals, made the motion to 
approve the one presented last week. "Mr. Arciero had been trying to build on 
his property since 1983," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ansari said she favored this plan over others, but added that the council made 
the hasty decision with reluctance. Phyllis Papen seconded the motion, and 
Werner cast the deciding vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer still needs federal and state permits that could take up to nine 
months. The developers could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had been in danger of losing $8 million in state funding for the 
new South Pointe Middle School building if it did not begin construction 
immediately, school board President Larry Redinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school district intends to use the land in a way that will cause 
the least environmental disruption, dumping it on 10 acres of high ground and 
leaving the rest undeveloped.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: BATS TOUTED AS MORE HEROIC THAN HEINOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a bad guy is a huge responsibility. Evildoers are expected to be ever 
vigilant, striking terror in the hearts of many -- even on days when they would 
rather be shopping for a new dinette set or curling up with a cup of cocoa and 
a good book. 
</P>
<P>
 For the truly nasty, life is just one mean thing after another: hauntings by 
night, icky potions by day, and what seems like an endless rotation of 
stalking, creeping and slithering. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rest of us are coping well with the general mayhem. (Even embracing 
it, judging by the popularity and ubiquity of Freddie Krueger movies.) 
</P>
<P>
 But now -- when we have finally learned to take our evil where we find it -- 
we have an altogether new breed of troublemaker to deal with: the revisionist. 
That's the sort of person who would have us believe that Richard III was 
actually a hail fellow well met and a doting uncle. And that the shy and kindly 
tarantula makes a swell pet. And that bats are not only some of the most 
important mammals on Earth, but they may be related to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Related? Maybe to Jeffrey Dahmer, I hear you saying, but not to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sorry, but according to local bat advocates Dee and John Lockwood, the 
furry, flying mammal has gotten a bad rap for too many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff writer Leonard Reed, who wrote this week's Centerpiece feature on bats 
and their proponents, is now inclined to agree that bats are a misunderstood 
species, though he didn't quite know what to make of either the Lockwoods or 
the bats when he stumbled onto the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove into the Barnes & Noble parking lot and saw a large van bearing the 
logo 'SAVE THE BATS,' " said Reed. "I hadn't thought often about bats, much 
less about saving them. So the owners of the van intrigued me as much as the 
bat subject. Who would drive around like that? And whatever happened to 'SAVE 
THE RAIN FOREST' -- something everyone could understand? I left a card under 
the windshield wiper, asked them to call me." 
</P>
<P>
 And call they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the van owners turned out to be amazing people with an amazing 
dedication. I not only learned that bats might be related to us as primates but 
that their capacities to reseed the Earth are vitally linked to, among other 
places, rain forest survival. Bats are also linked to human heart research. 
Sonar development in the Navy. Insect and pest control." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the stuff of nightmares, Halloween horror or rabid rural legend. More 
heroic than heinous, the bat seems deserving of a place in a tale by Beatrix 
Potter, rather than one by Bram Stoker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, well. Do bats cook dinner? Mow the yard? Not quite," said Reed. "But 
almost. They're worth thinking about. The Lockwoods and Ojai naturalist Kris 
Mashburn are deserving of thanks: for reshaping the bat image from one of 
wanton night stalker to kindly relative."

RELUCTANT NOVICE: STUDENTS FIND THE SUSPENSE OF DETECTIVE WORK ELUDES THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, When he's not undercover, Pancho Doll is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know you shouldn't giggle when the man tells you that he's "conducting a 
frontal surveillance on a female subject." You shouldn't giggle because he's 
totally serious. That, and he's got a gun in the glove box of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 You're in the car, a black, two-door sports sedan, driving in front of a 
flower delivery truck while keeping an eye on the female driver in the rearview 
mirror, hence the "frontal surveillance" description that, while it sounds lewd 
at first, is standard lingo in the private detective business. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Cavazos, a Thousand Oaks private investigator, who also teaches a 
private investigation class at Learning Tree University, is driving the car. 
You're riding along, getting a feel for the basics of detective work before 
attending one of his classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stakeouts are entry-level work," he says. "I usually assign my associates to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's pretty damn dull, as Cavazos describes it. Spending hours parked outside 
a warehouse trying to catch employees stealing from the company, checking up on 
spouses, or in this case, following someone who backed out of a business deal 
and left his erstwhile partner with a debt that he can't collect. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavazos wheels the car hard to the right to catch up with the flower van, 
which has turned at the previous intersection. He's been following this van 
since it drove off from a house he had under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to find out if the subject who declared bankruptcy has a 
business or a job that he's not reporting. Then my client might be able to 
collect on the debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavazos hopes the driver of the flower delivery van might be the man's wife. 
But when the driver stops and gets out, she turns out to be a stranger 
delivering flowers and birthday balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to sit on the house some more. Cavazos pulls the car into a discreet 
position, shuts off the engine and the wait starts again. 
</P>
<P>
 He's talking about the basics. Be sure your car is plain, no vanity plates, 
special license plate frames or even parking stickers that would help the 
observed pick your car out of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Check your engine oil level, windshield washer fluid, check for under inflated 
tires and make sure your tank is full, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile your own tank is filling up as indicated by increasing bladder 
pressure, the obvious result of the coffee you drank to get yourself up for the 
early morning assignment. You ask Cavazos how is it possible to maintain 
uninterrupted surveillance while attending to urgent matters of physiology. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bottle," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 You're not sure if he's kidding, but thankfully the surveillance ends before 
you have to find out. Later, during Cavazos' class, he says the bottle is 
probably a P.I. myth. He's never known anyone who carried one. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular night, the class Cavazos is teaching is also on automobile 
surveillance. You're in the back seat with Cavazos while a nervous student 
starts the engine to begin her first surveillance. She guns the engine, but 
barely moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is your emergency brake on?" Cavazos asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. First rule of automobile surveillance: Release emergency brake before 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 You drive to the restaurant in Thousand Oaks where the exercise is supposed to 
begin. The students have taken down descriptions of the two men they are to 
look for. Cavazos goes over more basics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn your head lights off as soon as your car comes to a stop. Don't step on 
the brake when the car is stopped. That could make it easy for the subject to 
read your plate. Leave the dome light off." 
</P>
<P>
 When you get to the rendezvous spot, some of the other students are already 
staked out in a red BMW (hardly a plain vehicle) parked in plain view. With 
their head lights and dome light blazing, they look about as inconspicuous as a 
highway flare. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject pulls into the parking lot, and the two-way radios the students 
are carrying begin to crackle. On the adjoining sidewalk three more students 
mill around under a light, taking notes and looking about 50 times more 
suspicious than the man they're supposed to be watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject moves to a table at an outdoor cafe where he meets a second man. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategies to overhear their conversation or ascertain what they are 
exchanging are discussed. You suggest getting a table near them. Of course 
you'd have to order something, and this opens up what could be a broad 
discussion on how much and how often you can bill clients for food and drinks 
consumed on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The tutorial on legitimate expenses is cut short when the subjects get into 
their cars and drive off, student P.I.s in hot pursuit. Your car follows 
subject No. 2 to a doughnut shop next to Learning Tree, indicating that the 
exercise is concluding and we will be debriefing soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you think?" asks the driver? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's going to get the jelly-filled," you say. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you know he's not going to go for the glazed," Cavazos asks. "A good 
investigator never assumes anything."

GENERAL PUBLIC GOT FEW OF CITY'S SOCCER TICKETS; WORLD CUP: THREE-QUARTERS OF 
THE 9,000 PASSES EARMARKED FOR PASADENA WERE PURCHASED BY CITY OFFICIALS OR 
OTHERS WITH BUSINESS OR POLITICAL CONTACTS, RECORDS SHOW.

<P>
 The list of people and firms who bought the 9,000 World Cup tickets allotted 
to Pasadena reads like a who's who of local and regional business, politics and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wantanabe Kikaku Co., a Tokyo-based firm, bought 1,069 tickets, the largest 
single purchase of World Cup tickets allotted to the city to resell at face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal employees scooped up about 1,020 tickets, with City Atty. Victor 
Kaleta buying the most -- 104, according to recently released city records. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who used to represent Pasadena as 
an assemblyman, bought 26 and former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley bought six, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The local law firm of Hahn & Hahn bought 30, while Huntington Memorial 
Hospital officials picked up 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about one-fourth of the city's tickets went to people who did not hold 
some position of economic or political power, work for the city or know a 
municipal employee or official, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,670 tickets were sold to local soccer and recreation clubs, and about 
300 tickets were given to needy youths. The council members said they sold 
tickets to ordinary constituents as well, although a full accounting was not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, Pasadena officials said, they had adequately taken care of the 
needs of the average citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the approach that was used here was a fair approach, one that gave 
access to tickets to residents and also used them for purposes of economic 
development and promoting the interests of the city of Pasadena," Councilman 
William Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a lack of demand for some World Cup tickets made community access a moot 
point, one city official noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalpers were selling tickets below face value at some of the games at the 
Rose Bowl. Before last week's semifinal match between Brazil and Sweden, for 
example, scalpers were selling $300 tickets for $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rick Cole said the distribution went reasonably well, but said he 
would welcome a change in the way the city distributes its allocation of 
tickets to events at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have long advocated that council members and city staff be entirely taken 
out of the loop, (in favor of a system) that was clear and automatic and had no 
room for questions or controversy or manipulation," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Distribution of city-held tickets for the eight World Cup games at the Rose 
Bowl was beset by controversy from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, about eight months after Pasadena landed the World Cup, 
tournament officials told the city it would have an opportunity to buy 9,000 
tickets at face value. The tickets, including 2,000 for last Sunday's final 
game, ranged in value from $25 to $475. 
</P>
<P>
 But the World Cup gave the city two months to pay for half of the tickets, 
which had a face value of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The city couldn't afford to put up the money. So city staff scrambled to find 
buyers. Promises of sales to holders of Rose Bowl luxury suites, to others who 
had done business with the city and to city staff members brought charges from 
City Council members that some of the buyers could be profiteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council considered withdrawing the ticket offers, but backed off in 
December after being advised that such an action could expose the city to 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone who bought city tickets was required to sign an agreement that they 
would not scalp them. But they were not required to provide a full accounting 
of where the tickets went. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the initial scramble contributed to a situation where 
employees were allowed to acquire dozens of tickets. But at least some 
employees, including Kaleta, the city attorney, were also allowed to acquire 
more tickets in the days leading up to the games, when demand was not as strong 
as anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta said he personally used three of his tickets, while the rest were sold 
at face value to in-laws and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sams, a Rose Bowl official in charge of selling stadium luxury boxes and 
overseeing Brookside golf course, bought 56, the second-largest amount of any 
employee, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
 Sams said he passed on some of the tickets at face value to his employees and 
others went to friends and relatives. Ten other employees bought 20 or more 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were allowed to buy tickets for themselves, relatives, friends 
and constituents. Mayor Kathryn Nack acquired 214, most of which went to 
constituents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wantanabe Kikaku Co., which markets sports merchandise, was able to buy 
$112,000 worth of World Cup tickets because it leases 10 luxury boxes at the 
Rose Bowl, acting Rose Bowl Manager David Jacobs said. It is policy to make 
such tickets available to firms and individuals who lease the stadium's 34 
boxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is policy to make tickets available to other city affiliates, such as 
Avalon Productions, which produces concerts at the Rose Bowl, and Orrick, 
Herrington & Sutcliffe, a Los Angeles law firm that has served as a bond 
counsel for Pasadena. Avalon bought 32 tickets and members of the law firm 
acquired 59, records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also set aside 1,742 tickets -- including 971 that were assigned to 
the Chamber of Commerce -- to keep existing businesses in town or to help 
attract new companies. A Hong Kong investment group bought 16 of the tickets, 
and the Korean Chamber of Commerce bought eight. Ticket distribution is a 
recurring debate in Pasadena. In 1987, the issue flared after the city hosted 
the Super Bowl. Some of the tickets bought by council members were resold 
without their knowledge for several times face value.

WORLD CUP WINNERS, AND LOSERS; COMMERCE: MANY PASADENA MERCHANTS SAW PROFITS 
RISE 10% TO 30%. BUT FEARS OF FAN TRAFFIC KEPT LOCALS AWAY, HURTING BUSINESS AT 
SOME ESTABLISHMENTS.

 Soccer's Fat Lady has sung. 
</P>
<P>
 For many bars and restaurants in Old Pasadena, it was a welcome tune, as cash 
registers rang up record sales, especially last Sunday when Brazil and Italy 
faced off for the World Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said business was up 10% to 30% overall, as hungry sports hordes snapped 
up plates of pasta and souvenirs and quenched their thirsts with frosty 
pitchers of amber beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last week, it was extraordinary," said a beaming Armen Shirvanian, 
owner of the trendy Italian bistro Mi Piace. Shirvanian said that he had to 
double-order food and liquor to keep from running out and that he sold 1,500 
beers on Sunday, for example, instead of the usual 200. 
</P>
<P>
 But for others, the World Cup extravaganza struck a distinctly sour note. 
</P>
<P>
 At Old Town Bakery, several blocks west of where the main action unfolded, 
revenues have been down one-third throughout July as regulars stayed away, said 
Joel Kessel, the eatery's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding insult to the injurious lack of sales, many World Cup fans poured into 
Old Town Bakery not to eat or drink but to use the restrooms after Sunday's 
game, Kessel said. Once there, they pulled a toilet out of the wall and 
urinated and defecated throughout the facilities, causing $1,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a positive experience at all; we lost a lot of money," Kessel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also disappointed was Club Shelter, located in an attractive shopping complex 
behind Colorado Boulevard and lacking the street prominence to draw in patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Steve Waite said the World Cup was a wash for his club. He said he was 
especially irked by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which asked 
him to close early three times last week but did not cite the restaurant for 
any violations of the liquor law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only open from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., so if they're asking us to shut down 
one hour early, they're taking 20% of our business," Waite fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hawkins, president of the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, said business 
was "fairly stagnant" for merchants outside Old Pasadena because many regulars 
stayed away, fearing the entire city would be overrun with sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, a partner in the Green Street restaurant off Lake Street, said his 
sales were down 10% for the World Cup's duration and even more on game days. 
Only now are the regulars trickling back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce won't have final data until this fall, after it 
receives figures from the State Board of Equalization. But Hawkins said he 
believes that bars, restaurants and souvenir shops along Colorado Boulevard 
benefited most. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Hawkins said that in the long run the World Cup will pay off in 
other ways because it put Pasadena on the map for millions of fans watching 
around the world who may want to vacation or do business here. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local businesses without food, drink or services to sell to fans seized 
upon the World Cup as a golden networking opportunity. The Parsons Corp. hosted 
a lavish dinner at the Ritz-Carlton for the chairman of the Russian Council of 
Federation, Vladimir F. Shumeiko, and his entourage of 13 parliamentarians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the dinner, Parsons officials introduced the Russians to projects that the 
international firm has expertise in, including refinery, construction, power, 
transportation and environmental work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came because of the World Cup," said Ron Wildermuth, Parsons' director 
of corporate relations. "Having met them personally will help us in arranging 
future business. . . . That's incredibly positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Being on Colorado Boulevard, meanwhile, wasn't necessarily a license to print 
money. Of the merchants who suffered a slow month, many blamed the media, which 
they said wrote and broadcast stories, playing up the crowds and thus scaring 
away locals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds didn't interrupt business, it was the perception of crowds," said 
Jack D. Smith, president of the Old Pasadena Business and Professional Assn., 
which has 370 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Wednesday on, if you owned a restaurant or bar or sold souvenirs, you 
did great," Smith said. "I own a gift basket company and my business was down 
30% to 40%. In the short term, you suffered. In the long term you couldn't ask 
for better press because people are going to come back and visit." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Columbia Bar and Grill, one bartender said the restaurant was dead for 
most of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible," added a waitress. "Then Sunday it came in like a tidal wave 
and we were running out of food and beer." The restaurant closed at 8 p.m. 
instead of the usual 10 p.m. because it had run out of so many essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Bitonti, who owns a complex of three bars and restaurants on Fair Oaks, 
had the luck to be located directly across the street from where the shuttle 
buses lined up to pick up and drop off World Cup crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitonti spent $200,000 expanding his downstairs sports bar and had projected 
that business would be up 50% during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he estimates it was closer to 30%. He plans to use some of those 
profits to relax during a nine-day trip to Southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait; I haven't seen my family for one month, I've been working 19-, 
20-hour days. It's been very stressful and I'm glad it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 At CT's, a popular hangout on Colorado Boulevard, it wasn't too hard to figure 
out how things went. 
</P>
<P>
 "CT's closed Monday and Tuesday," read a sign. "Gone to Vegas to spend the 
World (Cup) money -- the Management."

NIGHT LIFE: POWER ROCK TRIO COULD BE ALL THE RAGE; THE RAGING HONKIES MAKE 
THEIR VENTURA DEBUT AT NICHOLBY'S. THE GROUP EVEN HAS ITS OWN VERSION OF A 
GUITAR GOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There have been some pretty powerful trios -- Blue Cheer, The Jimi Hendrix 
Experience, Grand Funk Railroad and Cream. The Raging Honkies are this year's 
model. They play supercharged blues with endless guitar solos. And they'll be 
making the beer pulsate and pool balls defy the laws of physics at Nicholby's 
in Ventura on Saturday night. Opening is Ventura guitar band, Aerial. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the starting point for a power trio is a guitar god. Michael Landau 
more than qualifies. The band's bio sheet is filled with quotes by writers who 
compare Landau to Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Landau has more fans than just writers, half of whom just show up for the free 
beer, anyway. When something like 250,000 people voted, Landau won the 1994 
Guitar Player Magazine reader's poll as the best around. Past winners include 
Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, Eddie Van Halen and Clapton. According to bassist and 
brother, Teddy Landau, it was in the genes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when he was real little, he always had 45s in his crib. Sometimes, 
he'd put them on his wrist and wear them as bracelets. He used to stick his 
head right by the speakers in the living room. When Michael was young, his 
nickname was 'Drix' because he could figure out Hendrix. Other kids would be 
playing heavy metal or something and Michael would be playing the Hendrix 
version of 'Hey Joe.' " 
</P>
<P>
 All three members of the trio, including drummer Abe Laboriel Jr., were in 
other bands before becoming Honkies in January. The Landaus, as Burning Water, 
were hits in Japan as recently as last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, it was just me and my brother sitting around playing," said Teddy 
Landau. "Then we started looking for a drummer and we just called up Abe. A 
trio just seems to fit our style, which is sort of like Jimi Hendrix and Cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway, lead singers are a pain. . . . They're always whining about 
something. Michael's guitar is sort of Hendrix, sort of Stevie Ray Vaughn. It's 
pretty hard rock, but it's not heavy metal or anything. We've got 12 to 15 
originals; we do a couple of Hendrix songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do they rage, but they join a growing list of other bands that think 
they do too. There's Ventura's own Raging Arb & the Redheads, Raging Slab and 
Rage Against the Machine. Their name came courtesy of the younger generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the name from these punk rock skateboard kids that live by us. We'd be 
playing in the garage and they'd come over," said Teddy. "When we decided we 
needed a name, we asked the kids. One of them said, 'Duuuude, the Raging 
Honkies.' The name doesn't mean anything, and it's certainly nothing racial. 
Our drummer is black." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the band's Ventura debut. The rest of the time, the band does the 
L.A. thing, playing a lot of small bars where the floor is sticky and 
everything smells like old beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, we play these low-key little dives, none of which pay very much," 
said Teddy Landau. "But we're not a cover band, so that's pretty cool. And 
since no one is paying 15 bucks to get in, no one is going to panic when we 
don't play 'Free Bird.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And the buzz for the Raging Honkies is definitely on -- they have a four-song 
demo tape, but as yet, no deal. That could be changing soon. But how to get 
signed where everyone in L.A. who is not a screenwriter, is in a band? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard," said Landau, "but we're sort of working with this guy named Dave 
Jerden who produced Alice in Chains. We just got out of the studio with, of all 
people, Tom Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think that my brother plays on other people's records all the 
time and is some sort of geek session guy. Then they see him live." Details

<P>
 Students from Cal Poly Pomona have won second place in a national competition 
to build hybrid electric cars from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanical engineering students beat 40 schools competing in the 
competition, a cooperative venture by the U.S. Department of Energy, the 
Society of Automotive Engineers, the Saturn Corp. and Natural Resources, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition, called the 1994 Hybrid Electric Vehicle Challenge, was held 
June 14-20 in Southfield, Mich. A team from UC Davis finished first. Cars were 
judged on quality, safety, design, emissions and performance in rush-hour 
traffic and in a 100-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 Hybrid electric vehicles, which use both electricity and traditional fuels, 
represent a technology that could reduce reliance on fossil fuels and imported 
petroleum.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL TO LAY OFF 25 EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Memorial Hospital will lay off about 25 employees from its 
3,000-member staff this week in another sign of trouble for San Gabriel Valley 
health providers. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the layoffs include nurses, spokeswoman Peg Kean said.The layoffs are 
necessary because of a decline in patient admissions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, San Gabriel Valley Medical Center laid off 17 full-time and 34 
part-time employees from its staff of 881; the former Inter-Community Medical 
Center in Covina cut 50 full-time positions from its 1,100-member staff through 
a voluntary separation package, and 80 people accepted an early retirement 
package at Huntington.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Inter-Community Medical Center and Queen of the Valley Hospital 
in West Covina merged last April under the name Citrus Valley Health Partners.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: DIXIE FLYERS TAKING EXPRESS RUN FOR FUN; GROUP'S NEW 
SEVEN-PIECE LINEUP WILL APPEAR AT THE VENTURA CONCERT THEATRE AND IN CAMARILLO 
THIS WEEKEND.

<P>
 Local fans of the Santa Clarita-based group Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie 
Flyers can expect to see a lot of the band this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the Dixie Flyers will play for Country Dance Night at the Ventura 
Concert Theatre, where they have previously opened for Chet Atkins and John 
Anderson. The theater is a perfect venue to enjoy their stage show and highly 
danceable music. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you haven't seen them recently, check out the new seven-piece lineup: 
Lead vocalist O'Connell, Tom Ricardo (fiddle, guitar, keyboards, vocals), Gary 
Rudolf (lead guitar) and Jimmy Waldrop (lead guitar) are the original Flyers. 
They are joined by Maria Werth on bass, drummer Louie Fudale and 
singer-guitarist John (Elvis) Styles, who wowed 'em recently at the Crazy Bull 
with his rendition of "Heartbreak Hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 The party starts at 7 p.m. when Dave Graves and Kathy Culley teach "Renegade," 
a popular couples mixer dance. Then climb aboard the Dixie Flyer express at 9 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday bring the kids and kick up your heels at the second annual all-day 
indoor/outdoor Crazy Bull anniversary barbecue in Camarillo. Last year's party 
was a ton of fun. And Sunday's event, which will be outside starting at 11 
a.m., will include music by Shiloh, the Dixie Flyers, Diane Lynne and the Stars 
& Stripes band and Caught Red Handed. K-HAY radio dee jay Ray Taylor will give 
away T-shirts and prizes, and the kids can take cart and pony rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile indoors, Raywood and the Unseen will provide music for ongoing dance 
lessons by all the club's instructors -- John & Dawn, Lori McGee, Gary Evans, 
Juan and Rick Henderson. Guests will see the debut of the Crazy Bull Performing 
Dance Team, coached by Sandi Axelrod. And new members will be recruited for 
adult and junior teams starting in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Axelrod formerly worked with Western Saddles, a junior dance team in Thousand 
Oaks that recently disbanded. She said there is no cost to join the new Crazy 
Bull Adult Performing Team, which practices from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Crazy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 But monthly membership in the Adult Competition Team will be $25 per person 
excluding costume expenses. The fee covers guest choreographers and instructor 
costs. The competition team will practice at the Bull from 2 to 4 p.m. on 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Junior Performing/Competition Team, open to ages 7 to 17, will meet 4 
to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays. A $25 monthly fee for juniors does not include costume 
or travel expenses. For details on the new teams, call 482-7664.

 CLUB SCENE: First, the good news. Several clubs have recently introduced a 
Country Dance Night format. 
</P>
<P>
 The debut of country night at Alexander's in the Ventura Village Harbor looked 
good and well-attended. But the management decided to move the time up. So Dave 
Graves will teach from 7 to 8 p.m. Tuesday. Caught Red Handed will play 8 p.m. 
to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday nights at the Crazy Bull are free for women. And the format is 
mostly couples dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 About two months ago, the Hyatt Westlake Plaza Hotel started a country Western 
night Tuesdays in the lounge. The floor is small but the dark, cozy room is 
perfect for beginners who shun the spotlight of high-powered clubs. Mark Hicks, 
an Australian, teaches at 6 p.m. and then he deejays for dancing until 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sundays, the Wagon Wheel Restaurant in Oxnard offers a family-oriented fun 
dance evening starting with lessons at 6 p.m. by Jim and Pauls Trisdale. Then 
they deejay and help beginners until 9 p.m. There is no cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
 On the down side, two Camarillo country sites are gone. Zinno's recently 
closed and the Country Rose Saloon is now a sports bar. And that former dance 
mecca, the Borderline in Malibu, has "closed temporarily." 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, the Thousand Oaks Borderline is going strong although it has phased 
out the noon to 5 p.m. family dance on Sundays. I recently dropped into the 
Sunday Swing Jam Night, which starts with a 6 p.m. lesson, and had a ball. 
Dance fans should also check out the new live-band format at 8 p.m. on Mondays. 
You'll find a high-energy atmosphere but open dance floor both nights. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Congrats to Country Lover/dance instructor Robin Dick and Tom Finnerty, who 
tied the knot June 11 in a ceremony held at Faulkner Farm in Santa Paula. And 
also to not-so-newly weds Jerri and Joe Noone, familiar to dancers at Splash 
and Crazy Bull for their matching custom-made outfits. At last month's Ventura 
Theatre Country Dance Night, Jerri won the Women's Western Wear contest by 
entering with Joe as a fashion accessory. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Dance/Barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Crazy Bull Steakhouse & Saloon, 4426 Central Ave., Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Sunday, from 11 a.m. 'til the cows come home. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: Free dance lessons and entertainment by Darlene O'Connell & the 
Dixie Flyers and Shiloh bands.

TOPICS / SCIENCE; AMATEUR STARGAZERS SCOPE OUT COSMIC CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The collision of Jupiter with Fragment B of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 didn't 
look like much through the high-powered telescopes set up Saturday night by the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory Astronomy Club in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a thrill nonetheless to the several hundred visitors who waited 
patiently for a chance to view the cosmic crash, one of a series of such events 
that continued through the week. On Saturday, amateur star-watchers and New Age 
adherents alike became spectators to a galactic demolition derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the visual impact was far from "Star Wars" special effects, 
imagination picked up where the telescopes left off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic! Imagine what's happening," gushed Laura Ochoa of Los Angeles, 
waiting in line. "A comet hitting a planet. . . . It's history!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shajiyah Akbar, a Pasadena resident, wondered whether the collision would have 
astrological consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see if it has any effect on people that are ruled by Jupiter, 
(which) rules Sagittarius and Pisces," she said. "I thought this was a very 
exciting event of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from sheer entertainment value, the collision offered a chance for 
astronomers, who normally study phenomena that unfold over billions of years, 
to observe cosmic activity before their very eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 JPL employees belonging to the laboratory's Astronomy Club arrived before dusk 
to set up their own telescopes including some with eight- or 10-inch lenses -- 
while speculating on what they might reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomical theories predicted a plenitude of possible effects from the 
comet's collision, said JPL engineer and Astronomy Club member Dave Nakamoto. 
Among them: The comet fragments would create fireballs that would light up a 
nearby moon. They would puncture holes in the planet's atmosphere, revealing a 
deeper layer of dark gases. They would release plumes of gas, similar to how a 
pebble dropped in a pond sends up a splash of water. The last proved the most 
accurate prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the comet fragment hit the planet shortly before 8 p.m., but it 
struck on the far side of the planet, so the effects weren't visible for a 
couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 What viewers saw, at around 10 p.m. after most of the crowd had left, was a 
dark, diffused region, about the size of Jupiter's great red spot. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to focus on, Nakamoto said, but unmistakably there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me about 30 seconds to convince myself I was really seeing it," he 
said. "Jupiter was getting lower in the horizon, and the atmosphere was getting 
turbulent. It was like looking at a quarter at the bottom of a swimming pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact zone was the size of several Earth diameters, Nakamoto said, 
raising chilling implications about the possibility of a similar collision on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Impacts of comets and asteroids are a hot topic these days, probably because 
a lot of people since the early '80s have speculated that they caused mass 
extinctions on Earth," said Bob Cesarone, a JPL engineer and Astronomy Club 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael Hernandez of Los Angeles cautioned about that danger as he distributed 
literature on his proposal for space colonies built of lunar dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep neglecting the space program and an asteroid hits the Earth, 
forget it," he warned. "It'll be too late."

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; SCIENTISTS CONTINUE STUDY INTO PLANTS' EFFECTS ON CLIMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers returned to the San Gabriel Valley this month for the second phase 
of their study on the effects of transpiration -- the moisture given off by 
plants -- on climate temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co. sponsored the project conducted by the U.S. 
Forest Service and Indiana University researchers to determine whether the 
moisture would cool the neighborhood and result in less need for air 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, researchers will gauge the wind speed, humidity and temperatures 
from eight 10-foot climate stations placed in the back yards of Arcadia and San 
Gabriel residents, and compare the results to the same statistics gathered from 
those stations last summer. Arcadia has more vegetation than San Gabriel, which 
researchers expect will lower the temperatures in the Arcadia yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers will also compare the back-yard information to the yearlong 
statistics gathered from a 100-foot station that monitors Arcadia's climate in 
general. Researchers were unable to put a similar station in San Gabriel for a 
year, so they will only monitor that neighborhood's climate from a 100-foot 
station for one month. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Simpson, who works for the Forest Service and coordinates the study, said 
the absence of yearlong data from the neighborhood station in San Gabriel would 
hinder the results, but that data from a summer month was the most crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers will conclude their study in San Gabriel Valley next month with 
results in six months to a year. They will move on to San Bernardino and Long 
Beach for similar tests and plan to finish the entire project in 1997.

TOPICS / SCHOOLS; BOARD VOTES FOR NEW FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of many property owners, the board of the Alhambra City 
and High School Districts voted last week to create a landscape and lighting 
district to raise $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to maintain playgrounds and gymnasiums that are used by 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will make our playgrounds safer for the public when they come in to use 
them," district Supt. Heber Meeks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alhambra resident John Williams said the funds should come out of the 
district's $100-million annual budget, and not from assessment fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't even begun to take Draconian measures to find these funds in 
their own district," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks countered that the district already had cut $2 million from its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Alhambra and Monterey Park who live within both the elementary 
and high school districts will pay $23 per household. Households in only the 
high school district will pay $9.20. Households in multifamily units will pay 
$19.73 per unit or $7.89 per unit, depending on where they live.

 ALHAMBRA: Four armed men robbed a sewing machine company Tuesday afternoon. 
The robbers entered the store in the 2400 block of West Valley Boulevard at 
1:20 p.m. and demanded that employees and customers turn over jewelry and cash. 
The robbers hit one person on the head with the butt of a knife and another 
with the butt of a gun, police said. They then ran out of the store with about 
$400 in cash and jewelry and got in two cars. An employee activated a silent 
alarm and after a chase, police arrested Guo Chen, 21, of Alhambra on suspicion 
of armed robbery. He is being held in Alhambra City Jail on $50,000 bail. Three 
suspects are still at large. Police are looking for a dark blue, late-model, 
two-door Honda Civic that was driven by one of the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAREMONT: A 19-year-old Upland woman who had been missing more than 30 hours 
was in critical condition Wednesday after her car flew off the road and into a 
Claremont flood control channel early Sunday morning. Melissa Jan Pillow had 
left a party in Glendora at 1:30 a.m. Sunday with three friends, said Claremont 
Police Officer Larry Horowitz. After the group went to Pillow's brother's 
fraternity house on Garey Avenue in Pomona, Pillow left by herself about 3:45 
a.m., Horowitz said. Her car apparently went off an embankment along Garey 
Avenue, struck the concrete side of the flood control channel and dropped 40 
feet, he said. Pillow was not found until early Monday evening, when a couple 
taking a walk saw the car. 
</P>
<P>
 GLENDORA: Three men robbed a cellular phone store July 14 but were apprehended 
by police a short time later. Two men armed with guns entered Executive 
Cellular, in the 700 block of Grand Avenue, about 2:55 p.m. They jumped over 
the counter, told the two employees to lie down and ran off with 25 cellular 
phones as well as jewelry and a purse belonging to one employee and a watch 
from the other. The two were later seen in a car with a third man driving. 
Arrested on suspicion of robbery were Eric Wilson, 24, of Hawthorne; Derrick 
Daniels, 22, of Los Angeles; and Deandre Wright, 25, of Pacoima. They were held 
in Glendora City Jail on $50,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: An Arizona man allegedly shot his wife in the stomach Sunday morning 
after the two apparently argued in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven store at 1550 
Murchison Ave. Jesus Diaz Reyes, 21, was arrested on suspicion of attempted 
murder in connection with the 2 a.m. shooting of his wife, Rachel Diaz, 21, who 
was listed in critical but stable condition Tuesday at County-USC Medical 
Center. Jesus Diaz is being held in Pomona City Jail on $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Police reported that a woman they believe to be a prostitute left her 
5-week-old son early Monday morning with two transients who did not know her. 
The transients, a man and woman, told police the woman left the baby with them 
at the corner of Holt Avenue and Fillmore Place just after midnight. The mother 
was arrested on suspicion of child mistreatment but later released; her son has 
been placed in foster care pending court review of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 VALINDA: A 17-year-old La Puente boy was killed Monday in a drive-by shooting 
as he was riding his bicycle at the intersection of Echelon Avenue and Hayland 
Street. The boy, whose name was not released, was shot about 5 p.m and was 
taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina, where he died at 5:55 
p.m. Two of three male suspects, riding in a gold or gray late-model Oldsmobile 
Cutlass, fired at the boy with 9mm pistols, sheriff's deputies said. The car 
was last seen headed east on Bluelagoon Street. Anyone with information is 
urged to call homicide detectives at (213) 890-5500.

CENTERPIECE: SAVE THE BATS; DEE AND JOHN LOCKWOOD ARE COMMITTED TO A DAUNTING 
TASK: RE-EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF CREATURES WITH 
A BAD RAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dee Lockwood is serving afternoon tea and cookies. She is at her kitchen 
table, bathed in sunlight that pours in through a picture window, the setting 
and her hospitality and speech the essence of suburban gentility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the discussion is bats: their habits, their homes, their value to the 
world, the bum rap they suffer in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," says Lockwood, "would you like to see some bat guano?" 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses, takes a sip of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, these guys eat insects at an amazing rate. They're working all night 
cleaning things up. Their guano is loaded with bug parts -- moth eyeballs and 
such -- that the bat doesn't digest." 
</P>
<P>
 In a flash she's outside the picture window, down on the front lawn picking up 
a tiny black pellet. She returns to the kitchen table, opens her bare hand, and 
there, in the center of her palm, it rests: a tiny black tubule she will 
carefully place on the tabletop next to her tea, a veritable gemstone of scat. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mate, John Lockwood, smears a piece of it on a slide, pops it under a 
nearby microscope, and pronto: a kaleidoscope of gnat legs and torn sheets of 
moth eyeball rods and cones, an infinite junkyard of the undigested but 
decimated, a collage of seemingly ancient life fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee lifts the plate of chocolate chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Care for one? Isn't it just amazing?" BAT ADVOCACY 
</P>
<P>
 Dee and John Lockwood are, for want of a better term, bat guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 They live in a large, modern, airy home on a waterway channel of the Ventura 
Keys. They're fit, gracious, comported just as you would expect in this upscale 
neighborhood. But on their street of expensive cars, the Lockwood driveway is 
overwhelmed by a tan motor home with a large message emblazoned on both sides: 
</P>
<P>
 SAVE THE BATS 
</P>
<P>
 SALVE LOS MURCIELAGOS 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors at first didn't get it. Then they feared it. Then, says Dee and 
John, they got to know the Lockwoods personally and, more importantly, the 
nature of their bat advocacy. Some have even seen Dee's brown bat in the 
basement freezer or John's brown bat in alcohol in the Ball jar by the kitchen 
sink -- and managed not to shriek. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a measure of the Lockwoods' success in telling their story about the role 
bats have in the ecology of Ventura County and California, Mexico and the 
world. Their basic message is: Bats are our friends, not enemies, and if they 
are threatened so is the world as we all know it. 
</P>
<P>
 They spread this message with facts, a practical array of things that matter 
in everyday life to most people. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the amazing factoids they report, most furnished by Bat Conservation 
International (BCI), in Austin, Tex., are that bats are nature's bug-zappers (a 
single brown bat can catch 600 mosquitoes an hour), re-pollinators (cactus, 
including agave and saguaro, depend largely upon reseeding by bats, as do 
countless plant and tree species in tropical rain forests in South America), 
and most ubiquitous species (nearly 1,000 kinds of bats account for nearly 25% 
of all mammal species on Earth). 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate the rapacity of bats toward annoying insects and crop-damaging 
bugs -- and our unacknowledged debt to them -- the Lockwoods cite a now-famous 
cave in Bracken, Tex., where 3 million bats live and nightly consume 250,000 
pounds of bugs. Without those bats and their insecticide role, farm crops would 
be eaten, and people everywhere on back porches as well as the agriculture 
industry would increasingly contaminate the earth with chemical insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, mosquitoes and flies in the Ventura Keys are small pickins' by 
comparison. But there too nature's undesirables are held in check by Ventura's 
ample population of little brown, little-seen bats. And then, of course, there 
are the varieties of desert plants that spring up from seeds within the 
multitudinous bat guano. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockwoods use their own time and money to visit school classrooms in 
Ventura County, to farms and ranches where misunderstood bats are reported to 
be "a potential problem," or to Mexico's rural outback. It's a calling of 
sorts, an inspiration mined in midlife following divorces from previous 
marriages, a way to commit to something they both truly care about: the natural 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took a while for them to learn this message, let alone sell it. GETTING 
PAST UCKY 
</P>
<P>
 The love of bats started first with Dee, who, a decade ago, was a housewife on 
vacation in Oregon. She found an injured bat, put it in a cage and observed it. 
"It was amazing to watch it move about," she says. "It was actually quite 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 She was raising a family in Los Angeles at the time. Intrigued by her 
experience, she called the UCLA office of Pat Brown, a scientist who has 
conducted bat studies on the Channel Islands. Brown introduced Dee to a healthy 
bat in her lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in the palm of my hand, a tiny little thing," Dee says, "and it was 
calling out to its mama. Once I saw it up close, I was hooked. I fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, is a considerable achievement for an adult who, like most of 
us, grew up learning that bats were grotesque, evil creatures hanging upside 
down in trees and inclined to dive-bomb innocent people for the purpose of 
getting caught in their hair -- and possibly sinking vicious little teeth into 
their scalp or, even, sucking their blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee and John would, in a 1991 trip to Mexico, prove the folly of this myth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a cave with 200,000 bats," says John. "I'll tell you this: They 
don't get tangled in your hair. They brush by. We held our arms up as they flew 
by -- not a single hit. Except for a few species, they don't take off like 
birds -- they must fall 4 feet from their perch in order to gain loft and then 
momentum. They simply will not hit you. People mistake this fall at the start 
of flight as a dive at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Mashburn, an Ojai naturalist who promotes the cause of bats, describes 
the menacing psychology that runs against bats: "I talk to children, and they 
quickly take to bats. But overall it's hard to change people, especially 
adults. For many, when bats are the subject, there's just no way to change that 
ucky thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ucky thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider it: Bats are alien at first glance. 
</P>
<P>
 They do hang upside down. They do bare their teeth, though this has nothing to 
do with an intention to bite; they must hold their mouths open in order to 
operate their sonar, or send out the little beeps that find things in a process 
called echolocation. Their ears are huge, but then hearing those beeps bounce 
back off approaching objects gives them "sight." They do fly helter-skelter at 
times, but that's less about being crazed than complete in their search for 
information -- including a dinner of insects -- around them. They do look like 
rodents at times, but they're not. The scientific world, which classifies bats 
as mammals, now is in debate about whether bats are actually related to us, as 
primates: Their opposing thumbs and reproductive cycles seem to suggest as 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they can bite, though rarely, and when they do, it almost exclusively 
occurs as the result of being injured or sick and confused and then picked up 
by a human. The truth is, a normal healthy bat has no interest in you and would 
have to be sadistically provoked before biting. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they're ucky to so many. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ucky thing, as well as misinformation, is why bat populations 
worldwide have declined over the last few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 BCI cites farmers in the Midwest and West, frightened that their livestock 
would be vulnerable to bat-borne rabies, who have torched caves that were home 
to millions of bats. Yet bats carry rabies at only a fraction of the rate 
assigned to raccoons or dogs, both of which mingle with people. 
</P>
<P>
 And frightened people everywhere have assaulted bat habitats -- in trees, 
behind window shutters in houses, between roof tiles on garages, anywhere there 
is dark, narrow, cool, protected space, just because they are unknown creatures 
of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 These reflexive decimations of bats are made lasting by the extremely slow 
reproductive rate of bats, which have one baby each annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The fright factor and myth factor is so pervasive that Dee and John Lockwood, 
on tour in bat-rich Mexico to distribute pamphlets lavishing praise on bats, 
returned only to say a typical adult reaction to the logo on their motor home 
is, "Los vampiros meurdan a qui" (the vampires bite here), with a hand gesture 
to the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 But vampire bats, nowhere to be seen in these parts, are merely one small 
species based largely in Mexico and Central America, though still only a minute 
part of bat populations there. These mouse-sized creatures do nourish 
themselves on the blood of animals -- cleverly, as well, by first emitting an 
anesthetic from their saliva. They hold medical promise to humans, BCI asserts, 
because of a yet-to-be synthesized anticoagulant naturally secreted in their 
saliva. PITCHING A MESSAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Dee and John Lockwood figure they spend the equivalent of five full days a 
month in their bat "evangelism," to borrow John's word. The rest of the time 
they manage about 12 apartment units in properties they own in Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties. Occasionally, John does free-lance studio photography -- once 
his full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 But bats are central to their lives, central to their rather young 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 They had known each other for years but only got together in 1991 when each 
was coming out of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee invited John to attend a bat-research conference in Texas that first year 
they were together. They sat in bat seminars from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. for three 
days. While this was not exactly a standard date for John, he was no stranger 
to the conservation-minded; his father had played a central role in a state 
wildlife service in saving the Garibaldi, California's state fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Zuri, a fruit-eating red bat owned by bat researcher Merlyn Tuttle, 
that cinched things for John. "He was just a great little guy," Lockwood says. 
"Intense gaze, playful, incredibly sensitive. How could you not like him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dee: "I knew he'd love bats. I knew I couldn't be that far off." 
</P>
<P>
 While John insists that neither he nor Dee are "cause people or political 
drum-beaters" of any stripe, Dee plainly says "bats gave us a mission." Indeed, 
if they're not pitching their own bat message, they'll show up in interest and 
solidarity, as they did recently at a Barnes & Noble lecture, to hear 
naturalist Mashburn entrance an all-ages audience on bat reality, bat trivia, 
bat beneficence -- and to meet "Rusty," the charming pet red bat that hangs 
from Mashburn's collar. ON THE ROAD 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockwoods at this moment are somewhere in Canada, barely midway through a 
three-month, coast-to-coast tour in their motor home. Predictably, the giant 
lettering on the sides has expanded to three languages with this addition of 
Save the Bats: 
</P>
<P>
 SAUVEZ LES CHAUVE-SOURIS 
</P>
<P>
 Their peripatetic evangelism will not allow the full-service bat work they do 
here -- where 24 species, dominated by the humble little brown bat, thrive. 
Last month, they were consulting with a Hidden Valley rancher about building 
bat houses that would consolidate and even increase bat populations for the 
purposes of insect protection, as well as taking the time to do show-and-tell 
lectures for schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 For Canadians, it's more on the fly: The Lockwoods will hand out BCI-supplied 
bat brochures and also have fellow travelers in to the motor home to watch a 
compelling bat video, also supplied by BCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as their busy lives at home are only partly claimed by bats, their trip 
isn't entirely about bats. It's about expanding the journey that bats helped 
set them upon in the first place: joint exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee and John Lockwood will at some point end up in Goose Bay, Canada, where 
the trans-Canadian highway ends. That's where they'll put their fold-out boat 
into the water and commence a journey into deep interior Labrador in search of 
a memorial to a lost explorer who Dee had read about. 
</P>
<P>
 The trek will take them up a rough river and then on foot for 30 miles across 
trail-less, uninhabitable, boggy terrain boiling with the kind of black flies 
that bite for keeps. For any moose or bear on tour, Dee and John will appear as 
apparitions in white emergency response suits with vinyl windows sewn into the 
face netting -- perfectly ridiculous creatures with darting eyes and strange 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In that setting, they will look at least as alarming as any bat has to man.

THE ART OF THE BATTLE; PAINTBALL COMBAT AT AN AZUSA RANCH IS GOOD, NOT-SO-CLEAN 
FUN FOR WEEKEND WARRIORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Matt Valcore had staked out his spot behind a large rock along the perimeter 
of The Jungle, a 10-acre avocado grove that has been converted into one of 14 
battlefields on a 165-acre ranch in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in combat fatigues, his face covered by goggles and armed with an 
air-powered rifle capable of firing marble-sized balls of paint at speeds of 
285 feet per second, Valcore had found a prime position. He could also see that 
most of his teammates had been shot and knocked out of the game. And the 
"enemy" was zeroing in. In seconds, hundreds of colorful plastic paintballs 
started exploding off the rock Valcore was hiding behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a brief lull in the shooting, Valcore lifted his head and peaked over 
the rim of the rock. 
</P>
<P>
 PLAP! A bright orange splotch of watercolor paint, about the diameter of a 
half-dollar, fanned across the exposed part of Valcore's forehead. "That one 
hurt," said the 25-year-old Rancho Cucamonga man, taking his place in the "dead 
zone" with the rest of that battle's casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fun part is you can always go back and die again," offered dead enemy 
Eduardo Monge, a 42-year-old Amtrak administrator from Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reincarnation is wonderful," agreed paintball warrior Gary Hoopfer, 49, of 
Cerritos, as he and the others moved on to the next round. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly no one playing paintball at Ralph Covell's ranch one weekend earlier 
this month could appreciate a comment like that more than Covell himself. After 
winning a four-month battle with Azusa City Hall to keep the paintball 
operation open, Covell hopes paintball battles like the recent ones will 
generate renewed interest in his California Paintball Ranch in San Gabriel 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1 million people in the United States play paintball, suiting up 
in camouflage gear, strapping on goggles and protective headgear, arming 
themselves with paint guns and, after a brief safety training talk, heading out 
on "missions." Sometimes the mission involves teamwork to capture the flag. 
Sometimes the mission is simply to eliminate players from the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
 At all times players must keep their protective eye gear on. One hit and 
you're out -- though you can be reborn later. Referees roam the field to 
enforce the rules and call players out. Other than that, it's all-out war when 
the whistle blows and play begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of it as going out to shoot rabbits and the rabbits shoot back," said 
Jay Livingston of Monrovia. During the week, Livingston works construction. 
He's been playing paintball for about eight years and on the weekends helps 
Covell out with renting equipment and refereeing games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an excellent use of the land," said Covell, who is possibly better known 
for being the biggest breeder of Clydesdale horses in the western United 
States. "The most profitable thing I could do with the land is rock quarry it 
or build houses. But this leaves the land in a natural state. The paint is 
biodegradable and it's great action. I have yet to have someone tell me they 
have come up here and say they didn't have a fantastically good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Covell said he first got the idea for using part of the ranch for paintball 
battles 12 years ago. At the time, little was known about the sport and 
attorneys advised him the liability was too great. Today, paintball is played 
around the world and is among the faster-growing sports in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $20,000 investment, used mostly to buy rifles and goggles, Covell first 
opened the ranch for weekend paintball games in September. He has guests sign a 
waiver, although he also has insurance that costs him $4,000 a year. With a 
stable of 57 Clydesdale horses and ponies serving as a backdrop, the simulated 
urban and jungle war zone settings quickly became a hit with paintball 
enthusiasts across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "The Jungle," there's also "Dodge City," 40 wood-framed buildings set 
up in a fenced acre near the stables. The "OK Corral" is a collection of power 
line reels, oil drums and pallets, perfect for team play. Then there's the 
"Gotcha" field, where it's kill or be killed. Players go one-on-one in a 
50-foot-by-80-foot enclosed field dotted with upright plywood planks to hide 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch has attracted a diverse range of paintball buffs: corporate 
executives, staff from the county district attorney's office, construction 
workers and police officers. Even doctors and lawyers have come to practice 
team-building techniques or just blow off some steam. The ranch has been booked 
solid on weekends since March. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just interesting. It's a good release from the hospital. It 
gets your mind off the everyday routine," said longtime paintball player Lauren 
Lewan, an emergency room chart clerk at Pomona Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, however, embraced Covell's plans for the horse ranch. In 
December, two months after the paintball ranch opened, a handful of neighbors 
complained that they had never been notified of the change of use for the 
property. As a result, the Azusa city attorney's office temporarily put an end 
to paintball play at Covell's ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors expressed environmental concerns about the water-soluble paint, 
worries that proved unfounded; in fact, the U.S. Forest Service uses the paint 
to mark trees. One neighbor said she lost sleep over the fear of camouflaged 
people returning to the ranch at night and attacking her. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the City Council voted 5-0 to accept Covell's special permit 
application. But by then, Covell said, he had lost an estimated $12,000 in 
business. Azusa Mayor Steve Alexander, one of Covell's staunchest supporters, 
said the ranch was already zoned for recreational use and paintball fit neatly 
into that criteria. The city, Alexander said, overstepped its bounds by forcing 
Covell to get a special permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't regulate something that's not a problem," he said. Alexander has 
never played paintball, but he has watched it played from a distance. "And the 
ranch seems to be a perfect spot for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Since reopening, Covell has been steadily rebuilding his client base. Last 
month the ranch hosted 2,000 paintball players from around the country who 
competed in the two-day National Professional Paintball League Tournament. A 
steady stream of church groups, Girl and Boy Scout troops, corporations, even 
police squads have also been spending weekends at the ranch, in part to build 
morale and develop leadership skills, but mostly to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekend, Dave Harrington of Carson organized a game with 25 
co-workers, friends and family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a lot of fun to try something like that," the 
25-year-old electrical engineer said. His twin brother, Darrell, an internist 
at Harbor-UCLA Hospital in Torrance, and their sister, Andrea, 30, also played. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's anything you want to do regularly, but it is something you 
can do once or twice a year. You come out of there with a couple of welts, 
definitely, and you're proud of them. It tests your wits. It's pretty cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The adrenaline kick is what attracted Mark Arenas to paintball four years ago. 
Arenas, a victim's advocate for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, 
organizes men and women in the office to play twice a year at paintball fields 
around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always looking for new places to go," Arenas said. Past paintball 
battles have been waged on fields in Malibu, Corona and Valencia. At Covell's 
ranch, Arenas' group was treated to a hayride in a wagon driven by Covell and 
pulled by two of his champion Clydesdales. "We had a lot of fun when we went up 
there. And (Covell) adds that personal touch." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, it was all business for the West Covina police Special Weapons 
and Assault Team. They rented the fields to test their team skills under fire. 
Some of the officers said paintball is as close as you can come to re-creating 
a real police situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a relatively new thing for us," said West Covina police Detective 
Dennis Bennallack. Three weeks ago, the 20-member unit practiced street war 
drills in Dodge City, a paintball battlefield almost an acre in size, and 
dotted with 40 small wood-frame structures. "Our purpose for doing this is 
completely different from the reasons why other people go up there. We were 
there to brush up on our communication and our concentration. It's excellent 
for realistic training." 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem, he said, was the cost. For one day of play, each player was 
charged $25 for the field rental. They also had to rent equipment. The total 
cost for the SWAT team was nearly $700. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun and we were able to get across some good training points. But it's 
not real cheap," said West Covina police Sgt. Wade Weischedel. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most players at one recent paintball game at Covell's ranch, Mike 
Campbell of Monrovia brought his own equipment. His semiautomatic paintball 
rifle, one of two he owns, cost $500. Over the past eight years, Campbell 
estimates he has spent $5,000 to $6,000 on rifles, carbon dioxide canisters, 
paintballs and combat fatigues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a poor man's sport," said Campbell, 31, who plays with a San Gabriel 
Valley-based paintball team called the California Bushwackers. With 35 members, 
the Bushwackers are the largest pro paintball team in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pros, players have their entry fees paid by sponsors and split 
tournament purses. At the league tournament played at Covell's the winners 
split a $15,000 prize, also put up by sponsors. Campbell also referees games 
and sometimes "walks on" and joins up with teams that are short of players. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs aside, Richard Booth of Walnut said paintball is a great activity that 
he and his 16-year-old son, Richard Jr., can enjoy together. The elder Booth 
said he has spent more than $900 outfitting himself and his son for their 
weekend forays into the world of pseudo-combat. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "Compared with skiing or anything else for that matter, the 
start-up costs aren't really all that big of a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Booth, a vice president at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Los Angeles, plays 
at least once a month and said he enjoys the personal touch Covell offers 
weekend visitors to the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as high volume as other places," Booth said. "Sometimes they can get 
hundreds of people on a weekend" at other Southland paintball playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical toll a day of paintball exacts is another story. After their 
recent paintball games were over, Booth watched as teammate Monge lifted his 
undershirt and inspected some of the black and blue marks acquired during the 
battle. But Monge shrugs it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I played I went home and I was full of welts and full of paint 
and I said, 'This is fun,' " Monge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hoopfer, who works with Booth at St. Vincent's: "It doesn't really hurt. 
Sometimes you don't even know you've been hit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, you don't know you've been hit," Booth agreed. "Until you get in the 
shower."

IT'S FUN, BUT NOT CHEAP

 Those thinking of spending their weekends playing paintball might want to 
check their bank accounts first. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-day trip to Ralph Covell's paint ranch in Azusa costs $50 per person, 
$25 for use of the okace and $25 to rent the special air-powered pump rifle, 
goggles and enough paint to mess up a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The serious paintballer could spend serious money, $400 to $500, for a full 
complement of gear, said John Robinson, manager of Skirmish Inc., a paintball 
equipment outlet in Reseda. That cost will buy an air-powered pump rifle, 
goggles and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Paint ammunition is $5 for 100 rounds or $85 for a cache of 2,500 rounds of 
plastic pellets. Carbon dioxide canisters, which give the rifles their power, 
can cost from $40 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about a nickel every time you pull the trigger," said Eduardo Monge, 42, 
of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifles range from $100 for a simple-pump version to $1,000 for a specially 
fitted and painted semiautomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Campbell of Monrovia has been playing paintball for nearly eight years 
and has spent between $5,000 and $6,000 for rifles and other equipment over 
that time, he said. "It all boils down to your preference," he said. KEVIN

 With a lineup that has changed only slightly less than the Dodger bull pen, 
Yes has continued to make cerebral, bombastic, symphonic, complex and arty rock 
since the band's debut in late 1969. Yes will perform Sunday afternoon at the 
Santa Barbara County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take about 20 pages to recount the lineup changes in the band. But 
we'll just discuss the highlights. Original singer Jon Anderson continues to 
hit those high notes in his eminently identifiable voice, and Chris Squire is 
still the bass player. Tony Kaye was the original keyboard player, then was 
replaced by Rick Wakeman in 1971, but has been back in the band since 1983. 
Drummer Alan White has been with the group since 1973. Trevor Rabin, who 
produced the new album "Talk" is the new guy -- he's only been a Yesman since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The surreal album covers of Roger Dean from the mid-'70s to the early '80s are 
long gone, but the surreal music survives none the worse for wear. Also, at 
each show on this tour, there is a special section that allows a select few to 
experience an expanded listening experience, but more on that in a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 A South African native who now lives in L.A., Rabin got the band back on track 
after they broke up in the early '80s. He was responsible for "90125," a 1983 
release that has been the band's biggest hit, containing the smash single, 
"Owner of a Lonely Heart." Rabin discussed the latest Yes news during a recent 
phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 How is "Talk" different than the previous zillion Yes albums? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the last one ("Union" from 1991) wasn't very cohesive because there were 
various factions involved. It just didn't gel. But the new one was made for the 
right reasons with the right motivation. On this one we used computer 
technology; there was virtually no tape as it was done on the hard drive. 
People think that computers somehow eliminate the human aspect, but really it 
allowed us to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Yes has been labeled an art rock band. What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't mean anything to me. I hate how things must be classified. How this 
is applied to musicians implies that they somehow contrive their products and 
have studied the demographics of the audience. That's not us. 
</P>
<P>
 On this tour there is a Special Enhanced Audio section. What's up with that? 
</P>
<P>
 We spent a lot of time on the sound as well as the lights. We're trying to 
provide a new kind of sound experience, so we brought, in essence, a mini radio 
station to the show. We've done about 20 shows so far and have had a good 
response to it. It's sort of like audio binoculars. The people bring Walkmans 
and put on the headphones to receive a slightly different mix -- the more 
powerful the better. And they still can feel the power from the speakers on the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 How did your arrival change Yes? 
</P>
<P>
 That's hard to say. At the time, I was working on an album as a solo project 
which ended up becoming "90125." I moved from London to L.A. and one of the 
companies that heard the tape was Atlantic, the Yes label. So Chris Squire and 
Alan White heard it, and so we put a band together, the three of us. It felt 
really good. As a solo artist, I would have had to put a band together, so what 
better rhythm section could I find than these guys? After we finished the 
album, Jon Anderson heard it, and ended up singing 70% of it. Since the band 
had broken up, there was no pressure, and just seemed very natural. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the numerous personnel changes, what keeps Yes going? 
</P>
<P>
 I've been here for 12 years. I think the high point for all of us was this new 
album. Yes can be very volatile; we never know how each project is going to 
turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 The critics have been unkind to the band over the years. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes has a slightly soft underbelly because we've been around for such a long 
time. And there's been a lot of personnel changes. People think we adhere to 
some sort of industry standard, but we don't. When "90125" came out, even the 
critics liked that one. On the other hand, there're Yes fans that don't want 
the band to change or progress in any way, so it's very difficult for us. 
Sometimes, we please the critics, other times the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are Yes songs so long? 
</P>
<P>
 They're not. Some of them are very short. The new single is only 3 minutes 
long. If you go back to Led Zeppelin, most of their songs were pretty long. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the band ever played South Africa? 
</P>
<P>
 No, we've never played there as Yes. Before I left, I was in a band called 
Rabbit which is the most popular band ever in South Africa. People want me to 
come back with Rabbit, not Yes. We'd like to play Russia sometime, we're 
working on something for maybe next year. 
</P>
<P>
 What is Yes music like to you? 
</P>
<P>
 It's ever-changing; that's the enduring thing about Yes. When you listen to a 
Yes album, you should listen to the whole thing through headphones with the 
lights off. You can't judge an album by a single song, it's like judging a book 
by only reading a single chapter. There's usually a unifying concept or 
cohesion to a Yes album. It's like when we play -- it's definitely a show. 
We're trying to get better and better at what we do. Details

SIGHTS; FRIENDLY FACES POPULATE EXHIBIT BY AREA PAINTER; 'PEOPLE OF OJAI: 
PORTRAIT OF A SMALL TOWN' IS AFFECTIONATE BUT FAILS TO REFLECT RESIDENTS' 
DIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As with many large-scale artistic projects, this one began on a humble scale 
and got out of hand. Ojai-based painter Alice Matzkin decided to do portraits 
of a few friends. One painting begat another as she "let the flow take me to 
the next painting." 
</P>
<P>
 A year and 27 subjects/paintings later, a show was born. "People of Ojai: 
Portrait of a Small Town" amply fills the Ojai Center for the Arts gallery, 
with its mosaic of kindly faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Ojai is a small town, but not Everytown U.S.A., by any means. The 
populace includes spiritualists of various stripes, gentle-person ranchers, 
urban refugees, and artists -- by profession and by amateur passion. But, wait, 
there's much more. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is an abidingly affectionate show, and while it may accurately 
represent part of the racial and socio-economic picture of Ojai's demographics, 
it also presents a light, limited overview of a town -- if the ambitious title 
is to be taken at all seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai, according to this exhibit, is a dream-world place full of smiling, 
apparently cultured white people (apart from a portrait of Grandfather Semu, an 
85-year-old Chumash medicine man born in the area). 
</P>
<P>
 Matzkin's portrait is not a broad-minded, objective slice of humanity in the 
sense that German photographer August Sander sought. It's all friendly fire 
here, a selective sampling of friends and neighbors. Glittery generalities can 
be dangerous: better to think of the show as "some people in Ojai: a sketch of 
a small town." 
</P>
<P>
 That cavil aside, Matzkin's sampling touches on several pillars of this 
rightfully proud community. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Steve Olsen stands in front of the celebrated Ojai Post Office tower, 
standing tall. DeWayne Boccali, Italian restaurateur, grins warmly for the 
painter, while Jeffrey San Marchi, editor/publisher of the Classic Voice, peers 
at us, harried, amid the informational rubble surrounding newspaper work. 
</P>
<P>
 Less pragmatic in function, perhaps -- but true to the heart of Ojai -- we 
find a muted portrait of Rosalind Raja, a friend of Beatrice Wood's, founder of 
the Happy Valley School, and a caretaker of Krishnamurti. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the down-to-earth celebrities on hand, Wood herself, 101 and counting, 
is found hunched over a potter's wheel in a piece that conveys her undimmed 
spirit. Potters Otto and Vivika Heino, seen in full figure, look the picture of 
love and health, and the denim garb seems to symbolize their work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the odd portrait of Larry Hagman, looking sinister under a 
jester's cap and gripping a scepter. Those menacing eyebrows look like 
something out of the actor's "Dallas" gestural repertoire rather than relating 
to his gently scatterbrained "I Dream of Jeannie" image. 
</P>
<P>
 Local landscape painter Bert Collins, viewed up close and very personal, 
flashes an infectious smile that seems to shiver and rattle the canvas. A rare, 
unsmiling visage in the show, Karen Guthman nurses her baby while gazing off 
sagaciously. Apparently, she symbolizes the Earth mother consulting heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Ness -- described as an artist, quilter, animal lover and astrologer -- 
appears as a gentle older woman, flanked by a pooch, awash in an aura of 
soulful tranquillity. We also see a nice portrait of Aaron Clement, the 
16-year-old whose liver transplant was made possible via local fund-raising 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Matzkin's figurative approach varies in degrees of realism versus 
expressionistic looseness. Her painting of Roy Patton looks oddly haunted, 
basking in unflattering yellow half-light and finished with brusque brush 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, an almost brutal roughness of surface compliments her 
portrait of Don Lawson. A clenched close-up view of the subject lighting a 
cigarette elicits the tough mettle of a weathered outdoorsman without a lot of 
time for idle grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 The good-natured and even benevolent gist of Matzkin's show might make it 
almost above, or outside the ken of, criticism. But, while enjoying the gallery 
of faces, some hobgoblin of political correctness compels you to wonder what a 
portrait of the other Ojai might look like. WHEN IN OJAI. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Ojai Studio Artists" is a suitably vague and apt title for the current crop 
of works up at the G. Childress Gallery. As Childress pointed out, most of the 
artists hail from within a five-mile radius of the gallery itself -- a clarion 
call for the aesthetic energies around the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, Childress' lively space has tended to host art with erotic content, 
or, last month, a show of cartoonists. This show, of two- and three- 
dimensional work, leans away from the anatomy and toward landscape. Nancy 
Whitman, Fran Hofses and Betty Saunders exert a free, light hand in natural 
settings, while Bert Collins (she of shivering smile in the Matzkin show) 
brings a prickly seaside realism to China Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 In 3-D, Gretchen Greenberg's "Evening Shrine" finds a faceless Madonna in 
painted redwood, and the aforementioned Heinos display exquisite ceramics. 
Sculptor John Farnham shows an appealing, rustic economy, and the gifted Mary 
Christie brings detailed Breughel scenes to porcelain life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai's matron saint, Beatrice Wood, shows two ceramic pieces, and, most 
interestingly, a wonderfully naive, child-like drawing, "Kid Laughing at Cops 
on the Highway." There it is: this centenarian is the perennial kid, laughing 
at mortality and orthodoxy on life's highway. INN SHOW 
</P>
<P>
 To see more of Wood's two-dimensional handiwork, in fact, work with erotic 
content, stop by the Ojai Valley Inn. There, in the pastel ambience of the 
lobby -- an almost surreal juxtaposition -- hang several of Wood's small 
illustrations, dating from the late '70s, for a book of Anais Nin stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood's spare, linear depictions of female nudes hover in that delicate domain 
between innocence and ripe sexuality -- a domain that Wood seems keenly attuned 
to. For further provocations from Wood, see her drawing show now at the 
Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard. Details

GETTING STARTED ON THE RIGHT FOOT; GOAL OF YOUTH TRACK CLUBS IS TO PROMOTE 
POSITIVE ATTITUDE, COMPETITIVE EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Ward is in his first summer as a coach with the West Valley Eagles Track 
Club, but it hasn't taken the 30-year-old Duarte resident long to establish a 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward believes that keeping kids on track and keeping kids on the track are one 
and the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has had ups and downs in life, myself included," said Ward, a 
Pasadena High graduate who was an assistant track coach at Muir last spring. "I 
see the way some kids are headed and I try to get them to walk that straight 
line. You do that by encouraging them and keeping them motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to get them to have as much fun as possible so they stay in the 
mode of wanting to do positive things." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Valley Eagles are one of several youth track and field clubs in 
Southern California that provide young athletes with the opportunity to compete 
on the local, regional and national level. The Pasadena Running Roses and the 
L.A. Jets are two of the other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, several athletes from the San Gabriel Valley, including five from 
reigning state champion Muir, will compete in the Junior Olympics at 
Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Jucori Tryon will compete in the 400 meters and the 400 and 1,600 relays, 
DeAngelo Steward is entered in the long jump and relays, and Devin Myrick will 
run the 100 meters and the relays for the West Valley Eagles. Muir's Obea Moore 
will run the 400 and relays for the L.A. Jets and Derrick Evans will compete in 
the triple jump for the Pasadena Running Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinter Mike Russell of Rowland is also among the area athletes who qualified 
for the Junior Olympics with their performances at a regional meet two weeks 
ago in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experience these kids get during the summer is invaluable once the 
regular high school season starts," Muir track Coach Clyde Turner said. "It 
allows them to see where they are in their particular age group and where they 
stand against the best in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the Junior Olympics, the club has been staging workouts 
four days a week at sites throughout Southern California. Mt. San Antonio 
College, L.A. Southwest College, Pasadena High, even a park in Manhattan Beach 
are places Ward has overseen workouts that attract some of the nation's most 
talented high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use different sites so it doesn't take its toll on the kids or parents 
from one particular area," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, competitors bound for Gainesville went through their paces 
during afternoon workouts in preparation for the Florida climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it's going to be hot in Florida, so we want to get them used to 
running in the heat," Ward said. "There haven't been too many complaints. They 
can't always just practice for the race. Sometimes they have to train for the 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, who owns a company that rents studio sound equipment to dance clubs, 
oversees the intermediate (ages 15-16) and young men's (17-18) divisions of the 
West Valley Eagles. He said the summer brings out the best in many of his 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the summer, you find kids that really want to run, that come out because 
they really want to do it," he said. "That's different from the school year 
where, a lot of times, kids think you're making them run." 
</P>
<P>
 The summer also is beneficial because it allows Southland athletes to get to 
know each other as people rather than rivals. Without the tension associated 
with competition on the high school level, friendships are born. 
</P>
<P>
 "They compete against these guys all year, but they don't know who they are -- 
they never get a chance to become friends," Ward said. "I tell the kids that 
when they go off to college, they're going to meet people from all over the 
world, so they better learn to get along now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward is confident that his team will perform well in the Junior Olympics and 
that the runners will continue to be successful during the high school season. 
His hope is that they will use their ability on the track to make a run at 
success in all aspects of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to stress that academics are more important than athletics," Ward said. 
"I just try to tell the kids that this (track) is something you can stick with 
for a long time if you stay on the right side of the fence."

 Lineman Pene Talamaiveo of Ganesha, running back Rodney Sermons of Bishop Amat 
and defensive back Kenny Haslip of Muir will participate for the South team 
Saturday night in the 43rd annual Shrine all-star football game at Citrus 
College. 
</P>

 The West, coached by Don MacKinnon of Arroyo, won for the second year in a 
row, the first time in the history of the series that it has done so. The East 
leads the series, 8-5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The East's Justin Ventura, an all-state kicker from Claremont High, missed a 
50-yard field-goal attempt with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 West quarterback Gabe Agredano of Arroyo completed 15 of 25 passes for 192 
yards and two touchdowns, but had three passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 East quarterback Miguel Meriwether of West Covina completed nine of 23 passes 
for 153 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 50 yards and two touchdowns 
in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A football coaching clinic open to coaches of all levels will be staged 
Saturday at Pasadena City College.

 If you don't believe that Pog mania has hit Ventura County, come around to 
Scottie's Sports Cards & Collectibles in Simi Valley when the store holds its 
monthly tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes as many as 80 kids show up, ready to hunker down on the floor with a 
stack of Pogs in one hand and a "slammer" in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place is just packed -- it's a scene," said Richard Simons, who owns the 
store with his wife, Monica. So many kids want to play that they have to take a 
number and wait outside until it's their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you're still wondering, just what is a Pog? It's simply a 
silver-dollar-sized cardboard milk bottle cap. Just like the ones from the old 
days of glass milk bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 The game has its roots in the Depression when kids stacked the caps face up or 
face down and tried to flip them over by walloping them with a "slammer," a 
heavier disc. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was revived in Hawaii about two years ago when a teacher got some 
milk covers from a dairy and showed the game to her students. As the game 
caught on, the most popular discs came from a drink made from passion fruit, 
orange and guava -- hence the name Pog. Since then, the game has spread to the 
mainland, into Canada and down to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Simons said his store sells thousands of Pogs every week to elementary and 
middle schoolchildren, as well as some to adults. The colorful discs start at 
25 cents apiece, while the slammers run from $1 to $6. They have pictures and 
words stamped on them -- everything from "Howard Stern for President" to a 
skull and crossbones to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the hottest thing going," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The store bought its first supply of Pogs a year ago and began hosting the 
tournaments in the fall. The next tournament will be at 11 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 To play, kids pay 25 cents and receive four Pogs to stack up on the floor of 
the store. The Pogs they flip become theirs to keep, and the winners of each 
round go on to another round until a final winner emerges. The prize is more 
Pogs. 
</P>
<P>
 This month's winner was 13-year-old Adam Crowder, who took home a set of 
Beavis and Butt-head Pogs to add to his collection of more than 300 discs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've won most of them," he said. "I've won a lot and I've bought a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the controversy over Pogs. When kids began taking them to school 
to play during recess, they proved to be too disruptive, and many schools in 
Ventura County have now banned them -- some claiming that it was a form of 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 But that apparently hasn't stopped the popularity of the game. Newbury Park 
Sportscards is holding its third tournament at 10:30 a.m. July 9 at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids pay 25 cents to play, and they receive three Pogs and a slammer, 
according to store owner Pam Rhodes. The winner emerges through elimination 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have parents come in and take pictures," she said. But the game is still 
fairly new and some parents come into the store wanting to know just what a Pog 
is. They are sold mainly at sport card shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The local tournaments are partly the inspiration of a Simi Valley couple, Tim 
and Carol Whitcomb, who jumped on the Pog craze last summer and began 
manufacturing the milk caps, along with other makers of the discs. From their 
home, they've already printed more than 1 million Pogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're growing astronomically," Carol Whitcomb said. "We've got wall-to-wall 
Pogs." The couple, who operate the business with her sister, are looking for a 
business location. 
</P>
<P>
 They sell the caps to about 60 stores in Ventura County and the Los Angeles 
area, and they help the outlets run the tournaments. They've even organized 
them as far away as Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there skill involved in playing the game? "I've seen a 4-year-old beat a 
16-year-old," she said. "It's a little bit of luck and a little bit of skill."

ON THE ROAD: URBAN SPRAWL SOURS GROWER ON LEMON GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lemons were here as long as anybody can remember. That includes Ernie 
Nichols, who has been farming this 42-acre parcel for 64 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield is quite good: always 1,000 boxes an acre annually, requisite for 
profitability, and usually more. One year, Nichols packed 1,400 boxes an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was something," he says. "That's real profit, and I don't mind telling 
you so." 
</P>
<P>
 But the good times are over here at the Nichols Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, just north of the Santa Paula Freeway at Kimball Road, used to 
be 50 acres in size. Through the 1980s, however, government agencies decided 
they needed peripheral slices of the orchards for the public good. So they'd 
condemn and buy a piece to widen Kimball Road. A piece for a bike path. Two 
pieces for an expanded interchange of the freeway at Kimball Road. Yet another 
for the widening of Telegraph Road, to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, a housing development went in on the west border of the property. 
Same thing on the north side. Same thing to the east. To the south, four lanes 
of the 126, sealing off the Nichols orchards for good, entombing it in a sea of 
homes with swing sets, RVs, patio umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while everybody was happy. An orchard surrounded by houses is an 
unwitting courtyard -- a piece of shiny green luck for those who throw open the 
bedroom window and smell lemons. And Ernie Nichols still packed fruit at a rate 
that always turned a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't last. Things quickly shook out as they do when tidy homes abut 
farmland, when Sears lawn mowers roll alongside John Deer insecticide spray 
equipment. Things in lemon heaven go sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids do what kids are supposed to do -- they sneak in at night to explore. 
Sometimes, they also do what they're not supposed to do and tinker with valves 
that regulate the irrigation systems, leaving Nichols with a flooded orchard. 
Or sometimes, trespassers climb the trees, crack branches or fall and crack 
their own limbs -- in falling, one actually hit an electric line, got burned 
from it, and sued. Periodically, Nichols hires all-night watchmen to keep 
people out and their lawyers away. 
</P>
<P>
 More problematic are the spraying operations, which include aerial 
applications. Nichols has them under control, he says wryly, "as far as lemons 
are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 What he means is that he manages not to over-spray the orchards, ensuring that 
neighboring yards go unaffected, and he strictly adheres to keeping people -- 
including his workers -- out of the fenced-in orchards for four days following 
the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean someone or someone's pet won't find a way in and, in the 
trespassing, cover themselves in toxic chemicals. And get sick and hold Ernie 
Nichols responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about it a lot," says Nichols. "It didn't used to be that you had to 
worry much about it. But today, especially when we're spraying, I worry about 
it a lot. I don't want anyone hurt. And I don't want anyone coming after me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols pauses a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love those orchards. I'd love to keep farming them. But the truth is, it's 
just not farmland anymore. It's where people live. It's where Ventura expanded 
to. Hell, Ventura's expanded beyond me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Nichols appeared recently before the Ventura City Planning Commission 
and was turned down in his request to build houses where his lemon trees now 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, Nichols has optioned out his entire 42 acres to a developer who 
proposes to bulldoze the property and build 227 fancy Victorian-styled 
single-family homes -- but the planners chose to earmark this year's precious 
few new-home allotments to competing projects, one of them a mobile home park 
on Telephone Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, appearing in a medium-blue suit that matched his penetrating 
aquamarine eyes, told the planners plainly: "I'd prefer to keep farming it. But 
it's gotten impossible. So I ask you to consider this." He also gently reminded 
them that in 1989 the very same commission acknowledged, by vote, the eastward 
momentum of development by making his land and much of the land surrounding it 
suitable for conversion to residential development. Indeed, his land is not 
even within a designated greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Nichols, a trim and sharp 86, finds himself in a Catch-22. He's one of the 
last of the old-line ranchers to give in to the development pressure that has 
already eclipsed and transformed his property, yet he's told to take a hike, go 
home and tend those lemons, keep that lifetime of equity buried in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think Ernie Nichols would be very upset. But he's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Nichols knows one key thing: It's the Ventura City Council that makes 
the final decision on who gets to build houses. And the council in recent years 
has listened to the Planning Commission about as well as Ralph listened to 
Alice in the "Honeymooners." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it's hard to read," says Nichols. "It goes to the council late this 
month, and all these projects are viewed again. People spar for position. And, 
you know, anything can happen."

FASHION; UNCOMMON YOKES FREE ENTREPRENEUR'S SPIRIT; FORMER HORSE TRAINER FORCED 
TO SWITCH CAREERS INDULGES HER CREATIVE INSTINCTS AND FINDS HER WESTERN DESIGNS 
HAVE GREAT APPEAL.

 Following hunches is not for everyone. There's a lot to be said for time 
clocks, paychecks and group health care -- they keep casseroles on the table 
and tires on the car. 
</P>
<P>
 But right-brain people don't deal with life that way. They doodle on old 
envelopes, stare at sunlight patterns and venture where left-brainers would 
fear to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion design has lots of right-brainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Proctor is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Her early career was breaking and training horses; but recently horses became 
luxuries for many. So she switched to line inspection of medical appliances, a 
career that left yearning in the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration came during evenings at Western dance clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept looking at everybody wearing these clothes, and I thought, 'I could 
make something like that,' " said the soon-to-be entrepreneur. Her sewing 
experience was limited to curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance said, "Why don't you give it a shot; you can make my daughter 
an outfit for a fashion show." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? thought Proctor. She borrowed a sewing machine, and made up a cotton 
blouse and tiered skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the push that led to flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend's daughter "got first place in Western wear in the state finals," 
Proctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the California Gold Coast Models show. 
</P>
<P>
 With this beginning, Proctor went on to make more outfits, relying less on 
patterns and more and more on intuition. She started creating uncommon yoke 
patterns that caught attention. She also combined contrasting fabrics, such as 
organza with cotton, denim with lace. She has teamed bright Southwest motifs of 
blue, brown and purple with sheer gauze panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she launched her business seven months ago, one bride has worn her lace 
and satin creation, and another has placed an order for a summer gown. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dance wear is shown at the Longhorn in Oak View; but Proctor finds most of 
her customers at the Splash nightclub in Simi Valley, where she appears weekly 
to introduce new designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just grab people and send them out on the floor wearing my stuff," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Robinson, leader of the band Caught Red Handed, wears the shirts 
regularly, and the producer of Country Music World has taken an interest in the 
clothing, and wants samples. 
</P>
<P>
 This puts Proctor on the horns of a dilemma. If she is going to outfit bands, 
her business may soon pay all the rent, but she will need to hire help to put 
the clothes together -- and she's not keen on delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way success works. Once you're holding the trapeze, you need to 
catch the next bar that swings toward you. The first leap is the hardest; 
challenge gets easier as time goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor remembers when she sat down to produce the original dance dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death when I made that outfit," she says with a smile, "I 
couldn't read a pattern; I couldn't do anything."

EARTHWATCH: FIRM SELLS SEEDS TO KEEP THE GOOD BUGS AROUND; RINCON-VITOVA 
INSECTARIES OF VENTURA PROMOTES CROPS THAT SERVE AS FOOD AND BREEDING GROUNDS 
FOR FRIENDLY PREDATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Planting a crop for the express purpose of attracting insects may sound like a 
crazy idea, but that's exactly what the people at Rincon-Vitova Insectaries 
Inc. of Ventura are recommending to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, which became famous for breeding and marketing beneficial insects 
used by farmers to protect against crop-damaging bugs, is now promoting an 
additional process, one that further reduces the need for chemical agricultural 
sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jan Dietrick, general manager of the firm, the idea is to plant 
what she called "refuge crops," which serve as food and breeding grounds for 
the friendly predators. This keeps the beneficial bugs hanging around, 
defending farmers' interests. Farmers get the equivalent of a permanent army 
supply of guard dogs and guard-dog houses. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-pound bag of mixed seeds, trade-named "Beneficial Blend," will grow an 
acre's worth of rye, barley, clover, vetch, alfalfa, etc., adjacent to or among 
a farmer's regular orchards or row crops. The blossoms -- all appearing at 
different times -- are a treat for the good bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrick explained the odd contradiction in marketing these seeds right 
alongside the containers of beneficial insects. "We're a bit unique. We promote 
the whole habitat. It does hurt our sales of insects that we sell the means for 
the farmer to attract and breed his own insects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still plenty of farmers buying beneficial bugs from the firm. 
After all, growing refuge crops takes acreage away from cash crops. And 
Dietrick notes with a smile, "there are still billions of acres throughout the 
world which can be transitioned from chemical farming to sustainable farming." 
</P>
<P>
 Rincon-Vitova is perhaps the oldest, but it is not the only firm supplying 
beneficial insects to a worldwide market of progressive farmers. The process, 
using natural means to produce bugs and their habitats, allows other companies 
and the individual farmers to do this everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietrick's father, Deke, the founder of the firm and a respected expert in 
this branch of agriculture, has a thriving consultant practice throughout 
California. The biggest names in agribusiness -- Dole, Paramount and Gallo -- 
are making the transition to non-chemical growing, using both beneficial bugs 
and refuge crops, according to Dietrick senior, whose services are often sought 
by the operators of the Gallo family-owned vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 This trend has created several kinds of new businesses. Consumer interest in 
fruits and vegetables produced with minimal chemical use is increasing. Home 
gardeners are adopting these growing methods and ordering beneficial insects 
and special seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department of Agriculture and the University of California are 
finding programs to expand this technique as a way to restore the health of the 
nation's topsoil and the health of people who work that soil. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall in San Francisco, the leaders of this trend in agribusiness, 
including the Dietricks, will convene to discuss "Bioremediation: 
Decontaminating the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes called "The World Series of Organic Gardening," this event, held 
annually for the last five years, is staged by a Santa Fe, N.M., firm called 
Seeds of Change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Replicative"is the word Jan Dietrick uses when talking about the conference, 
the seeds and the bugs. "We face the same questions a good doctor faces -- 
should we promote drugs or something the patient can do, something from nature, 
a healthy biological lifestyle?" Details 
</P>

SHOP TALK; CRAFTY BARGAINS; IF YOU'RE PLANNING DO-IT-YOURSELF GIFTS OR 
ACCESSORIES, THE SAVINGS SHOULD BEGIN WHEN YOU PURCHASE SUPPLIES. 
</P>

<P>
 We have suggested before that the cheapest way to come up with gifts, party 
accessories, clothing and other items is to make them yourself. Drop by a craft 
store and stock up on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what we suggested. But what we haven't done yet is offer help in 
finding the best buys at these stores. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been three months since Michaels Arts and Craft Store opened its huge 
doors at Ventura's Donlan Plaza. And it's made a pretty big splash. How big? 
Well, Donlan Plaza is now Michaels Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week we ventured into the rather intimidating store -- have a good, 
healthy breakfast before you plow your way through. We also dropped by Ben 
Franklin Crafts and Framing in Oxnard and House of Fabrics, also in Oxnard, to 
see how the three places compare in supply and price. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things we should mention right off the top. First, feel free to ask for 
help at all of these stores, and at any specialized arts and crafts stores. The 
folks tend to be pretty happy to lend advice. Also, the three stores we visited 
all offer craft classes if you're really planning to throw yourself into some 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, look for sales. At House of Fabrics almost everything in the store 
will be 40% off this Friday and Saturday. And Michaels has a big 25%-plus sale 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, all three stores are loaded with Christmas craft items. If this is the 
year you're finally going to make those holiday gifts, now's the time to start 
shopping for the materials. There are a lot of discounted items around. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for the generalities. Let's move on to some random specifics. We'll 
start with eyes. Those glue-on black-and-white movable eyes used for dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 A bag of 144 10-millimeter eyes from Westrim Crafts was $2.29 (or about 1.5 
cents per eye) at Michaels, a bag of 100 10 millimeter eyes from Fibre Craft 
was $1.89 (or about 1.9 cents per eye) at Ben Franklin, and a bag of 14 10 
millimeter eyes made by the BTC company was 49 cents (or 3.5 cents per) at 
House of Fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone needs 144 eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 In other facial areas, cotton-ball size pompons make great noses. A pack of 
two Westrim pompons at Michaels was 33 cents. A pack of two by Fibre Craft was 
39 cents at Ben Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 On to other crafts. We looked at several kinds of yarn. The familiar Red Barn 
brand of four-ply acrylic fiber yarn was $2.49 for eight ounces of solid color 
at House of Fabrics and $2.79 at Ben Franklin. Sixty yards of Aunt Lydia's 100% 
polyester, three-ply Craft & Rug yarn was 99 cents at Ben Franklin and 
Michaels, and 89 cents at House of Fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 We also looked at some tools of the craft trade. An eight-inch wooden 
embroidery hoop was 89 cents at Ben Franklin, 69 cents at House of Fabrics, and 
99 cents at Michaels. A five-inch pair of Fiskar brand craft scissors was $7.99 
at Michaels, and an eight-inch pair was $6.99 at Ben Franklin. We found Rotary 
Fabric Cutters from OLFA for $9.99 at both Michaels and the House of Fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 As for various other accessories: 
</P>
<P>
 A 1 1/2-quart bag of decorative Woodland Scenics lichen was $3.98 at Michaels 
and at Ben Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 4.54 gram bags of Mill Hill Glass Seed Beads was $1.20 at Ben 
Franklin and $1.49 at Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 BeDazzler Rhinestone and Fashion Studs were $3.99 per package at Michaels and 
House of Fabrics, and $2.99 at Ben Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 Now don't expect us to practice what we preach. We're buying all our stuff 
pre-made, and preferably with no assembly required.

PROFILE; RACE OF A LIFETIME; EMMY KLASSEN PLANS TO PEDAL 2,931 MILES FROM 
IRVINE TO SAVANNAH, GA., IN ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ENDURANCE EVENTS IN THE 
COUNTRY.

 Six days from now, Emmy Klassen will straddle a bicycle outside a Holiday Inn 
in Irvine. Around her people will hurry about, occupied by important matters. 
Banners will sag in the morning quiet. There will be a final few words of 
encouragement, only half heard. Klassen will lift her head and peer into a 
distance she can't see, her mind's eye reeling through scrubby deserts, 
mountain passes and sweeping seas of dust-brown grass and two-lane roads that 
turn into blackness spotted by fireflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wish Klassen luck. On Wednesday, the 35-year-old obstetrics nurse from Ojai 
will join 30 other riders in the Race Across America (RAAM), cycling's annual 
paean to grit and mule-headedness, and arguably the toughest endurance event in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly events like the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon (140 miles of swimming, 
cycling and running) and the Western States Endurance Run (100 miles of hellish 
Sierra Nevada trail) test mettle and muscle. But these dilettantes are home 
soaking their muscles by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's RAAM covers 2,931 miles from Irvine to Savannah, Ga. The women's 
winner is expected to finish in about nine days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say the race doesn't even start until you hit the Mississippi," Klassen 
said. "That's 2,000 miles." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Klassen's first -- and perhaps only -- RAAM. Like most events in 
our lives, Klassen came to the RAAM through a combination of fate and 
inclination. For several years she had dabbled in triathlons. One day she 
arrived at a group training ride to find a new face, that of Premananda Childs. 
He had done the RAAM. 
</P>
<P>
 After several rides with Klassen, Childs, a 49-year-old homeopath from Ojai, 
noticed that Klassen's strengths matched the requirements of the RAAM -- the 
longer she went, the stronger she got. Almost immediately he began to put the 
bug in her ear, namely by dragging Klassen on longer and longer rides. Their 
first experiment, a 350-mile round-trip loop from Ojai to Los Osas proved a 
success. Their second test proved a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Klassen entered last October's Furnace Creek 508 bicycle race with few 
expectations. Yes, the race -- 508 miles from Valencia to Twenty Nine Palms, a 
large parts of it through Death Valley -- was a qualifier for the 1994 RAAM, 
but Klassen gave little thought to that. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify she would have to win or finish within spitting distance of the 
women's winner, and she had no illusions of doing either. Most riders make 
numerous tries before they qualify to ride the RAAM, and many more never do. 
</P>
<P>
 So it came as some surprise when -- 400 miles into the race and feeling strong 
-- she realized she was going to win. Pulling up next to her escort van, 
Klassen grinned at her crew members inside. Anybody have plans this coming 
July? Shortly thereafter a second thought occurred to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 10 minutes later I was like, 'Oh God, how am I going to get out of 
this?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, Klassen already had a few things going for her before she turned to 
long-distance cycling. Most important, at least in terms of RAAM, she was no 
stranger to hard work and long hours. For the past 10 years she has worked as 
an obstetrics nurse at Ojai Valley Hospital -- the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift -- 
while raising a son, now 13, as a single mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of practice at sleep deprivation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This will stand her in good stead as she wheels across the country. Time being 
important, RAAM riders waste as little of it as possible. During the 1983 race, 
RAAM rider Michael Shermer rode from Santa Monica to Haigler, Neb. -- 1,500 
miles and nearly five days -- without sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time his competitors were strung out behind him, but Shermer had other 
concerns. Convinced his support crew was a group of aliens intent on killing 
him, he refused to accept any nourishment -- how easy to poison a banana -- and 
sporadically quizzed his enemies about intimate details of his past, things 
that only close Earth friends would know. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors have since decided that sleep is important, but they still allot a 
minimum amount of time to it and to other biological essentials. Klassen will 
do most of her eating on the bike -- mostly energy drinks, plus a few solid 
foods like pasta and energy bars. She plans to sleep three to four hours a day, 
going down somewhere around 2 a.m. and rising at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 This still may not be enough to fend off hallucinations. Not long ago, Klassen 
talked to Muffy Ritz, the second place woman at last year's RAAM. "She said she 
saw knickknacks," Klassen said. "Like someone was having a yard sale along the 
side of the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Knickknacks are a decided improvement on what really does lurk on the 
roadside. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night in the desert, snakes and tarantulas come up and sit on the side of 
the road because it's still warm," Childs said. "You kind of have to hop your 
bike over them." Childs will serve as Klassen's coach during the RAAM, riding 
in one of three escort vehicles that will trail her throughout the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ugh!" Klassen said with a shudder. "I hate snakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's virtually impossible to predict what will happen in a race that 
traverses California, Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee and 
Georgia, Klassen hopes to log about 300 miles a day and finish the RAAM in 
between 10 and 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 She would like to wheel into the parking lot of the Savannah Hyatt before Aug. 
8. There, her father and her son will be waiting to help her celebrate, not 
just her finish, but her 36th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get there in time to have birthday cake," she said. "Then I'll 
probably sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this raises an obvious question. Even Klassen isn't entirely sure why 
she's doing the RAAM. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has their own goals, things they want to do in life," she said. 
"Sometimes you're afraid, so you never reach for them. This is what I've 
picked, but I can't give you a reason why." 
</P>
<P>
 Klassen smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll have a better idea when I'm done."

T-BOND RALLY IS SET BACK; DOW FALLS 21; MARKETS: YIELDS SOAR AS GREENSPAN'S 
REMARKS DEFLATE INVESTORS' HOPES THAT THE FED WAS LESS WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The biggest rally in the Treasury market in three months suffered a major 
setback Wednesday after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan delivered 
a stern warning that more interest rate increases may be needed to rein in 
inflation. Stocks also followed bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields soared and prices plunged as Greenspan's remarks deflated hopes 
among fixed-income investors that the central bank had become less nervous 
about the U.S. economy's rate of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the government's main 30-year bond rose to 7.54% from 7.46% on 
Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 7/8 point, 
or $8.75 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks followed bond prices lower, with the Dow Jones 
industrial average finishing down 21.04 points at 3,727.27. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first of two Congressional appearances this week, Greenspan told Senate 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee members that interest rates may 
need to move higher to ensure that inflation remains in check. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an open question whether our actions to date have been sufficient to 
head off inflationary pressures and thus maintain favorable trends in the 
economy," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, the Fed has pushed up short-term interest rates by 1.25 
percentage points in four steps between February and May. Although the 
fixed-income markets have expected the central bank to push up rates again, 
analysts said, Greenspan's aggressive tone caught many investors off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The view is he is coming out slightly more hawkish than he was expected to," 
said Dana Johnson, head of market analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff abruptly reversed one of the biggest market rallies since the bond 
market turned bearish in early February, when the Fed initiated the first of 
the four interest-rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices had jumped sharply since last Tuesday, driving down yields more 
than one-quarter percentage point following news on the economy suggesting 
there was no serious threat of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But it appeared the effect of those suggestions was undermined by Greenspan's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The tumbling government bond market, however, did not deter California from 
selling tax-free securities. 
</P>
<P>
 California sold $4 billion in short-term notes Wednesday in the first stage of 
a $7-billion borrowing. The tax-free notes, known as revenue anticipation 
warrants, are short-term securities issued in anticipation of future revenue 
such as taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The California sale came just days after major Wall Street credit-rating 
agencies downgraded the state's debt. The majority of the notes sold Wednesday 
were backed by an innovative financing plan that reassured investors as to the 
state's ability to pay money owed on the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, many stocks were buffeted by quarterly earnings reports and 
weaker recommendations by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 2 to 1 
on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 268.04 million shares, 
compared to 251.54 million for the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE composite index fell 1.19 to 249.70. The Nasdaq index of mostly 
smaller issues fell 6.55 to 712.77. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 
dropped 2.26 to 451.60. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was a shakeout day," said Don Hays, director of investment strategy at 
Wheat First Butcher Singer. "We think people are quick to sell on any news." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said the stock market frequently overreacts to Greenspan's 
statements and that stocks could well be in for a rise to recoup the day's 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Compaq Computer Corp.'s second quarter earnings were in line with forecasts, 
but some analysts said its product inventories were high. The stock dropped 1 
3/4 to 31 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software maker Sybase Inc. lost 8 1/2 to 39 3/4 despite reporting a rise in 
earnings. Bear Stearns lowered its rating to "neutral" from "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Pfizer dropped 2 to 60 1/8 after reporting higher profits but with the 
expectation that its 1994 earnings will come in toward the bottom of Wall 
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Illinois Central Corp. fell 1 3/4 to 30 5/8 after the company said it 
planned to buy Kansas City Southern Industries' Kansas City Southern Railroad. 
Goldman Sachs downgraded Illinois Central, saying the deal will dilute its 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mid Atlantic Medical Services fell 6 1/8 to 41 3/4 after an analyst cut the 
stock to "neutral" from "buy." Mid Atlantic had reported sharply higher 
earnings earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alcoa fell 1 3/8 to 80 5/8 after Oppenheimer & Co. downgraded its opinion of 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * USAir, which reported a rare profit for its second quarter, rose 1/2 to 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * AMR fell 1 1/2 to 61 3/8. The American Airlines parent company said its 
profit after a special gain was $1.49 per share, well below analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * DSC Communications, which reported sharply higher second quarter earnings, 
rose 5/8 to 23 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sifco Industries gained 1/4 to close at 3 after reporting that it had 
reversed its loss of a year ago to earn $17,000 for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets were mixed. Stocks finished broadly lower in London, with the 
Financial Times 100-share average falling 14.1 points to 3,077.2; Frankfurt's 
30-share DAX average closed 9.86 points higher at 2,138.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei average ended up 5.60 points at 20,780.76, and Mexico City's 
Bolsa index fell 44 points to 2,210.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar fell slightly against key currencies, following the bond 
and stock markets.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: THE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER ARE OVER FOR AN OLD STRAND 
STANDBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TO THE BIG POUND IN THE SKY: Hermosa Beach lost one of its most beloved 
residents last week when Dave Dog, the free-spirited Labrador retriever who 
hung out along the Strand for more than a decade, lost his battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless skaters, cyclists and joggers knew the yellow retriever as the beach 
pooch who sat contentedly atop a brick wall at 21st Court and the Strand and 
watched as life rolled by. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Dave would join strangers for walks along the popular path. He also 
liked to swim. Sometimes he even followed surfers into the waves that pound the 
shore only 200 yards from where he used to hang out in Hermosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Dave's death, at age 11, scores of well-wishers have visited his owner, 
Carole Prenter, to offer condolences and remember good times with the 
retriever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some just break down and cry," said Prenter, an English teacher at Mira Costa 
High School in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning last week, Prenter found a new pooch, named Summer, attached to 
Dave's old leash in front of her home. An anonymous note said that Summer, a 2 
1/2-year-old retriever, had been abused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably keep her," she said. But Summer, she said, "will never replace 
Dave." 
</P>

<P>
 STILL NO TO NAFTA: Last fall, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor tried 
his best to persuade Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) to support the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though President Clinton himself called her as the vote approached, 
she never did. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pact signed, sealed and delivered, it looks like they've let bygones 
be bygones. Last week, Kantor was stumping for Harman at a $500-a-plate 
fund-raiser in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enthusiasm for the congresswoman to come back," he said after the 
luncheon. "I wouldn't be here otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor noted Harman was an early opponent of NAFTA, even during her 1992 
election race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's opponent, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks, issued a 
press release on Kantor's visit, calling it "extremely ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 "One person endorsed the pact and supported free trade, the other spearheaded 
the fight against free trade," Brooks said. "Either Kantor or Harman is very 
hypocritical." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, said it was the pact -- not free trade -- that she opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends can disagree," Harman said. "My opposition was we should do a better 
NAFTA, not that we shouldn't have a trade agreement."

 OUTTA GAS?: In the 1991 film "Grand Canyon," the main character is harassed by 
gang members after his car breaks down in a neighborhood near the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, hoping to buck the negative image on screen and elsewhere in the media, 
the Forum, Hollywood Park and other members of Inglewood's business community 
have kicked in more than $600,000 to start a program to help stranded motorists 
on the city's major streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new Mobile Assistance Program, drivers in a fleet of three 
customized Ford Explorers will rescue stranded motorists. The trucks are 
equipped with cellular phones, jumper cables, a gallon of gasoline, a gallon of 
water, a two-way radio, flares, a Thomas Bros. map guide and a "slim jim," used 
for breaking into locked cars when the keys are on the wrong side of a locked 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was created in part to make visitors feel safe, said Truman 
Jacques, the city's communications director. "There is a perception of crime in 
Southern California, and Inglewood is no exception," Jacques said.

 CUP OF SAND: They couldn't beat 'em on the grass, but that didn't stop several 
U.S. soccer team players from competing against former Brazilian professionals 
on the sands of Hermosa Beach last week. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 fans filled an outdoor stadium constructed next to the Hermosa 
Beach pier to watch as U.S. soccer stars Cobi Jones and Eric Wynalda, as well 
as "Melrose Place" TV star Andrew Shue, played the 36-minute game. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a brief break so a Brazilian player could put on socks to protect 
his feet from the hot sand, the play was fast and furious. 
</P>
<P>
 But the result was the same near the surf as it was on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil won, 5-3. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>

 "Now and again, I'll hear a truck that sounds like his and I'll think, 'Oh, my

WANTED: 4-LEGGED REPLACEMENT FOR FAMED POLICE DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates police are searching for a four-legged officer to replace 
Bandit, the hillside city's award-winning police dog whose popularity spawned a 
baseball-style trading card. 
</P>
<P>
 The German shepherd's back legs were paralyzed during surgery in April to 
relieve back pain, and he was given little chance of returning to police work. 
He now uses an apparatus with wheels to move around. 
</P>
<P>
 So it came as no surprise when Police Chief Gary Johansen said the department 
began searching for a new dog last week. Johansen plans to make a formal 
request to the City Council for a new dog next month. Mayor James Nyman 
expected the council to support the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in our community love Bandit . . . and they really love the idea of 
having a police dog," Nyman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates for buying a new dog run from $5,000 to $10,000, and training the 
dog and officer would cost another $1,500. The yearly budget to maintain a dog 
is $20,000 to $25,000, given expenses such as food, veterinarian bills and 
extra pay for a canine unit officer, Johansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Palos Verdes Peninsula is not known for its high crime rates, 
Johansen said a police dog is important because it can search large areas -- 
such as fields and homes -- in minutes, while officers may take hours. City 
officials also maintain that a police dog is good for public relations, often 
taken on visits to schoolchildren and to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandit, whose trading card touts his gold, silver and bronze medals at the 
California Police Olympics, was often used without charge by other police 
departments because of mutual aid agreements and because there was not enough 
work in Palos Verdes Esates to keep him sharp, said Lt. Ed Jaakola. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates residents make no bones about their support for a police 
dog. A local group, Supporting Residents for the Canine Program, has already 
raised more than $3,000 for Bandit's replacement, said businessman Fred Lami(, 
who is involved in fund-raising efforts. Lami said another $3,000 has been 
pledged. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the group's goal is to raise enough money for two dogs, which the 
department once had. 
</P>
<P>
 Lami added that police dogs are not only crime-solvers but wage-earners. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, police dogs may net a department money by helping find drugs. A 
controversial forfeiture law allows police to seize items bought with money 
earned through drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaakola said Bandit has taken part in drug raids, but he could not pinpoint 
how much money those busts have netted the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost synonymous with Bandit was his handler, Officer Joe Hall. But Johansen 
said he will first consider requests from all interested officers before 
choosing the next canine officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, an official with local animal rights groups said the groups do not 
object to using dogs for police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least if they're well-treated, we certainly couldn't object from a humane 
point of view," said Madeline Bernstein, executive director of the Los Angeles 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Southern California 
Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she would oppose dog training methods that emphasize cruelty and 
punishment.

STATE REGULATORS SEIZE DEBT-RIDDEN BANK OF SAN PEDRO; BANKING: REAL ESTATE 
SLUMP AND BAD LOANS ARE BLAMED FOR THE FAILURE OF THE HARBOR AREA'S SOLE 
INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. 
</P>

<P>
 With regulators knocking at their door, Bank of San Pedro executives tried 
time and again to stay afloat. They sold real estate assets, raised money in a 
stock offering, even collected a settlement from a sunken ship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all too late. State banking officials seized the financial institution 
last week, shutting the doors on San Pedro's only independent financial 
institution. The bank had been losing $200,000 a month, and its operations lost 
more than $4 million since 1992, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Bank of Signal Hill acquired $22.1 million of the Bank of San Pedro's 
$123.4 million in assets, including two of the failed institution's branches in 
San Pedro. The sites reopened Monday under their new name. Home Bank also plans 
to keep about 40 of the Bank of San Pedro's 80 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The failed bank's other sites -- including its headquarters in San Pedro and 
branches in Long Beach and Gardena -- were closed by state officials and placed 
into the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Also closed was a 
site in Avalon, leaving Catalina Island with only one bank, a branch of 
Southern California Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of San Pedro President Lance Oak and board Chairman Peter Mandia, along 
with other top executives, gave up the bank's management after it was seized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just ran out of time," said Gerry Findley, publisher of the Findley 
Reports newsletter, which reports banking statistics. "Management of the past 
couple of years has been doing a good job of trying to raise capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators blamed the bank's failure on real estate investments that turned 
sour during the recession and a high number of bad loans. Overall, the losses 
reduced the bank's capital to $1.2 million. In addition, the bank's portfolio 
of non-performing loans was 5.9% at the end of last year. State and federal 
regulators -- who date the bank's problems to 1987 -- recommend only 1% to 2% 
in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got hit with what many independent banks have gone through," said Barry 
Rubens, president of California Research Corp., a bank consulting firm in Santa 
Monica. "They just couldn't get over the problems. Usually, in seven years you 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 Some former board members blame the bank's demise on the new direction the 
institution took in the 1980s, when it added new branches and started a 
subsidiary to invest in real estate projects. Among the investments: an 80% 
stake in the $25 million Redondo Shores shopping center, which has lost money 
and cut into the bank's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really the iceberg that brought it down," said Jim Hussey, a Bank of 
San Pedro founder, who left its board 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hussey and four others founded the bank in 1975 at the site of a former 
take-out chicken restaurant, their goal was to give the harbor community's 
residents and businesses a financial institution of their own, rather than 
depend on big chain banks based in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a major shake-up in the bank's executive ranks in 1981, when two San 
Pedro developers -- Steven G. Podesta and Bill A. Moller -- acquired a 
controlling interest in the bank's stock. The founding directors quit and some 
were dismayed at the decision to move the headquarters to a 5th Street building 
owned by Moller and Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the bank's new directors oversaw a rapid expansion, including 
the start-up of the Gardena, Torrance and Avalon branches, and investments in 
real estate projects near the Port of Los Angeles. The bank's assets jumped 
from $32 million when they joined the board to $180 million by the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1989, state banking regulators began to scrutinize some of the loans 
the bank issued to its own directors, including nearly $2 million in loans to 
Moller and slightly more than $1 million to Podesta.  
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials defended the loans and contended the scrutiny stemmed from the 
special attention that federal regulators began to give to so-called insider 
loans following the savings and loan scandal. The bank directors, however, 
agreed in 1990 to adopt tighter restrictions on loans to themselves and other 
bank officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moller and Podesta, who left the bank's board in 1990, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two partners also were once co-owners of the cruise ship Princess Louise, 
a popular floating restaurant in the Los Angeles Harbor that sunk in 1989. They 
had sold the vessel by that time, but the subsequent owner went bankrupt and it 
was repossessed by the Bank of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until last summer that the bank collected a $2 million insurance 
settlement on the ship. The money gave the bank a momentary reprieve from state 
banking regulators, who already had imposed deadlines for raising capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank could not sustain its revenue stream. Moreover, bank officials were 
unable to close a deal on the Redondo Shores shopping center, which continued 
to eat away at profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "They talked about selling it for a number of years," said Stan Cardenas, 
chief deputy superintendent at the state Banking Department. "We heard about 
it, but it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the bank also tried to sell stock to investors, but raised only $3 
million, far short of the $4 million to $5 million it needed to meet state 
banking guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure has left the FDIC with some of the bank's assets, including stakes 
in Redondo Shores and the Catalina Canyon Hotel on Catalina Island. The FDIC 
also will set up a plan for payment of claims to 210 customers who have 
uninsured deposits exceeding $100,000. Shareholders in the company are expected 
to lose their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Bank, which bought $82.2 million of the bank's insured deposits, will 
continue to operate the former bank's sites as consumer-oriented banks, said 
Home Bank Chief Executive James Staes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Staes greeted customers at the Gaffey Street and Western Avenue 
branches to assure customers that it will honor Bank of San Pedro checks and 
ATM cards, and will continue to operate as a consumer-oriented bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Staes said that Home Bank also experienced tough times during the recession, 
but the bank always stayed profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there is a downturn, every financial institution has to bite the 
bullet," Staes said. "But the bullet (Bank of San Pedro) had to bite was too 
big."

CONSERVANCY TO SEEK 315-ACRE PARCEL FOR PARK; LAND USE: PALOS VERDES GROUP 
HOPES TAX INCENTIVES WILL LEAD TO A DEAL TO PRESERVE THE OCEANFRONT PROPERTY 
KNOWN AS FILIORUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When bids were recently invited for one of Los Angeles County's last pieces of 
undeveloped oceanfront land, a local conservancy with few assets took notice. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a federal agency now moving to dispose of the 400-plus bluff-top 
acres, The Palos Verdes Land Conservancy says it is seeking to make a deal to 
turn some of the private acreage into public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy says it is not interested in acquiring the parcel known as 
Long Point, 105 acres overlooking the Pacific and approved for 450 hotel rooms 
and a nine-hole golf course. But the conservancy is interested in the parcel 
known as Filiorum: 315 nearby acres plagued by landslides and strapped with a 
building moratorium. Conservancy officials say the land would be ideal for a 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 By acquiring Filiorum, the conservancy would vastly increase its holdings; it 
now controls about 40 acres on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 But the conservancy must monitor the fate of both Long Point and Filiorum 
because the same bank note controls the two properties. So to obtain Filiorum, 
the conservancy would have to cut a deal with whoever buys the bank note. The 
conservancy's top two officials say it does not have the intention -- or money 
-- to buy the bank note itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Arizona-based developer James A. Monaghan) owns Filiorum and Long 
Point. But he filed for bankruptcy in December, 1992, and the Resolution Trust 
Corp., a federal agency responsible for liquidating the assets of failed 
savings and loans, oversees the bank note. The RTC values the note at $24 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Monaghan bought the two properties in 1987. Publishing giant Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich previously owned Long Point, for which it paid $23.4 million. 
Details of the sale to Monaghan have not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers estimate that Long Point alone -- once fully developed -- could be 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And it is anyone's guess what interested 
parties will bid for the bank note. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Point is peppered with weeds and cracked concrete. A sign on a guard 
station reads: "Sorry, We're Closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Filiorum, by contrast, is acres of green and gray hills with ocean views. The 
cries of peacocks can often be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 For the conservancy, last week's request for bidders was another reminder of 
the pending Sept. 13 auction, and officials say they stepped up efforts to 
ensure that Filiorum lands in the conservancy's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly warming up a bunch," Bill Ailor, the conservancy president, 
said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
 Ailor said the conservancy has $100,000 to $200,000 in reserves, but that the 
money is not set aside for land acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the conservancy may not need a lot of money to acquire Filiorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials note that whoever buys the note would have some incentive to cut a 
deal because the individual or company would pocket a tax break -- probably 
reaching into the millions of dollars -- by donating Filiorum or selling it to 
the conservancy at below-market rates. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conservancy is forced to pay for Filiorum, it could ask for funds from 
a bond measure that sets aside money for acquiring open space. The city of 
Rancho Palos Verdes and the county would have to approve the conservancy's use 
of the money. City Manager Paul D. Bussey valued the Measure A money at $4.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy conducted a study showing that some peninsula residents would 
favor a tax to acquire open space. Ailor estimated that such a tax could net 
the conservancy $5 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Andrew Sargent, president of the Coastal Conservation Coalition, 
is skeptical of public support for a tax. A frequent critic of the Palos Verdes 
conservancy, Sargent said it is one thing to express support for a tax and 
another to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy could turn to the Nature Conservancy, a Virginia-based 
organization. Michael Schindel, who reviews RTC California property for the 
group, said the Nature Conservancy has no plans to buy the bank note but is 
talking with The Palos Verdes Conservancy and trying to broker a deal to 
preserve Filiorum from development. 
</P>
<P>
 Schindel did not identify the other players he is speaking with for fear of 
jeopardizing negotiations. But he hinted that a deal could be in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conservation makes strange bedfellows sometimes," he said.

FEDERAL REVIEW FINDS NO REASON TO HALT HOMELESS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD and JAMES BORNEMEIER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials reviewing plans for a homeless center on surplus Navy 
property in San Pedro say they have no reason to reverse their earlier approval 
of the project, although a final decision has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health and Human Services' continued support of the plan, 
which hundreds of local residents have fiercely challenged in recent months, is 
one of several developments in the ongoing dispute over bringing the center to 
the Harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the department approved an application by Turner's Technical 
Institute Inc. to use housing on Taper Avenue for homeless families. Turner's, 
located in South-Central Los Angeles, would use the 27-acre site after the Long 
Beach Naval Station closes this summer and moves its personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 But department officials agreed to review their decision after local 
politicians and community members raised questions about the ability of 
Turner's to house up to 880 people. Opponents also pointed out inconsistencies 
in the group's application for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 During the height of public opposition, Turner's onetime executive director, 
Johnathon C. Marzet, resigned from the organization amid claims that on the 
application two letters of endorsement were forged and that he had falsified 
his academic qualifications. Those reputed to be endorsers of Turner's plan 
said they did not sign the letters. After he resigned, Marzet acknowledged 
false claims of college degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 The tumult, however, apparently has not changed the opinion of Health and 
Human Services officials about Turner's qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, The Times asked the department if its review had uncovered 
any inaccurate or misleading material in the Turner's application. In a written 
response, Kathleen Furey Martin, the official who approved the selection of 
Turner's, said: "To date, our review has not provided any basis on which to 
reverse our previous approval of (Turner's) application." 
</P>
<P>
 Although staff members have completed the review, a final determination on the 
project "has not yet been made," said Martin, director of the department's 
division of health facilities planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Her statement drew angry local reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The department) is basically saying it's OK to commit fraud or forgery," 
said Doane Liu, chairman of the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee. "It's probably 
not going to be pursued by any federal agency, but it's a federal crime and we 
view it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro and also is 
fighting the homeless center, called Martin's response "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "HHS knows they made a mistake with a hasty decision. Now they're so afraid to 
admit their mistake they're going to allow their incompetency to prevail," 
Svorinich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) said Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna Shalala is personally directing the review and "told me on the phone that 
they hadn't started a serious review." 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Zonana, an HHS spokesman, said the secretary considered the Turner's 
review a "serious matter" and had asked a high-level aide to monitor the 
department's handling of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No final decision has been made," Harman said. "Rumors are rumors, and I'm 
hopeful we'll find a solution that is acceptable to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a review by the Department of Housing and Urban Development has 
apparently been completed, but officials said no decision has been made. In 
response to local concerns, HUD officials re-examined safety questions about 
two aviation fuel tanks near the 144 units of housing at Taper Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say HUD should not have declared the land suitable for the homeless 
shelter because the tanks are closer to some buildings than the 2,000 feet 
required under federal regulations. But HUD's environmental review reportedly 
found that the fuel does not pose a threat because it is not explosive, said a 
local official who did not want to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents provided to Svorinich show that a HUD official found that several 
buildings on the site should not have been listed as suitable for occupancy 
because they are "within 2,000 feet of flammable or explosive material." 
</P>
<P>
 That information, housing officials in Washington said, should not have been 
released. It did not reflect any final decision, said department spokesman Jack 
Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 If HUD officials decide that the land is not suitable for the project, HHS 
cannot allow Turner's to proceed.  
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, The Times has learned that Los Angeles city officials 
last summer denied an application by Turner's for funds to expand a child-care 
center in South-Central. A child-care facility is one of many services that 
Turner's plans to operate at the Taper site. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization had applied to the Community Development Department for 
$400,000 to renovate the building it leases in the 8900 block of South 
Broadway. But city officials doubted Turner's ability to undertake and operate 
such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . (Turner's) experience in the child-care field is limited to informal 
child-care services and referral of child-care services to needy families," 
city officials noted in a report.

EPA OFFICIAL FIELDS QUESTIONS AT TOXIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-level official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has 
assured residents of a toxics-plagued neighborhood near Torrance that the 
agency is taking their health and environmental concerns seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Assistant Administrator Elliott Laws visited the neighborhood Saturday to 
discuss two nearby chemical waste sites that have stirred fears since the 
recent discovery of chunks of the banned pesticide DDT in two families' yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws met with residents in a verdant garden lined with red and yellow lilies. 
Its peacefulness belied the fact that DDT was found only a few doors away and 
that waste pits containing cancer-causing benzene sit directly north of the 
back alley. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the setting was tranquil, the conversation was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents challenged Laws to explain why the federal government has not 
conducted tests to assure that residents of West 204th Street are not being 
sickened by toxic substances at the two nearby sites: one a former DDT factory 
that is now a Superfund site, the other the former location of a World War 
II-era synthetic rubber plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors fear the sites may be causing nausea, dizziness, vomiting and 
rashes, and they complain that few people can afford expensive medical 
screening to determine if chemicals are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people here don't have the money to go to private doctors," one 
resident told Laws, who heads the EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency 
Response. In turn, Laws promised that he would contact other federal agencies 
to see if testing could be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of how to deal with health concerns at Superfund sites has long 
prompted controversy, because the EPA focuses primarily on site cleanup. An EPA 
spokesman said that Laws already has discussed the general problem with Dr. 
Philip R. Lee, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), who helped arrange Laws' visit, promised 
residents Saturday that she will make sure their concerns are heard in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever are the appropriate medical tests should be done right now," Harman 
said. She also suggested that officials study some kind of buyout for 
residents, citing the high cost of moving residents temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has moved 33 families to hotels during the investigation of the buried 
DDT, and some residents are calling on the federal government to relocate them 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Laws said Saturday that the EPA cannot make a decision on permanent 
relocation -- a step the agency has never taken at a Superfund site in 
California -- until it has conducted extensive testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't feel that because we're taking time, we've forgotten about you," Laws 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying Laws on Saturday were half a dozen officials from the EPA's 
regional office in San Francisco as well as Harman and a representative from 
the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 204th Street neighborhood, the federal government is spending $1.7 
million to test soil, household air and tap water, with results expected later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's work is complicated by the fact that the street lies alongside 
not one, but two, toxic chemical sites so contaminated that they merit federal 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The former DDT-manufacturing Montrose Chemical Corp., now a vacant lot, is 
northwest of the street. And directly to the north is the Del Amo Study Area, 
once home to a synthetic rubber factory operated by Shell Oil Co. and the Dow 
Chemical Co., among others. Most of the area is now an industrial park.  
</P>
<P>
 Montrose is on the federal Superfund list of the nation's 1,200 most hazardous 
toxic sites, and Del Amo is a Superfund nominee.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HARBOR AREA; RIORDAN'S APPOINTMENTS TO BOARD DRAW CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's appointment of two new members to the 
Harbor Commission this week has fueled criticism that he is turning over the 
port's huge operation to a five-member panel indifferent to or ignorant of 
neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Riordan named Jonathon Y. Thomas, board chairman of Saybrook 
Capital Corp., and Leland Wong, regional director of government relations for 
the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, to the Harbor Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, appointed to a three-year term, replaces Steven L. Soboroff, who was 
reassigned to the Recreation and Parks Commission. Wong, who served as 
president of the Airport Commission under former mayor Tom Bradley, was 
appointed for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Wilmington activist Gertrude Schwab, who was considered the strong 
local voice on the commission, was not reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without her there, I'm not sure that we will have someone to speak out for 
the community," said Roy Igo, chairman of the Wilmington Community Advisory 
Committee that Schwab served on before her appointment to the Harbor 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab told The Times that Deputy Mayor Mike Healy called her with the news 
about 9 p.m. last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He offered me a position as a Convention Center commissioner. I'm thinking 
about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab, who served a one-year term, said she is disappointed that she was 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The board) is wonderful. I think they fulfilled their job every way and they 
always told me I was their conscience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Thomas nor Wong lives near the Port of Los Angeles and their selection 
drew objections from some in the communities of San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor 
City and Harbor Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed in Richard Riordan. There are many people in the harbor area 
he could have picked," said Joann Wysocki, president of the Wilmington 
Homeowners' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kruesopon, spokesman for Harbor area Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., said 
Riordan broke an earlier commitment to keep local representation on the harbor 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Noelia Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for Riordan, said the mayor's selections were 
based on feedback from City Council members and the ability of appointees to 
represent the best interests of Los Angeles, not only the port.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; OFFICIALS WON'T ASK JUDGE TO INSPECT SCHOOL BOND 
BALLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Hawthorne School District officials, who lost a recount effort to pass a 
$15-million bond initiative, are no longer considering taking the matter before 
a judge. Officials were considering challenging the recount until late Tuesday 
but decided against it after determining the chances were of winning were slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have enough yes votes we were sure of," said district Supt. Christa 
Metzger. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials who sat in on the recount were considering contesting 42 ballots, 
school board member Shirley Duff said. Duff, who asked for the recount after 
Proposition B lost by 18 votes in the June 7 election, said some of the ballots 
showed an intent to vote for the measure, although the perforations on the 
ballots were not completely detached. 
</P>
<P>
 State guidelines recommend that at least three sides of a ballot's rectangular 
perforation be pushed for the vote to be counted, said Pricilla Smith, manager 
of election services for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the district had said that under recent legal precedents, the vote 
might count even if the tab has not been detached, as long as some intent is 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
 In similar cases, judges have ruled that light impressions that did not 
completely punch out the tabs showed intent to vote, said Fredric D. Woocher, 
an attorney advising the district on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Duff, who observed the on July 7 recount, said she thinks at least 10 of the 
ballots being challenged showed the voters intended to vote for the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 42 ballots were not counted in the original tabulation. Some of 
those disputed ballots were not counted because they had been cast at the wrong 
polling stations, Duff said. The recount cost the citizens group that sponsored 
the Proposition B campaign the remainder of its funds -- about $1,200. Any 
further actions would come out of district funds or private contributions, 
Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the June election, Proposition B gained 66.16% of the vote -- 0.5% shy of 
the two-thirds majority needed to pass the measure, according to the county 
registrar's office. The vote was 2,491 in favor, 1,274 against. 
</P>
<P>
 The $15-million bond issue would be used to fund major renovations of local 
school buildings. Many of the buildings are more than 40 years old and have 
extensive problems with plumbing, locks and windows, said Pamela Fees, director 
of business services for the district. The funds would also allow the 
construction of permanent buildings in place of the portable classrooms in use 
on some campuses, Fees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue would be paid back over 25 years by an average $20 annual 
property tax increase for Hawthorne residents, Fees said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; CITY TREASURER, SAYING COUNCIL WRONGED HER, 
FILES A CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redondo Beach City Treasurer Alice E. DeLong filed an $8-million claim against 
the city this week, accusing City Council members and other officials of 
committing a host of wrongful acts against her over the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, who has threatened to sue the city since May, said she has been the 
victim of harassment, libel and defamation of character, and claimed officials 
violated the City Charter by interfering with her duties as treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the claim are Mayor Brad Parton, the five council members, City Atty. 
Jerry Goddard, City Manager William E. Kirchhoff and two former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, 60, has been under fire since February, when Kirchhoff said he could 
no longer supervise DeLong's office because she mistreated employees and failed 
to properly manage the city's investments. DeLong watches over about $45 
million in investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very damaging to me," DeLong said. "If you're proud of the way 
you painted a house and someone says you're doing a lousy job, you have to 
defend your work." 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the claim were Gary Baum and Barry Kielsmeier, former city 
workers who Kirchhoff said have complained about DeLong's on-the-job behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong, an elected official who has presided over the city's investments for 
19 years, said she believes recent criticisms of her are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Her four-year term expires in March, and at this point, DeLong said, she is 
"not sure" she will run for reelection. "I look like I'm about 80 now. I feel 
like it. I feel like I've been through the mill," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 45 days to respond to the claim, which is the first step in 
filing a lawsuit. A city committee and the council will evaluate the charges, 
Goddard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parton said he was not surprised by the charges, but by the amount of DeLong's 
claim. "It's a little ridiculous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Memos written by Kirchhoff and council members that circulated throughout City 
Hall in recent months and that were released to the media concerning conflicts 
in the treasurer's office have brought an unusual amount of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be no confidentiality around this place when it comes to Alice 
DeLong," said Councilman Stevan)Colin, a longtime supporter of the treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 In an additional legal fray, a Torrance Superior Court judge is expected to 
rule Friday on DeLong's request for a restraining order against Councilman 
Joseph Dawidziak. The two had an angry argument at City Hall last month.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOMITA; COUNCIL DONATES $6,337 TO KEEP LIBRARY OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave the Friends of the Lomita Library $6,337 to help keep 
the Lomita branch of the Los Angeles County Library system open through 
September. The donation was the largest single donation from any of the 52 
cities that the county library serves, said its head librarian Sandra F. 
Reuben. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous largest donation was just over $2,000 from Lakewood, Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was raised last month from the Jim Thorpe 5K Run/Walk, an event 
sponsored by more than 60 local businesses and residents, said Mayor Ben 
Traina. "$6,000 won't keep it open for a year but it certainly will help," 
Traina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the money could have been earmarked for specific uses at the Lomita 
branch, the money was donated to the "County Libraries Are Worth It" campaign 
to benefit the whole library system, said Ruth Herbert, president of the 
Friends of Lomita Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The grass-roots campaign was started in April as part of National Libraries 
Week and has taken in nearly $90,000 so far, Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lomita branch is one of about 50 branch libraries that was facing possible 
closure after state budget cuts left the library system with a $10-million 
deficit. The system lost a total of $30 million as a result of the cuts, Reuben 
said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; SHERIFF'S DEPT. WILL ENFORCE YOUTH CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to curb graffiti and other crimes by young people, the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department will begin to strictly enforce a 10 p.m. curfew 
starting Friday for youths under the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the department's new policy, youths who cannot prove they are en route 
to a specific destination, or who do not have written permission from a parent 
to be out, will be in violation of the curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, youngsters would have been cited and released. But now young 
people detained by deputies will be held at the station until arrangements can 
be made with their parents to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides calling parents, deputies also will issue citations for violating the 
curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is to cut down on the graffiti and vandalism that occurs," said Sgt. 
Steve Bellino of the Carson station. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine for curfew violations can be up to $1,000 and/or six months in jail, 
police officials said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOMITA; NEW CITY BUDGET CUTS COUNCIL PAY, TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday unanimously adopted a $7.5-million budget that 
includes pay cuts for council members and less money for travel while holding 
the line on most other expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending package avoids layoffs but also provides no pay raises for city 
employees.But city officials are concerned that further cuts by the state would 
put the budget into the red. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a reserve in the budget," said City Administrator Walker J. 
Ritter. Any money taken by the state would come at the expense of existing 
programs and services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that the state might take more money was one of the reasons the 
council and Ritter decided against giving city employees a raise, said Mayor 
Ben Traina. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, council members voted to give up their $50 a month salary as 
housing authority members. The move will save $3,000 a year in a budget that 
has small cutbacks in many areas from capital outlays to part-time employees, 
Ritter said.  
</P>
<P>
 The deepest cuts came in travel and conference expenses, with the council 
voting to bring Lomita's travel budget in line with other South Bay cities, 
Traina said. For the coming year, the council has budgeted $17,500 -- half what 
it spent this past fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey done earlier this year showed Lomita was spending more on travel than 
other comparable cities, Traina said. JON GARCIA

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; IN THE SHADOW OF VIOLENCE; AT ONE OF 3 LOCAL SHELTERS 
FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE, WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIND A HAVEN AND A PLACE TO 
START OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The telephone rings at 12:10 a.m., 1:02 a.m. and again at 3 a.m. Each time, 
shelter worker Maria Sanchez crawls out of bed to reach for the receiver and 
hears the voice of a terrified woman.  
</P>
<P>
 One caller blurts out that she is trapped behind locked doors in her home, 
frightened that her abusive boyfriend is waiting in his car outside. She wants 
to slip away tonight and drive to safety.  
</P>
<P>
 So Sanchez carries her bedding to a sofa next to the shelter's front door 
where she will be sure to wake up when she hears a knock.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman still has not arrived when daylight streams through the 
lace-curtained windo w s. A sleepy-eyed Sanchez sips coffee and dials the 
number she was given during the night. The phone rings. There is no answer.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The nights can be long and unsettling for those who serve as sentries at the 
Rainbow Services battered women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 During the daytime, this crowded three-bedroom house in the South Bay resounds 
with the sounds of spirited conversation, meals being cooked, television 
game-show music, and boisterous children chasing each other from room to room. 
</P>
<P>
 But late at night, with the sound of a ringing phone, the shelter's purpose 
comes into stark focus. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who pick up the receiver, it must seem as if countless women 
throughout Southern California are trapped in some sordid shadow world where 
they are threatened, stalked, beaten and bruised by their husbands or 
boyfriends. Some of the callers speak in whispers and some cry outright as they 
describe being taunted with guns, hit by flying dishes, slapped repeatedly in 
front of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 When they call the Rainbow Services hot line, day or night, they make contact 
with a worker usually seated in a cozy, well-lit office at a house tucked away 
on a residential street. 
</P>
<P>
 This house is a way station on an underground railroad of sorts, one of 17 
shelters in Los Angeles County offering sanctuary to victims of domestic 
violence. Shelter counselors work together in hopes of providing emergency 
housing and other aid for 30 to 45 days for victims -- primarily women and 
their children -- who have fled abusive relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most such shelters, the one run by Rainbow Services is in an undisclosed 
site to protect the safety of victims. Secrecy is paramount. It is, in fact, a 
misdemeanor to disclose the location of a battered women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shelters have worked hard not to be visible," said Cheryl Majka, Rainbow's 
services director. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to many, three shelters now operate in the South Bay: the Rainbow 
shelter and two run by the 1736 Family Crisis Center, an agency based in 
Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Between them, the agencies provide 45 shelter 
beds for women and children, which workers report is far too few to serve the 
need in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The same shortage plagues the entire Los Angeles region. A total of only 390 
shelter beds -- including portable cribs for infants -- are available in all of 
Los Angeles County, where law enforcement officials last year received more 
than 67,000 domestic violence calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbow hot line received 3,800 calls last year, and its shelter housed 82 
women and 146 children. An average of 60 victims a month sought such services 
as individual and group counseling, child counseling, and legal advice on such 
matters as how to obtain a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing such numbers, shelter workers can sometimes feel overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 A chart tacked on a wall at the Rainbow shelter showed that, as of Monday, the 
agency had been forced to turn down 65 requests for shelter since July 6 for 
lack of space. An informal survey this month by the Los Angeles County Domestic 
Violence Council found that the county's shelter network may be turning away 
four out of every five families requesting shelter because of lack of space and 
other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure on that network has burgeoned in recent weeks, following the arrest 
of O.J. Simpson on charges of murdering his ex-wife and her friend. Reports 
that the Simpson marriage was marred by abuse have focused unprecedented 
attention on domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of calls to local hot lines has surged, and the Rainbow shelter is 
at capacity, with 18 women and children on a recent weekend sleeping in three 
upstairs rooms furnished with dormitory-style bunk beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women who call have been listening to television talk shows, recognizing 
in themselves some of the classic signs of being battered. Now, some seem more 
willing to make a break for it, to leave an abusive partner for a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 One such woman is 29-year-old Janet (not her real name), who says she endured 
years of physical abuse from her husband, even leaving the state with her four 
children in a futile effort to hide from him. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently released tapes of Nicole Brown Simpson's desperate 911 call to a 
police dispatcher resonated in Janet's brain, stirring memories of her own 
calls to authorities when her husband would explode with rage and hit her. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been in hiding at a relative's home, where, one day this month, her 
husband suddenly showed up on the doorstep. She dodged him long enough to call 
the Rainbow hot line. And within minutes, she was on the freeway with her four 
children in the car, speeding toward the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 What Janet found at Rainbow does not conform to the stereotype of a battered 
women's shelter: a gloomy building where women with bruised faces gather in a 
circle to dissect their emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 She instead found a large, rambling house brimming with friendly adults and 
playful children. The women are assigned chores, such as cooking dinner, 
scouring the bathrooms, tidying the yard. They watch television together and 
gossip over coffee. One woman ambles down the stairs in early morning with 
curlers in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Janet had never attended college, this fits her image of a campus 
sorority house. 
</P>
<P>
 She feels comfortable talking to the other women, and she notices that her 
four children seem less tense. "They like it," she says. "I think that when we 
have to leave, they'll cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Children outnumber adults in this household, last week ranging in age from 3 
months to 10 years old. Keeping them occupied is a key mission of shelter 
residents. Two women have begun taking their children on outings to McDonalds, 
where their 2-year-olds can clamber over the elaborate play set while the 
adults eat and talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such relaxed moments, shelter life has a dreary side. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women arrive here with only the clothing on their backs, and they are 
given free vouchers that they can exchange for clothes at the Rainbow thrift 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leave behind not only their husbands but their jobs. Women entering the 
shelter are strongly advised to quit their jobs or -- if possible -- to ask 
their employers for leaves of absence because their abusers could easily trace 
them if they return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Many newcomers must take a bus to a nearby office to apply for welfare, some 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women decide to leave the shelter after only a few days, often returning 
to their husbands or boyfriends. Studies have shown that abused women may leave 
a relationship and return to it five, six, eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 If a woman decides to go home to her abuser, she is still welcomed at 
Rainbow's outreach support groups, but she generally cannot return to the 
shelter because Rainbow officials worry that she may have alerted her partner 
to its location. They tell the story of one departing woman seen getting into 
her abuser's car right outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 If such women contact Rainbow again, counselors will help guide them to 
another shelter, another station on this underground railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening, an overflow crowd shows up for Rainbow's regular Thursday support 
group, with 16 women squeezing into the cluster of sofas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's topic is "helplessness," and the personal stories come spilling out. 
One woman recounts how her husband beat her in front of her 3-year-old. Another 
describes being thrown repeatedly against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 After all that, one woman wonders aloud, why is it so hard to leave her 
abuser? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as time passes and the bruises fade, she finds herself rationalizing that 
the beatings didn't happen all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now I want to forgive him again, because I don't have this anymore" -- 
she points at her eye -- "or makeup's covering it." 
</P>
<P>
 Says another woman: 'After he hit me, I'd think, 'Is it really that bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 As the session finishes, the therapist asks how many in the room have left 
their abusers. Only half the women raise their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not until her boyfriend threw the glass at their 3-week-old baby did Susan 
decide the relationship was over. 
</P>
<P>
 He had erupted in anger that night as he had before, kicking and stomping her, 
dragging her across the floor by her hair, threatening to kill her and bury her 
in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was seeing that glass hurtling toward her baby that stopped her short. 
She reached out fast and managed to catch the glass, but the water spilled all 
over her and the infant. 
</P>
<P>
 So she left him that night for the third time -- the last time, she says. She 
looked through the telephone book and found Rainbow Services. 
</P>
<P>
 During her three weeks in this rambling house, she has begun to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now and again, I'll hear a truck that sounds like his, and I'll think, 'Oh, 
my God.' " But instead of nervously pacing the floor, she is sleeping through 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 2-year-old son, Joey, seems calmer too, she says. She had worried in 
recent months when he began copying his father, waiting until the beatings were 
done and then hitting her with his own small fists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's monkey see, monkey do, at that age," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she must start planning her next move -- probably to a transitional 
shelter where she can stay for several months. In time, she would like to go to 
nursing school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will induce her to return to her boyfriend, she says. Not even brute 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 On this lazy July afternoon, she sits talking in the shelter's back yard as 
the baby dozes and Joey plays with a toy truck. She watches as Joey wanders 
over to the baby carrier, and, unprompted, kisses his sister on the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates believe that women such as Susan and Janet need more help than can 
be offered during 30 days of sanctuary. In response, the shroud of secrecy 
shielding the battered women's network is lifting ever so slightly with spinoff 
programs reaching beyond the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to this trend, Rainbow Services last month moved its outreach 
center to larger quarters in San Pedro so that it can expand its counseling and 
legal advocacy work. Rainbow also has forged an unusual partnership with the 
Los Angeles Police Department's San Pedro-based Harbor Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to that effort is the Emergency Response Team, Rainbow volunteers who 
are called in by the LAPD after domestic violence-related arrests. Volunteers 
offer crisis counseling, arriving equipped with pamphlets, hot line phone 
numbers, tissues, and even hotel and taxi vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment has started slowly, with the team only being called out about a 
dozen times since April. Still, supporters hope it can turn into a citywide 
model, inspiring other LAPD divisions to launch similar programs with shelters 
in their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helpful to us, and it's helpful to them," said Detective Julie Nelson, 
who reports that the division gets about 200 domestic violence-related calls 
monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this same desire to reach beyond shelter work that brought Rainbow 
Executive Director Connie McFall to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital one recent 
morning to address a roomful of emergency room nurses who are all too familiar 
with the ravages of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know from your experience many of these women never call the police," 
said McFall, who encouraged the nurses to call Rainbow if a victim needs more 
help than the hospital staff can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow hopes to open a satellite office in Wilmington this fall and to hire a 
caseworker to assist women after they leave the shelter.

 A formal program to aid such women is available at the 1736 Family Crisis 
Center's Second Step Shelter, designed for battered women and their children 
who have already been in a short-term shelter but who need more sustained help. 
Through the program, these women may learn how to write a resume, dress for a 
job interview and balance a household budget. The agency plans to open two more 
Second Step shelters in the Los Angeles area later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, more services are needed on all fronts, experts agree. The 
outpouring of calls unleashed by the Simpson case publicity, they say, helps 
dramatize the insidious nature of domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One quiet evening, Janet and Susan lounge in the shelter living room and talk 
about the curious nature of this house they now call home. 
</P>
<P>
 These two women are like travelers waiting in a train station -- Janet will be 
leaving the shelter within the week, whereas Susan has barely arrived -- but 
they already have struck up a friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation drifts as the two women describe the men they have left, the 
episodes of violence. They remember the sea change that swept over their old 
partners before the men began attacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their faces change so much," Janet remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look totally different," Susan agrees. "Their shoulders tense up. He 
used to get a tick, and I knew then not to mess with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Such images seem oddly jarring in this lace-curtained room as Janet's 
2-year-old son stretches across her lap, struggling to keep his eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
 He looks so much like his father, says Janet as she strokes his head. She 
worries about the resemblance, troubled that the propensity toward violence 
also could be hereditary. And she doesn't want her daughters to grow up 
thinking that it's all right to have someone hit them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few weeks, she will wrestle with decisions about where she and her 
children will go next. For now, she seems content to sit here watching her son, 
joking with Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy," she says. Warning Signs of Violence 
</P>
<P>
 Some patterns of behavior by a partner could hint at the potential for 
violence in a relationship, according to the National Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Growing up in a violent family, perhaps being abused or seeing one parent 
beat the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using violence to solve problems, displaying a quick temper, overreacting to 
frustrations such as not finding a parking place, punching walls or throwing 
things when angered, being cruel to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Having a poor or negative self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintaining rigid ideas about the roles of men and women, such as believing 
a woman should stay home and follow orders. Getting angry if a partner does not 
follow orders or anticipate wishes.  
</P>
<P>
 * Exhibiting jealousy of a partner's family and friends; wanting to know where 
the partner is at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abusing alcohol or other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Playing with guns, knives or other weapons and threatening to use them 
against others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Experiencing extreme highs and lows, acting extremely kind and then becoming 
cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treating a partner roughly, by hitting or physically forcing someone to do 
things against his or her will.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: LOVE STORY REELS IN A WINNING CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A smiling waitress and a good bowl of soup can lead to true love. It happened 
to Phillip Dang in 1977, when he wandered into a Vietnamese restaurant in Los 
Angeles and floated out in love with Tiem, the waitress who had served him beef 
noodle soup. A short while later the two were married. And when Phillip's 
employer moved to Dallas in 1991, the married couple also became a business 
couple, opening the Hermosa Fishmarket Cafe (despite the name, it's a cafe, not 
a market). 
</P>
<P>
 The Fishmarket Cafe is a relaxing outpost with some seafaring decorations: 
life preservers, oars, a mounted swordfish. Since it's a mere 100 feet from the 
Hermosa Pier, you can expect a casually dressed crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the menu is the raw oysters ($5.50), a molluscan half-dozen 
from Wallapa Bay in Washington. They are served with lemon wedges and a 
cocktail sauce with a dab of horseradish. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish is charcoal-grilled and very simply served, with no seasonings at all, 
unless you care to put on some tartar or teriyaki sauce. Alaskan king salmon 
($9.95) comes with a salad and garlic bread. Monkfish ($8.95), known as "poor 
man's lobster," is often available, as are sea bass, swordfish and fresh tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular items here is the seafood paella ($6.25 at lunch, 
$8.95 at dinner), the classic Spanish dish of saffron-flavored rice and 
seafood. It's made with shrimp, mussels, clams, crab, squid and whitefish, not 
to mention garlic, onions, peas, mushrooms, tomatoes, carrots and bell peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish tacos ($4.95 for two), those old beach favorites, are filled with shrimp 
and mahi mahi. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermosa Fishmarket Cafe is at 20 Pier Ave., Hermosa Beach. (310) 372-1488. 
Open Sunday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. 
to 10:30 p.m.

SANDERS IS ON WAY TO BECOMING A HOT PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern California housing market remains sluggish, but the value of an 
aspiring real estate agent and current Westchester High basketball player has 
skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning recently from two national basketball tournaments, Ben Sanders of 
Westchester received telephone messages from 15 Division I basketball coaches 
who are interested in the senior-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got home and I had messages from (Nevada Las Vegas), Oklahoma, UCLA, 
Arizona, Utah, Purdue and Kansas," Sanders said. "I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a 6-foot-4 guard, and teammate Danny Walker played for a Southern 
California team at the Nike Sports Festival in Deerfield, Ill., and Great 
American Shootout in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 After competing for the first time against the nation's best prep players, 
Sanders received rave reviews from recruiting evaluators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben is a high major college prospect," said Bob Gibbons of the Lenoir, 
N.C.-based All-Star Sports Publications. "He should emerge from the summer as 
one of the top 50 players in his class." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Sanders, he was able to impress recruiters before suffering a 
sprained ankle Sunday in Westchester's 67-64 victory over Dominguez in the 
championship game of the Fairfax tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury prevented him from playing this week for top-seeded Values for a 
Better America (VBA) in the Slam-N-Jam National Invitational at South and West 
Torrance high schools. He may be sidelined for the rest of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' ultimate dream is to play in the NBA, but he knows a college 
scholarship will also help him accomplish his second dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do see myself playing in the NBA," he said. "That's a dream. But if I don't 
make it, I want to do some real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders appeared to be a tough sell, playing in the shadows of his brother 
Jason, a sophomore at San Diego State, and Walker, who as a sophomore was The 
Times' 1994 Westside Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, Westchester has produced several outstanding high school 
players, including Zan Mason, Sam Crawford, Kevin Floyd and James Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was selected to The Times' all-star team last season as a junior, 
Sanders' game lacked the polish of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's great talent, but a raw talent," Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said. "He is 
improving daily. He has a lot of skills, but he is a long way from being as 
good as he is going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Capable of playing point or shooting guard, the 6-4 Sanders has a quick move 
to the basket. But he lacks consistency as a three-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's little bit streaky as shooter because of the motion of the shot," Azzam 
said. "He's not consistent because of mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "James Gray was an awful shooter in high school, but right now he's one of 
best shooters around," he said. "It takes time and work." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Sanders did not spend long hours practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a kid who has interests other than playing basketball," Azzam said. 
"There's nothing wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
 That changed in June when Sanders decided to work out five hours a day with 
his brother at Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to improve my outside shooting," said Sanders, who would jerk the 
ball when he shot. "I'm starting to stroke it now." 
</P>
<P>
 The workouts have already paid dividends for Sanders, who was selected to play 
for the Southern California all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarterfinals, the Southern California team defeated Southeast Breeze, 
a team featuring the nation's top two players -- 6-foot-10 center Kevin Garnett 
of Mauldin, S.C. and 6-7 forward Ron Mercer of Madison, Tenn. -- and later beat 
the Hartland Jammers in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders more than held his own. "That was the best I've ever seen him play," 
Walker said. "He was shooting the ball better, taking the ball to the 
(basket)." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders plans to major in business in college and lists UNLV, Arizona State, 
Temple and Long Beach State among his top choices. He has a 2.5 grade-point 
average and scored 750 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which qualifies him for 
a scholarship.

PEOPLE: MANHATTAN BEACH RESIDENT FOSTERS LIFELONG CAREER OF CARING FOR KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 36 years since Pat Warner started her career as a foster mother, a lot 
has changed. Drug babies, AIDS babies, abandoned babies were all rarities in 
the '50s. One constant has remained, though: the satisfaction Warner gets from 
giving foster children the love they need for a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 The job is emotionally draining and the pay is bad, but the rewards are great, 
she said. "They need loving, caring, nurturing, plain old TLC. Some babies are 
dumped in trash cans or left here and there and I know I've given mine a good 
start," said Warner, 74, a Manhattan Beach resident. "It's a good feeling, 
especially when you see them grown up." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner was recently honored with the "Service to Mankind Award" from the 
Sertoma Club of Torrance for her work "in caring for the less fortunate infants 
of our society," said the club's Robert Murray. "She knows that love is the 
vital ingredient in the first months of a human life. What better contribution 
to the growth and well-being of America could an individual make?" 
</P>
<P>
 Warner said she can't remember a time when there wasn't a baby in her house. 
"I've always been with children. I got myself through high school baby-sitting, 
then I had six of my own," including adopting one of her foster children in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
 She became a foster mother out of a need to "do something more productive than 
sit at home and go to women's club meetings," she said. "Everyone said I'd be 
sorry and tried to talk me out of it because it'd be so emotionally draining. 
But I didn't listen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she signed on with Holy Family Services -- a private, nonprofit 
counseling and adoption agency in Los Angeles -- and began taking babies into 
her house in 1959. At the time, most were white and born to mothers who lived 
near the agency in a home for unwed mothers, Warner said. For the past 15 
years, "we've had mostly minority babies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a white, blond, blue-eyed baby, they go the fastest. They're at a 
premium. The minority babies aren't," Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also seen more babies born to mothers with drug problems or AIDS; her 
current charge -- a 3-month-old -- was born to a mother on drugs and then 
abandoned, she said. "But he's fine, no problems. I've been real lucky," Warner 
said. "I've never turned down a baby and I've never really had any with 
difficult problems." 
</P>
<P>
 She has cried a lot, though, when she meets adoptive parents she worries they 
"aren't prepared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think is right or wrong doesn't matter, though," she said, since she 
leaves those decisions to the experts. "I cry a lot and then go about my 
business until the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, Warner has cared for 189 babies from all over Southern 
California; most stay about three months, some only overnight, others are with 
her -- on and off -- for years. 
</P>
<P>
 She keeps in contact with about half a dozen of her former wards, she said. 
One, now a Compton police officer, invited Warner to his wedding and introduced 
her as his mother for five months, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Warner is an unusual foster parent, said Jane Jackson, administrative manager 
for Holy Family, now one of the largest adoption agencies in Southern 
California. "It's rare to find someone who stays with it for that length of 
time. It's usually quite an emotional drain. But (Warner) is wonderful. She 
takes babies no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said she has no idea what keeps Warner going. And the question is 
difficult for Warner to answer herself. "It's just there, that's all," Warner 
said. "I came from a broken family so I don't think it came from my parents." 
And the money doesn't motivate her. Paid a fee of $345 per child per month, she 
said: "If you do it for the money, you don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner credits her husband George, retired from the construction business, and 
her children for giving her the support and help she needs to keep going. "If 
they hadn't helped, I couldn't have done it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there is another reason. "Children are my life," she said. 
"Maybe that's what it is."

FOR TEENS; MOBIL'S TEEN 'GREEN TEAM' CLEANS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a break from cutting and hauling brush, a group of Torrance teen-agers 
this week showed off their blisters and complained about the hard work that 
occupies their time. From 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 They are members of a new program, sponsored by the city and paid for by a 
$50,000 grant from Mobil Oil Corp. The "Green Team," as the group is called, 
paints, weeds and cleans up public property under the supervision of city 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the 17 youngsters have spent their first week hacking their way along 
a few hundred yards of railroad track that parallels Madrid Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In sweltering heat, they have dragged brush through areas that burned in 
recent months, stirring up ashy dust as they work. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain that the $4.26 an hour they earn isn't enough for the difficult 
work. But in the same breath they say if it weren't for the program, they'd 
still be looking for jobs. And, they say, their friends envy them for having 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Berly, 17, said the outdoor work makes having a social life almost 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just want to go home and sleep the entire night," Berly said. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of them, it's the first time they have had a full-time job. Several 
of them had been baby-sitters or done odd jobs. Michael Sun,16, worked in fast 
food for a while. He said that type of work was easier, but jobs are hard to 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 They all look forward to reaping the fruits of their labor -- their first 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Mackey, 15, said he'll buy a lot of beef jerky with his money. 
</P>
<P>
 Zack Ward,16, said most of his check will go toward paying car insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the group on Madrid Avenue, being so close to the railroad tracks has 
provided some diversion from the drudgery of work. On Monday, the Ringling 
Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus rolled past, giving the workers a chance to 
see a few animals on the train cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Madrid Avenue workers wistfully described other Green Teams planting 
flowers in a park near the beach, relating that their group is always the 
dirtiest when they go back to the city yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-week program marks the first time Mobil has sponsored a Green Team 
in California, although similar grants in New Jersey and Texas have mixed work 
programs and academics. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program works in Torrance the company will look at adding funding for a 
program next year that includes some academic work, said company spokesman 
Barry Engelberg.

NASA LAUNCHES PROGRAM WITH 54 MINORITY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The serious-looking father and his lanky, baby-faced son seemed dazzled by the 
spiel that Wendell Greer, summer principal of Gardena High School, was 
delivering. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes it was sudden, Greer said, but NASA was offering to foot the bill for the 
boy, 17-year-old Torian Mitchell, and 53 other students in the Los Angeles area 
to spend part of the summer at an all-expenses-paid science program at Central 
State University in Ohio. After the program, the students would take a swing 
through the southern United States on a tour of traditionally black colleges 
and universities. Torian would have to be on a plane Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "NASA just got the funding for it, and we found it out real late, but I think 
this will do a lot for him," Greer told Torian's father, Raymond Mitchell, who 
nodded in agreement . 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet, 4 inches and loaded with athletic talent, Torian dreams of playing 
in the NBA. (That he had an uncle who reached 7 feet, 3 inches gives him hope 
for a late growth spurt). 
</P>
<P>
 Whirling to address Torian, Greer pounds at that dream: "I told you all next 
year you're going to be in the spotlight because the way you play basketball is 
the way you're going to do other things." The principal was referring to 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to go shopping right now," Raymond Mitchell said to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a bureaucratic snafu, NASA did not receive the full $300,000 
funding for the pilot program, called Earth to L.A., until last week. High 
School principals throughout Los Angeles, Inglewood and Pasadena rushed to 
select students and persuade their parents that the trip would be beneficial. 
Most of those participating in the program are African American; a few are 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-week program, offered only in the Los Angeles area, is intended to 
encourage minority students from inner-city communities to pursue earth 
sciences and mathematics at traditionally black colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54 chosen students, who had to have at least a B average, were chosen from 
Bell, Pasadena, Muir, Morningside, Inglewood, South Gate, Roosevelt, Jordan, 
Locke, Banning, Hamilton, Dorsey and Gardena high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, they began a four-week stay at Central State University in 
Wilberforce, Ohio, studying computer science, earth sciences and mathematics. 
Each student receives a $60 weekly stipend and help from the the Los 
Angeles-based Council of Black Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are scheduled to visit 12 colleges, including three in Atlanta 
(Morehouse and Spelman colleges and Clark Atlanta University), Fisk University 
in Tennessee, Hampton Institute in Virginia and Howard University in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to the last minute Saturday morning, principals were urging, badgering, 
pushing and flattering their most promising students into being ready to leave 
Los Angeles by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer, shoving an application into the hands of one student who worried that 
going on the trip might harm his standing on the football team, told the 
youngster: "Looking at you, I think you could own a team rather than be on a 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Greer added: "Look, Coach (Donald) Threat went to Alabama A&M. Tell him you'll 
bring him back a hat, and he'll be just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The student, Steven Brooks, 17, signed up for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday afternoon, the students and their parents and teachers filled a 
room at the Museum of Science and Industry in Exposition Park to hear a pep 
talk from NASA and other government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth to L.A. program was developed after NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin 
introduced himself to U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 At Saturday's gathering, Goldin recounted how he met with Waters last year to 
talk about the space program, but she stopped him mid-sentence and asked him 
what the space program was doing for her district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped cold," Goldin said. "I walked out with my tail between my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 He went back to research minority participation in NASA and found that of 580 
executives, only 14 are African American. Goldin said he imposed a hiring 
freeze for the agency until it developed an affirmative-action plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged the students to pay attention in class, study at night and "turn off 
the television. . . . NASA is spending $300,000 for this program. Understand 
that you've been given a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters was much more direct. "We expect you to conduct yourselves at a very 
high level," she said. "You represent all of us here. You represent your 
schools, your community, me, your parents, NASA, Central State, everybody. We 
don't expect any excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I expect everybody out of this first class to enroll in college," she 
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee will 
hold a public hearing Tuesday on finalizing changes to San Pedro's residential 
and commercial zoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2 p.m. hearing will address maintaining low-density residential 
development throughout San Pedro and ensuring that development on Pacific 
Avenue remains commercially viable, said Daniel Cartagena, planning deputy for 
Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late 1980s, residents were concerned with demolishing of California 
bungalows and unique structures that were being replaced with five- to six-unit 
structures," Cartagena said. "They wanted the preservation of their 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be held in the council chambers at Los Angeles City Hall, 200

LOVE CONNECTION; ONCE-WRECKED ARTHUR LEE IS FINDING HIS WAY BACK TO FAME, 
RESPECTABILITY

 The wreck of the Arthur Lee will never return again, never return again.  
</P>
<P>
 -- From "The Wreck of the Arthur Lee," by Robyn Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lee leans over a plate of tacos and beans and starts to wave his arms 
angrily, taking care not to disturb the great pink concoction in front of him 
that could be the Lake Superior of mixed drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 The grin marks have vanished from Lee's long, dimpled face. He doesn't know 
Robyn Hitchcock from Alfred Hitchcock, but he knows that he doesn't at all like 
the song verse an interviewer just quoted for him. Until now, a late-afternoon 
lunch in this deserted North Hollywood restaurant has been a placid, rather 
sunny affair, notwithstanding the black decor and the dim lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll wreck him! I'll wreck him! " Lee booms, his voice a mixture of high 
dudgeon and amusement at the theatricality of his own outburst. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, however, is willing to be mollified. He harrumphs and settles back into 
the booth as it's explained who Hitchcock is (a '60s-influenced British rocker 
highly regarded in college-radio circles) and how he came to take liberties 
with Lee's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wreck of the Arthur Lee," Hitchcock said in an interview last year, is 
intended as "a lament in general," and not a comment on the condition of its 
namesake. The lyric talks about a sinking ship, which Hitchcock named in Lee's 
honor because the song also incorporates a swelling orchestral arrangement 
clearly inspired by "Forever Changes," the 1967 album that established Arthur 
Lee and his band, Love, as an enduring, if overlooked, rock treasure.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Hitchcock's explanation, the image of Arthur Lee as a lost vessel 
hits uncomfortably close to home, given the long downward arc of his musical 
career. For most of the past 20 years, Lee seems to have foundered on the 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The '60s held some great high-water marks. When the band debuted in 1966, Love 
succeeded the Byrds and preceded the Doors as the ruling band on the Sunset 
Strip. Love's music, like that of most great '60s bands, can't be labeled with 
a handy tag, like today's "punk" or "grunge."  
</P>
<P>
 Love played gritty, blitzing speed-rock (notably on "7 And 7 Is," the band's 
only Top 40 hit) that helped lay the foundation for latter-day punk. It also 
played jangling folk-rock and gorgeous, cottony ballads that showed jazz and 
classical influences. Lee's lyrics were sometimes full of hippie idealism and 
lovelorn wistfulness; but they also could capture the Vietnam War-shadowed 
defiance and paranoia that pervaded the era.  
</P>
<P>
 "Forever Changes," with its combination of plaintive innocence and deep 
foreboding, came out at the end of 1967 and captured the moment as that love 
fest year slipped into 1968, a dark year of assassinations and street-fighting. 
But the strange, shimmering, still-haunting beauty of "Forever Changes" 
transcends any sociological moment and earns it a place high on the list of 
rock's all-time greatest albums. 
</P>
<P>
 On his '60s recordings, Lee's singing voice was remarkably diverse and 
instantly identifiable, whether he was barking out a tough-rocking song or 
crooning in a pure, tremulous tenor that could have made him an idol in any 
Irish saloon (Lee is one of the few rock singers who cites Johnny Mathis as an 
important influence).  
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't Irish, though. He was a black man, born in Memphis and raised in 
South Los Angeles. Love was the first racially integrated band in post-Beatles 
rock, and it is likely that Jimi Hendrix (whose maiden recording session as a 
sideman Lee produced in 1963) took a few ideas from him, both musical and 
sartorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Love never enjoyed commercial success equal to its artistic achievement, 
partly because the original lineup, wracked by dissension and, reportedly, drug 
abuse, failed to tour. Lee kept Love going with new musicians, but his 
songwriting faltered in the '70s, and by the middle of the decade he had joined 
the where-are-they-now brigade of former contenders who slip quietly out of the 
public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lee reappeared early in 1989 on a "Psychedelic Summer of Love" oldies 
package tour that played a string of Southern California dates, his performance 
at the Coach House was pallid. He was grim and withdrawn as he fronted a 
lifeless band, giving only fleeting glimpses of his old vocal glory. In an 
interview at the time, Lee came off as a man who felt slighted of his due, 
brimming with egotism and with resentment for a music business establishment 
that he felt had raided his wallet and pulled his rightful pedestal out from 
under him. Wreck or not, Lee's career was in need of a major salvage job. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years on, a salvage job appears to be well underway. The Arthur Lee who 
pulls up to the appointed restaurant in a long, black Lincoln Town Car proves 
to be an upbeat, accommodating figure. Under long frizzy sideburns and a helmet 
of curly, tied-back hair, he looks a little weathered but not worse for the 
wear. He still seems youthful for his 49 years, and with his slender frame 
draped in an all-black get-up that includes tight jeans and tan suede boots 
with chains around the ankles, Lee, who stands over 6 feet tall, looks every 
inch a rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 He chats in a voice that has hues both smokey and sweetly mild and breaks 
every so often into a wheezy laugh. Lee still has plenty of ego, and his 
wariness of the music business remains, like Van Morrison's, an apparently 
ingrained part of his makeup. But Lee's boastfulness no longer seems so much 
the self-massaging of a bruised ego. Instead, it can be construed as the 
Ali-style self-proclaiming of a man who is trying to bolster himself for 
another bout in the heavyweight ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The tools for Lee's attempt to climb back on the contender's list are in the 
Lincoln's trunk -- the guitar and amplifier he will later carry to a North 
Hollywood studio where he has been working on demo tapes that he hopes will win 
him a new recording deal. The evidence that he has a chance is in a large, 
black briefcase in his front seat. After rummaging through its clutter of 
cassette tapes, Lee turns off an oldies station that has been playing the 
Supremes. (Lee jokes about how out-of-date he is when it comes to the 
contemporary rock scene: "The last name I remember in music is James Brown, I 
think.") 
</P>
<P>
 He slips in tapes from recent studio sessions and live shows. There's an old 
Love song, "Your Mind and We Belong Together," powerfully redone with a hard 
edge supplied by Baby Lemonade, a band of young Los Angeles players he has been 
working with over the past year. A new composition, "That's the Way It Goes," 
is a lovely folk-rock ballad with an insinuating lilt. As it plays, Lee leans 
back in the driver's seat, eyes closed, head bobbing, a pleased look on his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born Arthur Porter Taylor in Memphis. His mother, Agnes, now 91, was a 
school-teacher who brought him up with traditional Southern respect for manners 
and politeness. Lee says he saw little of his natural father, Chester Taylor, 
who was a cornet player in Memphis. Lee says he can remember listening while an 
aunt spent mornings there playing blues records and listening to Nat King Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lee was 5, his mother moved her only child to Los Angeles. Six years 
later, his mother married Clinton Lee, a tradesman who did carpentry, plumbing 
and construction. By then, Lee says, musical fascination had already arrived 
for him -- on four legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy would come by with a pony, advertising his (music) studio. That pony 
was his gimmick." Little Arthur ran out to see the pony; his mother signed him 
up for accordion lessons. By his mid-teens, he was playing keyboards in Los 
Angeles clubs.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee says his mother backed his music but his stepfather couldn't see the 
point.  
</P>
<P>
 "My father believed in a hard day's work. If you didn't sweat and all that 
stuff, you weren't a man. He said I'd never be nothin.' He said, 'Listen to 
this guy playing on "Lawrence Welk." You can't do that.' The more he said it, 
the more I was convinced I had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides music, Lee was keen on athletics, including running track and playing 
basketball in high school and junior high. (He also liked to raise pigeons and 
still keeps pigeons at his home in Sherman Oaks.) 
</P>
<P>
 With friends from Dorsey High School, he started an instrumental R&B band 
called Arthur Lee and the LAG's (for Los Angeles Group). It was patterned after 
Booker T and the MG's (for Memphis Group), and like their model, the LAG's were 
a racially integrated band. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1964, Lee was a Beatlemaniac and a Stones freak -- one of the few 
teen-agers in his predominantly black neighborhood who got excited when the 
Beatles made their landmark U.S. television debut on the Ed Sullivan Show. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Lee was hanging out at the Los Angeles club, Ciro's, watching the 
indigenous response to the British Invasion.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the Byrds and my head spinned around like Linda Blair," Lee said. "I 
heard 'Mr. Tambourine Man,' and I didn't have to hear any more. I'd been 
writing things like that for a long time, but it didn't fit the show (on the 
R&B stages he was then playing). It wasn't dance music; it was folk rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee saw being black not as a barrier to playing the white kids' rock, but as 
an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no black people singing Beatles records or the Byrds. I chose that 
because it was the opposite, just to see if it would work. My thing was to 
sound Caucasian, instead of the run of the mill. Johnny Mathis, I picked up a 
lot of stuff from him. God gave me this gift, to use a lot of different voices 
in this style I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who was developing a mod look that featured bandannas, leather jackets 
and thin, diamond-shaped sunglasses, recruited a lineup that included Brian 
Mac- Lean, a Byrds roadie who had the flash, Carnaby Street image he wanted for 
his band. MacLean would earn his keep in the early Love as a strong 
second-chair singer and songwriter behind Lee, who was the dominant musical 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Love soon became the hottest band in L.A. Lee fondly remembers selling out the 
Whisky and other local clubs for nights on end. 
</P>
<P>
 Love didn't tour, Lee said, because "we had the West Coast sewn up," and 
because "I didn't trust nobody. I wasn't going on the road and play for $20 
when I could play at the Fillmore for thousands. I had it made in one place, 
and I was kind of leery of going to a place I'd never been. I think I 
definitely made a few wrong decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 As the '60s turned into the '70s, Lee admits, "I kind of got lost. The failure 
of his 1974 album, "Reel to Reel," ushered in what Lee refers to as his period 
"on the couch" -- years when he didn't record and performed only sporadically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt, 'I'm tired of the music business, wondering where my money is.' I 
quit doing music. I was hanging out with the guys on the corner, back in the 
'hood again, in the house my father built." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee says he was needed at home because his stepfather was ailing with terminal 
cancer, and he wanted to help his aging mother care for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Lee ever feel his career was finished? 
</P>
<P>
 "Never that. Just that I needed a rest. But I didn't choose the (long) rest I 
got, I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee played sporadically in Los Angeles clubs during the late '70s and '80s, 
"but it wasn't really serious. It was just to sustain and keep jamming." 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, Lee had trouble sustaining a decent show, according to 
Robert Leslie Dean, a Love admirer who watched the band's rise in the 1960s and 
befriended Lee in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen him where I basically gave up on him. Terrible, very embarrassing 
concerts in the late '70s and early '80s. Probably a series of factors was 
involved. Take a pick whether it's substance abuse, personnel changes in the 
band or trying to outdo himself and come up with something hipper than 'Forever 
Changes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After Lee emerged again in 1989, Mark Linn, a young, novice booking agent with 
a deep affection for Lee's music, contacted him and started trying to revive 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just kind of his own worst enemy for a while," Linn said from his 
Chicago office. "He was feeling kind of defeated, feeling like he should have 
had more success than he did. He was getting up, maybe drinking a bit, watching 
TV, not accomplishing much." 
</P>
<P>
 But Linn liked some of the new songs Lee would sing him over the phone and 
began making contacts with independent record companies on his behalf. There 
was interest, Linn said, but there were a lot of negative perceptions to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people hear these wild stories and think he's an acid casualty. I've 
been on tours with him where he has been completely straight and people in the 
audience say, 'He's got to be so high right now.' People expect it of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee doesn't like to dwell on that aspect of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs are a bad write-up for people that read the newspapers," he said 
simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Linn helped Lee get back on the road for East Coast tours, hooking him up with 
good, young musicians (Lee's East Coast band features members of Das Damen and 
Cell). A French label, New Rose, heard Lee's new songs, and in 1992 issued 
"Arthur Lee and Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing primarily with musicians he had first worked with in the 1970s, Lee 
came up with a respectable album that proved his voice was intact. The leadoff 
track, "Five String Serenade," proved that his muse hadn't deserted him, 
either: It's one of the most gorgeous ballads of his career (the Los Angeles 
band, Mazzy Star did a fine version on its excellent 1993 album, "So Tonight 
That I Might See"). 
</P>
<P>
 Lee got a hero's welcome on a 1992 tour of England. Linn thinks it gave him an 
important boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reception completely blew his mind. All the shows were sold out and 
packed with 16- and 17-year-old kids with homemade Love T-shirts who sang along 
with every word. Although he acted pretty cool, I think he was emotionally 
knocked out." 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest task, Linn said, was rehabilitating Lee's reputation in his 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up against incredible resistance in L.A. Nobody wanted to book him. 
He'd just about worn out his welcome everywhere. Every single club had a horror 
story about him." 
</P>
<P>
 That problem was solved by Tom Sweeney, a Los Angeles booking agent and 
old-line Love fan. Sweeney saw Lee playing a small-club gig in Santa Monica 18 
months ago and approached him with ideas for bigger shows. One idea was that 
Lee should team up with a younger, more energetic set of players.  
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney said he put Lee in touch with Baby Lemonade, a racially diverse Los 
Angeles band of four rockers in their mid-20s who all were great Love fans. The 
band became Lee's regular backup unit for West Coast dates. With promoters 
unwilling to take a risk on Lee, Sweeney rented out clubs himself to showcase 
his ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the bigger (clubs) saw that Arthur was not only showing up at the gigs, 
but the performances were getting good reviews, everybody felt much more 
comfortable working with him," said Sweeney, who now handles Lee's West Coast 
bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, the Love fan and Lee associate who had given up on his shows in the 
early '80s, became curious when he saw that Lee had been booked last year to 
play the Troubadour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a chance on seeing what his latest folly would be, and he blew me 
away," Dean said of that April, 1993 concert. "Every successive gig has been 
fantastic. It amazes me that Arthur has picked himself up by the bootstraps and 
gotten back into it with a real fire to reclaim his place." 
</P>
<P>
 Good things continue to happen for Lee in 1994. A tiny Pennsylvania label, 
Dimensions Records, issued "Girl on Fire," a vinyl 45 he cut with Baby 
Lemonade, and it found the veteran and the youngsters wailing together with 
punk-rock intensity. A 10-show East Coast tour during the winter climaxed with 
a New York City club date that won rave reviews from Rolling Stone and the New 
York Times. Both critics concluded that Lee was singing better than he had on 
his classic '60s recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee also is the object of veneration on a new album, "We're All Normal and We 
Want Our Freedom: A Tribute to Arthur Lee and Love." The Alias Records release 
is a heartfelt but uneven effort, mostly by bands from the deep indie 
underground. Love fanatics may want it; others (meaning anyone with an affinity 
for '60s rock) should start with "Forever Changes" and Rhino's "Best of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Lee was back in England, playing at the Royal Albert Hall on a 
bill celebrating the 10th anniversary of Creation Records, the independent 
label that launched such contemporary rock acts as the Jesus And Mary Chain, 
Ride, Primal Scream and My Bloody Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see one hole. It's the first thing I looked for," laughs Lee, 
Beatles fan to the core, referring to "A Day in the Life" and its cryptic 
vision of holes filling the Albert Hall. "It's the most beautiful place I ever 
played." 
</P>
<P>
 Having been hailed as an icon on his trips to England, Lee says he is thinking 
about moving there.  
</P>
<P>
 "The glamour and praise would be good for my ego. To know that people are in 
my corner would make we want to do what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem that booking agent Linn sees is Lee's difficulty believing that a 
business team -- something vital to furthering a musical career -- will ever be 
in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible. He doesn't trust anybody at all," Linn said. "There are some 
young people out there now who are really trying to help him, and he'll think 
they're trying to rip him off. We've had our ups and downs where he's accused 
me of ripping him off, where I really haven't. I think he knows deep down that 
I'm (working with him) because I love him as a great musician, and most of the 
time as a person, too. I think the problem is he's getting older and he'd like 
things to move a little faster." 
</P>
<P>
 While it's still in doubt whether Lee can fashion a business vehicle to carry 
his career as far as his talent might allow, he certainly has high hopes when 
it comes to setting a destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to have a No. 1 record and to be the No. 1 entertainer in the world," 
Lee says matter-of-factly when asked about his goals. "You people don't have a 
king, and I don't have a throne." 
</P>
<P>
 As his friend, Dean, points out, Lee will have accomplished a great deal 
simply by sustaining the level of musical quality and personal renewal he 
already has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen Arthur ugly, ugly inside and out," Dean said, referring to bad 
times in the 1970s. "But I went over Arthur's place last year, and I couldn't 
believe I was sitting with the same person. He was generous and kind. It's a 
new day, a new beginning, and he ain't like that. As long as he keeps doing 
what he's doing, and not doing what he's not doing, I think some amazing, 
long-overdue recognition will be accorded him. He was down for the count, and 
he is better than ever. If Arthur can come back the way he is, there's hope for 
everybody. "

COMEDY; THE ODD COUPLING; BUT SUCCESS, MUTUAL RESPECT KEEP MACK & JAMIE 
TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for the Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One's a liberal Northerner and 25-year vegetarian. The other's a conservative 
Southerner who loves a good steak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mack is a rabid carnivore," Jamie Alcroft said, referring to Mack Dryden, the 
meat-eating half of the Mack & Jamie comedy team. "He'd actually like a 
restaurant where you could hunt your meal. If it blinks, I don't eat it. We 
constantly surprise each other with our stupid opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 But just because Dryden sees a meal where Alcroft sees a life form, doesn't 
mean automatic incompatibility. There's a simple, overriding reason they've 
been together since linking up in 1978 in Key West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We crack each other up. We genuinely find each other funny," Alcroft said in 
a recent phone interview from his L.A. home. "We've been through a lot 
together, and we're still together because every step of the way we've met with 
success. When you look at someone who reminds you of your success, it's easy to 
be around them." (Given that context, then, Alcroft must certainly have meant 
it as a compliment when he earlier said his partner looked like a cross between 
Sting and E.T.) 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, their act is as disparate as its creators. They constantly surprise 
people (and each other). Unfortunately, that sort of variety doesn't lend 
itself to simple definition. The show is part stand-up, part musical, part 
parody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a comedy team makes it difficult for people to package you," Dryden 
said in a separate phone conversation. "Roseanne was a whiny housewife. Tim 
Allen a tool guy. It's hard to define us in one line like that. We do something 
different every two minutes. I'll play a dumb guy and Jamie will be a smart 
guy. Then I'll be a smart guy and Jamie will be a dumb guy. We'll do something 
musical, something incredibly slapstick, then something very sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes for an interesting show, which the pair will bring to the 
Irvine Improv from Friday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers started by putting together comedy revues in South Florida 
before taking on New York City comedy clubs, which led to Los Angeles and two 
spots on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson. That brought them to the 
attention of Viacom, which offered the pair a chance to write and perform on 
"Comedy Break," a syndicated show in 1985 and '86. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, "Comedy Break" didn't prove to be their big break, and neither 
did a movie they were in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in '85 or '86, we did 'Million Dollar Mystery,' produced by Dino de 
Laurentis," said Dryden, who later played Scotty the bartender on ABC's 
"Paradise" series for three seasons starting in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a couple of bumbling FBI agents. We lost poor Dino about $20 
million. As Yogi Berra once said, 'They stayed away in droves.' We were hoping 
someone would see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dryden was quick to add, however, that the movie's premise might have aided in 
its demise: It asked viewers to look for clues to solve a mystery and send in 
their answers, with a chance at winning $1 million. That was too much 
participation to ask, Dryden concluded. Plus, Alcroft added, the film was 
marketed as a contest rather than a comedy. (Incidentally, the movie can be 
seen on Cinemax later this month.) 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than lament their time on the cusp (which finds them far from 
starving), the pair remain busy. Ideally, they'd like to land a TV series, 
which could lead to movie roles, preferably something more fruitful than 
"Million Dollar Mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 The duo can be heard on the radio, including local spots on KLOS' "5 O'Clock 
Funnies" and national syndication on about 300 stations through the Premiere 
Radio Network, an L.A.-based comedy service they've been connected with for 
about five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, Dryden, who has a master's degree in creative writing from the 
University of Southern Mississippi, concentrates on his writing. He finished 
two screenplays in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a producer interested in one," he said. "It's all just talk now. You 
write things and just hope you get better by doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcroft is into voice-overs. If you've seen the popular Whiskas cat-food 
commercial, he's the little green lovebird's voice. (It is not, he clarifies, a 
parrot. And its name is not Whiskas. It has no name.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Feed your kitties Whiskas," Alcroft began, breaking into what he calls the 
bird's Eurotrash accent. "They stay healthy and I stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair also plumbs the lucrative corporate convention circuit, which has 
seen Gillette fly them to Sydney and Nissan take them on a Caribbean cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably do three or four overnighters a month during the season, 
corporate stuff," said Alcroft, who is married to ice-skating choreographer 
Sarah Kawahara and has three children. "They pay very well so you only have to 
do two or three a month. So if CBS calls, you're not on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't always such responsible homebodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1980 when we got to L.A., we were two single guys," said Dryden, now a 
fortysomething single parent with one daughter. "We'd stay up 'til 4 every 
morning and sleep until 2. When you have a family, that changes. You start 
plotting ways to stay in town, to make money without getting on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of conventions, which are invisible venues. When you perform in 
front of morticians in West Virginia or bean shippers in Idaho, you don't get 
your name out. We've gotten our home and professional lives to a settled spot 
so we can start going out again. We're fired up. We're writing new stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 That new stuff (and the old stuff) is among the cleanest in the business. 
Alcroft says it's simply a matter of artistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to craft a joke that's clean," explained Alcroft, also 
fortysomething. "We're not puritans or fundamentalists. I guess we wanted our 
family and friends to come see us, and we didn't want to be different people 
than we were in real life."  
</P>
<P>
 * Who: Mack & Jamie. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Friday, July 22, at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; Saturday, July 23, at 8 and

<P>

</P>
<P>

 Flipper 
</P>
<P>
 "Album -- Generic Flipper" (1981) 
</P>
<P>
 Def American  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike its fellow punk contemporaries such as the Dead Kennedys and Millions 
of Dead Cops, Flipper blazed onto the early '80s underground rock scene with a 
moniker that was more cute than threatening. The San Francisco band clearly 
understood that the true punk spirit was about breaking rules rather than 
blindly following them. 
</P>
<P>
 Individualists to the core, Flipper played like no other band, and its music 
was anything but cute. Its droning, dissonant and often lumbering material 
stood in sharp contrast to the high-speed rants that dominated the punk 
movement of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Flipper played at a slower tempo, the tracks on its debut disc, 
"Album -- Generic Flipper," still manage to pack plenty of tension and visceral 
power. In "Ever" and the monolithic, 8 1/2-minute "(I Saw You) Shine," grinding 
guitars combine with dirgy bass lines and rolling drum patterns to help convey 
the group's generally dour world view. And with the album's cornerstone track, 
"The Way of the World," Flipper exhibits its penchant for serving up darkly 
philosophical lyrics: "There are dreams left empty and blank and legs that have 
ceased to walk/That's the way of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "Album" is in no way a commercial venture. Most of its tracks are defined more 
by their abrasive, though mesmerizing grooves than any well-honed sense of 
melody. In addition, the vocals tend to be shouted rather than sung. The song 
"Life Is Cheap" is fairly typical of the album, its powerfully forbidding mood 
established through a corrosive and insistent instrumental attack. Somewhat 
less typical is the gloriously noisy "Sex Bomb" -- a lengthy, uptempo song with 
horns, humor and one lyric ("She's a sex bomb baby, yeah") that's repeated over 
and over again like a punk mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 If they taught Punk Rock 101 in college, "Album -- Generic Flipper" would 
absolutely be required listening. JON MATSUMOTO

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manu Dibango 
</P>
<P>
 "Wakafrika" 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Records  
</P>
<P>
 On the cover of "Wakafrika," Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango is posed so 
that his body forms the shape of the African continent, with a shoe removed to 
represent Madagascar. While the CD inside doesn't quite encompass the entire 
continent, it isn't for want of trying, and the result is one of the most 
adventurous musical atlases you're likely to find this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dibango was one of the first African artists to take his music to an 
international audience, with 1972's "Soul Makossa." The makossa was a popular 
Cameroonian dance rhythm, and it ran through the song's percussion parts, as 
well as Dibango's sub-basement deep chants and his sax playing, which he used 
half as a staccato rhythm instrument and half as a honking homage to American 
soul master King Curtis. The song became a disco and pop hit around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a remake of "Soul Makossa" here, and, like most of the album's other 
tracks, it's given a stellar spin. Dibango is joined on the song by Senegalese 
singing sensation Youssou N'Dour -- who sends the melody spiraling with his 
passionate vocal -- while other numbers boast South Africa's Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo and Ray Phiri, Nigeria's King Sunny Ade, Malian Salif Keita and even 
pale old Peter Gabriel, who appears on a relatively sanguine version of his 
"Biko." Gabriel's remarkable drummer, Manu Katche, propels most of the tracks, 
and a close listen will reveal Sinead O'Connor singing backup on four of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dibango seems happy to play in the shadow of his guests, but when he steps 
forward there's some heated blowing. The standout number in the set is "Jingo," 
a song by drum master Babate Olatunji, the first artist to present African 
music to the West in the late 1950s. The number was popularized by Santana, 
whose stardom had been cemented by his propulsive Woodstock rendition of the 
song.

 Here, "Jingo" is pushed even higher by the relentless cross-currents of 
Nigerian juju rhythms, over which rides one of Ade's more compelling vocals and 
some positively molten tenor playing from Dibango. JIM WASHBURN

WANNA DANCE?: LEAVE YOUR BRIEFCASE AT HOME; THE MOOD HERE IS ROMANTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Indulging in champagne and jazzy vibes at some swanky supper club often seems 
the stuff of another era -- and Carmen Miranda or Elvis movies. But these 
places do still exist and are as reachable as the Club Grill at the 
Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel (which is actually in Dana Point, by the way). 
</P>
<P>
 What the Club Grill lacks in the way of wild pizazz and grand orchestras 
commonly found in the old supper clubs, it more than makes up for in ambience. 
The mood here is intimate and very romantic, complete with low lighting, a 
single red rose on every table and a dressy but relaxed atmosphere. Couples of 
all ages will find this the ideal place for a special evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The equestrian-themed prints, paintings and sculptures throughout the supper 
club, as well as the semi-regal English decor, inspire some guests to tux up, 
but a jacket and tie are not required. Even though the dress code specifies 
evening attire, a woman was spotted recently in a long white gauze dress and 
clean, white Keds. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples can dance the night away (and they probably would if the club stayed 
open that long) to a charming quartet performing spirited new and old 
favorites, usually ones about love. Gayle & Company take the stage nightly, 
with a repertoire including hits by Dionne Warwick, Astruid Gilberto and 
Whitney Houston, as well a few from Broadway and the movies. ("As Time Goes 
By," used in "Casablanca," fits the Grill perfectly.) True, it's a night of 
KBIG covers live, but nothing sets the lovey-dovey scene better.  
</P>
<P>
 Bands are scheduled for a three-month run; Gayle & Company will finish up in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 A small parquet dance floor fits about eight couples comfortably and sees at 
least that much action, even on a Sunday. To the ballroom-shy: no need to 
worry. In contrast to other places that attract Freds and Gingers intent on 
putting everyone to shame, technique is less of a concern here. 
</P>
<P>
 Although guests come mostly for the food (the menu includes duck, venison and 
lobster entrees, from $21 to $40), it would be a loss to consider this just a 
restaurant with great grilled meats, seafood and a to-die-for Caesar salad 
prepared table side for two ($15).  
</P>
<P>
 Just drinks and appetizers, with a little dancing thrown in, can make for a 
memorable night. Snack on escargots and wild mushrooms in a phyllo pastry with 
warm goat cheese and roasted peppers for $13, or salmon with herbed vegetables 
for $12. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar selection boggles the mind. Just about everything is available, 
including 25-year-old Glengrant single malt Scotch at $18 a glass. And keep 
your excitement under control if you're a wine lover: More than 600 varieties 
of wine from around the world are available. Word is that the decade-old hotel 
is hoping to land the grand award from the Wine Spectator this year. Wines by 
the bottle range from a $22 house brand to a $1,700 port -- 1931 Quinta Do 
Noval. A glass of wine is $5 to $15. A $12 glass of Piper Heidsieck champagne 
is recommended by the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer lovers will have to do without draft, but the selection of world-class 
beers makes up for that: Sapporo, Guinness Pilsner, Bass Ale, Anchor Steam, Red 
Tail Ale, Amstel Light, Becks Dark and more at $5.50 a bottle. Domestic bottles 
from the Coors and Bud families are $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells are $6.75; liqueurs and cordials, $6.75 to $8.50; sodas and tonic water, 
$3.25, and tasty nonalcoholic, fruity drinks, $5.75. Or finish the day with a 
cappuccino or other coffee drinks, $2 to $3.50.  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, cruise the hotel grounds. The cliff overlooking the Pacific is 
particularly inspiring.  
</P>
<P>
 All cars are valet parked at the Ritz-Carlton for $5.

BENEFIT; SCR CULTIVATES TALENT FROM THE ROOTS OF LATINO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 George Lopez may be one of comedy's hot commodities, but he doesn't flinch at 
giving it away to help raise money for South Coast Repertory's Hispanic 
Playwrights Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't do enough for SCR," said Lopez, who Saturday will host this year's 
annual night of entertainment to benefit the Costa Mesa theater's 9-year-old 
project, in which unproduced plays by Latino writers are developed in two-week 
workshops at SCR, then given staged readings there.  
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing about the Hispanic Playwrights Project," Lopez said, "is that 
you're cultivating talent. . . . I went to school in the San Fernando Valley, 
with mostly lower-middle-class kids, and no one ever came in to cultivate our 
talents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Raices: Una Noche del Teatro '94" (Spanish for "Roots: A Night of Theater") 
will celebrate "the indigenous cultures of the Americas" with comedy, music, 
dance and theater by Los Angeles and Orange county-based artists. The evening 
will also benefit SCR's youth outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers include Alturas, an Andean music group; Parmelee, a Chicano a 
capella ensemble; Los Tlacuilos Bribiescas, a group presenting music and dance 
of the Americas; singers Edna Alvarez, Christine Avila and Teresa Velarde, and 
musicians Marcos Loya and Francisco Gonzalez. Also, playwright/performance 
artist Luis Alfaro -- whose play "Straight as a Line" will be developed in this 
year's playwright's project and read Aug. 6 -- will present an autobiographical 
work about growing up as a Chicano in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 (The project, which begins Saturday, will work on four scripts to be read Aug. 
5 and 6.) 
</P>
<P>
 Besides acting as host, Lopez will deliver his brand of stand-up comedy, 
which, he said in a recent phone interview, "targets people who are 
separatists, or anti-diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is a great forum for that," said the comedian, who also emceed 
last year's fifth annual, sold-out "Noche." "In my idealist world, it would be 
nice to have just men and women, and it wouldn't matter what race you are. . . 
. In fact, I'm working on a stand-up act (to be performed entirely) in the 
dark, because in the dark, we're all the same." 
</P>
<P>
 On a somewhat lighter note, the comedian, whose numerous television 
appearances include a recent Showtime special and several visits to Johnny 
Carson's and Arsenio Hall's late-night shows, gave a sample of what Saturday's 
audience might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll talk about the fact that Mexican food is more popular than Mexican 
people," he said, "and how the police, instead of using mace, are using cayenne 
pepper spray. I really think that's just to make us hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 * What: "Raices: Una Noche del Teatro '94." 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, July 23, at 6:30 p.m. Pre-performance reception with hors 
d'oeuvres; dessert and coffee service after the show. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: South Coast Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to Bristol Avenue and head 
north to Town Center Drive. Take a right. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $35 unassigned seating; $100 reserved seating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 957-4033.

KID STUFF: SAND BLAST; SAN CLEMENTE OCEAN FEST KEEPS CRABS AT BAY ON THE 
WATER'S EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tell me you haven't been there. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a perfect Southern California day; the air is warm, the breeze light and 
your kids, amazingly, are infection-free, so you decide to take the brood to 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, your crammed mini-van is circling the parking lot like a hyena 
closing in on a lame zebra. When you finally nab a space, you unload and begin 
a trek to the sand -- think Hannibal's journey across the Alps, only with more 
beach toys -- where you commandeer the first available spot and heave your 
weary, grit-coated bod to the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 You know what happens next. After seven corn dogs, three trips to the restroom 
("Don't touch anything !") and half a sandcastle, your children turn their 
sunscreen-slathered faces to yours and utter the words that have frayed adult 
nerves since Cain and Abel were in training pants: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm booooored. Let's go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Weary parents, lay down your swim rings and rejoice. The friendly folk of the 
San Clemente Ocean Festival come to your aid this weekend with three days of 
music, entertainment, games and sporting events they say will please 
beach-goers large and small without breaking the piggy bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th annual festival begins Friday at the San Clemente Community Center 
with "Meet the Surfing and Southern California Lifeguard Legends," a free 
reception honoring noted surfers and lifeguards from the past 30 years, a 
surfing-themed video and live music. The event continues through Sunday with 
events on and around San Clemente pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as "The Greatest Show on Surf," the San Clemente Ocean Festival has 
evolved from a lifeguards' athletic competition to a community event expected 
this year to attract 20,000 visitors with activities ranging from a display of 
vintage Woodies (the wood-paneled station wagons popular with surfers in the 
'40s and '50s) to children's games with intriguing titles such as Lobster 
Shuffle and Crab Scurry to a new, family-friendly beach party and concert. 
</P>
<P>
 But the original intent hasn't been buried in the sand. Organizers say 
teaching the public about beach and ocean safety and giving them a chance to 
appreciate the lifeguard's role remain the event's primary goals. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., the California Surf Lifesaving Assn. 
Regional Championships will feature professional lifeguards from across the 
state in Ironman and Ironwoman competitions, a surf swim and rescue races, 
among others. One of the most popular of these competitions is the surfboat 
race, said festival committee member Paula Laskelle. 
</P>
<P>
 Commonly known as a dory, the 325-pound fiberglass, wood-rail boat has been 
largely replaced by surfboards as a rescue vehicle, but the race, in which 
two-person teams row through the surf, round markers and return to shore, makes 
for some exciting viewing, Laskelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty daring event. The surf's usually five or six feet, minimum, and 
the boats are constantly crashing into each other. People get a huge kick out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m. in the children's pavilion, youngsters can take 
part in an ocean-safety workshop lead by lifeguard and noted surfer Richard 
Chew and Lt. Bill Humphreys of San Clemente's Marine Safety Division. Other 
diversions to be held in and near the pavilion both days include face-painting, 
cartooning by South County artist Curt Visca and children's games and races, a 
bodyboard race and a kid/parent swim. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, the San Clemente surf band the Eliminators don vintage 
sharkskin suits and perform surf classics from 6 to 8 p.m. in a free concert 
during the First Annual Beach Blanket Party. Visitors can take their own food 
or purchase grilled fish, ribs or hot dogs there. 
</P>
<P>
 A team sand-sculpture competition begins Sunday's lineup. Teams may include up 
to 10 people, and there is no minimum age to compete. Registration begins at 
6:30 a.m., with judging about noon, depending on high tide. This year, 
competitors may use biodegradable coloring (Jell-O powder should be a popular 
choice, Laskelle said) to enhance their sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 Other activities include the Doheny Longboard Assn.'s invitational surfing 
contest and a 5K and other public athletic events on Sunday morning, an 
all-ages fishing derby Saturday and Sunday mornings and a rubber duck derby on 
Sunday afternoon. Exhibitors of surfing and ocean-themed art by Oceanside's 
Waterman Surf Art Gallery and the creation of a large chalk mural by local 
artists will continue Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize parking woes ("What? I thought you brought the quarters!"), 
festival organizers have set up free shuttle service between San Clemente High 
School and the pier. An information booth will be open near the pier with a 
complete schedule of events on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: 18th Annual San Clemente Ocean Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Friday, July 22, from 5 to 10 p.m.; Saturday, July 23, from 7 a.m. to 
8 p.m. and Sunday, July 24, from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Friday at San Clemente Community Center, corner of Avenida del Mar 
and Calle Seville; Saturday and Sunday on and around San Clemente Municipal 
Pier, Avenida del Mar at Victoria and adjacent to Parque del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: To reach the parking area at San Clemente High School, take the 
San Diego (5) Freeway to Avenida Pico and drive inland. Parking there is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Festival admission is free. Entry fees for the public 
competitions range from a $5 flat fee for the children's events to $25 for the 
team sand-sculpture registration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 440-6141. MORE KID STUFF IN ANAHEIM: FAMILY CIRCUS 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, July 22, at 6:30 p.m., San Francisco's Make-a-Circus troupe stages 
its show-cum-children's workshop at Pearson Park Amphitheatre. After a 
performance, the artists teach children circus skills, then lead them in an 
original show. $1 to $2. (714) 254-5274.  
</P>
<P>
 IN FULLERTON: NATIVE AMERICAN STORIES 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown, an Apache descendant, will share Apache creation stories, 
including tales about his people's coming-of-age ceremony for young girls, in 
an outdoor program Saturday, July 23, at 7:30 p.m. at the Fullerton Museum

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: BREAKING AWAY FOR THE CLEAN, CRISP WAVES IN 
TAHITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After returning from two weeks in Tahiti, a place where reef waves are clean 
and crisp and Tahitian hospitality is alive and well, I learned that Rockin' 
Fig is headed to the U.S. amateur championships in Florida! 
</P>
<P>
 Fig: Yeah, the kid got lucky, that's all I can say. But I'm looking forward to 
surfing Sebastian Inlet in Florida during Thanksgiving week. The contest will 
have all the top seeds from the West, Gulf, and East coasts, in addition to 
Hawaii. But, hey! How was the trip?  
</P>
<P>
 Beautiful. I stayed in a place called Papara, and surfed a beach break near 
the Taharu river mouth where the surf was from four to six feet. Crystal clear 
ocean water. Black-sand beaches. And, on several occasions, I paddled out to a 
reef break about a half-mile from shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahhh, you got away from the rat race huh?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes. No smog. Plenty of beautiful stars at night. And, I got to stay with a 
Tahitian family. My host was Christophe Holozet, president of Popoti Surf Club 
-- Tahiti's No. 1 surfing group. The trip was set up through the Laguna 
Beach-based Kalos Kagathos Foundation as a cultural exchange with about 23 
young men and women from Southern California. The coach was pro surfer Jim 
Hogan from San Clemente. He also coaches the National Scholastic Surfing Assn. 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tahitian surfers were hot. They took most of the top places for the "Horue 
'94" contest, except two Australians took juniors and cadets. In longboard, I 
saw Teva Noble, Tahiti's 1992 amateur world champion, and Michel Demont, 
another Tahitian who won the world championship in Brazil this year. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Emere David, world pro surfer Vetea David's mom. A gracious lady, she 
lives in Papeete, which is about 35 miles away, but every day she visited the 
contest. She's also a healer -- like our physical therapists in the U.S., but 
she uses relaxation and touches the body's stress points. Several of the U.S. 
team members had a session with her and came away feeling "better and 
energized." 
</P>
<P>
 Was her son there?  
</P>
<P>
 No, she said he was at Reunion Island surfing in a competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Say Reyes, did you have to take your shoes off, like they do in Hawaii?  
</P>
<P>
 Yup, that's a big deal in Tahiti. I mistakenly walked in with my shoes on the 
first day and Holozet's wife, Moea, gave me a dead-eye stare. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig, they said Tom Curren, former three-time world champion, had been to 
Tahiti two weeks earlier. He got smacked on a reef on nearby Huahine Island and 
left immediately after getting scraped up. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, it could happen to anybody. What did you eat?  
</P>
<P>
 Lots of fish, which is high on their diet. I was drinking beer one night and 
woke up early the next morning expecting an egg or maybe a pancake, and they 
had this big plate of fried fish. It took some getting used to, but their fish 
is excellent; it's sweet and delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, brain food. How much did the trip cost?  
</P>
<P>
 About $700. The deal with the exchange was that each person pay $150 to their 
host family for food. The families were incredible. Gracious and friendly and 
they are so anxious to learn about California. I could have stayed in a hotel 
but it wouldn't have been the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like you met some nice people, and learned some of their culture too.  
</P>
<P>
 And, it's expensive there. A six-pack of beer costs about $10, and a pack of 
U.S. cigarettes, $5. Gasoline was $5 a gallon. So, it was good to keep the 
costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 Trip tip: Surfers should take plenty of mosquito repellent, and netting is a 
good idea. They sell mosquito coils, which you light each evening to ward off 
the flying blood-sucking devils, but beware, the coil smoke is potent. And, 
remember, "thank you" in Tahitian is "mauruuru," pronounced ma-rue-rue . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fame: The results of the Huntington Beach Walk of Fame balloting are in. The 
winners and their categories as determined by surf journalists, prominent 
surfers and industry representatives are: Robert August, local hero; Tom Blake,

DO IT!: OPEN WATER SWIM IS NOTHING LIKE THE LAPS OF LUXURY

 Every summer, Bob Werth hears lap swimmers tell him about their 
accomplishments in the pool. A half mile in the ocean, they figure, will be a 
piece of cake. Werth knows better. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the current to contend with, along with the chop and the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot different than doing laps," Werth said, understating the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Werth is the organizer of the 44th annual Huntington Beach Open Rough Water 
Pier Swim, to be held Saturday morning. Though he warns lap swimmers that the 
ocean might be tougher than they expect, the city-sponsored event is ideal for 
folks who want to try their stroke in the open water. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it's shorter than most of the summer ocean swims held along the 
county's coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole circuit of these kinds of swims," said Werth, referring to 
others that range from three-quarters of a mile to 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Saturday's event will have plenty of junior lifeguards monitoring the 
race in the water, ready to pluck out anyone who poops out before the finish 
line.  
</P>
<P>
 The event is divided into two swims, one for juniors 12 to 15 years old and 
another for participants 16 and older. Both swims begin with a mass start, with 
the entire field running down the sand into the water. Swimmers will negotiate 
the north side of the pier first, then swing around the end and come back along 
the south side. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, the event has drawn 125 to 150 swimmers annually. Many 
are first-timers with a range of ability levels, Werth said. A few years ago, a 
92-year-old woman tried and made it halfway before catching a ride the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 There are familiar faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some regulars who have been doing it for all 12 years I've been 
(organizing) it," said Werth, a senior recreation supervisor for Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Prize divisions in the adult race include: men, 16 to 24; senior men, 25 to 
31; senior women, 16 to 24; masters men, 32 to 39; grand masters men, 40 to 49; 
masters women, 25 to 39; grand masters women, 40 and older; super masters men, 
50 and older. The race for junior men and junior women, ages 12 to 15, will 
start at 9:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The record for men is 8 minutes, 46 seconds; for women 10:14, but many 
swimmers take twice as long. 
</P>
<P>
 Trophies will be awarded for first, second and third places in each division, 
plus a trophy will go to the first Huntington Beach boy and girl to finish. 
Also, several local swim teams compete for the Gene Belshe Memorial Perpetual 
Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Race-day registration will be held from 8 to 8:30 a.m. The registration 
deadline for T-shirts has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Huntington Beach Open Rough Water Pier Swim. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, July 23, at 9 a.m. for swimmers 16 and older and 9:45 a.m. 
for juniors. Registration will be from 8 to 8:30 a.m.

</P>
<P>

REWIND: TENANTS RAISE PRICE OF PROTECTION IN 'GUARDIAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Guardian," which reflects on what price society pays when its members 
trade freedom and the rule-of-law for security, poses many questions but only 
hints at the answers.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the story of fearful New York apartment-dwellers who hire a security 
guard to keep them safe after a fellow tenant is killed by a thief. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new guardian is John Mack (Louis Gossett Jr.), a former military man 
whose methods are quick and effective but brutal. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Sheen plays Charlie Hyatt, a tenant who at first supports hiring Mack 
but comes to believe that the guard may be as bad as the people he's supposed 
to protect tenants from. 
</P>
<P>
 After one couple's apartment is ransacked just days after its tenants laugh 
off Mack's warnings about improving security, Hyatt suspects the guard may have 
done it to teach them a lesson. After that and other suspicious incidents, Mack 
fatally shoots a heroin addict he caught stealing from an apartment and asserts 
it was self-defense. The tenants celebrate Mack's heroism, but Hyatt believes 
the shooting was murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man was killed. It's hardly a cause for a celebration," Hyatt shouts in 
disbelief. "A junkie's gotten his head blown off, and everyone's having a 
party!"  
</P>
<P>
 While some neighbors are skeptical of Hyatt's suspicions, they agree to 
scrutinize Mack's behavior. Others, however, don't seem to care what Mack does 
to keep them safe, so long as he keeps doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack has a plausible explanation for every suspicion. And, because the 
audience doesn't see everything Mack does, viewers never know for sure whether 
he is a true hero, wrongfully suspected, or a vicious thug. The ambiguity makes 
the film unsettling but extremely interesting.  
</P>
<P>
 It's one of those movies that's entertaining while you watch but also gives 
you something to think about long after it ends. You wonder how strongly you 
really believe in principles of innocent until proven guilty and ends 
justifying the means, especially when you are the one in constant fear of being 
a victim. 
</P>

KIDS ON FILM: THE TRUTH IS, THERE'S MORE TO 'LIES' THAN ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "True Lies," Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a secret super-agent who tries to 
save the world from nuclear-warhead-wielding Arab terrorists while also trying 
to save his marriage to Helen, a secretary who fantasizes about the glamorous 
life her husband, unbeknown to her, actually leads. (Rated R)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's James Bond of the '90s -- more unusual explosions and high-tech gimmickry 
than you might need to see, more self-deprecating comedy and a subplot that 
finds family values triumphing over danger, glamour and sex. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's an Arnold Schwarzennegger, muscle-bound, great-big-weapon action 
flick that is bound to solidify the two camps of parents: those who say the 
high body count and violence is untenable and the others who say, hey, it's 
just a fun movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there seems to be no R rating that can stop kids from pouring 
into whatever movie they want to see -- or that their parents take them to.  
</P>
<P>
 Cousins David Mendelsohn, 10, and Summer Karkoski, 12, said they had meant to 
see the PG-13 rated "Forrest Gump," but it was sold out so they went to "True 
Lies." They were sure this wasn't a movie for young children, but as action 
film buffs, they gave this one two thumbs up. Said Summer: "It was cool. It was 
like really action. It was nonstop." 
</P>
<P>
 David said he liked it better than Schwarzenegger's "Terminator" movies and 
his most recent "Last Action Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more action," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A few examples: Arnold slays a slew of guards at a fancy Washington party; he 
commandeers a police horse to chase a terrorist on a motorcycle through several 
floors of a fancy hotel; he and his wife, who gets drawn into the action, kill 
dozens of terrorists at their compound.  
</P>
<P>
 I've seen bloodier action movies, but this one had a new and disturbing 
wrinkle, particularly considering the current spotlight on domestic violence: 
The women are slapped and called bitches more than once. By movie's end, they 
have become as violent as the men.  
</P>
<P>
 In one scene, Arnold's wife, Helen, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, and the 
terrorists' moll slug it out in a limo. When Helen finally does her in with a 
champagne bottle to the head, the audience cheered and clapped.  
</P>
<P>
 Summer said, "I preferably don't like to be called those names. . . . It's 
sexist." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said the language didn't bother her. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hear it a lot, it doesn't really matter," she said. "But I wouldn't 
advise a little kid to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other scenes, such as a comedic bump and grind Helen performs in a 
G-string for Harry, that are not kid material. There are also scenes of cruelty 
to animals, meant to elicit laughs, that brought gasps from the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, kids had their favorite parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor Clark, 9, remembered the detonation of an atomic warhead.  
</P>
<P>
 David liked a scene with Arnold piloting a high-tech warplane in downtown 
Miami with his 14-year-old daughter hanging onto the nose for dear life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," he said.

SPECIAL SCREENING: FROM 'HAT' TO TAILS, FRED ASTAIRE IS TOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did American dance begin with Fred Astaire? Of course not, it just seems that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Few high-steppers have been lionized like Astaire. Through the movies, he 
became the populist image of what dancing was all about. His glides, leaps and 
taps informed people, made it accessible. Credit the talents of Astaire and the 
influence of film. 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone who knows anything about anything can tell you, he deserved all the 
praise. Nobody in the pictures (not even the athletic Gene Kelly, who managed a 
good-humored rivalry with Astaire for years) was in his class. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I prefer Astaire solo, doing his own thing without the restraints 
imposed by a partner. Astaire alone was a dancer who consciously laid traps and 
puzzles into his routines, then cleverly, happily danced out of them. Astaire 
created the feeling of freedom every time he moved over the floorboards, up the 
walls or across the ceiling, as he did in a famous sequence in "Royal Wedding" 
in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 But his fame really began in the '30s in a series of musicals with Ginger 
Rogers. There were nine in all (every one for RKO, beginning with "Flying Down 
to Rio" in 1933 and ending with "The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle" in 
1939). Perhaps the best, 1935's "Top Hat," opens a three-film series on 
musicals Friday night at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the plot doesn't amount to much. Astaire plays Jerry Travers, a 
carefree entertainer who meets Dale Tremont (Rogers) after his lively tap-dance 
wakes her in the hotel suite below his. She's suspicious of Jerry's smooth ways 
but eventually falls for his cool singing and cooler dancing. Whenever Dale 
starts to stray, Jerry just starts the footwork; he hypnotizes her like a cobra 
in a basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The story takes a comic, mistaken-identity turn when Dale believes Jerry is 
actually Horace (Edward Everett Horton), the husband of her good friend Madge 
(Helen Broderick). Thinking Jerry is a philandering jerk, her love fizzles. But 
there's a spark still there, and Jerry spends the rest of the movie trying to 
rekindle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Mark Sandrich is smart enough to know that Astaire's dancing is the 
best way for Jerry to win Dale back. In between the semi-funny slippings and 
slidings of the plot are a handful of memorable dance routines, reaching an 
apex with the well-known "Cheek to Cheek" sequence near the movie's end. Rogers 
is no Astaire, but she keeps up smartly enough, even in those tall heels. 
</P>
<P>
 The elegance of that number is clear, but a more inventive set-piece comes 
much earlier, sans Rogers. Dancing and singing "Top Hat, White Tie and Tails" 
(one of picture's many fine Irving Berlin tunes), Astaire systematically "guns 
down" his chorus of male dancers, using a staccato of tap steps to waste them 
against an Art Deco backdrop. The scene is at once both lighthearted and moody. 
</P>
<P>
 The series continues July 29 with "42nd Street" (1933) and ends Aug. 5 with 
"Singin' in the Rain" (1952). Arthur Taussig, an Orange Coast film instructor 
and author of The Film Analyst newsletter, will discuss the films before and 
after their screenings.

RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON: WAVES OF CULINARY DELIGHT ARE ASTIR AT THE SUNSET 
GRILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I discovered the nonstop surfing videos playing in the lounge at the 
Sunset Grille and Bar, I nearly backed straight out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think me surfophobic. It's just that I don't generally free-associate 
serious cooking with a restaurant quite this beachy, particularly not a former 
Rib Trader that's decorated with plastic fish, papier-mache alligators and 
wooden flowers ablaze with pastel glory. 
</P>
<P>
 So I was wrong this time. This lighthearted, sun-splashed Dana Point 
restaurant may be whimsical to the very core, but something really special is 
going on in the kitchen. Come casual, but come hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual, definitely. The tables are covered in butcher paper during lunch, 
though there's white linen at dinner. The restaurant is festooned with 
capricious art, marlins, surfer shirts and fish that glow in the dark. Its 
walls are a creamy shade of driftwood, making it all seem fun and relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
 The only one not relaxing is probably head chef Sean Grovier. Grovier is a 
graduate of the Culinary Academy in San Francisco, and his cooking reflects 
California, Louisiana and Europe (some of the many places he has worked). His 
food has a finished quality that one expects only in far pricier or -- dare it 
be said? -- trendier restaurants, an effect most likely achieved through hard 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, two or three of his oeuvres -- crab cakes, spare ribs and barbecue 
chicken salad -- rival any I've eaten. All three are oddly individual, yet they 
represent the best of that elusive ideal, California cuisine, where light, 
fresh products are supposedly cooked with a minimum of fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 The best appetizers actually stretch across the southern half of the United 
States -- for instance, crab cakes with red chili sauce and garlic aioli. 
They're crisp, golden disks, two to an order, each flavored intensely with the 
taste of sweet crab meat. Grovier serves them with two sauces, one red, the 
other yellow, artfully dribbled across the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Roasted poblano chili is another revelation, stuffed with Cheddar and pepper 
Jack and blanketed with a soft, sweet, grainy sauce made from smoked corn and 
cream. As for the smoked baby back ribs with kick-ass barbecue sauce and 
Kentucky whiskey glaze, I can't believe how tender the meat is -- it just falls 
off the bone -- or how wonderfully flavorful the glaze is. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if the crab cakes take a page from L.A.'s seminal Southwestern chef, 
John Sedlar, and "the kick-ass chili" concept is borrowed from Maple Drive in 
Beverly Hills? This is terrific cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, there are delicious sandwiches with good side dishes like 
multicolored cole slaw and tempting, lightly fried yam chips. Smoked turkey 
breast (all smoking is done on the premises by Grovier and his team of young 
chefs) comes on marbled rye with a tasty herbed mayo. A spicy, full-flavored 
Louisiana-style andouille sausage comes on a buttered roll with finely sliced, 
grilled onions and peppers. On top of that, there's a giant tray of at least 13 
mustards. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbecued chicken salad, an entree in its own right, could make a perfect 
lunch. For this, Grovier marinates a chicken breast in achiote and other 
Southwestern flavorings, then juliennes it onto creamy field greens with corn 
kernels, black beans, three-colored corn chips and a mound of light, crisp 
onion rings. A colorful curried shrimp salad is served with bacon, egg, 
coconut, peanuts and chutney, something that would look equally at home on a 
table in Sri Lanka or Tahiti. Come back Stateside with a juicy barbecue burger 
in a fresh onion roll. 
</P>
<P>
 The few weaknesses in this kitchen show in some of the entrees. Roasted pork 
tenderloin is sliced into scallop-sized pieces, then set on a spicy white bean 
ragout. It's good meat, but the kitchen overcooks it, and the spices in the 
bean ragout taste old rather than freshly ground. There's a good-sized hunk of 
roasted prime rib that tastes as if it has been smoked somewhat, though the 
menu doesn't warn you. Order it just to get at the garlic mashed potatoes and 
spicy horseradish-mustard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-nut crusted mahi-mahi is an intriguing idea -- crushed pistachios, 
walnuts and pecans give the fish a rich outer coat. I'd like the fish a little 
better without the vineyard beurre blanc underneath, though. Nuts and butter 
sauce both marry well with meaty fish like mahi-mahi; together, they overwhelm 
it. The poached salmon filet, however, is perfect. It's served pink in the 
center, painted with a unctuous, elegant cilantro cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't expect all the food to be on such a high level here, but I did expect 
fine desserts. Grovier did a pastry apprenticeship for the royal court of 
Denmark, and when I heard one of his desserts was called "chocolate thigh 
cream," that's all I needed to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Grovier makes a great, enormous fruit crisp with an oatmeal topping, big 
enough for three. There is a strawberry mousse pie with an Oreo crumb crust, 
caramel sauce and a name only Julie Andrews could pronounce: 
chocostramellicious. Grovier's creamy banana brulee is inspired. Nothing goes 
quite so well with the smooth, egg rich taste of a creme brulee as these thin 
slices of sweet banana, caramelized around the edges. 
</P>
<P>
 But I never got to taste the "chocolate thigh cream," which is only 
intermittently available. The chef says this pate-like confection of crushed 
macadamia and pecans, cappuccino and amaretto confected with a pound of 
chocolate, a pound of butter and a whole lot of whipped cream is hard to make; 
I'm coming back as soon as he makes more, and I promise not to smear any on my 
surfboard. 
</P>

PARKER'S PLACE: STEP 1: READ; STEP 2: WRITE; REPEAT AS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a year or so I am asked to participate in a "writer's conference," and 
occasionally I accept. Just last month a local school sponsored such an event, 
and I was on a panel to discuss "the writing life." 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat with the other writers at the head of the class, I got to wondering 
if the students were getting their money's worth. Tuition ran something like 
$125 for a two-day enrollment or, strangely, $225 for the full three-day 
treatment. By the standards of tennis pros, fly-fishing instructors or golf 
coaches, these fees aren't outlandish, but let's face it -- you can do a lot 
with $225, even in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 You've probably heard the old saw about the purpose of newspapers being to 
afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted. This is somewhat true. So, 
in the interest of offering the afflicted (people who want to write) the 
comfort of attending a writer's conference without spending all the dough, I 
will now offer a condensed writing program for what you just paid for this 
newspaper -- 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 1: How do I get an agent? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: From a book called "The Writer's Market," available at bookstores 
everywhere. You must be able to write an intriguing one-page query letter 
explaining your work. If you can't write a great one-page letter, chances are 
your manuscript needs work also. Of the 100 agent-seekers I've talked to at 
conferences, maybe three have also had truly good, finished manuscripts. Those 
three have agents now. If you have a good manuscript, an agent is easy to get. 
Until your manuscript is good, don't worry about them. 
</P>
<P>
 OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 2: How did you get your first book published? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: I sent an agent a novel manuscript that had been written, rewritten 
and rewritten again six times over five years. I was thoroughly sick of the 
thing at that point. If you're not sick of your manuscript yet, it probably 
needs more work. Don't send out something you're not tired -- and proud -- of. 
</P>
<P>
 OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 3: Should I enroll in an MFA program in writing? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: If you get accepted, yes; if you don't, no. It doesn't matter. There 
are many more ways to write a book than there are stars in the sky. If you look 
hard enough, you'll find your way. 
</P>
<P>
 OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 4: How important is it that I have a publishing 
track-record? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Not important at all. Writing credits might make an agent or publisher 
a little more interested in your material, but not interested enough to draw 
them into a story that isn't compelling. If you have published before, flaunt 
it. If not, don't worry. 
</P>
<P>
 OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 5: Can writing really be taught? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Yes, but only by you. MFA programs, workshops and writers' conferences 
are just learning aids. Use them if they fit your temperament; eschew them if 
they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 6: Is there a danger that my story idea will be stolen by 
a publisher? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: No. There's no reason for anyone to steal something that you've 
already created and are offering to them. Exceptions to this are few and far 
between. Don't worry. 
</P>
<P>
 OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 7: Should I keep an eye on publishing trends to see what 
might be selling? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: No. By the time you see a trend, 50,000 other writers have seen it 
too. New trends come from new writers, and you are one of them. Make your own 
trends -- that's one of the things you'll be getting paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other questions that are less often asked but more important to 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 CRUCIAL QUESTION 1: How do I learn to write? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The process is very simple. First, read a lot of good books. It is 
imperative that you read good books, because you have no other way to know what 
good writing is. Composers learn from composers, poets from poets, painters 
from painters. Learn from the best. Read critically. If a book seems dishonest 
to you, stop reading. Every book you read will lodge in your being somewhere 
and carry a lesson with it. You will learn that lesson without knowing you are 
learning it. It's as easy as learning a foreign language while you drive! 
</P>
<P>
 Then, sit down and try to write a good book. 
</P>
<P>
 Study every line after you've written it and ask yourself: 1) Is it 
interesting to read? 2) Does the story need it? If the answer to both questions 
is yes, go on to the next line. The same principle holds true for paragraph, 
scene, chapter, passage. If the answer to either question is no, delete the 
line (paragraph, scene, etc.). The more you do this, the easier and faster it 
will become. It's an exercise, a skill -- something you develop, just like a 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 CRUCIAL QUESTION 2: Is that to say, then, that I should revise as I go? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Not really. Just ask yourself those two questions before you go on to 
the next line, paragraph, chapter, etc. If the answers are "yes," then let it 
fly. Write fast. Don't sweat the small stuff, yet. Finish. Finish. Finish. 
</P>
<P>
 CRUCIAL QUESTION 3: How will I know when my manuscript is good? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: When you can read it -- critically -- as you have the many good books 
in your life, and it looks kind of, remotely, a little bit, somewhat like one 
of them. If you honestly believe that what you've written should be on the desk 
of a New York editor, it is time to get it there. (see OFTEN ASKED QUESTION 1, 
above.) 
</P>
<P>
 CRUCIAL QUESTION 4: How long should I spend writing a book? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Long enough to finish it. That will be six months to two years, on 
average. Keep working on a book until it's not getting any better. Then ask 
yourself CRUCIAL QUESTION 3. If you are particularly committed to a story, give 
it five years. 
</P>
<P>
 CRUCIAL QUESTION 5: How much time do I need to put in every day? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Less than you might think. If you can take one hour per day and 
produce one page, at the end of a year you'll have a 350-page manuscript (about 
right) plus 15 days of vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 CRUCIAL QUESTION 6: Do I have to know the story before I write it? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: No, but you have to know a story. If you find a better one as you're 
working (you probably will), jettison the old and go with the new. This is how 
good stories are made. Remember your story as you answer the two most critical 
questions after writing something -- is this interesting to read, and, does the 
story need this? 
</P>
<P>
 CRUCIAL QUESTION 7: Why should I take your word for anything? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: You probably shouldn't. These are just things that work for me, 
occasionally. In fact, if you find better ways of writing a book, I'd like to 
know about them. Old dogs can learn new tricks.

 The Democrats -- party of the '80s!Humorist Will Rogers once declared that he 
didn't belong to an organized political party -- he was a Democrat. That quip 
is still timely. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago, the Democratic National Committee sent a computerized 
letter to George Deukmejian, asking him to fill out a poll "to show Bob Dole 
and the rest of the GOP that a solid majority backs the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian forwarded the letter to us, along with this comment: "It appears 
that the Democratic Party must be in big trouble. They apparently don't know 
that I am a Republican and that I haven't been the governor for the past 3 1/2 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes. The letter was addressed to "George Deukmejian, Governor of 
California," in the state Capitol. Deukmejian is now an attorney in private 
practice in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes you wonder whether the same letter was sent to a Ronald Reagan in the 
White House. 
</P>

 From the Three Tenors to the Four Moptops: "Watching Pavarotti on stage at

 Our spell-check mechanism is still sizzling: Several readers have helpfully 
translated the '40s comedy song that begins, "Mairzy doats and dozee doats. . . 
." into English. The tongue-in-cheek lyrics are actually the scrambled words, 
"Mares eat oats and does eat oats. . . ."

 Still, no report on "Flat-Foot Foogie with a floy-floy."

 Giving an arm and a leg: When we printed Avenues magazine's list of the 
average number of parking cops on duty around the state, we noted that the 
figures ran from 350 for L.A. to two for Bakersfield.

Luis Obispo: 2 1/2.

 Do Bigfoots eat oats?Stan Sieger of Pasadena is obviously familiar with Only 
in L.A.'s cast of characters. 
</P>
<P>
 He noticed our item on a sighting by Jon Erik Beckjord of a "scruffy, 
long-haired" man holding a sign that said: "The American Distress Card -- Don't 
Be Homeless Without It." 
</P>
<P>
 Sieger says: "I would have asked for photographic proof. On the other hand, 
isn't this the same Beckjord who claims to have photographic proof of a 
'scruffy, long-haired' Bigfoot?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it is true that Beckjord is curator of Malibu's UFO, Bigfoot & Nessie 
Museum.  
</P>
<P>
 But, as we recall, he claims that Bigfoot has a smooth coat -- and has too 
much pride to panhandle. miscelLAny:

 Dave Reichert of West L.A. sent along a brochure titled "Panorama City -- It's 
a wonderful life. . . . Welcome to God's country." Unfortunately, it isn't 
advertising the San Fernando Valley suburb. This Panorama City is located in 
the state of Washington. That's Bigfoot country. Or, at least, used to be.

SCOTT HARRIS: A SCHOOL THAT HAS SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Valdez wants everyone to get something straight. It's the pronunciation 
of his name. You would think that folks in Los Angeles, where 40% of the people 
are Latino, would know by now that Valdez rhymes with fez. Yet, he says, he 
keeps running into people who call him "Val-deez." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I'm an oil spill," he mutters. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience laughed. Jeff Valdez is a pro with a pro's polished delivery. The 
show wasn't 2 minutes old, yet Valdez and the comics who would follow probably 
knew they'd be a hit. This audience was eager. These people had paid their 10 
bucks and they were there to have a good time. The comics must have known that 
they would be rewarded with laughter, which was a good thing, because they 
wouldn't be rewarded with money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you keep up with philanthropic events in the society pages, chances 
are you missed "Noche de Risas." That's Spanish for "Night of Smiles." This 
fund-raiser last week at Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn in Studio City didn't 
attract rich folks in black tie or inspire corporations to buy a block of 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it wasn't like anybody was trying to cure a disease this night. It 
was just a matter of Oxnard Street Elementary School in North Hollywood trying 
to figure out a way to buy a few microscopes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, who's to say that one of Lourdes Knapp's fifth-graders 
won't someday find the cure for cancer? Or perhaps one of Elizabeth Teicher's 
kindergartners? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If it were not for Knapp or Teicher, there would have been no night of smiles. 
And there would have been no night of smiles if not for Jeff Valdez either. In 
corporate boardrooms across America, in the halls of Congress and in groups 
such as the National Science Foundation, there is a great deal of concern about 
how America, once the world's leader in science education, has now fallen 
behind other economic powers. At Oxnard, it was just a matter of a teacher 
identifying a need -- and others pitching in with their unique talents. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Knapp, Teicher says, who one day said that Oxnard sure could use some 
microscopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Teicher took this as a challenge. At Oxnard, she is known as "Mother Mooch" 
for her ability to persuade people to become involved in this North Hollywood 
school that serves a student body that is more than 92% Latino, mostly 
immigrants. Teicher has recruited the neighborhood service station and 
Hollywood personalities to help out at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Teicher says, she read a newspaper article about "Comedy 
Compadres," the Latino-oriented showcase on KTLA produced by somebody named 
Jeff Valdez. She reached Valdez by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Serendipity was at work. When Teicher made her pitch, Valdez remembered how, 
as a child growing up in the projects of Pueblo, Colo., his dream was to be a 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I begged and screamed and cried and kicked to get a chemistry set," he 
recalled. And it worked. His parents, who worked hard just to put food on the 
table, "scrimped and saved" enough to buy the set, which included a low-power 
microscope. He still displays that old microscope on a bookshelf in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez was quick to offer his services, but Teicher's work wasn't through. She 
shopped around for a site and got a bargain rate at the Holiday Inn. And 
Richard Palezyan, the proprietor of King's Flowers and Balloons, provided the 
decor for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Valdez recruited fellow comics Rudy Moreno, Larry Omaha, Johnny 
Sanchez and Rick Najera. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets were sold mostly to teachers and staff. The audience was a mix of 
Latinos and Anglos. The humor was heavily ethnic and a tad racy. Valdez warned 
the parents of an 11-year-old in the front row that their daughter would be 
about 14 when they left. The girl's relentless laughter served as a running gag 
throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice to repeat the funniest gags. But in these sensitive days, I 
have learned that much of what was said there cannot be said here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A funny thing happened when Elizabeth Teicher caught up with me Wednesday. I 
had called her to find out how much money the event raised. When she returned 
my call, I was on another line with a reader who was expounding on a favorite 
topic, The Trouble With Schools Today. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with schools, the reader told me, isn't a lack of money. It's 
mismanagement and teachers who lack dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nice, then, to hear from Mother Mooch. "Noche de Risas," she said, 
raised nearly $1,000. Last weekend, she bought a dozen microscopes for Oxnard 
Elementary.

 * Congratulations to the Pasadena Police Department for its hard work and wise 
prevention planning, which resulted in the world getting a picture of how a 
successful and safe World Cup soccer series can be held. Because Pasadena had 
the foresight to prohibit alcohol sales in the stadium, the incendiary 
ingredient -- alcohol -- was removed from the often dangerous triad of sports, 
crowds and booze.Eight games with a total of 715,826 in the Rose Bowl and only 
15 arrests for public drunkenness is an absolutely astoundingly positive 
statistic! 
</P>
<P>
 Bar crowds in Old Pasadena who celebrated "prodigiously but peacefully" (July 
18) did not get out of hand because the Police Department and the Department of 
Alcohol Beverage Control instructed bar owners about managing alcohol service 
to maintain a balance between celebration and safety.

GETTING CALIFORNIA BEYOND THE SLAPDASH PATCH JOBS; ISN'T IT OBVIOUS BY NOW THAT 
CALIFORNIA REQUIRES A TRUE FINANCIAL PLAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sacramento's year-to-year crisis management of state fiscal problems received 
a big thumbs-down from Wall Street the other day. The message was clear: The 
new "make do" budget is inadequate and could possibly exacerbate the 
unprecedented problems faced by the state. What is needed is a detailed, 
comprehensive, long-range plan to get California public finance under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such a five- or even 10-year strategy, the Golden State could find 
itself on a slippery slope toward the near-disastrous experience of New York 
City in the mid-1970s, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy. Designing a 
preemptive strike to prevent such a fiasco in California should be a big issue 
in the governor's race and top priority for whomever takes office next January. 
</P>
<P>
 The wake-up call from Wall Street rang loud and clear last week when all three 
bond-rating agencies downgraded California credit worthiness because of 
concerns about the budget for fiscal 1994-95 and the following year. Their 
assessment: It was a politically expedient but problematic budget because of 
the reliance on $3.6-billion in unappropriated federal funds, record short-term 
borrowings of $7 billion and the inclusion of sledgehammer automatic spending 
cuts in the event of state revenue shortfalls. Another troubling development 
was last week's federal court ruling that invalidated California's 1992 welfare 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty surrounding each component of this budget undercuts any 
credibility of sound fiscal management. Tough decisions have been merely put 
off. The process of addressing the incredibly complex task of tackling the 
structural problems of the budget and addressing the accumulated $3.8-billion 
deficit must begin in earnest very soon. Neither problem will be resolved if 
addressed in a piecemeal fashion, nor will the solutions be easy and quick. It 
will take a very specific financial package -- a precise formula of further 
painful cuts, serious restructuring and perhaps even some new revenues over a 
period of five to 10 years or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession certainly worsened California's fiscal problems, but it was not 
the lone cause. Even before the economic slowdown, structural impediments such 
as Propositions 13 and 98 were reducing budget flexibility. Even with the 
economy recovering and revenues rising, there are continuing pressures on the 
spending side, such as a projected increase in expenditures for growth in 
social-service caseloads and prison operations. So even as the state has 
managed to match revenue and spending over the last two years, the balancing 
process will continue to be tough. The budget process needs a higher level of 
accountability of operating and capital spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the accumulated deficit, now financed out of the general fund. 
Can the deficit be financed some other way? No state is directly comparable 
with California, but Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and Louisiana have 
each issued such deficit-funding bonds. But, in each state, the bonds have been 
part of a specific multiyear fiscal plan -- not some slapdash patch job. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementation of a multiyear financial plan will not come without pain. 
Precisely what that might be will not be known until a strategy is devised. But 
without such a comprehensive plan, California will continue on its haphazard 
fiscal management and further jeopardize its credit worthiness. As soon as Nov. 
15, the state controller will assess whether California is on track within 1% 
of earlier projections of revenues and spending. If the state fails this test, 
automatic across-the-board spending cuts, except for education, would take 
effect in mid-February. That prospect is not pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 As a political matter, Sacramento is unlikely to handle this problem before 
the November elections. So what we are proposing will take the leadership of 
the next governor. But even now, Gov. Pete Wilson and his challenger, State 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, need to be discussing and debating just this: 
California's need for a plausible long-range financial plan. To put this off 
any longer is fiscally irresponsible and extremely risky.

ONE ISSUE SACRAMENTO WON'T SKIRT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the many worthy bills the Legislature, in its infinite wisdom, summarily 
rejected this year were proposals to tighten gun ownership, correct defects in 
the "three strikes and you're out" law and allow voters to decide whether to 
streamline the state's huge trial court system. But lest anyone think this 
august body has no appetite for the vexing issues of our day, consider AB 
3672.Introduced by Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park), this bill 
would make it illegal for most employers to prohibit female workers from 
wearing slacks to work; the bill wouldn't affect uniforms or any other dress 
code shown to have "good cause." The bill has cleared the Assembly and will be 
considered by the Senate Appropriations Committee when the Legislature 
reconvenes next month. 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect this bill has widespread support, at least among voters for whom 
"suiting up" still means high heels, panty hose, straight skirts and other 
late-20th-Century instruments of torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigid dress codes once prevailed at most places of employment. Mercifully, 
these have, in the main, gone the way of Nehru jackets. But, amazingly, not 
everywhere. Martinez's bill would end the tyranny of the pencil skirt and the 
spike heel once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Should we be surprised that our representatives may marshal a majority for 
this measure but not for those others of only marginally greater import? 
Probably not. Do we object? Only those touched by the July heat, no doubt made 
worse by a clammy polyester suit or sweaty pantyhose, would be so foolish.

IS POLITICS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton has two key self-inflicted political problems: He seems at times 
to be at war with himself over just how much he should compromise; he has a 
history of drawing a line in the sand and then drawing it again, and then 
again. If the President wants health-care reform this year, he must be 
flexible, which comes easy to him. But he must fight another instinct to please 
others so much that the compromise yields him only a Pyrrhic victory, a 
political score that does not provide better health care for Americans. It's 
the latter aim that's the goal here, and he must not allow Congress to 
obfuscate that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton remains right in diagnosing the basic elements that must be a part of 
any true health-care reform. His willingness to compromise on universal 
coverage -- saying that a bill need not immediately cover 100% of all Americans 
-- was sensible, considering that 85% of Americans are already covered by 
insurance (albeit many not adequately). 
</P>
<P>
 The real hang-up, of course, is how to pay for increased coverage. Clinton has 
proposed that employers be required to provide insurance coverage for their 
employees, but said this week, "I would not rule out a health bill that didn't 
have a employers mandate in it, if we knew that we were moving toward full 
coverage and we had some evidence that it would work." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter statement was a political bombshell when uttered Tuesday. No doubt 
there are still stinging memories of how the White House last year left some 
allies out on a limb, when some House members swallowed hard and cast a 
politically damaging vote in favor of a controversial Clinton-proposed energy 
tax -- a plan that the President himself later abandoned. Whatever the final 
compromise, Clinton must find a way to assure his allies that he's not going to 
leave them stranded without cover. He's now made that task harder. 
</P>
<P>
 A phase-in of universal coverage is actually preferable to trying to load on 
everything all at once; the same would be true in how to finance the program. 
Now Congress and the President must come up with a method of financing that 
works. Even the political pariah of employer mandates may not be dead, since 
now even the American Medical Assn. is urging Congress to enact comprehensive 
reform through employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise is not bad, it is inevitable. But compromise cannot be used as the 
excuse to pass a crucial reform that is no reform at all. The President must 
keep reminding Congress that better health care has a price tag, and so-called 
"reforms" that don't convincingly address how the nation will pay for them are 
bogus.

BAN ON FIRING UNION STRIKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Ban on Firing Strikers Blocked," July 13: The Senate acted wisely and 
courageously in maintaining an employer's right to fire striking workers. It 
did not, as Sen. Howard Metzenbaum stated, show that "workers are disposable" 
and that the outcome would "lower worker productivity." Rather, the outcome 
prevents a labor monopoly that would have -- in terms of the true world economy 
we face today -- ultimately sacrificed the economic well-being of all Americans 
for the benefit of the few, self-chosen, striking union members. 
</P>
<P>
 This observation is bolstered by the second article reporting that United 
Airlines employees have assumed 55% ownership of the airline. It's important to 
note that they did this only after taking a 6% to 20% pay cut and, contrary to 
the senator's hand-wringing, agreeing to productivity increases (i.e., harder 
work). Moreover, these concessions mirror those which have occurred in 
virtually every transition to employee ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson is clear: Under self-ownership, employees necessarily balance both 
short-term and long-term interests. That is, they reduce their exposure to 
"disposability" by acting in the longer-term interests of their company. This, 
in turn, generates a form of discipline that usually extracts employee 
concessions, much less gains. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of this self-balancing mechanism, individual employers must 
also have disciplinary tools to constrain employee excesses. Thanks to 
farsighted senators, the right to fire striking workers correctly remains that 
tool. It's unfortunate, but good medicine is often bitter.

 * The largely Republican filibuster of the striker replacement bill in the 
Senate says volumes about the larger electoral strategy of the GOP in the 
1990s. Maintaining busted unions means forcing the left to remain divided over 
whether to pursue the ineffectual politics of racial identity or the ultimately 
shallow vision of the pro-business Democratic Leadership Council. Busted unions 
means the right can rebuild itself while driving a wedge between working 
Americans of all creeds and color. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline of wages in recent years is blamed on immigrants who steal jobs 
rather on the real culprit, which is the concerted attack on unions by business 
over the past 20 years. My heart aches to think of what could be and what the 
Republicans do not want: a thriving democratic labor movement that binds 
together a broad-based coalition of working-class Americans of all creeds and 
colors.

 * My mother was one of the women who started the International Ladies Garment 
Workers Union in the early part of the century. She told the story many times 
of the nine months she was on strike, wearing a "sandwich board" to explain the 
union view, her shoes literally without soles, so layers of cardboard were 
inserted. How proud I am that her sacrifice helped create a solid and 
long-lasting union. 
</P>
<P>
 But I am in tears at what has become of the union movement today (albeit not 
without some union excesses). The whole point of a strike, it seems to me, is 
to put both parties in a position where they hurt. The employer because new 
workers won't do the job as well; the strikers because they lose pay, benefits, 
etc. The incentive, then, is to quickly resolve the issues dividing them. But 
if the company can fire its workers at will, where is the incentive to 
negotiate? 
</P>
<P>
 I think what many people are saying about members of Congress is true. Living 
a life of privilege has destroyed their ability to understand the average 
working person today.

RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In James A. Baker III's "Confronting the Matter of Personal Responsibility" 
(Opinion, July 10), the key to reversing the slide in American morals and 
morale lies with the individual role model. Further, he lays blame for the 
"crisis in values" on the cultural relativism and moral permissiveness of the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 If historical memory serves me well, no President since Kennedy admitting his 
mistake in the Bay of Pigs fiasco has taken responsibility for the most 
horrendous crimes, i.e., Vietnam, welfarization and resulting destruction of 
families, high illiteracy among public school graduates, stagflation due to 
stupid government policies, deficits that threaten economic collapse, arms for 
hostages, etc. The savings-and-loan scandal occurred under Baker's watch as 
secretary of Treasury. Did he take any responsibility for that? 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians very publicly have someone else to blame like other politicians, 
the voters, the non-voters. Ultimately no one is really responsible because no 
one wants to suffer the consequences as individuals. So where are the role 
models that are the key to prevent moral decay? No comment!

WIVES ALSO KILL HUSBANDS -- QUITE OFTEN; ABUSE: WOMEN MAKE UP 40% OF DEFENDANTS 
IN SPOUSAL MURDERS, UNDERCUTTING POLITICAL RHETORIC TO THE CONTRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ, Alan M. Dershowitz, who teaches at Harvard Law School 
and writes a syndicated column, is an adviser to O.J. Simpson's legal defense 
team. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though O.J. Simpson vehemently denies that he murdered his former wife, his 
case has provoked media attention about husbands who kill their wives. 
Coincidentally with the Simpson case, the Department of Justice has just 
released the first detailed empirical study of "murder in families." It 
contains surprising information that contrasts sharply with media headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The most shocking finding of this study, which analyzed nearly 10,000 cases, 
is that wives murder their husbands far more frequently than press reports 
would suggests. To put the issue in context, women in general account for only 
about 10% of defendants charged with all murders. But for all spousal murders, 
women accounted for more than 40% of defendants. And "among black marital 
partners, wives were just about as likely to kill their husbands as husbands 
were to kill their wives." 
</P>
<P>
 The real headline of this report, therefore, is that women kill almost as 
often as men do in the context of family murders, though men much more often 
kill strangers -- nearly always other men. 
</P>
<P>
 The other shocker in this report is that husbands who kill their wives are not 
treated more leniently than men who kill strangers, despite the media myth to 
the contrary. Indeed, they were as likely to be charged with first-degree 
murder, were no more likely to have their cases dismissed or diverted and were 
as likely to be convicted. Nor were their sentences significantly different, 
when relevant "case characteristics" such as prior criminal record were taken 
into account. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this hard data, the myths persist that spousal murders consist almost 
exclusively of husbands who kill their wives and are then treated leniently by 
the criminal justice system. Indeed, there is one figure that is missing from 
this otherwise thorough report: namely, whether women who murder their husbands 
are treated more leniently than husbands who murder their wives. The author of 
the report told me that data were available but not compiled. I asked if he 
would compile it and he did, faxing me new tables that compared the outcome of 
prosecution based on the gender of the victim and the accused. This previously 
unpublished analysis undercuts the myth that husbands who kill their wives are 
treated more leniently than wives who kill their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 Wives who kill their husband were acquitted in 12.9% of the cases studied, 
while husbands who kill their wives were acquitted in only 1.4% of the cases. 
Women who were convicted of killing their husbands were sentenced to an average 
of six years in prison, while men received an average sentence of 17 years for 
killing their wives. Sixteen percent of female spousal killers get probation, 
compared with 1.6% for males. To be sure, some of the difference may be 
attributable to gender-neutral factors such as prior record, provocation or 
mental illness. But there is absolutely no support in this data for the claim 
that husbands who kill their wives are systematically treated with kid gloves 
by the justice system.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unexpected data, the Justice Department press release buried the 
politically incorrect information under the following headline: "Wives are the 
most frequent victims in family murders." But even that conclusion obscures the 
real picture: that for all family murders -- which includes killing of parents 
and children as well as spouses -- 55.5% of the victims were males and 44.5% 
females, and "female defendants were more likely than male defendants to have 
murdered a person of the opposite sex." 
</P>
<P>
 The new data strongly suggest that spousal murder is not primarily a male 
versus female political issue, as some insist. Instead, it is primarily a 
psychological issue of pervasive familial violence on all sides, generated by 
the passions of family interaction. Misdiagnosing this psychological problem to 
fit into a political agenda will delay its proper treatment and cure.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when his depression may have been most dark, Foster told his sister 
of his reluctance to see a psychiatrist because it might jeopardize his 
continuing to hold a White House pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we have a climate of myths and misunderstandings in this country that leads 
to mockery of psychological pain and intimidation of people in the public eye 
and prevents them from reaching out? Did Foster flee condemnation, mockery or 
"trial by society" by choosing death by his own hand? 
</P>
<P>
 The last several decades have seen decline in the stigmatization of those 
seeking psychiatric help. But politicization of a suicide, usually a tragic 
outcome of a medical disorder, can have a regressive effect on these gains and 
also be brutal to the victims. It has become too accepted a practice to exploit 
personal trauma in our culture for political or journalistic gain. It is as if 
no boundaries exist. 
</P>
<P>
 A culture is only as good as the way it treats its neediest citizens.

COLUMN RIGHT/ VIRGINIA POSTREL: HARASSMENT LAW IS GOING AMOK; RELIGION IS ONLY 
THE LATEST OF MANY PROTECTED CATEGORIES AND THEY'RE BREAKING DOWN WHAT'S LEFT 
OF OUR SENSE OF COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA POSTREL, Virginia I. Postrel is editor of Reason magazine, based in 
Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Will office Christmas parties be outlawed by the year 2000? Will store clerks 
be able to sue retailers for making them listen to piped-in renditions of 
"Silent Night" and "O, Little Town of Bethlehem?" 
</P>
<P>
 Religion may soon be as illegal in the workplace as it is in the public 
schools. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has proposed guidelines 
extending the prohibition on sexual harassment to other protected categories: 
race, color, national origin, age, disability and, yes, religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is not really new. Religious-harassment complaints have been brought 
under existing law, which the EEOC claims the guidelines "were intended merely 
to explain and interpret." But such cases are rare and usually extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines expand the idea of harassment. They impose the equivalent 
of the "reasonable woman" standard. Whether an action constitutes harassment 
depends on the viewpoint of a reasonable member of the offended group -- the 
reasonable atheist or Mormon or Jehovah's Witness. And harassment need not be 
deliberate; it can be anything that has the effect of "creating an 
intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Religious employees and business owners fear that the EEOC will force them to 
hide their beliefs. Evangelical Christians, in particular, worry that the EEOC 
is making it illegal for them to encourage co-workers or employees to accept 
Jesus as their savior. Small businesses that hold voluntary prayer meetings or 
post inspirational signs with religious messages are afraid those actions would 
be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The safest policy may be a religion-free workplace. As Michael K. Whitehead, 
general counsel to the Southern Baptist Convention's Christian Life Commission, 
told a Senate hearing, "Employers trying to avoid lawsuits want a clear-cut, 
simple rule which can be understood and obeyed by all employees, whether high 
school drop-outs or Harvard MBAs . . . Their bottom line is to find a policy 
that will help them stay out of court." 
</P>
<P>
 But federal law also requires employers to accommodate employees' religious 
practices. So if a company lets evangelical Christian employees proselytize on 
the job, it can be sued for creating a "hostile environment" for 
non-Christians. And if it forbids proselytizing, it can be sued for failing to 
accommodate evangelical Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider the Christmas season, in which workers are bombarded with songs, 
slogans, artwork and numerous other expressions of faith. This campaign of 
harassment seems OK only because we are used to it. And, notes the EEOC, 
"Recent case law . . . emphasizes the importance of considering the perspective 
of the victim of the harassment rather than adopting notions of acceptable 
behavior that may prevail in a particular workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Just because shipyard workers have always posted explicit pinups doesn't get 
their employer off the hook for sexual harassment. And just because stores have 
always piped in "O Holy Night" doesn't mean that Christmas carols won't spark a 
suit. The same holds true for profanity that offends Christians. After all, 
says the EEOC, employees can "challenge a hostile or abusive work environment 
even if the harassment is not targeted specifically at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Congress, led by Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) and Rep. Buck 
McKeon (R-Calif.), want the EEOC to delete religious harassment from its 
guidelines. But why should religion get special treatment? 
</P>
<P>
 Harassment law in general has run amok. The federal government is centrally 
planning the corporate culture of millions of wildly different businesses. It 
is prohibiting free expression and turning the private workplace into an 
extension of the public sphere. Religion is only part of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Massive workplace regulation, down to the details of wall decorations, is 
busting up communities, destroying the institutions that stand between 
individuals and the state. It is telling entrepreneurs that they cannot create 
businesses that reflect their personalities and beliefs or hire workers who 
want to work in that atmosphere. And all the while, American intellectuals go 
around mourning the loss of community. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the people who write the harassment laws, I prefer to work in a secular 
atmosphere, where religion is appreciated but not embraced. But forcing every 
workplace to provide the cultural environment preferred by intellectuals is 
profoundly intolerant. It is itself a campaign of harassment, backed by the 
power of the state.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; THE MYTHICALLY RICH ARE EXPOSED; IN A COUNTRY OF DIRE 
ECONOMIC STRUGGLE, IT IS IMMORAL THAT 24 FAMILIES HOLD WEALTH EQUAL TO THE 
NATIONAL BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS MONSIVAIS, Carlos Monsivais is a journalist and cultural historian. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 24 Mexican families are together worth $44.1 billion, the news transcends 
the ordinary to become a genuine moral scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 How else can we read the Forbes 500 list revealing that, in a country where 17 
million people live under conditions of extreme poverty and 35 million are 
officially considered poor, 24 individuals or families have an accumulated 
wealth equivalent to Mexico's 1990 national budget?  
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list, published last week, is banker Carlos Slim with $6.6 
billion and media/communications mogul Emilio Azcarraga with $5.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Forbes, Slim had $2.1 billion in 1992. In only two years, he has 
become the fourth-richest man in the world. His wealth derives in part from his 
stock in Telefonos de Mexico. It helps, too, that he is in command of 22% of 
the Mexican stock market's trading capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Azcarraga is the major stockholder of Televisa, a corporation blessed by a 
holy alliance with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the articles, caricatures and mocking references printed in the Mexican 
press, the Forbes list is monopolizing conversations in Mexico City. How was 
this monstrous sum of money produced? The explanation is always the same: The 
outrageous accumulation of money was facilitated by connections with the 
government, the clever maneuvering of CEOs, juicy favorable contracts with the 
governing elites, speculative trading in the stock market, the ridiculously low 
buying prices for state-owned businesses, clever tax filing and advantageous 
associations with foreign capital. Yet, understanding how the vast amount of 
money was accumulated by so few does not dissipate the anger of the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1940s and '50s, quick fortunes created some sort of communal pride. 
There were protests and criticism against corruption, but there were also jokes 
and gossip that entertained the masses -- talk about the mansions in Acapulco, 
the safaris to Africa and outrageous gifts to glamorous lovers. Predictably or 
strangely, the gossip amused a population always dreaming of somehow making it 
with one stroke of good fortune. The multimillionaires of years ago were mocked 
with jealous admiration and their squanderings became fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories also were told of bureaucrats who found suitcases full of money on the 
streets and of high government officials winning the lottery 10 times in a row. 
Corruption was looked upon as a carnival, something somehow festive. Moral 
outrage was tempered by a society that accepted and enjoyed the fashionable 
notion of getting rich quickly and mysteriously. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, this fascination with wealth faded as social mobility 
virtually ceased to exist. One impression seemed to dominate: He who comes from 
the underclass can only make it to the starting point. Fortunes became 
institutionalized. From now on, there will be only a few, perhaps none, who 
will be able to found dynasties. Only the chosen heirs, that ubiquitous 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 When capitalism goes wild, there is no room for moral dilemmas. After all, it 
is not capitalism's fault if there is economic inequality. Disparity gives the 
people an incentive to prosper, and neither compassion nor government handouts 
serve any purpose. Furthermore, complaining about the rich is a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes' revelations give testimony to the truths spoken by the majority. Even 
though what should incite outrage is the number of poor people, somehow 
invisible despite their demographic majority, it is the number of super-rich in 
Mexico that creates a reaction, one that irritates, exasperates and causes 
resentment. Moral indignation tends to be ephemeral and consume itself, but 
this time the anger remains ever present because the concentrated fortunes 
continue to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences of anger and resentment will not necessarily be demonstrated 
electorally, but they will be felt in the long run. In Mexico's current 
economic condition, so much concentrated wealth is a personal affront that a 
devalued middle class uses to measure its own situation. What opportunities are 
available for them and their children compared to the 24 richest families and 
the next richest 100? Their destiny seems fixed and stationary, a conclusion 
derived mainly through observations about the richest people, not the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the class struggle has been outdated with the fall of communism, then the 
personal and social experiences of those who have little or no money no longer 
lead to the usual lamentations addressed against those who own a lot. The 
awareness of having been radically plundered, of being cut out of real 
opportunities without a visible chance of social mobility, is more than a 
provocation; it raises politics to the domain of morality. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the richest people do pay something for their tremendous 
advantages. They live in fear, in medieval-like fortresses, with armies of 
bodyguards, traveling in bulletproof limousines that cost, they say, half a 
million dollars and are imported used, from Colombia, because Mercedes-Benz is 
slow keeping up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet honey of the beehive has its price. If kidnaped banker Alfredo Harp 
Helu's ransom was $30 million, how much will the next one be worth?

MORNING BRIEFING: TALE OF THE TAIL PART OF THE LORE OF SEA CADET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sea Cadet, back at Hollywood Park after a 20-month absence because of injuries 
and illness, has earned $1.7 million as a racehorse, but is best known for what 
he lacks -- a tail. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally considered braiding a fake tail on Sea Cadet's stub when 
the horse was a yearling in Kentucky, but is glad he didn't. McAnally reckons 
Sea Cadet became more agile because of his deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flies are especially heavy in Kentucky," he explained. "With no tail, Sea 
Cadet had to improvise to keep the flies off his rear. He learned to reach back 
with his head, shake it from side to side and shoo the flies away in that 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Name the six players (three in each league) who played for World 
Series winners the same season they were named rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste of power: Albert Belle, Cleveland's slugging outfielder, shocked even 
his manager when he laid down a suicide squeeze to score Kenny Lofton in a 
recent game. 
</P>
<P>
 An obviously pleased Belle came into the dugout and said, "That's my one bunt 
for the year," and Manager Mike Hargrove said emphatically, "Yes, it is." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known how a corked bat would affect a bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 For contortionists: Sportscaster Gary Cruz, urging people to call him on his 
sports talk show, recently said, "If you have something on your mind, call and 
get it off your chest." 
</P>
<P>
 Handy man: Injured Deion Sanders made himself useful Sunday at Riverfront 
Stadium, going out with the Cincinnati grounds crew to sweep the bases in the 
fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Faint praise: New York Yankee Manager Bucky Showalter criticized Seattle 
superstar Ken Griffey Jr. for wearing his baseball cap backward, claiming it 
was disrespectful to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game against the Yanks last week, Griffey hit two home runs, drove in 
five runs and leaped high against the fence to catch a 400-foot potential home 
run. Showalter was asked what he thought of Griffey now. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good player," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost right: Get your bets down with those who claim that the last 0-0 tie in 
the Rose Bowl before Brazil-Italy was California-Washington & Jefferson in 
1922. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch: It wasn't in the Rose Bowl. It was the last New Year's Day game 
played at Tournament Park -- now the site of Caltech -- before the Rose Bowl 
was built. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting priorities: Gary Player was recently asked by the Times of London if 
he would prefer to win the British Open or the U.S. Open or for his horse, 
Broadway Flyer, to win the English Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without question, I said I would prefer to win the Derby," answered Player, 
who has been breeding horses on his ranch in South Africa for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Player has already won the British Open three times and the U.S. 
Open once. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Gil McDougald (1951 Yankees), Tom Tresh (1962 Yankees), Jim 
Lefebvre (1965 Dodgers), Pat Zachry (1976 Reds), Fernando Valenzuela (1981 
Dodgers) and Chuck Knoblauch (1991 Twins).

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels' dwindling attendance should be no mystery. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium fans simply have grown weary of a bad product. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are well on their way to their sixth losing record in eight 
seasons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Their only winning season during that span was 1989, when they were 91-71. 
They were 81-81 in 1991. Not since 1986 has Gene Autry's team finished higher 
than third in the AL West. . . . The surprise is that season home attendance 
has stayed above two million for so long, but that 12-year streak is nearly 
certain to end even if there is no strike. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The way the Dodgers are playing, they will be fortunate to be in second place 
when they come home from this trip next week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When Vin Scully describes Mike Piazza as being "bone weary and soaking wet" on 
a hot night at Shea Stadium and then Piazza isn't in the starting lineup the 
next day, you wonder if such a great young hitter should be moved to a position 
that is less draining than catcher. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers usually do a lot better job substituting at the plate than on the 
mound. First came record-setting pinch-hitter Manny Mota, then Jose Morales, 
Mickey Hatcher, Mitch Webster, Dave Hansen and now Jeff Treadway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So much for those who believed Jim Abbott would have to be effective for the 
New York Yankees to be pennant contenders. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The American and National leagues would be wise to follow the lead of the 
International League, which suspended and fined 35 players for leaving their 
positions, the bench and the bullpen during a fight between Richmond and 
Norfolk. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Someone could make a fortune reviving the old "Home Run Derby" television 
show. . . .

 Major network boxing shows have been few and far between the last several 
years, but the Grand Olympic will stage two in three weeks -- Zach Padilla-Juan 
LaPorte on CBS Sunday and Larry Donald-Andrew Golota on ABC Aug. 13. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla, 31, is a hot commodity, but was retired as recently as two years ago. 
The junior welterweight from Azusa quit the ring for five years and worked as a 
carpenter because he couldn't get enough fights. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Donald vs. Golota will be a matchup of two unbeaten heavyweights. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Riddick Bowe-Buster Mathis Jr. fight, originally scheduled for June in Las 
Vegas before Bowe was injured in training, has been rescheduled for Aug. 13 in 
Atlantic City. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Allice, the new USC track and field coach, promised a group of boosters -- 
including Olympic medalists Lennox Miller, Rex Cawley and Ron Morris -- that 
the Trojans would finish in the top three in the NCAA men's and women's 
championship meets within the next few years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Avondre Jones signs with Iowa as expected, he won't be the first USC 
basketball player to transfer there. Gerry Wright did after the 1983 season. 
His coach at Iowa? George Raveling. . . .

 Kickoff for the USC-Notre Dame game, to be televised by ABC, will be 5 p.m. on 
Nov. 26 at the Coliseum. . . .

will serve as guest assistant coaches for Bobby Hull Jr. on Sunday when his Los 
Angeles Blades of Roller Hockey International play Edmonton at the Forum at 5

 Maybe Mike Keenan just wanted to get away from the New York media. Only one 
writer travels regularly with the St. Louis Blues. . . .

 Wayne Lukas will try to beat the boys with a filly in the $100,000 Hollywood 
Juvenile for the third time on Monday. Serena's Song will be trying to repeat 
for Lukas what Terlingua did in 1978 and Althea in 1983. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Laffit Pincay's polished, winning ride on longshot Highland Crystal in a 
stakes race at River Downs in Cincinnati on Sunday showed what the 47-year-old 
youngster can still do when given the opportunity. . . .

 Nolan Richardson of Arkansas might eventually become a pro basketball coach, 
but he was recently quoted as saying: "The NBA used to be up and down. Now it's 
nothing but a one-on-one show where all you do is try to back your man down the 
lane. The only time I watch a pro game is when one of my former players is 
playing." . . .

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; FREGOSI IN HOSPITAL; GIANTS WIN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philadelphia Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi, who has been bothered by a sore back 
the past few days, was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital on 
Wednesday for treatment after his team's 9-2 loss to San Francisco in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Team spokesman Larry Shenk said Fregosi was sent to the hospital for "rest and 
medication." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory puts the Giants, winners of 10 of their last 11, within 3 1/2 
games of the Dodgers in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' Mike Benjamin drove in a career-high four runs. Benjamin had only 
five RBIs before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His doubles in the second and third innings helped the Giants give Mark 
Portugal (9-6) a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams hit a solo home run in the ninth, his 35th of the season. Barry 
Bonds hit a solo homer in the seventh, his 29th overall and sixth in seven 
games. Bonds is hitting .451 (14 for 31) with 11 RBIs during the first seven 
games of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry did not play for San Francisco, resting his sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 2, St. Louis 0 -- After 15-12 victory and a 10-0 loss earlier this 
week, the Astros won a relatively normal game at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Swindell and John Hudek combined on a five-hitter, and Chris Donnels hit 
a go-ahead double in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury (10-9), who has lost eight of his last 10 decisions, struck out 
eight in 6 2/3 innings. He gave up eight hits and both runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 9, Colorado 8 -- Mark Grace beat the Rockies with his third double and 
fourth hit of the game, driving in two runs in the eighth inning in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 7-7, in the eighth, pinch-hitter Tuffy Rhodes singled 
with one out against Steve Reed and moved to second on a walk to Mike 
Maksudian. Grace followed with a double to right to give the Cubs a 9-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Veres (1-0) pitched two innings before Jose Bautista came on in the 
ninth. Bautista got two outs, but Colorado put runners on first and third 
before Dan Plesac got the final out for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago pounded starter Kevin Ritz for five runs and eight hits in 1 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, San Diego 2 -- The Expos completed a season sweep of the Padres 
when Butch Henry tossed 7 2/3 innings, giving up two runs on six hits. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Expos' 12th consecutive victory over the Padres at Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry struck out two and walked one, that intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Moises Alou's bases-loaded single against Andy Benes (6-11) in the fifth 
inning broke a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Wil Cordero's two-run homer, his 14th, made it 5-2 in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 8, Cincinnati 7 -- Gary Sheffield, out of the starting lineup to rest, 
hit the first pinch-hit home run in Marlin history, a two-run shot in the 
eighth inning, and knocked in the winning run in the ninth in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield's homer, a franchise-record 21st, put the Marlins ahead, 7-6, in the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Natal opened the eighth with a single against Jeff Brantley (5-5) and 
Sheffield hit his seventh homer this season against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Carrasco gave up Sheffield's run-scoring grounder in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Atlanta 4 -- Tom Foley singled in the go-ahead run in the 
seventh inning, and Pirate starter Denny Neagle drove in three runs as 
Pittsburgh continued to frustrate the Braves. 
</P>

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TEXAS LEFT STANDING AFTER 39-HIT BARRAGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Juan Gonzalez hit a two-run home run in the 14th inning, his second homer of 
the night, and the Texas Rangers overcame five Cleveland homers to defeat the 
Indians, 13-11, at Cleveland in a game that lasted nearly six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians lost 11-game winner Mark Clark to a fractured right wrist in the 
third inning, then squandered the remainder of what had been a five-run lead 
when Manuel Lee hit a three-run homer against Jeff Russell in the ninth, tying 
the score at 11-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The homer was Lee's first in 321 at-bats since last Sept. 3, and only his 18th 
since coming to the majors in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Casian, the Indians' sixth pitcher, yielded a one-out single in the 14th 
by Jose Canseco -- his fourth hit -- before Gonzalez drove his 16th home run 
into the bleachers in left. Gonzalez also homered in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Belle, Eddie Murray, Jim Thome, Paul Sorrento and Wayne Kirby homered 
for the Indians, who have hit 10 homers in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers matched a team record with 22 hits and used eight pitchers. The 
Indians had 17 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians preserved the tie in the 11th when Gonzalez threw out Belle trying 
to score from first on Sandy Alomar's single to shallow left. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 1, Oakland 0 -- Melido Perez outdueled the A's Steve Ontiveros and 
Mike Stanley hit a home run in the fifth at Oakland for the game's only run. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for only five hits, two by New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez pitched eight innings for his fifth consecutive victory. The 
right-hander struck out five and walked one. Steve Howe pitched the ninth for 
his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley led off the fifth with his 11th home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez retired 16 consecutive batters in one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Minnesota 2 -- Ed Sprague homered and tied his career-high with 
four runs batted in and Juan Guzman pitched eight strong innings at Toronto to 
give the Blue Jays their fourth consecutive win and ninth in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins, who were swept in the three-game series, lost for the 10th time in 
a row on the road and 23rd time in 30 games overall as they fell into last 
place in the AL Central for the first time since May 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman (10-9) gave up five hits in eight innings and struck out four. He lost 
his shutout in the eighth, but has won his last four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 11, Kansas City 1 -- Jose Valentin, one of five rookies in the 
Brewers' lineup, hit his first major league grand slam, and another rookie, 
Matt Mieske, drove in three runs at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee scored five times with two outs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Nilsson had tripled in the sixth when Felix Jose barely missed his 
sinking liner in right. When Jose got to his feet, he looked around for several 
seconds, not realizing the ball was between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mieske followed with an RBI single for a 2-0 lead. After consecutive walks, 
Valentin hit Tom Gordon's first pitch off the right-field foul pole for his 
seventh homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mieske added a two-run double against Stan Belinda in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Detroit 0 -- Jack McDowell pitched a six-hitter at Chicago for his 
10th career shutout and his sixth victory in seven decisions. McDowell struck 
out nine and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 It was McDowell's second shutout and third third complete game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Franco hit an RBI double and Bob Zupcic singled with one out in the 
first and scored on Franco's two-out double. Franco then scored on Robin 
Ventura's single.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LORRAINE TO START AGAINST YANKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann liked what he saw during Andrew Lorraine's 
three-inning major-league debut Sunday and inserted the rookie left-hander in 
the starting rotation. Lorraine will replace Russ Springer, a right-hander, for 
Friday night's game against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck (Hernandez, Angel pitching coach) likes his weapons against the 
Yankees," Lachemann said, "and we think he's better suited to start right now 
than (Springer)." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer started Sunday's game against the Orioles and gave up five earned 
runs, including two home runs, in three innings. Lorraine relieved and gave up 
nine hits and four earned runs in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them were "pretty cheap hits," Lachemann said.

 The decision to play this weekend's Red Sox-Mariner series in Boston instead 
of Seattle sent Boston players scurrying around Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Steve Farr was standing on the dugout steps with his cellular 
phone, trying to reach his wife, who had just landed in Seattle. First base 
coach Frank White was in the lobby trying to make reservations for a hotel in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 And Manager Butch Hobson was wondering about the news. The Red Sox are 21-23 
at Fenway Park this season. JOHN WEYLER

PALMER SHOOTS 69 FOR SHARE OF LEAD; GOLF: JACKLIN HAS MISERABLE DAY AT SENIOR 
BRITISH OPEN WITH 81, DISQUALIFICATION IN HIS SENIOR DEBUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer shot a three-under 69 in the Senior British Open on Wednesday 
and was tied for the first-round lead with Liam Higgins of Ireland and Alberto 
Croce of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer was six under par over the last 13 holes, making an eagle at the 
par-five 15th using a driver and one-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, 64, left the press tent at the U.S. Open last month in tears after 
shooting rounds of 77 and 81. Many thought he was seriously contemplating 
giving up competitive golf, but two weeks off and a solid opening round at 
Royal Lytham and St Annes seemed to have changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the grandchildren with me for a week, I swam every day, hit a few balls 
in the afternoons and had some early nights," Palmer told the Times of London. 
"I guess it has done me some good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not very confident when I came over here, but something just happened 
when I made a good contact on the fifth hole. Suddenly it felt better and now 
I'm cautiously optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer was three over when he reached the fifth, having birdied No. 1 before 
making double-bogey on No. 2 and bogeys on Nos. 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth was nothing remarkable -- a five-iron to 30 feet and two putts for a 
par -- but it sent Palmer on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Things certainly didn't go as smoothly for Tony Jacklin, who was disqualified 
in his senior debut for signing an incorrect scorecard. Jacklin won the British 
Open on the same course 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacklin signed for a four at No. 13, when he had actually made five. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought the low point of his round had been when he took an eight at the 
par-five 11th after his ball rebounded onto his chest as he tried to escape 
from a greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 He was uncertain of the penalty, but after some discussion it was agreed it 
should be two strokes. Jacklin completed his round in 81. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the trouble I had at the 11th, and getting the penalty for that 
sorted out, I hadn't checked my card closely enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer was sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened to Tony is too bad," he said. "It does happen occasionally. I 
think he was just a little despondent about his round."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SHULMAN, SOLIS MERIT VOTES AS MEETING'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though all precincts won't be heard from for another four days, here is 
the way one best-of-the-meeting ballot will look for the Hollywood Park season, 
which concludes Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer -- Sandy Shulman. After a mild slump, Shulman has come to life again 
in the closing days to regain the lead over Ron McAnally, continuing an 
eight-month roll. He won Hollywood Park last fall and was third behind Jack Van 
Berg and Bill Spawr at Santa Anita. McAnally and Gary Jones, who never has a 
bad meeting, also deserve mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey -- Alex Solis. Dedicated and not afraid to spend time improving 
himself, and blessed with a talented agent in Harry Hacek, Solis has already 
wrapped up the title, although he won't ride for the next five days because he 
is suspended. He has shown versatility with the kind of horses he rides and 
should be successful at Del Mar as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Race -- Beverly Hills Handicap. Hollywood Wildcat, the 1994 Eclipse Award 
winner as the nation's top older filly or mare, and Flawlessly, the female 
grass champion the past two years, finished together in the 1 1/8-mile grass 
race. And the winner? Corrazona, who edged both and is perfect in three 
American starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming Horse -- Town Caper. The late-running, 4-year-old Fatih colt rattled 
off three consecutive victories -- two for trainer Cliff Sise, the other for 
Bill Wilmot -- and will try to keep the streak going for new conditioner Pete 
Eurton. Also worthy of mention is Running Fox, who improved immensely after 
joining Bob Hess Jr.'s barn. He easily defeated $12,500 claimers in his first 
race for Hess on June 2, then returned 27 days later and was even more dominant 
in a low-level allowance race, winning by 5 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinter -- Cool Air. No one dominated the main-track sprints, but this 
4-year-old filly is in a different league at 5 1/2 furlongs on this course. She 
is perfect in three tries at the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 2-Year-Old Filly -- Serena's Song. This is an easy choice because the Rahy 
filly dominated maidens in her California debut, then coasted home in the 
Landaluce. She is supposed to return in Monday's Hollywood Juvenile, and if she 
beats the boys, she will be the top 2-year-old as well. 
</P>
<P>
 2-Year-Old Male -- To be determined. This one hinges on what happens in the 
Juvenile. If Serena's Song wins, no one deserves the honor. The top 2-year-old 
males are Mr Purple and Sierra Diablo. 
</P>
<P>
 3-Year-Old Filly -- Lakeway. She is the best of her class to run at the 
meeting, and she might also be no worse than the second-best 3-year-old in the 
country. The daughter of Seattle Slew blew away Sardula in the much-anticipated 
Hollywood Oaks, and although conventional wisdom says she shouldn't run in the 
Travers, how much fun would it be to see her tackle Holy Bull on Aug. 20 at 
Saratoga? 
</P>
<P>
 3-Year-Old Male -- Unfinished Symph. Although his pedigree says he is supposed 
to be at his best sprinting on the dirt, the Aloha Prospector colt has become a 
terror routing on the dirt. After finishing second in the Spotlight, he looked 
strong in winning the Will Rogers and Cinema. The only other 3-year-old who 
merits consideration is Dramatic Gold, if he wins Saturday's Swaps Stakes 
impressively. The son of Slew O' Gold looked like a different horse when he 
returned June 25 after being away for more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Older Filly/Mare -- To be determined. The two front-runners are Golden Klair 
and Andestine, who traded decisions in the Hawthorne and Milady, respectively. 
Their rubber match will come Sunday in the Vanity, and the way the race is 
developing in terms of pace, Andestine, who provided Chris McCarron with 
victory No. 6,000 in the Milady, looks to have the edge again this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Handicap Horse -- Slew Of Damascus. Third behind The Wicked North and Kingdom 
Found in the Californian, a race he needed, the Slewacide gelding got the money 
in the big one, beating Fanmore in the Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two other categories that also remain to be decided -- grass horse 
and horse of the meeting. If Grand Flotilla wins the Sunset Handicap on Sunday, 
he deserves both honors because he also won the Hollywood Turf Handicap on 
Memorial Day, upsetting Bien Bien and Arcangues. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 7-year-old roan is beaten Sunday, there is no real clear-cut choice for 
top grass horse, and horse of the meeting could be Serena's Song, if she wins 
the Juvenile; or Lakeway, on the strength of her devastating victory in the 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, who underwent nasal surgery July 11, won't return until 
Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw (Dr. Glenn Weissmann) on Monday and he advised me to take the rest of 
this meet off," Delahoussaye said. "It's coming along well, and I'm feeling a 
lot better. . . . But I don't want to take any chances on coming back too soon 
after the operation. I'm doing some light activity and I plan to work a couple 
of horses (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, who was scheduled to return in the San Diego Handicap on July 30 at 
Del Mar, was among six horses entered Wednesday morning for Friday night's 
$61,200 Answer Do Handicap at seven furlongs. The 6-year-old gelding, who 
hasn't run since Feb. 13, will be making his first start for trainer Richard 
Mandella. Kent Desormeaux was named to ride. . . . Garrett Gomez, a top rider 
in the Midwest who is going to try to make it on the local circuit, won with 
his first mount, scoring on 9-2 shot Flying Safeera in Wednesday's fifth race. 
. . . Jockey Martin Pedroza turned 29 Wednesday.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: WHETHER IN A CAR OR PLANE, STEWART SPENDS PLENTY OF 
TIME BUCKLED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No one has even attempted it, much less accomplished it, but Tony Stewart is 
shooting for a rare midget car racing double this year by driving for the 
championship in the U.S. Auto Club's national series in the Midwest and the 
USAC Western States regional series on the Pacific Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 And to make sure he doesn't miss anything, the 23-year-old from Rushville, 
Ind., also drives in Silver Crown championship dirt cars and sprint cars, when 
he has a night off from the midgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the Western States race Saturday night at Bakersfield Speedway in 
Oildale, Stewart is fourth in West Coast standings and leads the national 
series by 18 points over Andy Michner of Somerset, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my last conflict last week, so now I can race in both series without 
having to miss a race," Stewart said. "I know it's a longshot, but I got off to 
such a good start early in the year with the TV races in Ventura that I decided 
to give it a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart finished first or second in five of the first six races and had a 
45-point lead when the national season started and he began missing races. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten events remain on the regional schedule, and Stewart is 130 points behind 
John Cofer of Sonoma and also trails Billy Boat of Phoenix and Jay Drake of Via 
Verde. Last Saturday night, while Stewart was racing in Gainesville, Ga., Drake 
took over the white Larry Brown-owned No. 36 midget Stewart usually drives and 
won the main event at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be no direct conflicts, but Stewart still is on a tight schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 20 he has a Silver Crown race in Springfield, Ill., and a midget race 
that night in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right after the Springfield race, four of us will jet to Oxnard and take a 
helicopter to Ventura in time for qualifying, we hope," he said. "One night, 
after a race in Ventura, I caught the red-eye to Indianapolis and drove to 
Winchester (Ind.) in time for a 10 a.m. drivers meeting."

 Brown, a Bakersfield auto parts manufacturer, sponsors Stewart in West Coast 
races and flies him back and forth from his home in Indianapolis, where he 
lives in an enclave of race car drivers that includes USAC midget champion Mike 
Bliss, Page Jones and Clint Mears. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, at Terre Haute, Ind., Stewart flipped his Silver Crown car and 
narrowly escaped serious injuries when the car caught fire with Stewart hanging 
upside down in his harness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was OK until the fire broke out and the safety crew sprayed me with some 
chemical," he said. "I couldn't breathe, and I couldn't unbuckle myself. It was 
panic time. I think most of my bruises came when I was thrashing around trying 
to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the next night found Stewart at a kart race -- with his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the guys asked me if I wanted to get back in a kart -- that's how I 
got started in racing -- so I did and won my class." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight he will be in a national midget race at Indianapolis Raceway Park and 
Friday night at Rushville to drive a three-quarter midget at his hometown's 
county fair before jetting to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, he will drive a midget Wednesday night in Kokomo, Ind., a sprint 
car Thursday at Indianapolis, another sprint car Friday at La Salle, Ill., and 
back to the national midget series Saturday night at Portsmouth, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racing every night sure beats what I was doing," Stewart said. "I was just 
out of high school, working in a machine shop for $5 an hour. In the winter, it 
was so cold in there that if you didn't keep your feet moving, your toes would 
get numb. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day I got invited to drive in the Copper Classic in Phoenix, and when I 
finished second I got $3,500. It didn't take me long to figure out that I'd 
have to work 3 1/2 months to make as much money as I'd made in one race, so I 
quit my job to go racing full time." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and other West Coast drivers will not have seven-time western regional 
champion Sleepy Tripp to contend with Saturday night. Tripp and long-time car 
owner Gary Zarounian parted company before last week's race, leaving the former 
national champion without a ride. Zarounian hired Richard Griffin of Silver 
City, N.M., to drive his car.

LOS ALAMITOS; DREAM A SECRET OFFERS FRESH LOOK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DERBY 
TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the continuing competition among derby hopefuls, the newest entrant, Dream 
A Secret, also might be the most noticeable when he leaves the gate in the 
Southern California Derby trials on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A promising 2-year-old who finished 1993 with surgery, Dream A Secret returned 
to racing July 10 and finished second in an allowance race at Los Alamitos. He 
certainly will be the fresh horse in the trials and the finals of the Grade I 
race, scheduled Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Town Policy Handicap winner Artesia's Special Gal, the Charles 
Bloomquist-trained Moo Vin First and Movados, a tough runner from the Brian 
Koriner barn, probably will be crowd favorites, considering their recent 
heroics. But all have worked hard this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dream A Secret has run only one race this year, but in six as a 2-year-old, he 
won three before he was injured. And Bruce Hawkinson, who trains the colt for 
Ed Allred, said Dream A Secret might be better now than he was at his best last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 He chipped both knees in the California Futurity, the break-out of the 
California Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We operated in November and turned him out," Hawkinson said. "We got him back 
the first of May." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lewis rode Dream A Secret in the colt's debut last April. Before his next 
start, Lewis broke his collarbone and needed six weeks off. Danny Cardoza 
picked up the mount and rode Dream A Secret to three consecutive victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Cardoza retired at the end of last season and became the trainer for 
Vessels Stallion Farm, leaving Dream A Secret available. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a really nice colt," Lewis said. "He doesn't always break real well, but 
he comes flying late. Some horses are like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis already had two of the top horses in the 3-year-old division in Her 
First Cin and Rainbow Sun, winner of El Primero Derby. Dream A Secret gives him 
a third. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest 10 from Friday's two heats will compete in the Southern California 
Derby. Trials for the Governor's Cup Futurity will be held Saturday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A new jockey to watch might be Richard Hawkinson, who begins his second week 
of riding with a victory in his only race. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon learning that Tim Murphy had taken off the mount on Undisclosed in last 
Saturday's second race, Hawkinson ran to the Los Alamitos racing office to get 
his license. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old son of trainer Bruce Hawkinson had decided a month ago to 
become licensed. But he hadn't done it when Undisclosed lost its jockey. With 
the added incentive of a good horse, Hawkinson had the mount in that evening's 
second race within 20 minutes of being licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the second betting choice for trainer Earl Tobler, Hawkinson guided the 
5-year-old gelding to a victory by a neck at 350 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited my whole life for this moment," Hawkinson said. "I never thought I 
would feel this jazzed about it. But when I was about to win that race I could 
feel myself sweating from the excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkinson was introduced to horses and the backstretch area by his father, who 
started as a jockey at Los Alamitos in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hawkinson began galloping at the track seven or eight years ago, but 
also worked as a steward's assistant and an assistant on the starting gate. He 
waited to get his jockey's license because he felt unable to commit to the 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago I wouldn't have believed he could have gotten the weight off," 
his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he stays with it and makes it as a jock, he'll earn it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Avison surged from the gate and never faltered in taking Saturday's Chicado V 
Stakes Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning by three-quarters of a length in 19.59 seconds, Avison tied the stakes 
record set by Heisajoy in 1990 and gave trainer Connie Hall her second stakes 
victory of the weekend. Trucklin Six defeated two-time distance champion 
Griswald in the 870-yard Table Tennis Handicap on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The field for the Chicado V included last year's champion gelding, Four Forty 
Blast, All-Star Jockey Challenge winner Childish, Shuefly Handicap winner 
Beinbetter and Make Mine Bud, who had defeated Avison twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He broke awesome," winning jockey Jose Badilla Jr. said. "From there he just 
played with this field." 
</P>
<P>
 Trucklin Six, Hall's other stakes winner, did not have it so easy. Breaking 
from the fourth post, Trucklin Six left the gate a step behind leaders Griswald 
and Speedy Lunch. Midway through the 870-yard race, jockey Eddie Garcia dropped 
Trucklin Six to the rail, allowing Griswald and Speedy Lunch to duel for the 
lead without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone went to the lead in the early going," Garcia said. "I just wanted to 
stay close and give my horse a chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Arabian star Magna Terra Smoky won Friday's Silk Designs Sprint Handicap at 4 
1/2-furlongs only two weeks after winning the 1 1/8-mile Charles O. Pollard 
Handicap. . . . Claude Ramsey, executive director of the Arabian Horse Trust, 
announced that the 1994 Darley Awards, the breed's highest honors, will be held 
at Los Alamitos next spring. . . . Racing Secretary Ron Church scheduled a 
second set of thoroughbred claiming stakes. The two 4 1/2-furlong sprints for 
$5,000 claimers will be run Aug. 5-6. Each offers a purse of $15,000.

DIGEST: OLSSON QUITS SAUGUS BASKETBALL JOB AFTER 2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Olsson has resigned after two seasons as Saugus High basketball coach, 
Saugus Athletic Administrator Randy Parker said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsson could not be reached for comment, but Parker said he resigned for 
several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a combination of factors: The stress of dealing with some of the 
pressures, mainly from parents, a change in his teaching assignment and he 
wanted to spend more time with his kids," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said Olsson, who took the Centurions to the second round of the 
Southern Section Division I-A playoffs last season, has not resigned his 
teaching position. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said Olsson's decision was "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is he an excellent coach, but he's a first-class person and those 
people are hard to find," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centurions finished 12-13 in 1994, and their 3-5 Foothill League record 
was good for third place. Olsson's two-year record was 18-30. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said there is no timeline for naming a replacement. "Obviously we'd 
like to do it as soon as possible for the benefit of the program," Parker said, 
"but we are not going to jump into it until we get a first-class person."

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL PLAYOFFS ; VERDUGO HILLS WINS ON SQUEEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben Malen's suicide squeeze with one out in the eighth inning scored Corby 
Foster in Verdugo Hills' 1-0 victory over Quartz Hill on Wednesday in a 
District 20 American Legion playoff game at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill (16-7), seeded No. 3, was the first team knocked out of the 
10-team, double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gantt (4-2) pitched a five-hitter for Verdugo Hills (16-7), striking out 
eight and walking one. Gantt, who recently graduated from Glendale High, 
pitched a perfect game last spring for the Dynamiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills' David Boger had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In other District 20 playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North 9, Newhall-Santa Clarita 2 -- Tony Montiel hit a two-run home run 
and Bryan LaCour was three for six with three RBIs, leading Valley North to an 
upset of the No. 2-seeded team at Burroughs High in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Montiel's homer broke a 1-1 tie in the top of the fifth. LaCour drove in three 
runs with a bases-loaded double in the seventh inning. Rod Daryabigi also added 
two hits for Valley North (15-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Jim DeBiase (5-1) picked up the victory by pitching seven innings. He gave up 
one run on seven hits and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Dean hit his seventh home run for Newhall-Santa Clarita (17-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Encino 7, Van Nuys West 1 -- Barry Matthews scattered seven hits in 7 1/3 
innings for Encino at Birmingham High. The loss eliminated Van Nuys West 
(13-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews, a right-hander who will be a junior at Crespi, gave up one earned 
run and one walk. He struck out five. Jon Cuccias pitched the final 1 2/3 
innings for Encino (17-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Encino put the game away with six runs on five singles in the bottom of the 
third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino right fielder Ray Munoz had three of his team's eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills West 13, Antelope Valley South 12 -- A game between teams known 
for offense and not for pitching was high-scoring, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpected, though, was top-seeded Antelope Valley South being upset at 
Burroughs High. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills West (16-7) will face Van Nuys East in a winners' bracket game 
at 4:30 p.m. today at Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley South (18-4) drops into an elimination game against Encino at 
1 p.m. at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's other matchups, Verdugo Hills will meet Newhall-Santa Clarita at 10 
a.m. at Birmingham, and Sun Valley will face Valley North at 1 p.m. at 
Burroughs.

 WAILIN' WEILAND: Orange County bashing is alive and well, from people you 
don't expect. The Stone Temple Pilots got an enthusiastic reception when they 
played at Irvine Meadows last Saturday night, despite a run-in lead singer 
Scott Weiland had with one fan. So what did Weiland, a Huntington Beach native, 
have to say about the crowd? . . . At Sunday night's concert in San Diego, he 
praised that crowd, saying he was glad to play for people who liked music, not 
like "those conservative fascist Nazis in Orange County. That was a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 SAY IT'S SO, JOE: Joe Garagiola may be just a .257 lifetime hitter, but he's 
made millions as baseball's resident humorist and TV pitchman. He'll be guest 
auctioneer Friday at a charity auction that's part of the huge, four-day sports 
memorabilia show that starts today at the Anaheim Convention Center. . . . Also 
featured: four women who were members of the All American Girls Professional 
Baseball League, which thrived for a few years after World War II.

 THEATER ROOTS: Comic George Lopez likes to use his stand-up routine to debunk 
racial stereotypes. Which is why he promises a lot of ethnic humor when he 
appears tonight at South Coast Repertory. Lopez returns as emcee and performer 
in the annual "Raices: Una Noche del Teatro '94" (Roots: A Night of Theater 
'94). . . . While it's a show of music, dance and theater by Latino artists -- 
to benefit a South Coast Rep project helping Latino playwrights -- Lopez says: 
"Last year's audience was quite diverse." 
</P>
<P>
 JUST A LOCAL TEAM? "Angels in the Outfield," currently at 20 local theaters, 
is about a fictional California Angels team. It's supposed to mean a lot of 
good, free publicity for the Angels. But it hasn't always worked out that way. 
. . . Here's a review from the latest People magazine: "The current Angels are 
a moderately successful team of little interest to anyone outside Anaheim."

END OF THE LINE FOR MIAMI TROLLEYS AS FEAR TAKES TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The operators of a trolley service say they are halting their sightseeing 
tours of Miami because fear and violence are scaring riders away. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Town Trolleys, headquartered in Key West, Fla., will end its tours of 
Miami on July 31, according to a story in Wednesday's Miami Herald. The company 
has ferried 500,000 passengers to attractions throughout Miami in the past six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Officer Christopher Belland said ridership dwindled to fewer 
than 40,000 last year. He blamed media reports that have heightened the fear of 
random violence, and hotel concierges, taxi drivers and local residents who 
advise visitors not to leave the safety of their seaside hotels.

PAUL DELVAUX; ARTIST WAS PIONEER IN SURREALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Delvaux, whose surreal nudes and dreamlike depictions of skeletons and 
trains sell for $1 million and more, died Wednesday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not formally a member of the surrealist movement, he was 
considered one of the last if not the last of that pioneering group that 
shocked and offended much of the art world in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgian-born artist died in Veurne near the North Sea resort of St. 
Idesbald. Incapacitated by failing eyesight and poor health, the solitary 
artist had not painted in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Delvaux's career spanned almost 70 years, during which he gained fame for 
depicting the richness of the subconscious in figurative but irrational images. 
His work often reflected alienation and featured empty train stations, deserted 
vehicles or barren deserts. 
</P>
<P>
 His paintings hang alongside those of Salvador Dali and fellow Belgian Rene 
Magritte in many private collections and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young Girl in Front of a Temple," which was painted in 1949, sold for $1 
million 40 years later. Other major works included "Sleeping Venus" (1933) and 
"Evening Trains" (1957). 
</P>
<P>
 Delvaux, who made naked women a central theme of his paintings during a time 
of stringent moral codes, was no stranger to controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1948 show was off limits to priests. Children were not allowed into a 1960s 
retrospective in the resort of Ostend. 
</P>
<P>
 His seemingly somnambulant, naked women have been a common target for 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They symbolize nothing. I paint them because they are beautiful and 
desirable," he said. "I have something against the word symbol because it has 
something artificial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest influence had been skeletons. "Crucifixion" (1951-52) is among the 
most grotesque of his output. 
</P>
<P>
 Delvaux began as a painter of portraits, land and seascapes in Belgium, but 
was influenced by surrealism in the 1930s after traveling in Italy and France. 
</P>
<P>
 He destroyed most of his early work, either because he did not like it or to 
reuse the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1960s onward, his work had increased in value so that major museums 
in Europe and America were often the only places that could afford him.

ANTIOXIDANTS FAIL TO SLOW CANCER, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Antioxidant vitamins, often touted as a way to ward off cancer, fail to 
prevent the development of precancerous growths in the colon, a study shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The research is the latest to cast doubt on the popular but largely unproven 
notion that extra doses of these nutrients provide a shortcut to good health. 
</P>
<P>
 Beta carotene and Vitamins C and E were tested on 864 men and women who had 
already been treated for colorectal adenomas, polyps that precede cancer. Among 
the 751 who completed follow-up tests, researchers found no signs that the 
vitamins had stopped them from getting more colon growths. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal of money is being spent to market the concept that taking 
additional vitamins will stop cancer. This particular study does not suggest 
that," said one researcher, Dr. John A. Coller of the Lahey Clinic in 
Burlington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the journal carried a study showing that Vitamin E and beta 
carotene, which is the vegetable form of Vitamin A, failed to protect smokers 
from lung cancer. In fact, that study reached the surprising conclusion that 
beta carotene was associated with an increased risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those vitamins had seemed to be an especially promising way to attack colon 
cancer, although earlier, smaller studies produced conflicting results. 
</P>
<P>
 People who eat lots of fruits and vegetables are less likely to get colon 
cancer. Many assumed that the key was the relatively large amount of 
antioxidant vitamins in fruits and vegetables. Antioxidants soak up hazardous 
oxygen molecules called free radicals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest study, volunteers were randomly assigned to take dummy pills or 
daily vitamin supplements. Of that group, 751 underwent colon exams after one 
year and four years later to check for new adenomas. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors found that the vitamins made no difference in the risk of 
precancerous growths. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 113 patients who did not complete the study, 44 died, 32 no longer 
wished to participate, 19 were too ill or had moved and 18 dropped out for 
unknown reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who received the vitamins took 25 milligrams of beta carotene, one 
gram of Vitamin C, 400 milligrams of Vitamin E or a combination of the three.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; TUTTLE 
CALLS FOR AUDIT OF REGIONAL UTILITY AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle called Wednesday for an audit of a regional 
utility agency with $3.7 billion in bond debt for which the city is partially 
liable.  
</P>
<P>
 An audit of the Southern California Public Power Authority would coincide with 
ongoing efforts to streamline the Department of Water and Power, Tuttle said in 
a letter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge the council to take swift and aggressive action to assure the public . 
. . that the city's investments and involvements with SCPPA and other joint 
powers authorities are consistent with other city policies and best practices," 
Tuttle said.  
</P>
<P>
 DWP board President Dennis Tito could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena-based SCPPA was created in 1980 to acquire reliable, cost- 
efficient electrical generation facilities and transmission systems for its 11 
member agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle is concerned about the lack of city oversight because SCPPA's bond debt 
is backed by the fiscal strength of its members. He estimated the city's share 
of the debt amounts to $1.4 billion.

COLLAPSING FREEWAY WALL KILLS 1, HURTS 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quake-damaged freeway sound wall being razed by a construction crew 
collapsed Tuesday night, killing one worker and injuring at least one other, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said the incident 
occurred at 7:28 p.m. along the Branford Street on-ramp to the southbound 
Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a private construction crew had been dismantling the wall, 
unbolting the 12-foot-high concrete panels from their foundations for removal 
by a crane. Humphrey said it appeared that the wall had been completely 
unbolted but not yet attached to the crane when it toppled, crushing one worker 
-- a man about 25 years old -- and injuring a second man. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatally injured worker was declared dead at the scene, and the injured 
worker was taken to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, where he was 
listed in good condition with minor back and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Names of the victims were being withheld pending notification of families. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey said investigators from the Fire Department, the California Highway 
Patrol and the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene, but added 
that a final determination will be made by Cal/OSHA officers.

SPRINGER USES OLD APPROACH TO SAVE ANGELS; BASEBALL: HE SHUTS DOWN RED SOX WITH 
HIS THREE-QUARTERS DELIVERY AND BOSTON LOSES, 8-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wednesday afternoon, Russ Springer was slumped in front of his locker, trying 
to explain why he had been replaced in the starting rotation by rookie Andrew 
Lorraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Springer's recall from triple-A Vancouver June 9, the Angels had been 
trying to get him to take advantage of his height (6 feet 4) and pitch 
"downhill," as Manager Marcel Lachemann puts it. Springer struggled with the 
over-the-top delivery, though, and sounded almost relieved to be in the bullpen 
because he also was permitted to use his old delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just wasn't comfortable," he said. "I wanted to go back to the way I was 
pitching in Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few hours later, Springer was back in a comfort zone, pitching with his 
new, old three-quarters delivery, the one that had helped him to a 7-4 record 
with a 3.04 earned-run average in the minors. He retired 10 of the first 11 
batters he faced and picked up the first save as the Angels beat the Red Sox, 
8-4, in front of 17,180 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most impressive thing about (Springer's performance) was the way he was 
throwing strikes with all his pitches," Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this a case of Lachemann, the longtime pitching coach, trying to fine tune 
an already smooth running machine? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hm-hmmm," he said, smiling. "That's exactly what I told Russ." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time this season the Angels had managed to sweep a series and 
the first time they had won three in a row since mid-June. And inconsistent 
pitching has been the most glaring factor in their inability to string a few 
victories together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels staked Leftwich to a 4-0 lead after two innings, but then the game 
developed into a see-saw, you-score-then-we'll-score affair and Leftwich 
finally succumbed in the sixth inning after Tom Brunansky and Mike Greenwell 
hit consecutive doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich left with a 6-4 lead, but given the way baseballs were flying around 
the park -- the two teams already had collected 16 hits, including four doubles 
and two homers and they were only one out into the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 So nobody in the stands was waving a broom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty much up for grabs when Russ came in," Lachemann said. "And he 
pretty much set it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, 0-1 in four relief appearances before Wednesday night, struck out 
four and gave up three singles. He may not have slammed the door, but he 
managed to push it shut, which is all the Angels can ask for these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I started warming up with my old arm angle, I already felt much 
better," Springer said. "My curveball was breaking better and I was throwing it 
harder. I was just more relaxed, more confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when I got out there, I was able to move the ball in and out and up and 
down. I was throwing my curve for strikes and my changeup for strikes. I felt 
like I was back home." 
</P>
<P>
 Home hadn't been all that sweet for the Angels, but the Angel hitters, at 
least, are thriving. They picked up 12 more hits Wednesday -- for a total of 34 
in the last three games -- including home runs by Chili Davis and Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two hitters in the Angel order -- Chad Curtis and Spike Owen -- 
scored as the Angels roughed up Chris Nabholz for two runs on three hits. And 
they went ahead, 4-0, in the second inning. Leftwich retired the first six Red 
Sox before giving up a single and a two-run homer to Damon Berryhill in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, leading off the Angel third, hit a rocket in almost the exact same spot 
over the right-center field fence as Berryhill. It was Davis' 20th homer of the 
season, marking the seventh year in which he has hit at least 20 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson slammed his 10th homer of the season in the seventh, but by then 
Springer had things under control.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LORRAINE TO START AGAINST YANKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann liked what he saw during Andrew Lorraine's 
three-inning major-league debut Sunday and inserted the rookie left-hander in 
the starting rotation. Lorraine will replace Russ Springer, a right-hander, for 
Friday night's game against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck (Hernandez, Angel pitching coach) likes his weapons against the 
Yankees," Lachemann said, "and we think he's better suited to start right now 
than (Springer)." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer started Sunday's game against the Orioles and gave up five earned 
runs, including two home runs, in three innings. Lorraine relieved and gave up 
nine hits and four earned runs in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them were "pretty cheap hits," Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to play this weekend's Red Sox-Mariner series in Boston instead 
of Seattle sent Boston players scurrying around Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Steve Farr was standing on the dugout steps with his cellular 
phone, trying to reach his wife, who had just landed in Seattle. First base 
coach Frank White was in the lobby trying to make reservations for a hotel in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 And Manager Butch Hobson was wondering about the news. The Red Sox are 21-23 
at Fenway Park this season. 
</P>

 Wives of the Angel players are playing host to hosting a canned food drive 
during the four- game series against the Yankees that which begins tonight. The 
drive is in association with the Food Distribution Center of Orange County. 
Fans bringing a canned food item will receive a photograph of a player from his 
wife. JOHN WEYLER

LOCAL NOTES: FREEDOM BOWL GETS THREE-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH WAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new three-year contract between the Freedom Bowl and the Western Athletic 
Conference was announced Wednesday by Orange County Sports Assn. and Freedom 
Bowl Executive Director Don Andersen and WAC Commissioner Karl Benson. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement places the WAC's second-place team against the Pacific 10 
Conference's third-place team this season and in 1996; the WAC's third-place 
team will participate in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted with the new arrangement," Andersen said. "The WAC plays the 
most entertaining football in America and the Pac-10 is traditionally one of 
the strongest conferences ever formed." 
</P>
<P>
 The WAC has been represented in seven of the 10 Freedom Bowls and the Pac-10 
has been in four. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which lost to Fresno State in 1992 and beat WAC opponent Utah in 1993, 
will not appear in the 1994 game because of a new no-repeat arrangement with 
the Pac-10.

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; WOODS TAKES ANOTHER STEP FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiger Woods, the only male to win three U.S. Junior Amateur golf titles, made 
another breakthrough Saturday in spectacular fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, of Cypress, won the Pacific Northwest Amateur in Vancouver, Wash., 
routed Ted Snavely, 11 and 10, in the championship match on the 6,818-yard 
course at Royal Oaks Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory in a non-junior event for Woods, who will attend 
Stanford in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods closed out Snavely, the Oregon State Amateur champion who plays for the 
University of Oregon, on the 26th hole of a scheduled 36-hole match. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods shot nine-under-par 63 -- nine birdies and nine pars -- in the morning 
and was 13-under for the day when he won. He needed only 30 putts to complete 
the 26 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the best round of my life," Woods said Monday, "because I didn't hit 
the ball all that great but I hit all the right spots and made my putts." 
</P>
<P>
 The course record of 64 still stands because Woods was conceded three putts, 
the longest of which was about 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was the medalist in the two-round stroke-play qualifying for match play, 
shooting 68-69. In his 140 holes in the tournament, Woods was 35-under par. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods was at the top of his game despite suffering with a head cold. "Beware 
of the sick man," he said. "Isn't it always like that in sports: every time 
you're sick you play well. It was one of those weeks that everything came 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods hopes his performance this summer will earn him a spot on the U.S. team 
for the World Amateur team championship in October in France. Woods will play 
in three more amateur tournaments -- the Southern California Golf Assn. 
Amateur, the Porter Cup in New York, and the Western Amateur in Michigan, 
before attempting to qualify for the U.S. Amateur in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said he is especially looking forward to this weekend's SCGA Amateur 
Friday through Sunday at Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my friends will be there to watch," Woods said. "My best friend (fellow 
Western High graduate Bryon Bell) is going to caddie for me. So it's kind of 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The SCGA starts at 7 a.m. Friday for two rounds after which a cut will be made 
to the low 42 and ties. Play starts at 7:30 a.m. Saturday and Sunday. Hacienda 
Golf Club, 718 East Rd. in La Habra Heights, can be reached from Harbor 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp Richardson of Laguna Niguel is also entered in the SCGA Amateur, but he 
doesn't fit the profile of most entrants. Richardson is 48; most of his 
competitors are of college age. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go to an amateur tournament that's pretty much what you'll find," 
Richardson said. "You'll find a few guys my age but you'll have to look pretty 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But tough competition keeps him coming back, said Richardson, who was a 
two-time Pacific 8 Conference champion in 1967 and '68 and a first-team 
All-American at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't enjoy just going out and playing," he said. "I'd rather still try 
to be somewhat competitive. Not that I don't like playing but I wouldn't want 
just a steady diet of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson finished second in the SCGA Amateur in 1966 and '68, losing the '66 
title to John Jacobs on the third playoff hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's father, John, won the SCGA Amateur title in 1973 and the 1987 
U.S. Senior Amateur. John Richardson died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp Richardson, a stockbroker, carries a plus-1.9 index at El Niguel Country 
Club, but isn't able to practice as much as he would like because of a bad 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The back forced him out of qualifying for June's California Amateur, but he 
still went up to Pebble Beach to caddie for his son, Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a bag with a bad back? 
</P>
<P>
 "I made it through 15 holes the first day and he had to take over," Richardson 
said. "I made it nine holes the next day."

PUC TENTATIVELY OKS OPENING OF TOLL-CALL MARKET; UTILITIES: COMMISSION'S RULING 
TO LET LOCAL FIRMS ENTER LONG-DISTANCE MARKET WOULD ALSO RAISE MONTHLY BASIC 
SERVICE CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday issued a tentative ruling 
that would permit Californians to place so-called local long-distance calls 
through the phone company of their choice beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the policy change, the commission also proposed increases in basic 
monthly telephone service charges. The rate hikes are designed to offset the 
revenue local telephone companies will lose when they are forced to cede their 
monopoly on the $3-billion local long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, MCI, Sprint and other companies are expected to mount a fierce battle 
for a piece of the local long-distance -- or toll call -- business, offering 
rates far below those now charged by Pacific Bell and GTE. Local long-distance 
is defined as calls between points that are more than 12 miles apart but still 
within a local service region, such as calls between Los Angeles and Anaheim, 
or between Santa Monica and San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal comes 10 months after the PUC issued a similar order opening 
local long-distance to competition. But that order was rescinded a month later 
when it was learned that a Pacific Bell employee helped draft portions of it, 
in violation of commission procedures. A final ruling is now expected September 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed order issued Wednesday gives Pacific Bell and GTE smaller basic 
monthly rate increases than they had wanted, and Pacific Bell said it hopes to 
cut toll call rates more than the proposal allows. Still, some consumer 
advocates denounced the local rate hikes as harmful to the poor and elderly. 
Long-distance companies, meanwhile, applauded the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, which make most of the local long-distance calls, could come out 
ahead under the proposed decision. The PUC said it plans to approve cuts of up 
to 40% in what Pacific Bell and GTE charge for toll calls. For example, the 
charge for a three-minute call between Los Angeles and Anaheim would drop to 45 
cents from 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said residential customers, especially those who do not make 
many toll calls, would end up paying more. The flat rate for Pacific Bell 
residential customers would increase 35% to $11.25 a month from $8.25 a month. 
The flat rate for GTE residential customers would mushroom nearly 80% to $17.49 
from $9.75 under the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Business customers would also pay more for basic service. The measured rate 
for Pacific Bell business customers would increase 17% to $9.77 from $8.35. The 
flat rate for GTE business customers would balloon 86% to $16.99 from $9.10. 
But businesses are expected to benefit overall because they will save on local 
long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Long, an attorney with Toward Utility Rate Normalization, an advocacy 
group in San Francisco, asserted that 70% of Californians will pay more for 
phone service if the proposal is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a blow to Californians," Long said. "It is really bad news for people 
trying to economize on the phone bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC said the monthly phone bill for the median Pacific Bell residential 
customer would increase 3.6% to $23.55 from $22.31. The monthly phone bill for 
the median GTE residential customer would jump 14.8% to $24.86 from $21.66. 
</P>
<P>
 The order that was rescinded last fall called for larger increases in basic 
rates while permitting deeper cuts -- up to 60% -- in local long-distance 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell said that it plans to ask the commission for deeper toll cuts so 
it can be more competitive with rates charged by long-distance carriers. 
Indeed, shortly after the proposal was issued, MCI said it plans to underprice 
Pacific Bell by at least one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had proposed a 50% decrease as a starting point, with further discounts 
for people who use more of our services more often. We think there could be 
bigger discounts," said Pacific Bell vice president Mike Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he will ask the commission to offset larger toll rate cuts with 
increases in other charges, including the possibility of further increases in 
basic rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance carriers were generally pleased with the proposal, which MCI 
said made it "an important day for California." But the long-distance carriers 
said they plan to seek "open access" to make it easier for Californians to use 
their services for toll calls. Under the proposal, consumers must first dial a 
five-digit access code to use any carrier other than Pacific Bell or GTE for 
toll calls. The Coming Competition 
</P>
<P>
 The issue: The Public Utilities Commission has proposed rules that would allow 
competition in the local long-distance market. These changes require a new rate 
structure for Pacific Bell and GTE so they can compete with long-distance 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: When the old AT&T was broken up in 1984, the seven regional Bell 
operating companies were created to provide local telephone service. The 
remnants of AT&T and competitors such as MCI and Sprint were authorized to 
provide long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
 Types of calls: Bell companies are prohibited from carrying calls between 
LATAs. These calls are the province of highly competitive long-distance 
companies, though new federal legislation may soon allow local phone companies 
into the market. Within LATAs, calls between points more than 12 miles apart 
are toll calls, or "local long distance". In California, the local phone 
company has a monopoly on such calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed changes' effects on consumers: Rates for toll calls would drop. In 
its Public Utilities Commission proposal, Pacific Bell says the rate for a 5 
minute call between Los Angeles and Anaheim would drop to 45 cents from 75 
cents. Residential flat rate service would increase, however. For Pacific Bell 
customers, the fee would rise to $11.25 from $8.35; for GTE customers, it would 
increase to $17.49 from $9.75. 
</P>
<P>
 LATAs: To define what would be a local call and what would be a long distance 
call at the time of the AT&T breakup, the nation was divided into Local Access 
and Transport Areas (LATAs), based on Census Bureau's Standard Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas. The map at left shows how California is divided.

GREENSPAN REMARKS SNAP BONDS' RALLY; MARKETS: YIELDS JUMP AS FED CHIEF'S 
COMMENTS DEFLATE INVESTOR HOPES THAT CENTRAL BANK WON'T TIGHTEN CREDIT AGAIN 
SOON.

<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan torpedoed stock and bond markets 
Wednesday as he warned Congress that more interest rate hikes may be necessary 
to rein in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields, which had fallen Tuesday to their lowest levels in three weeks, 
leaped again on Greenspan's comments. The 30-year Treasury bond yield surged to 
7.54% from 7.46% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks closed broadly lower, hurt by Greenspan's testimony and 
by more disappointing second-quarter earnings reports from some key companies. 
The Dow Jones industrial average sank 21.04 points to 3,727.27. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the markets' declines weren't large but that Greenspan may have 
done significant damage to fragile investor psychology by continuing to harp on 
prospects for higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, losing stocks outnumbered winners by nearly 2 
to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised short-term rates four times this year in an effort to slow 
the economy and keep inflation down. While Greenspan admitted in his Senate 
testimony Wednesday that the Fed sees few signs of sharply rising prices for 
consumer goods and services, he said the central bank remains wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an open question whether our actions to date have been sufficient to 
head off inflationary pressures and thus maintain favorable trends in the 
economy," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the battered bond market, investors had been pushing yields lower in recent 
weeks on the expectation that the Fed wouldn't feel compelled to raise rates 
again anytime soon. But Greenspan's comments caused some investors to dump 
bonds in fear of a potential August rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The view is he is coming out slightly more hawkish than he was expected to," 
said Dana Johnson, analyst at First Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting concern about another rate increase, bond yields rose across the 
board. The yield on the one-year Treasury bill surged to 5.35% from 5.24% on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff in bonds abruptly reversed one of the biggest rallies since the 
bond market turned bearish in early February, when the Fed first raised rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar failed to benefit even though Greenspan specifically 
said he was concerned about the currency's decline this year. Indeed, many 
analysts have speculated that the Fed's next rate hike would be made mostly to 
support the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said sliding securities prices and profit taking from the dollar's 
recent rally undermined any positive effect on the currency from Greenspan's 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 98.65 Japanese yen and at 1.565 German marks, 
down from 99.25 yen and 1.568 marks on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, commodity prices were broadly lower, but that failed to help bonds. 
Lumber futures plunged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after the government 
reported a surprisingly steep 9.8% drop in June housing starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruce two-by-fours for September delivery fell below the daily limit of $10, 
to $367 per 1,000 board feet. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, many stocks were buffeted by interest rate fears and by 
quarterly earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday "was a shakeout day," said Don Hays, director of investment strategy 
at brokerage Wheat First Butcher Singer. "We think people are quick to sell on 
any news." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks suffered another selloff, hurt by some disappointing 
earnings news. Software firm Sybase plunged 8 3/4 to 39 3/4 after analysts 
noted a slowdown in sales growth in its otherwise stellar earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 Also falling on earnings news was another software firm, Cadence Design. It 
slumped 3 7/8 to 13 1/2. And Compaq Computer fell 1 3/4 to 31 1/2 even though 
its earnings met expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other tech issues falling, Microsoft lost 1 3/4 to 48 3/8 in advance 
of its earnings report, released after the market closed. The firm said 
quarterly sales were up 24% and that earnings rose 30% before onetime items. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the drug sector, Pfizer dropped 2 to 60 1/8 after reporting higher 
profit, but with the expectation that its 1994 earnings will come in toward the 
bottom of estimates. Rival Johnson & Johnson rose 1 1/8 to 44 3/4 on its 
earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among airlines, USAir gained 1/2 to 7 after reporting a rare quarterly 
profit. AMR, parent of American Airlines, reported a large profit but dropped 1 
1/2 to 61 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * HMO stocks slid on renewed worries about price wars, rekindled by earnings 
reports from Mid Atlantic Medical Services and California HMO Foundation 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid Atlantic slumped 6 1/8 to 41 3/4 and Foundation Health tumbled 3 1/2 to 35 
1/2. Other losers included PacifiCare A, down 4 to 47 3/4, and United 
Healthcare, off 1 3/8 to 43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some bank shares continued to drop, despite this week's generally strong 
earnings reports. Wells Fargo fell 5 to 152 1/2, First Interstate sank 2 3/8 to 
75 5/8, NationsBank lost 1 3/8 to 53 5/8 and Citicorp was off 3/8 to 40 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But BankAmerica, which reported results Wednesday, eased just 1/8 to 47 3/8. 
And Great Western added 1/8 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among stocks responding positively to earnings news was Reebok, up 2 3/4 to 
33 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home builders' stocks dropped on news of the large drop in June housing 
starts. Kaufman & Broad fell 5/8 to 15, Lennar sank 1 3/8 to 20 1/2 and Centex 
gave up 5/8 to 24 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index eased 14.1 points to 3,077.2 while 
Frankfurt's DAX average gained 9.86 points to 2,138.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's Nikkei average ended up 5.60 points at 20,780.76. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index tumbled 44.35 points to 2,210.95 on worries 
about another possible rise in U.S. interest rates.

FOR WHOM THE BALL TOLLS; WORLD CUP SALES WERE SOCKO, BUT MANY HAD HIGHER GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of imported beer -- led by the Dutch brand Heineken -- jumped 365% in 
Orlando, Fla., in June. As many as 50 kids a week are enrolling at Cherif 
Zein's youth soccer camp in Pasadena this summer, up from 30 or 40 last year. 
Washable tattoos featuring Striker, World Cup '94's canine mascot, were a 
surprise hit for a Texas novelty maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the 3.5 million in attendance at the Rose Bowl and eight other 
stadiums, beyond the half-million hotel room nights booked by soccer fans, 
beyond the number of times that the Snickers logo flashed in front of 2 billion 
pairs of eyes in global TV broadcasts, the World Cup was a powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the economic impact of the monthlong, 52-game international tournament 
was immense by virtually any measure, but it still failed to meet some people's 
expectations. The hotel industry, for one group, was disappointed at the level 
of bookings, as were certain merchants who sold World Cup-licensed products. 
</P>
<P>
 As tourism and economic development officials compare notes with business 
people in the nine host cities, they are hearing praise for the event's smooth 
running mixed with disgruntlement that it didn't always match its advance 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cup fever? I wouldn't even call it a mild head cold," griped Bud Konheim, 
chief executive of the Nicole Miller fashion house in New York City. The firm 
created a $65, limited-edition silk tie with a World Cup motif. Sales were so 
slow that you might call it a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the business almost 40 years and I've never experienced a hype 
bust like this," Konheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants -- especially those with less-expensive wares -- fared better. 
</P>
<P>
 W.H. Smith, which runs airport and hotel gift shops nationwide, did about $3 
million worth of sales during World Cup -- "about three times the average Super 
Bowl," said David Banks, vice president for business development. 
</P>
<P>
 T-shirts celebrating the Italian team were so hot in Boston that employees 
couldn't keep the shelves stocked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Dick Pope, president of Winona, Minn.-based Wincraft, said his 
company's selection of low-priced pennants, key rings and seat cushions sold 
twice as well as he expected, and he's been selling soccer merchandise "since 
Pele came to the U.S." in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hoteliers were disappointed at the relatively small influx of foreign 
tourists, given early projections of hordes of free-spending fans from all 
corners of the globe. World Cup officials estimate that the event drew 300,000 
visitors from abroad.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is now surveying local 
hotels, said World Cup-related bookings may total 150,000 room nights for 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a monster event," said Michael Collins, the bureau's senior vice 
president. But it won't be enough to satisfy an industry that had counted on 
twice that number. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody could complain about the final week, though, as area hotels were jammed 
to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup '94 Organizing Committee originally projected that the event 
would generate a total impact of $4 billion on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers relied on a January, 1993, study by two USC economics 
professors, who said the impact on the nine host cities would be $2.8 billion. 
(The extra $1.2 billion in the estimate came from air fare, sponsorship 
payments and other expenditures that couldn't be tied to a particular venue.) 
</P>
<P>
 The study's basic assumption was that the main economic benefits of the 
tournament would flow from the people who actually attended the games. 
</P>
<P>
 International TV coverage makes the World Cup a truly global event, the 
thinking goes, but support from the domestic audience drives most of the direct 
economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 That is part of the secret to why World Cup '94 was a bigger moneymaker than 
the 1990 World Cup in Italy, or any previous Cup, for that matter. The United 
States may lack Italy's soccer history, but it more than compensates with five 
times the population, huge disposable income and a strong tradition of 
sports-related spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, chairman of the U.S. organizing committee, noted one tangible 
bequest that World Cup '94 will leave to FIFA, soccer's international ruling 
body: a viable U.S. television market for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide TV rights for this World Cup totaled $300 million, of which the U.S. 
share was a paltry $20 million to $25 million. For ABC and ESPN, which got 
better-than-expected ratings, it was a bargain not likely to be repeated, 
Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some TV advertisers were wary going into the event because the games consisted 
of two 45-minute halves without commercial breaks. Rather than traditional ads, 
sponsors had their logos displayed on "perimeter boards" on the sidelines or on 
the on-screen game clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to derive a dollar value from the time a logo is in focus on-screen is 
"a bit of an inexact science," said Mike Goff, director of corporate 
sponsorship for Sprint, one of World Cup '94's prime sponsors. But Goff said he 
knew he got his money's worth when a dramatic photo of Swedish goalkeeper 
Thomas Ravelli appeared on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle with 
the Sprint logo in sharp focus in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't buy that," Goff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Bryan Peter Rosendorff, one of the authors of the USC study, said in a 
recent interview that as long as game attendance met expectations, the overall 
impact would be close to the original projection. As it happened, although the 
final attendance total of 3.57 million was 1 million more people than had ever 
attended a World Cup, it fell nearly 6% short of organizers' projections. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cities, officials think it fell shorter than that. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dallas, which spent $15 million on improvements to the Cotton Bowl, the 
USC study had projected an economic impact of $266 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it'll be more like $50 million to $55 million," said David Whitney 
of the Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau, which has commissioned a 
follow-up study. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit officials, too, were dubious that the four games in the nearby Pontiac 
Silverdome had generated anything like USC's $180-million estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The $243-million estimate for Washington was "ludicrous -- such an 
outrageously high figure," said Tom Murphy, spokesman for the Washington 
Convention and Visitors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a general feeling downtown of real disappointment that it was not the 
event the World Cup organizers made it out to be," Murphy said, explaining that 
the lion's share of hotel bookings was snared by facilities in suburban 
Virginia and Maryland that undersold their D.C. competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston is the first World Cup host city to have completed an economic impact 
estimate based on actual numbers compiled during the tournament: $212 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That total is within hailing distance of the $255 million projected in the USC 
study and doesn't include results from the Providence, R.I., area, which is 
actually closer to Foxboro Stadium, where the games were played. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel capacity in New York may have hit 80% last month, compared to 71% for a 
typical June, said a spokesman for the city's convention bureau. He noted, 
however, that two other major events -- the Gay Games and the Stonewall 25 gay 
rights commemoration -- also contributed to the Big Apple crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even tourism officials who were disappointed by local hotel bookings or retail 
sales were ecstatic about the boost to their cities' international profile from 
globally televised images of festive, nonviolent soccer crowds in well-groomed 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime against foreign tourists in Florida was literally washed off the pages 
of the international press because of the World Cup," said Joanie Schirm 
Neiswender, who led Orlando's bid to become a host city. GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD! 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94 by some measures was history's biggest single-theme sports 
event, rivaled only by the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. U.S. trade and tourism 
officials are still calculating the economic impact of the monthlong 
tournament, but the following estimates give a sense of the scope. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign visitors: 300,000 
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel bookings (room nights): 500,000 
</P>
<P>
 * Total game attendance: 3.57 million 
</P>
<P>
 * TV broadcast rights (worldwide): $300 million 
</P>
<P>
 * TV viewership of final game: 1.5 billion to 2 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Projected U.S. economic impact: $4 billion

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: MICROSOFT'S MOMENT TO 'OPEN' WINDOWS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as "Billionaire Bill" Gates is concerned, his Microsoft has finally 
popped the painful pimple of antitrust litigation. "It's over," he told one 
newspaper. "None of the people who run (Microsoft's seven) divisions are going 
to change what they do or think or forecast. Nothing. Nothing. There's one guy 
in charge of licenses. He'll read the agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, the trustbusters over at the Justice Department and the 
European Union beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the political posturing and Microsoft machismo surrounding this 
consent decree, the crucial issue here was not just the proposed breakup, 
restructuring or per-processor punishment of the world's most successful 
software company. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue is: What does this clash say about the future of software 
development and pricing? Is it in Microsoft's best interests to proceed as if 
all of its legal and political obstacles have, in effect, been vanquished? Or 
could the company exercise creative options that might let it neutralize 
further antitrust intervention even as it expands its market influence? 
</P>
<P>
 Few Microsoft competitors believe that Bill Gates is anything but a ruthless 
pragmatist who is even more concerned about Microsoft's market share than its 
margins. Remember, Gates became a billionaire not by charging premium prices 
for his wares but by continually cutting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill will do whatever is necessary to achieve world domination," says Adobe 
Systems vice president Deb Triant, tongue barely in cheek. "For Microsoft, 
market share is everything. Market share in the operating system is what drives 
their clout on the other (applications software) side of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Microsoft's popular Windows operating system -- the software that 
coordinates and controls the internal workings of a personal computer -- has 
rapidly evolved into a de facto global industry standard. You can buy Windows 
software today for less than $60. The overwhelming majority of entrepreneurs 
and enterprises developing applications software for PCs now write their 
software to conform to Microsoft Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous companies complain that Microsoft enjoys an unfair competitive 
advantage because Microsoft applications development people might have access 
to operating systems information that outsiders do not. That's one of the 
reasons why the trustbusters focused on Windows as a key indicator of 
Microsoft's alleged monopolistic practices (though this was not part of the 
consent decree). 
</P>
<P>
 But Microsoft is now in a unique position to call everybody's bluff about the 
way it manages Windows. The company has a new, more powerful operating system 
called Chicago coming out early next year. In the wake of the consent decree, 
now is an excellent time for Microsoft to "open up" its Windows operating 
system and put it into the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way IBM created the "open architecture" personal computer, 
Microsoft should turn Windows into an open-architecture operating system. Over 
the next year or so, it should publish the source code (the system's blueprint) 
and specifications and license them -- for a fee -- to software developers. 
Manage Windows as a standard, not just as a product, and it's entirely possible 
Microsoft becomes even more influential and Bill Gates becomes even richer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would make a lot of sense for them to publish (Windows specs) and 
make their operating system more open," acknowledges Adobe's Triant. "Our 
developers would be ecstatic if Microsoft opened up its source code. They could 
accelerate applications development and come up with much richer 
functionality." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at Microsoft say the idea has indeed been kicked around. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, an open-architecture Windows could be sold more cheaply, though a 
company like Microsoft -- with a brand-name reputation for excellence and 
support -- could probably continue to command a premium price. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the reason people follow Microsoft -- they continue to deliver value 
for the price," says Michael Tiemann, president of Cygnus Support, a small 
Mountain View, Calif., software company that derives most of its revenue from 
servicing the software it in effect gives away. Tiemann argues that pushing 
Windows into the quasi-public domain would create a rich installed base from 
which Microsoft could reap service revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft has already made their money back on Windows and they're going to 
make their money on the next-generation operating system," contends Esther 
Dyson of EDventure Holdings, who has tracked Microsoft for more than a decade. 
"So it's an interesting option, but I don't think it's in character for the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Dyson points out, Microsoft competitors such as Novell would claim 
that a cheap, open-architecture Windows would qualify as "predatory pricing' 
and would undermine efforts to launch rival operating systems. "I don't think 
Novell would take it kindly," she says. "They'd call in the Justice Department 
to investigate." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the paradox, Dyson says: Making Windows a more open system may be seen 
as anti-competitive, even though it would give more developers and consumers 
more choices at lower prices.  
</P>
<P>
 But isn't giving consumers standards that promote more choice at lower prices 
a goal of public policy? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gates is simply wrong if he believes that consent decree means he should 
go back to business as usual. He has a provocative opportunity to rewrite the 
rules of the software game yet again by putting his company's flagship product 
into the public domain -- and making money and market share from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see the Justice Department explain how that is not in the public 
interest.

WHITE HOUSE STARTS FINAL BIG PUSH FOR GATT PACT; TRADE: ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS AND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ARE NEARLY DONE NEGOTIATING COST ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort almost lost in the roiling debate over health care reform, the 
Clinton Administration is beginning a final concerted push to win approval of 
U.S. participation in a massive global trade agreement, optimistic that it will 
be able to nail down its second major political victory on the trade front -- 
and one that eluded the two previous Administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior White House officials and congressional leaders are nearing completion 
of arduous, often contentious, negotiations over how to meet the trade plan's 
$12-billion price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, though active and vocal, has been unable to coalesce into a 
political force that could pose a serious threat to passage of the legislation 
implementing participation in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House's goal is to slip the 22,000-page trade pact into the 
legislative mill by the beginning of August and quickly push it through to 
final approval -- despite the more visible work on health care -- before the 
House and Senate begin their summer recesses in the middle of the month, a 
senior Administration official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That timetable has prompted criticism from Congress, where Administration 
allies are concerned that failure to meet the schedule will suggest that 
momentum favoring the agreement is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But whether Congress acts before it leaves for its August recess or after it 
returns, increasingly optimistic Administration and congressional sources 
predict that the plan -- whose goal is to cut tariffs by roughly one-third and 
liberalize trade rules to stimulate world commerce -- will pass each house with 
bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 After having spent two days this week in negotiations with congressional trade 
experts, a senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Wednesday, "I am more cautiously optimistic than I was 48 hours ago." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Administration's estimate -- which is more conservative than 
some -- the trade plan would expand the U.S. economy by $100 billion in its 
first years and be an important first step in raising U.S. exports to the 
$1-trillion range, more than twice the current level, over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact, negotiated over seven years, would expand the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, which took effect in 1947, and replace it as the 
international trade rule-enforcing body with a new Geneva-based operation to be 
known as the World Trade Organization. That body would be given greater 
authority than its predecessor over the more than 120 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents in the United States are concerned that bureaucrats in Switzerland 
would be in a position to overrule local, state and federal laws governing such 
sensitive matters as food safety, environmental protection and labor rights by 
decreeing that such laws and regulations serve protectionist purposes and 
therefore stifle free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other points raised by opponents and wary supporters: 
</P>
<P>
 * Will the new rules mean that the United States and other countries would be 
restricted in efforts to protect home industries from foreign products dumped 
at below-production costs? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will key provisions in U.S. trade laws intended to pressure other nations 
into opening their markets to U.S. products be overruled because they could 
result in trade sanctions? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will the Administration succeed in keeping its authority to negotiate trade 
agreements on a "fast-track" basis (this prohibits time-consuming and 
agreement-threatening amendments) when the completed pact is sent to Congress 
for approval? That would come into play when the Administration seeks to expand 
the North American Free Trade Agreement to include Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized labor has recently intensified its opposition to the fast-track 
procedure, a leading congressional expert on trade issues said, and the trade 
agreement being advanced by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), chairman of 
the Senate Finance Committee, omits it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the sticky question of what participation in the trade plan 
will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little dispute over the Administration's assertion that the increased 
commerce the pact would bring would, in the end, produce more government income 
-- as much as $3.90 for every $1 lost to lowered tariffs, U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor says. But federal budget law requires that for 
every $1 lost in revenue, there must be a $1 cut in spending or a $1 increase 
in taxes or other income. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan outlined by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the Administration 
will recommend spending cuts of $8 billion, including $1.6 billion in reduced 
agriculture subsidies.

RISING MORTGAGE RATES STUNT NEW HOUSING STARTS; CONSTRUCTION: GOVERNMENT 
REPORTS A STEEPER-THAN-EXPECTED 10% DROP IN U.S. HOME BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising mortgage rates sapped the home building industry in June as 
construction starts on new homes and apartments dropped nearly 10% nationwide 
and nearly 9% in the West, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The falloff was much steeper than expected and follows a report Tuesday from 
the National Assn. of Home Builders that said fewer prospective homeowners were 
touring new projects and builders were increasingly pessimistic about sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Building activity in the western region -- which is dominated by California -- 
fell 8.8% to an annual rate of 320,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, rising mortgage rates and falling consumer confidence has led 
Kaufman & Broad -- the state's largest home builder -- to lower the number of 
homes it plans to build during the current fiscal year, to about 6,400 from 
7,500, spokesman Greg Romano said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kaufman, which built only 5,745 homes last year, as well as other 
builders and lenders remain optimistic about the state's housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still going to be a great year," Romano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residential construction lending in June in California is expected to jump 
about 30% from last year's level, to $918 million -- the highest amount since 
December, 1991, according to John Karevoll, who publishes financial and real 
estate information for Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Leahy, who heads residential construction lending operations at Bank of 
America, said he expects building loans in California to remain strong this 
year and in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a slow but steady strengthening in the California economy, we see more 
and more buyers coming back into the marketplace," Leahy said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board has pushed up short-term interest rates four times 
this year, driving up long-term rates that affect mortgages. The housing 
industry is especially sensitive to changes in interest rates, and mortgage 
rates have climbed sharply since touching bottom last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, said the 30-year 
mortgage loan rate last week had risen to 8.72% -- about 30% above the low of 
6.74% reached in October last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That adds nearly $300 a month to a payment on a typical $100,000 mortgage, 
enough to wipe out some potential buyers' ability to qualify for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The run-up in rates has throttled housing," said Warren Lasko, executive vice 
president of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the annual rate of starts on new homes slumped 9.8% to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, after a revised increase of 1.8% in 
May and a 3.2% fall in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fall in June building occurred in multiple-unit apartments, which 
plummeted 35.7% from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 193,000 units. 
Construction of single-family homes was down 3.3% to a rate of 1.16 million -- 
the third straight monthly fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, starts were 9% higher than in June, 1993, when they were running at a 
rate of 1.25 million. But Lasko of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. said housing has 
peaked for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fed has certainly done its job," Lasko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Building activity in June was weaker in every region of the country except the 
Northeast, where construction picked up modestly. In addition, applications for 
permits fell for a second straight month, suggesting that construction starts 
may lose more momentum in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally in June, Northeast starts increased 4.5% to an annual rate of 
139,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, starts dropped steeply in the South, by 13.2% to a rate of 
597,000 units. In the Midwest, starts were down 9.2% to a 295,000-unit rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Home Builders said only 31% of its members reported good 
sales in July, down from 36% in June. They said buyer traffic was deteriorating 
at project sites so there was little incentive to keep building.

KIA MOTORS ANNOUNCES RECALL TO REPLACE SPEEDOMETER SENSORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than six months after beginning sales in the United States, Kia Motors 
America has announced a voluntary recall of nearly 7,000 cars to replace 
sensors that control speedometers and cruise controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half the 6,945 cars subject to the recall have actually been sold 
to private buyers, the company indicated.The others are still on dealers' lots 
or waiting to be shipped to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say the recall is not likely to hurt Irvine-based Kia, which 
advertises its vehicles as well-built cars for everyone. About 13,000 cars, 
which are built in South Korea and known as the Sephia, have been imported into 
the United States so far. The starting price is roughly $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recalls don't have the negative connotations they used to have" when most 
repairs were forced on reluctant auto makers by federal regulators, said 
Christopher Cedargren, an analyst with AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana. "Most 
recalls these days are voluntary, and they tell people that the car companies 
care about quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Kia Motors America, which imports and distributes the cars through 67 
dealerships in the United States, said the cars subject to its recall were 
equipped with an electronic speed sensor that has developed an "unacceptable" 
malfunction rate. The problems have been identified over time in the Sephias 
that have been used by rental fleets since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia began a "rolling" retail introduction of its cars in Washington in 
February. The first dealerships in Southern California opened in May.

 Teledyne Settles Four More Contract Disputes: The Los Angeles-based company 
took an $11.3-million pretax charge against second-quarter earnings to reflect 
a preliminary settlement of four more contracting disputes with the U.S. 
government. Three of the cases involved Teledyne's electronics unit in Newbury 
Park; the other involved its Teledyne Thermatics division in Elm City, N.C. The 
allegations ranged from delivering inferior military transponders to violating 
product-testing requirements. Teledyne, which has been trying to settle a rash 
of criminal and civil fraud cases against the company, said its second-quarter 
profit rose despite the latest charge, to $11 million from $8.1 million a year 
earlier.GOVERNMENT

 TWA May Cancel Order for 10 Airbus A-330s: The carrier ordered the jets from 
the European consortium Airbus Industrie.The trade publication Commercial 
Aviation Report quoted unnamed sources as saying Trans World Airlines has also 
deferred for as much as a year $10 million in progress payments that were due 
June 30 as it decides about the order. Airbus, which wants to keep the order, 
believes TWA wants to husband cash, having gone through an estimated $20 
million in June, the magazine reported. The contract for the 10 Airbuses is 
included in TWA's bankruptcy reorganization plan, and the airline has already 
paid deposits to Airbus and Rolls-Royce, which makes the engines for the jets.

 MDT Corp. Board Reelected: The Torrance-based maker of medical equipment 
sterilizers, whose board was the target of a no-confidence vote at its annual 
meeting, said preliminary figures show 68% of shareholder votes cast were in 
favor of the board. Still, the 32% disapproval rate is extraordinarily high for 
a public company.Andrew Shapiro, the San Francisco-based money manager who led 
dissident shareholders, said the no-confidence vote was aimed at spurring MDT's 
board to take steps to restore flagging sales and earnings growth. At the 
meeting, MDT executives noted that they had announced new restructuring steps 
this week. They also said they would explore other shareholder proposals, 
including adding new directors. Shares of MDT, which had sales of $137 million 
last year, fell 19 cents to $4.75 on Nasdaq.

 2,000 Pounds of U.S. Apples Reach China: The consignment of Red Delicious 
arrived by air this month and is the first U.S. fruit to officially be sold in 
China in commercial quantities, officials said. A second 18,000-pound 
consignment is due to arrive Friday.The apples represent a victory for U.S. 
negotiators urging China, which has a $23-billion trade surplus with the United 
States, to open its markets. It took two years of discussions before Chinese 
quarantine officials would allow the apples to be imported, the growers said. 
Washington apple growers say they hope to sell 20 million pounds of the fruit 
to China in the next 12 months, and U.S. officials hope grapes, tobacco and 
other agricultural products will follow.

 Glendale Federal Forecloses on Hotel: Lawyers for Glendale Federal Bank said 
they completed a more than yearlong effort to foreclose on a $70-million loan 
owed by the owners of the San Francisco Airport Marriott.The move makes 
Glendale Federal the hotel's owner. The bank said it will continue to operate 
the property as a Marriott hotel until it can be sold. The hotel's path to 
foreclosure began in March, 1993, when a limited partnership established by 
Marriott Hotel Corp. as the property's leaseholder filed for bankruptcy 
protection.

 USAir Ground Workers Choose Union: The International Assn. of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers bested the United Steelworkers of America for the chance to 
represent the nearly 8,000 workers who handle baggage and cargo for the 
Arlington, Va.-based airline, the National Mediation Board said. The board 
allows two working days for any allegation of election interference to be 
filed. If no such claim is filed by 5 p.m. Friday, the panel will certify the 
Machinists as the collective bargaining agent for the employees, who have not 
had union representation since 1990. The Teamsters lost the right to represent 
the workers a year after USAir and Piedmont Aviation merged.

TIME RUNNING OUT AS JAPAN TRADE TALKS DEADLINE LOOMS; COMMERCE: TEN DAYS REMAIN 
BEFORE U.S.- THREATENED SANCTIONS. NO NEW TALKS HAVE BEEN SET. 
</P>

<P>
 With the deadline for threatened U.S. sanctions looming, Commerce Secretary 
Ronald H. Brown said Wednesday that he still hopes for trade progress with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when is the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo has only 10 days left to open its public procurement market or risk U.S. 
sanctions proceedings -- a threat that has helped keep world financial markets 
on edge and raised political hackles in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reserve the right to call off talks under the economic framework pact" if 
sanctions are imposed, one government official said Wednesday in Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
 But few here detect signs of an imminent breakthrough, raising the specter of 
renewed trans-Pacific friction at a time of extreme fragility in world currency 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 One Japanese official said Tokyo may pull out of the talks should Washington 
pounce, but that "would require a major political decision. We would have to 
consider the overall situation, including currency markets. It's not that 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if there is any hope of averting sanctions, Brown responded, "It's a 
very difficult situation to read." 
</P>
<P>
 He said repeated political turmoil in Tokyo has hampered the trade talks, but 
he added, "We remain hopeful that we can make some progress." 
</P>
<P>
 The first hurdle is July 31, the U.S. deadline for progress in opening up 
Japan's public telecommunications and medical technology markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, insufficient progress has been made despite months of intense 
negotiations and an extra month's leeway for Tokyo to help it ride out its 
political disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 With time now tight, a senior Administration official said the United States 
is open to talk more but conceded that nothing has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese government has shown a willingness and interest in continuing 
discussions, and we welcome that," he told a group of reporters, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that there has been no date set for new negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide refused to discuss the likelihood of U.S. action in the matter, but 
senior officials have said there is no deal yet and are downplaying prospects 
for progress this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we understand the so-called deadline is July 31. We're fully 
prepared to make a decision prior to that time. We have already had discussions 
in the Administration," the senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed there have been changes in attitude this past year, according to one 
well-placed source, who said the hawks have won the battle for now as "utter 
frustration" has set in about lack of progress in cutting Japan's $131-billion 
surplus.

NORTHRIDGE QUAKE CAUSED DECLINE IN PERSONAL INCOME IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake and lower wheat subsidies caused personal incomes to 
decline in four states in the first quarter of this year, the government said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, income was down 1.2% over the last quarter of 1993 as the Jan. 
17 quake caused an $18.5-billion drop in rents at an annual rate because of 
uninsured losses, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of the earthquake were widespread enough to show a drop in the 
rate of increase for Americans' incomes in the first quarter, to 1.3% from 
1.5%, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incomes decreased in North Dakota 1.6%, Kansas 0.3% and Nebraska 0.1%, as the 
government reduced wheat subsidies from high levels in the last three months of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the four states where incomes declined, only Montana experienced a 
change in income that did not keep pace with a 0.5% increase in prices 
nationally. The income of Montanans rose only 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight states had income growth that exceeded the national average by more than 
one percentage point in the first quarter. They were New Mexico and Iowa, each 
up 3%; Minnesota, 2.9%; Arizona and Nevada, 2.7%; Utah, 2.6%, and New Hampshire 
and Louisiana, each 2.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said income growth was helped by large increases in 
farm income in Iowa, Minnesota, Arizona and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa and Minnesota rebounded from serious crop losses in the second half of 
1993 that were caused by major flooding in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Increases in federal subsidy payments to cotton farmers in Arizona and cotton 
and rice farmers in Louisiana boosted income in those two states.

PUC SETTLEMENT WILL PUT GAS RATES IN SLOW DECLINE; ENERGY: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
GAS CO. CUSTOMERS CAN EXPECT LOWER BILLS AFTER AUG. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a settlement 
that will give Southern California Gas Co. customers a small but long-term rate 
reduction, beginning next month. 
</P>
<P>
 What has become known as the Global Settlement resolves a host of long-running 
gas pricing disputes between the utility, its suppliers and consumer advocates. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The relief for customers -- from residents to big industrial users -- will be 
lower rates over the next 19 years, beginning with a modest drop Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Savings could total more than $1 billion during that period for nearly 5 
million gas company customers. The typical household's bill of $19.81 for a 
summer month will drop by 32 cents. The average winter bill of $44.33 will fall 
81 cents, according to gas company estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Large industrial customers -- most of whom now buy their gas directly from 
producers -- will receive roughly comparable reductions in the transmission 
fees they pay the gas company to deliver the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few, if any, filings with the PUC have ever involved so many diverse 
interests coming together to achieve consensus," company President Warren I. 
Mitchell said. "This is a remarkable achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Parties to the settlement include consumer advocates representing residential 
and small-business users, the California Manufacturers Assn., Southern 
California Edison Co. and the Southern California Utility Power Pool -- a group 
of smaller electric utilities that use gas to power electricity-producing 
turbines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're satisfied with it," said Audrie Krause, executive director of Toward 
Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer group based in San Francisco that was 
active in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the pact resolves a PUC objection to what the gas company paid for 
natural gas from 1989 through 1992. The PUC had asked for a $100-million rebate 
to customers; the utility agreed to pay $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big issue was the utility's renegotiation of gas-purchase contracts 
dating back to the 1970s, when energy costs were high and expected to go 
higher. In fact, gas prices have dropped in recent years, and gas utilities 
nationwide have sought to get out of long-term contracts under which they must 
buy gas at rates well above current market prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's settlement allows the utility to pay $500 million in up-front 
costs to renegotiate old contracts with suppliers in California and Canada and 
replace them with deals tied to fluctuations in gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that $500 million, shareholders of Pacific Enterprises, the gas company's 
parent, will absorb $90 million. Ratepayers will shoulder the remaining $410 
million -- all to be paid in the first five years. The net benefit to customers 
from this part of the settlement will be $700 million in savings, the utility 
estimated.

PERSONAL VIEW: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Name: John J. Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * Position: Corporate communication consultant, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations for overseas business trips typically focus on the physical 
aspects -- jet lag, health insurance, climate. Building personal relationships 
in a new culture, however, requires some preparation as well. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can know all the details of a new culture, so here's a survival 
checklist when you're traveling to an unfamiliar country. Eventually, you'll 
know which of its rules you can start to bend and when. 
</P>
<P>
 * Know before you go. Visiting another culture unprepared can make you look 
foolish -- or worse, uncaring. Learn basic cultural dos and taboos, foods, 
history, geography, social structure and economy. Years ago, several Americans 
were arrested for climbing on a giant Buddha image in Thailand. The visitors 
pleaded ignorance, but many Thais were outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speak the body language. Familiar signs like "thumbs up" or "V for victory" 
are rude in some countries. A U.S. World Cup official flashed the OK sign in a 
meeting with Brazilian dignitaries, not knowing the gesture is obscene in 
Brazil. He had to quickly say he meant no insult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let hosts lead. Business practices vary greatly. In Russia, executives spend 
a lot time getting to know you, but in Australia they get right down to 
business and chitchat later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be flexible. Overlook foul-ups. Don't correct mistakes in English or 
misunderstandings about the United States unless absolutely necessary. I prefer 
colleagues to use my first name, but some Vietnamese contacts would rather call 
me "Mr. John." 
</P>
<P>
 * Know eating rituals. Eating together is often vital to business. You'll find 
you can eat at least a bit of almost anything -- if you cut it very small and 
eat it with food you like. Watch other guests. In Indonesia, when my host 
served iced coffee, I drained my glass in grateful gulps. Only later did I 
notice that no one else drank until invited several times, and then only when 
the host drank. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn, don't judge. Resist the urge to say, "Back home we do it this way." 
Cultivate a sincere interest in the new culture; it will enrich you. For 
example, in Saudi Arabia, a meeting may be recessed briefly to allow Muslims to 
pray at prescribed times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Behave conservatively. Don't be too talkative, too informal, too friendly or 
too joking. This doesn't mean be over-serious. Take your cue from your hosts 
and smile. California executives meeting a manufacturer in Bangkok recently 
slighted their host by dressing in informal tourist garb. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch your tongue. Avoid ethnocentric terms such as Third World and 
underdeveloped countries . Although it's a mouthful, the term newly 
industrializing countries respects the dignity of every culture. Don't refer to 
past colonization. Avoid discussing politics, sex, race or other delicate 
topics. For example, a Korean official told me she felt put off by Americans 
who bring up the Korean War when making small talk.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; A SNICKERS WITH A WATER BACK; GUESTS LEAVE THE LIQUOR BUT 
PICK SNACKS FROM HOTEL ROOM BARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's business traveler prefers to relax in the hotel room not with a 
cocktail, but with a bottle of mineral water and some candy. 
</P>
<P>
 This news comes from MiniBar North America, one of the largest companies in 
the in-room refrigerator bar and snack service business. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the company sells and leases the computer systems that help hotels 
keep track of and bill guests for the items taken from the bars, it can monitor 
what's being used. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest seller by far in North America is bottled water, the company said, 
followed by diet cola, regular cola, orange juice, light beer, M&Ms, Snickers, 
potato chips, pretzels and meat sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 The move away from liquor consumption is a "noticeable trend" in the 150 or so 
hotels in the United States that have MiniBar systems, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a big change," said Stephen Reid, vice president for sales at 
MiniBar. "When the bars first came out, they were perceived as liquor bars. . . 
. That's still a part of the unit, but they're not the big sellers they once 
were. Today the bar is really like a refreshment center or a snack bar." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That change mirrors a well-documented drop in liquor consumption in the United 
States, which has accompanied an increasing emphasis on fitness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same effect is not being seen in Europe, where the company also 
operates, Reid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Liquor is much more significant in Europe than in the United States, much 
more of an important part of the sales," he said. It is among the Top 10 
sellers in MiniBars there. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said a changing taste in potables is not the only trend showing up in the 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more and more items of a non-food nature going into the bar -- 
toothpaste, brushes, razors, all types of personal hygiene products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have even been reports that some hotels have placed condoms in the 
units, though Reid said he had not personally seen them offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels do their own stocking of the units and set the prices -- typically 
considerably higher than normal as a premium charged for the convenience the 
bars offer.  
</P>
<P>
 Those prices sometimes tempt guests to replace the items themselves. A hungry 
guest who grabs a can of peanuts out of the bar despite the $4 price tag might 
be tempted to run down to a store the next morning, buy the same can for $1 and 
put it back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reid says that doesn't always work. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has a new line -- the RoboBar -- that looks like the standard 
in-room refrigerator bar except that each item is in an individual slot. 
Removing the item from the slot triggers an automatic charge that can't be 
undone by putting something back.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; RAIL SERVICE SEEKS TO LURE BUSINESS TRAVELERS; 
TRANSPORTATION: INDUSTRY BELIEVES HIGH-SPEED TRAINS CAN COMPETE WITH AIRLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business travelers may not realize it, but they are at the heart of the slow 
but steady move toward high-speed rail service in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail industry experts believe almost any 500-mile trip that can be made by 
rail in three hours or less becomes a viable competitor to flying, given the 
delays, weather problems, airport commute times and other factors involved in 
air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Because statistics show that the bulk of business travel is done on short-haul 
flights, those customers are ripe to be courted. 
</P>
<P>
 The rails, however, are not quite ripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak hopes to have trains capable of hitting 150 m.p.h. between Washington 
and Boston by 1997. It expects to contract for the rail cars soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has designated several clusters of cities as candidates for 
high-speed service. They include a Los Angeles-centered service to Sacramento, 
the Bay Area, Bakersfield and San Diego; Eugene, Ore., north through Portland 
and Seattle to Vancouver, Canada; extensions of the existing East Coast service 
to Albany and Buffalo, N.Y., in the north and to Richmond, Va., Raleigh and 
Charlotte, N.C., in the south; Orlando and Tampa, Fla., to Miami, and Chicago 
to Detroit, St. Louis and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Sillen, director of business development for ABB Traction Inc., one of 
the companies bidding for the rail car contract on the Boston-Washington route, 
believes that high-speed rail "absolutely will happen in the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the equipment and for making existing track and grade crossings 
safe for fast trains could run into the billions. The high price tag remains a 
formidable obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of high-speed rail is geared to business travel," Sillen said. "The 
trains are designed to be an office on wheels -- you have the entire journey 
time to do what you need to do: telephone, fax -- there are even little 
conference rooms," he said of the Swedish-designed X-2000 train his company is 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the business travel market is expected to provide the volume to make 
high-speed rail service profitable, such travel will not be cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan and parts of Europe where high-speed service already exists, Sillen 
said, ticket prices run just under the cost for air travel on competing routes.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; LAPTOP COMPUTERS NEED TLC ON THE

 Portable computers are standard luggage for many executive travelers. Yet 
despite their image as equipment you can use anywhere -- whether perched on a 
rock overlooking a river or inside a cramped airplane -- portables need some 
special handling to make sure they don't break down on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, repairing a laptop may be expensive. Desktop computer parts are 
readily available even for the more obscure brand names, but portables do not 
have easily exchangeable parts. And in some cases, the parts most easily broken 
may cost as much as the entire computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, then, are some first-aid and prevention tips for people who take laptops 
or notebook-type computers on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the computer's carrying case has adequate padding. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common way computers are damaged is by being dropped, said Rich 
Malloy, editor in chief of Mobile Office, a magazine for business travelers. 
"You don't have to drop them too far; even a few inches can cause problems," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from electronic component failures, damage to screens from dropping or 
bumping is the No. 1 cause of repair calls, said Jaime Fidalgo, sales manager 
for Man & Machine, a Bethesda, Md.-based company that specializes in 
portable-computer repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But what many people don't realize is that replacing the screen on some of the 
newer models can cost $2,000 to $3,000 -- as much as the whole computer, 
Fidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people will spend $2,000, $3,000 or even $5,000 on a nice computer, but 
don't want to spend more than $30 on a bag to protect it," he said. "But it's 
worth the extra little bit of money to get more padding." 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping a computer can also loosen internal connectors, and although this is 
a pretty simple thing to repair, most computer experts advise against trying to 
tighten them yourself. Most laptops are not designed to be opened and worked on 
by amateurs, Malloy said.  
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the components inside a desktop computer are fairly easy to reach, in 
a portable there is so much crammed into so little space that people risk being 
shocked or damaging the components by trying to fiddle with the insides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expose the computer to temperature extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers often make the mistake of leaving their computers in their rental 
cars on hot days. Intense heat can cook a computer, damaging components or 
screens, which are extremely sensitive to temperature. Cold can be just as bad; 
it can cause a screen to crack. And fluctuations from high temperature to low 
temperature can lead to condensation inside the computer, another cause of 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The solution is to keep the computer with you," Malloy said. On a cold day, 
don't put it in the trunk. Keep it in the passenger seat. And when it's hot, 
take it into the building with you when you leave the car." 
</P>
<P>
 When a computer is operating, its tolerance for temperature variation is even 
lower. If the computer has become very hot or cold, let it come back to room 
temperature before you turn it on, Malloy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if you see any condensation, let the computer dry out for at least 
24 hours before using it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when you're using the computer at room temperature, check periodically to 
make sure it isn't overheating. If the underside of the unit feels hot to the 
touch, turn it off and let it cool down, Malloy said. Most laptops lack the 
internal fans that desktops have, so make sure the computer has enough space 
around it to allow for good ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid airport metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many travelers are unduly concerned about the X-ray machines at airports, but 
these pose no problem, Fidalgo said. Of greater concern are metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectors sometimes contain very powerful magnets, Malloy said. The 
magnetism can damage floppy disks, so send any disks you're carrying through 
the X-ray machine along with the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be careful not to spill liquids on the computer or keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Because business travelers use their laptops in a variety of locations, such 
as airplanes and restaurants, they are at greater risk for getting things 
spilled on them.  
</P>
<P>
 The best thing to do for a spill is sponge up what you can, then let the unit 
air for a day to make sure it dries, Malloy said. Don't apply heat to try to 
dry it out more quickly. If the spill was juice or a drink containing sugar, 
get the computer serviced as soon as possible to make sure there is no residue 
that could interfere with operation. 
</P>
<P>
 * For overseas trips, buy a transformer to use with an alternating-current 
adapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many portables come with auto-sensing AC adapter devices so they can be 
plugged directly into a wall, voltage regulation in other countries is not 
always as good as it is in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, Fidalgo recommends buying an inexpensive transformer, called 
a "step-down" or "step-up" transformer, because it either raises or lowers the 
voltage coming from the wall outlet to ensure an even power supply. (Which one 
you use depends on the power sources for that country.) These devices, which 
usually cost about $15, act as fuses. If anything goes wrong with the power 
supply, the transformer will blow, not the adapter. Adapters cost between $100 
and $175 to replace, Fidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take the usual precautions regarding computer viruses and backup files. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers should make sure their antiviral software is up to date in case a 
client or friend wants to try out new software, which could contain viruses.  
</P>
<P>
 Though it is often less convenient to make backup disks while traveling, this 
precaution is vital in protecting the work being done.  
</P>
<P>
 * Carry an extra battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what some manufacturers' specifications indicate, many batteries last 
only a few hours. Also, carry a battery-charger adapter so you can recharge 
batteries at your destination. An extension cord will also be handy if the 
phone and wall outlets are not conveniently near each other. 
</P>
<P>
 One more word on batteries: A portable battery discharges rapidly, so make 
sure you charge it just before you leave.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 'PHANTOM SHIPS' ARE NEWEST TWIST IN PIRACY ON EAST 
ASIAN SEAS; CRIME: OFFICIALS SAY $200 MILLION IN CARGO IS BEING HIJACKED EVERY 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Phantom ships," using fake documentation, are hijacking cargoes from ports 
across East Asia in the latest twist on piracy in the region, maritime 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a problem which has accelerated," said Eric Ellen, executive director 
of the Commercial Crime Services Division of the Britain-based International 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $200 million worth of cargo is being hijacked every year by these 
phantom ships, Ellen told reporters after a two-day conference on piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Maritime Bureau has investigated 20 phantom ships in recent 
years, including five ongoing cases. "It's a tremendous problem for insurers," 
a bureau official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the pirate ships are registered in Honduras or Panama. They take 
cargoes easily disposed of, such as timber and minerals, IMB deputy director 
Jayant Abhyankar said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the latest cases, the Jeorge I sailed from China's Ningbo port in 
February with a cargo of electrical cable bound for Jakarta, Indonesia, and has 
not been seen since. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, the cargo ship Harpers loaded timber in Indonesia that was 
destined for South Korea. After an investigation in six countries, the ship was 
found in Bangkok and the cargo tracked down in China, Abhyankar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a typical example of a phantom ship," he said. "Since then, we've 
investigated four more cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas gangs of Chinese operating out of Taipei, Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Bangkok are running the phantom ships, Ellen said. "They're experienced in 
shipping and documentation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gangs have an "underground banking system" and are heavily involved in 
smuggling people out of China, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies have not yet figured out how to stop the menace, 
other than asking for crackdowns by countries where the ships are falsely 
registered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are unable or unwilling to investigate, then we must ask ourselves 
why are we allowing these flag states to continue" registering ships, Ellen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think it's a major threat," he said. The gangs "are not so greedy 
that they need to do more than five or six a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Piracy of the more traditional kind, in which raiders plunder oceangoing 
vessels on the high seas, is on the decline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 42 cases were reported worldwide in the first six months of 1994, 
compared to 75 in 1993 and 83 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The seas around China, a hot spot last year, have been much safer this year 
since the regional piracy center in Kuala Lumpur called attention to Chinese 
naval vessels illegally detaining ships and confiscating cargo, Ellen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been quite a marked decline in piracy and illegal detention of ships 
in the South China Sea. No doubt this is due to action taken by the Chinese 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing has told maritime officials that in only a few instances was there any 
"misconduct" on the part of its naval forces. The other cases were 
anti-smuggling operations or pirates masquerading as Chinese naval personnel, 
Ellen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Straits of Malacca have shown an even more dramatic decline in piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The straits, which link the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and the 
Pacific Ocean, were free of piracy last year after recording 200 cases in 1991, 
Ellen said. Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore began joint patrols of the 
waterway nearly two years ago.

 MEXICAN STOCKS 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning of potentially 
higher interest rates hit Mexican stocks even harder than U.S. shares 
Wednesday. The Bolsa index tumbled 44.35 points to 2,210.95, its lowest close 
since 2,187.27 on June 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * Greenspan's comments, coupled with another rise in Mexican treasury bill 
rates, injected new uncertainty about the sluggish economy's next move. With 
concerns about the August presidential election's outcome already high, rising 
rates are shaking more and more investors out of stocks, traders say. The Bolsa 
has fallen for eight of the last nine sessions.

 SPOTLIGHT: VIETNAM 
</P>
<P>
 The communist government has been moving toward a market economy since the 
late 1980s and inviting increased foreign trade. A mending of relations with 
other governments, including the United States', has set off an international 
race to invest in what many believe will be Asia's new economic tiger.

 Bundesbank Cuts Securities Repurchase Rate: The German central bank made 
another small cut in a key money market interest rate Wednesday, but traders 
said the easing offers no clue as to whether it might lower official rates 
today. The Bundesbank allowed the securities repurchase rate to fall by 3 basis 
points to 4.88%. The move came one day before the bank's policy-setting council 
is to meet for the last time before its summer recess, which lasts until Aug. 
18.

 Auto Parts Production Rises in Brazil: Output reached $6.4 billion for the 
first six months of 1994, up 7% over that period last year, the Gazeta 
Mercantil newspaper reported.Sindipecas, the Brazilian association of auto 
parts manufacturers, expects the industry's output to rise to $15 billion by 
the end of the year, a 20% increase over 1993. Growth is being fueled by strong 
local motor vehicle production, which is expected to reach 1.5 million units in 
1994, and by stronger exports, which rose 41.8% during the first five months of 
1994 over the same period last year, the Gazeta said. Last year, Brazilian auto 
parts production rose to $12.5 billion, up 18.5% over 1992.

ANOTHER SIDE OF THE 'CRAZY LIFE'; ALTHOUGH FLATTERED TO SEE THEMSELVES ON 
SCREEN, FOR MANY ECHO PARK YOUTHS, THE DEPICTION OF THEIR LIVES IN 'MI VIDA 
LOCA' MAY BE TRUE BUT IT MISSES THE UNTOLD STORIES OF COMPASSION AND 
UNDERSTANDING.

 "It's all about the girls, and the girls do nothing for the neighborhood," 
sniffs Tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 Nitowl doesn't agree: "I hear talk like that from all the guys, they always 
talk . . . about the girls. . . . But it's (screwed) up, man, 'cause we're from 
the neighborhood too, we grew up here, we don't need them." 
</P>
<P>
 When Allison Anders made "Mi Vida Loca" ("My Crazy Life"), that was exactly 
what she wanted to show: The girls didn't need the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no script. Tricky, 17, and Nitowl, 21, are talking from the other 
side of the screen, part of a group of mostly gang members who have seen this 
movie that portrays them, the homegirls and homeboys of Echo Parque.  
</P>
<P>
 Their comments range from frank incredulousness ("That would never happen") to 
grudging acceptance ("Yeah, we've all done time . . . we've all gotten shot"); 
from outright criticism ("They just showed the bad things") to recommendation 
("I'd tell people to see it").  
</P>
<P>
 And though flattered to see themselves up on the big screen, for many "Mi 
Vida" (opening Friday in general release) often hits much too close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie is kind of true, but . . . they should have made a neighborhood 
up," complains Scrappy, 18. "Everyone's gonna think that's the way Echo Park 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mi Vida," Echo Park is a neighborhood of kids living on the edge: of teens 
getting pregnant and dealing drugs, of men who are "either dead, maimed or in 
jail" by the time they're 21, of young people struggling and not finding a way 
out of a gang lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 While all this may be true, argue the kids, untold were the tales of 
compassion and understanding, of families supporting their children, of gang 
members going to school, of efforts to raise money for comrades doing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Though their objections might sometimes sound like quibbles, for them, they 
are a matter of pride and identity. Thus, the relationship in the film between 
Mousie (Seidy Lopez) and Sad Girl (Angel Aviles) was a point of contention for 
the young neighborhood women, who did not approve the severing of the 
characters' friendship when both have children by the same father, Ernesto 
(Jacob Vargas). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our girlfriends get pregnant but not from the same guy," says Liz Delgadillo, 
17, who is not in a gang. "At least they have a little bit more respect than 
that. Some parts are fake; it's not what would happen around here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of many story angles that drew that kind of reaction. Topping the 
list is Ernesto's obsession with the truck he pours much of his money into, and 
which ends up being the prize in a deadly war between gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not gonna put all their money in fixing up a car. They have more 
sense than that," says Chente, who works with El Centro del Pueblo, an Echo 
Park-based organization that works to stop gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds a young man who goes by Evil: "No one is gonna get shot over a car." The 
guys would fight over the neighborhood or over drug dealing, explains his 
friends, but "a car is a car. Everybody has one." 
</P>
<P>
 The car premise never flew with the Echo Park crew, despite the fact that they 
reviewed Anders' script, nixing her original scenario of two groups in the same 
gang fighting over the truck, and suggesting other possibilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Revising the script with the neighborhood youths, many of whom she recruited 
to work in the movie as extras or in title roles, was Anders' modus operandum 
in her effort to be as faithful to reality as possible. Getting close to the 
girls, she says, literally took years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coveted them from afar," explains Anders. "I finally approached Whisper 
(Nelida Lopez, who plays herself in a leading role) because she was the 
youngest and looked like she might not kick my ass." 
</P>
<P>
 Smokey and Nitowl, who were extras in "Mi Vida," don't hesitate in giving 
Anders her due credit. "She dared to come and talk to us when no one else 
would," says Smokey. But at the same time, they are clearly ambivalent about 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth," says Nitowl, "I liked (the movie), because it was 
about me." But, she adds, "I've bumped into friends that think it's stupid, 
(who say) it's a put-down to our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 A rival gang member, such as the film's El Duran (Jesse Borrego), for example, 
would not be cruising the area in a fancy car.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the whole neighborhood knows that that guy is after one of our homeboys . 
. . in any other neighborhood they would have shot him already," says Evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Script differences aside, the youths gained respect for Anders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allison did a lot for us. When we needed help, she helped us . . . and she 
adopted my homegirl's son," says Nitowl, referring to Nica Rogers, who died at 
19 of an overdose a few months before the movie was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (Nica) was a wonderful person, very mythic to the girls -- the most 
beautiful, the most down," says Anders, who is in the process of adopting her 
little boy. "He's going to have all the chances (Nica) didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the biggest gripes about "Mi Vida" is the fact that the 
movie depicts the characters as having no interaction with their families.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see the extension of the other family members," says social worker 
Willie Martinez, who also works with El Centro del Pueblo. "But those family 
members are with them constantly. They're the ones who bail them out of jail, 
who visit them in jail, who take them to school and try to get them back in." 
</P>
<P>
 And for those trying to go beyond gang life, "Mi Vida" doesn't offer much 
hope, which is not what young women like Smokey want to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I don't like the idea of people seeing me like that, 'cause I'm getting 
my (act) together, and I'm thinking about the future," she says. "We used to 
steal cars and . . . we could get money buying and selling drugs, but now . . . 
I'm gonna go back to school and get myself a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Anders, however, didn't want to sugarcoat her ending. "I feel the upbeat 
ending is up to the audience," says the filmmaker. "I don't want people to walk 
out of the movie and say, 'OK, everything's fine.' "

Q & A WITH GEORGE PUTNAM; 'I BROADCAST IN MY SPARE TIME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With little fanfare, George Putnam celebrated his 60th anniversary in 
broadcasting last week.  
</P>
<P>
 At 80 years of age, Putnam still has the distinctive, stentorian vocal style 
familiar to millions of television viewers in the 1950s and '60s, when he was 
Los Angeles' highest-paid television newsman. His mixture of news reports and 
editorials earned him a reputation as a staunchly conservative commentator.  
</P>
<P>
 Putnam got his start in broadcasting -- and washing floors -- in 1934 at WDGY, 
a Minneapolis radio station. During the next six decades he worked for NBC, 
ABC, Mutual Broadcasting, KTLA-TV Channel 5, KTTV-TV Channel 11 and, for the 
last 20 years, at KIEV-AM (870) in Glendale, where he hosts a talk show called 
"Talkback" weekdays from noon to 2 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You were conservative long before it was fashionable, as it has 
become these days on talk radio. What do you think when you see the success of 
someone like Rush Limbaugh? Do you think you were ahead of your time? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think that Rush Limbaugh is a phenomenon. And yet not really a 
phenomenon, because many of the things he's doing today, I did 40 years ago in 
this very community. However, I take exception to two or three things he does. 
With all of that wonderful opportunity, with all those stations he broadcasts 
on, why in hell does he insist on talking about himself? I'm so g-------- fed 
up with the fact that he is self-indulgent and self-aggrandizing. Shut up 
already and let people make their decision. Don't tell people how wonderful you 
are. And the other thing is when he says that animals have no rights. Then he 
plays "Born Free" with machine guns and animals screaming. . . . I am an animal 
person. People come first and then our animals. God, I spend 90% of my time 
working with, helping, saving animals. It's an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are often called ultra-conservative or even reactionary. What's your 
response to this label? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've never thought of myself as a conservative. I detest labels. I've been 
called many things in my career: right-wing extremist, super-patriot, 
goose-stepping nationalist, jingoistic SOB. And those are some of the nice 
things! But those people have never bothered to determine my background: Farmer 
Labor Party, Socialist Party, lifelong member of the NAACP, member of the Urban 
League. . . . I went through the Depression, and my father was reduced from a 
sales manager of a company to selling peanuts door-to-door. Then, because of 
that, I fell in love with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I've been a lifelong Democrat. 
I'm a conservative Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the '60s you were said to be the highest-paid television news reporter 
in Los Angeles, with a salary of $300,000 a year. What do you think of the 
salaries being paid to television anchors today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'll be quite frank with you. No one -- and I don't give a damn who you are 
-- no news reader is worth $1 million on a local station. Now, that may be a 
horribly harsh statement and, well, maybe it's not fair, but I mean it. 
Especially news readers. All my life I've reported and written. I wrote "One 
Reporter's Opinion" every day of my radio and television life. It's the best 
training in the world. I am not too impressed with people who cannot report and 
write. . . . I would like to ask the average broadcaster today after he or she 
is finished broadcasting to repeat for me what he or she just said. Now, there 
would be a test! And I'll wager there isn't one in 10 who has absorbed the 
material because they didn't write it, prepare it or report it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think of television news shows these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't very often watch them. Good reporting has all but disappeared from 
television news. One thing that aggravates me more than anything else are these 
g-------- teasers: "Famous actor dies. We'll tell you who at 11."  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has broadcasting changed over the past 60 years? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have the greatest technology in the history of the world. But I frankly 
don't think our present-day reporting has kept up with the technology. With 
present-day technology, an independent or local station is as effective as any 
network in the history of mankind. . . . But, as far as the reporting's 
concerned, I'm very disturbed by two or three things: tabloid journalism -- the 
fact that hard news is suffering, that I tune in a news report in the evening 
and get as much as eight or 10 minutes of shootings and stabbings and robberies 
and murders and rapes. All of that titillation and much of it trivial. Scandal, 
a numbness, a kind of a loss of feeling about what blood truly is, about what 
life truly is, what the human truly is, all lost in kind of a world of 
make-believe that crosses over into actuality.  
</P>
<P>
 And then further than that, I worry about checkbook journalism. I fear it's 
going to get in the way of court cases. And it's all a part now of the jury 
system. The whole damn jury system is falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you get your start in broadcasting? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I started out at WDGY Radio in Minneapolis. It was a 1,000-watt station 
owned by Dr. George Young. In those days, all the screwballs got into radio 
because they didn't think it was going to last. He was a mail-order 
optometrist. I answered the telephone; I spun the records. It was the best 
training in the world. But then along came television in 1934. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I got started in television in 1939. I did both over the years. Walter 
Winchell made my career. The thing that gave me attention was he called me "the 
greatest voice in American radio." I went from $190 a month at NBC to better 
than $200,000 a year, which was much too much for a 24-year-old kid out of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were said to be one of the inspirations for the Ted Baxter character on 
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was kind of a composite of three of us, I think: Baxter Ward, Jerry 
Dunphy and myself. Early on it offended both Jerry and myself. Because when 
you're much younger, you take yourself more seriously. Then you outgrow it and 
you don't give a damn. It was a hell of a cute character. And I've known a few 
(anchors) like that. Airheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the future? Now that you're 80, do you have any plans to retire? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: I wouldn't know what else to do except for my ranching and my horses. I've 
raised 450 thoroughbred horses. I've won 150 races. Ran seventh in the Kentucky 
Derby once. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you do when you're not broadcasting your talk show? How do you 
spend your leisure time? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I work on my ranch (in Chino) from 5 in the morning till 8 at night every 
Saturday and Sunday. I have 20 dogs, 30 cats, three burros, two Palominos, 65 
thoroughbred horses. I never stop. I have 20 acres. I broadcast in my spare 
time.

 UNPLUGGING GRUNWALD: With the Administration's health care plan in jeopardy 
and Democrats worried about fall elections, the Washington backbiting season 
has begun in earnest. Earlier this summer, Democratic National Committee 
Chairman David Wilhelm was the chief target of intraparty sniping. Now, the 
fire has begun shifting toward President Clinton's chief media consultant, 
Mandy Grunwald. She was widely hailed for the advertisements she produced for 
Clinton during the 1992 campaign, but critics grumble that her health care ads 
have failed to do the trick and have needlessly annoyed some Democratic 
senators, including Nebraska's Bob Kerrey, who has publicly told people to stop 
giving money to the DNC because of health care ads he says are a "waste of 
money." Grunwald's defenders say she is being unfairly targeted in part because 
she is a she -- a rarity in the male-dominated world of political consulting -- 
and because White House officials are seeking a scapegoat. But even admirers 
concede that she can be difficult to work with.

 OFFICE HARMONY: The hunt for an office for former White House Chief of Staff, 
now counselor, Thomas (Mack) McLarty ended peacefully this week without further 
intrigue. McLarty did not try to displace Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos 
from his spot next door to the Oval Office but, instead, moved one floor below 
into the space vacated by David Gergen, who departed to the State Department.

 BIG BAD JOHN?: Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), heavy-handed baron of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, took some shots from Rep. Joseph Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) in a recent debate over insurance redlining. "It's time to stop 
getting bullied around by the Energy and Commerce Committee," Kennedy said, 
proposing to trim the panel's jurisdiction. Dingell kept mum. Kennedy's measure 
failed, 343 to 88.

 WELFARE PLUNGE: The House is moving full-speed ahead on welfare reform, 
despite the conventional wisdom that time is too short in this session of 
Congress to negotiate such complicated and controversial legislation. Ron 
Haskins, a Republican staff member of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on 
human resources, which is scheduling hearings on the legislation next week, 
said that a month ago the chances of getting a bill passed this year were one 
in nine, but "now I'd say the chances are 50-50." One reason for the push: The 
new chairman of Ways and Means, Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) wants to show that he 
can fill the shoes of his formidable predecessor, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.). Another factor, staff members say, is that passing a bill to reform 
welfare, a system voters agree needs fixing, would help incumbents in the polls 
this November. The Senate had one hearing on welfare reform earlier this month 
but has yet to draft a hearing schedule. Gibbons and others have suggested 
that, if the House starts plowing ahead, the Senate will have to follow.

 OFF THE GRASS: In the Four Corners states of the Southwest -- Colorado, Utah, 
New Mexico and Arizona -- environmentalists trying to pressure the Clinton 
Administration into cracking down on cattle grazing on federal land are 
rallying behind a new battle cry. The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and 
Gilawatch, a group standing guard over a New Mexico wilderness area, are 
helping finance lobbying efforts with proceeds from the sale of T-shirts 
emblazoned with: "No Moos Is Good News."

DRIVING TEST UPDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Bravo, great job and well done to the DMV for finally updating the driving 
test! Sixty years and literally thousands of accidents later, we finally are 
requiring motorists to learn the rules of the road before they drive. 
</P>
<P>
 What concerns me is why we had to wait so long for a change.Both the freeway 
conditions and number of vehicles on the road today are hardly comparable to 
what they were 60 years ago. To expect a driving exam to remain accurate for 
this length of time is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 And to the 75% who fail the new test the first time they try -- don't worry. 
You can practice and take the test again later. Look at the DMV -- it took them 
60 years to get it right. Let's just hope it doesn't take them that long next 
time.

THREE STORES IN HUNTINGTON BEACH HIT BY ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three stores were robbed at gunpoint within 80 minutes Wednesday afternoon, 
but police said they were not certain if they were connected because 
descriptions of the suspects varied widely. 
</P>
<P>
 The first attack occurred shortly after 4:30 p.m. when a man walked into the 
Great American Yogurt store, in the 19000 block of Beach Boulevard, showed a 
clerk a handgun tucked in his waistband and demanded money, said Officer J.B. 
Hume of the Huntington Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, whom police described as a 5-foot, 9-inch black man, about 35 
years old and weighing about 200 pounds, left the store with an undisclosed 
amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later, a man walked up to an employee at the Hair Shack, in the 
10100 block of Adams Avenue, showed a handgun in his waistband, and demanded 
the store's money, Hume said. Hume described that robber, who also fled on foot 
after taking an unknown amount of cash, as about 6 feet tall and 19 to 20 years 
of age, with a dark complexion. 
</P>
<P>
 The third store, Glo White Florist, in the 9000 block of Atlanta Avenue, was 
hit at 5:50 p.m. by an armed man who said "this is a robbery." After the 
suspect displayed the gun in his waistband, the employee ran out of the store, 
Hume said. The suspect followed and was seen getting into a red Firebird parked 
nearby, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume described the third suspect as a white man in his late 20s, about 6 feet 
tall with blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The three stores are within four miles of each other.

KIA VOLUNTARILY RECALLS HALF OF ITS U.S. IMPORTS; MANUFACTURING: KOREAN AUTO 
MAKER IS REPLACING DEFECTIVE SENSORS IN 6,945 CARS SIX MONTHS AFTER DEBUT IN 
THIS COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than six months after beginning sales in the United States, Kia Motors 
America has announced a voluntary recall of more than half of the 13,000 cars 
it has imported from Korea to replace sensors that control speedometers and 
cruise controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half of the 6,945 cars subject to the recall have actually been 
sold to private buyers, the company indicated. The others are still are on 
dealers' lots or waiting to be shipped to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say the recall isn't likely to hurt Irvine-based Kia -- 
which advertises its vehicles, which start at $8,995, as "well-built" cars for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recalls don't have the negative connotations they used to have" when most 
repairs were forced on reluctant auto makers by federal regulators, said 
Christopher Cedargren, an analyst with AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana. "Most 
recalls these days are voluntary, and they tell people that the car companies 
care about quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Luxury auto lines such as Lexus and Infiniti, as well as General Motors 
Corp.'s Saturn -- the domestic leader in recent quality surveys -- have had a 
number of voluntary recalls. "If anything, they have helped the images of those 
companies," Cedargren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia owner Jeannine Sainz bought her turquoise Sephia at an El Cajon dealership 
in April. She has not yet been notified of the recall, she said, but isn't 
concerned about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear about them all the time now, they're no big deal. At least they show 
that the company is keeping an eye on things," Sainz said. The 22-year-old San 
Diego bank teller said she is very happy with her car and has had no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia Motors America, the importer and distributor of Korean-made Kia 
automobiles, said that the cars subject to its recall were equipped with an 
electronic speed sensor that has developed an "unacceptable" malfunction rate. 
The problems have been identified over time in the Sephias that have been used 
by rental fleets since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kia began a "rolling" retail introduction of its cars in Washington in 
February. The first dealerships in Southern California did not open until May. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 3,600 of the 13,000 Sephia compact sedans now in the United States have 
been sold by dealers, said Kia spokesman Geno Effler. An additional 2,000 cars 
are owned by rental car fleets and the remaining vehicles are at showrooms or 
in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars all were made between Nov. 5, 1993, and March 30, 1994. Of the total, 
1,555 are Sephia GS models with cruise control.

PROMOTION CAPS DEL TACO STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During a career spent in marketing, Del Taco Executive Vice President Paul 
Hitzelberger says, he has never found a promotion so packed with promise as 
milk caps, the round game pieces that kids trade and collect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it," said Hitzelberger, 49."We're projecting a 
30% to 50% increase in sales, which is wild in a category where 2% to 3% is 
good." The allure of milk caps is strongest in Southern California, 
Hitzelberger said, but market research suggests that the milk cap promotion 
will also succeed outside of the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Del Taco is using the milk caps in conjunction with a radio and television 
campaign that is designed to bolster the number of 6- to 12-year-olds eating in 
its stores. As important, the advertisements will target parents of young 
children. Del Taco, with more than 270 Mexican-style fast-food restaurants, 
generally had targeted customers age 18 through 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Taco, based in Orange, has allied itself with the Costa Mesa-based World 
POG Federation.

O.C. BRIEFLY: HEALTH FIRM ACCUSES EX-PRESIDENT OF FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. charges in legal documents that its former 
president defrauded the Costa Mesa company, wasn't entitled to $1.2 million in 
severance pay and wrongly pocketed $67,000 in expense money three days before 
his Jan. 27 firing. 
</P>
<P>
 The home health care company's assertions are part of a counterclaim against 
Victor M.G. Chaltiel, who had sued the company over his dismissal. The case is 
pending before an arbitrator in Los Angeles. Abbey contends that Chaltiel, in 
selling his home-infusion therapy company to Abbey last year, inflated earnings 
projections and concealed illegal operations of his company, Total 
Pharmaceutical Care Co.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; IRVINE CO. MAY BE WEIGHING UNSECURED, JUNK BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Compiled by Debora Vrana, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rating officials from Standard & Poor's Corp. were in town last week to chat 
with Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren. The subject: Ratings for a possible bond 
issue, probably a privately placed, unsecured, junk bond issue from Orange 
County's largest landowner, according to sources at the New York-based rating 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., which sold a 39% minority stake in its apartment properties to 
the public in a successful $187-million real estate investment trust last year, 
is looking at ways to raise additional capital, Bren, 62, has said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Those possibilities include a Real Estate Investment Trust composed of 
industrial and/or retail properties -- such as its 1.3 million-square-foot 
Fashion Island shopping center and the 3,600-acre Irvine Spectrum industrial 
and office park -- by the end of this year, or a type of bond issue. The 
company may be eyeing an unsecured bond issue because a bond issue secured by 
properties would tie up those properties and not allow them to later serve as 
security for a REIT. The privately held company could eventually become a 
holding company with several publicly owned companies, Bren has said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a brief meeting, but thorough," said Jean Callanan, a real estate 
analyst with Standard & Poor's in New York, who said she could not comment 
further on the bond issue.

 Thrifts and Mortgages: While a drop in mortgage refinancing volume has hurt 
most mortgage lenders in Orange County, the local thrifts are doing better than 
other financial institutions, according to a report from TRW REDI Property 
Data, a real estate data company in Riverside. 
</P>

 In the first five months of this year, local thrifts accounted for 20.4% of 
new home mortgages originated in the county, as compared to 17.6% of mortgages 
for the same period last year. The shift is occurring because savings and loans 
do not rely as heavily on the refinancing business as do banks and independent 
lenders and more of the thrifts' home loans use the increasingly popular 
adjustable rate mortgages, which allows them to place the risk of higher rates 
on the borrower.

 Downey Savings & Loan Assn.: The Newport Beach S&L posted a second-quarter 
profit of $6.5 million, or 40 cents a share, a 32% decline from earnings of 
$9.5 million, or 58 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. For the 
first half, profit totaled $12.2 million, or 76 cents a share.That compared to 
earnings of $31.7 million, or $1.96 a share, for the comparable period last 
year, which included a gain of $15.1 million from an accounting change. Downey 
attributed the earnings decline for the latest quarter to an increased 
provision for loan losses after the Northridge earthquake and a $1.5-million 
write-off resulting from a tenant in Downey's headquarters building defaulting 
on a lease and vacating the space.

MAN ARRESTED IN POSSESSION OF 12 BEAR GALLBLADDERS; CRIME: HE HAD PLANNED TO 
SELL THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKAGE HE PICKED UP IN ANAHEIM, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hearing aide technician was arrested as he picked up a package of 12 bear 
gallbladders, which he planned to sell in Asian communities for their professed 
medicinal and aphrodisiac qualities, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Charles Schulte, 31, of Anaheim faces up to three years in prison and 
a $5,000 fine if he is found guilty of the felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service said they were notified last week by their counterparts in 
Wyoming that a package containing dried bear gallbladders was to be shipped to 
California. Originally, they said, the gallbladders had been sent from 
Saskatchewan, Canada, to Casper, Wyo., where possessing them is not a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wyoming wildlife officials, noticing paperwork accompanying the package 
that identified its contents, alerted California officials of the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 After staking out an Anaheim mail drop for three days, a team of Fish and Game 
wardens arrested Schulte on Friday in the parking lot of the DHL Worldwide 
Express facility where he had picked up the package and was about to place it 
in his car, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was extremely surprised," said Lt. Angel Raton, the state warden who 
oversaw the arrest. "His eyes got big and he became pale. He was shocked that 
we were there; he figured he wasn't going to get caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulte, subsequently released on $10,000 bail, could not be reached for 
comment on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Raton, however, Schulte told investigators he had gotten the idea 
of importing the gallbladders from a television program on the subject and 
intended to sell them in Chinatown and Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 In some Asian communities in California, investigators said, dried bear 
gallbladders sell for $200 to $1,000 apiece and in some Asian countries, they 
bring as much as $265 per gram. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who buy them generally grind them into tea, believing them to possess 
certain medicinal qualities and, in some cases, to act as aphrodisiacs, said 
Valerie A. Griswold, the Orange County deputy district attorney prosecuting the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fairly widespread throughout the state," said Pat Moore, a spokesman for 
the state Fish and Game Department. "We believe that several hundred bears are 
killed in California for this purpose each year." 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases," said Bob Schlicting, another spokesman, "it's as lucrative as 
drug running." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say they have no evidence that Schulte's imported gallbladders 
came from California bears. Because of the difficulty of infiltrating the 
communities in which the bladders are sold, they said, only about six arrests 
are made for the crime each year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Schulte's case, Raton said, "we were able to nip it in the bud. This was a 
first-time offense." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is protect the bears in our state," Griswold said. 
"This appears to be a fairly pervasive problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment has been set for Aug. 15 at Central Municipal Court in Santa Ana.

A BEAUTIFUL ENDING FOR INFANT WITH BAD HEART; HEALTH: JOSE VERDUGO BECOMES THE 
YOUNGEST PERSON TO RECEIVE A CARDIAC DEFIBRILLATOR IMPLANT. HE IS EXPECTED TO 
LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven-month-old Jose Verdugo may never have a normal heart, but he should be 
able to grow up much like other children, thanks to a high-tech device 
implanted in his upper abdomen by surgeons at Children's Hospital of Orange 
County last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Mel Singer, director of the hospital's cardiac division, said the Downey 
boy, who was discharged Wednesday, is the youngest patient ever to receive an 
automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator. Before Jose, the youngest person 
to receive the cardiac defibrillator was 18 months old, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a happy ending," said Dr. Sana Al-Jundi, a physician in the hospital's 
intensive-care unit. "It's been a pretty rocky course for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose suffers from life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, a condition that is 
relatively rare in infants. When an irregular heartbeat occurs, Jose's heart 
stops functioning and blood is not pumped through his body. The boy quickly 
lapses into unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The implanted device, which is about the size of a cigarette pack, monitors 
the boy's heartbeat and administers a jolt of electricity when his heart needs 
to be shocked back into a regular rhythm. Without the device, Jose would be in 
constant danger of going into cardiac arrest, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign of trouble for Jose came when he was only 40 days old. The 
infant suddenly lost consciousness for three minutes but was kept alive by his 
father, Ralph Verdugo, who administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation until 
paramedics arrived. Ralph Verdugo is a mechanic who was taught CPR at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He truly owes his life to his father," Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-month stay at Children's Hospital, during which the arrhythmia was 
diagnosed, Jose seemed to have regained his health and was able to return home 
under medication. But eight months later, the arrhythmia recurred. Once again, 
Ralph Verdugo saved his young son's life with CPR. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors then decided that Jose needed the implanted defibrillator to survive. 
The four-hour surgery performed Friday was a relatively routine procedure, 
except for the patient's young age, Singer said. The device is normally 
implanted into older adults who have suffered heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jose must return to the hospital for periodic examinations and to 
have the device's batteries changed every two years or so, he should be able to 
develop normally, Singer said. The doctor stopped short of giving Jose 
permission to take up contact sports, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience has also been pretty rough for Jose's mother, Aida Sarkar, who 
is six months pregnant. The stress of the past five days caused her to go into 
contractions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkar seemed relieved Wednesday as she gently rocked Jose, who was wearing a 
Chicago White Sox playsuit in the hospital's pediatric intensive-care unit. 
After she delivers her second child, a baby girl who will be named Stephanie, 
Sarkar said, there will be no more children. 
</P>
<P>
 "No more babies," she said with a smile. "It's just too much.

RULING VOIDS 175,000 COURT WARRANTS FOR ARRESTS; JURISPRUDENCE: THE ACTION 
COULD MEAN A LOSS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE. HOWEVER, SOME 
MAY BE REISSUED AT A LATER DATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Law enforcement officials have begun canceling at least 175,000 arrest 
warrants for people who failed to appear in Orange County Municipal Court, 
spurred by an appellate court ruling that the warrants were unconstitutionally 
issued by court clerks instead of prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Invalidating the warrants could mean the loss of hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in revenue to county government from fines paid by defendants, said 
South Orange County Municipal Court Judge Ronald P. Kreber, an assistant 
presiding judge. It will mean at least temporary reprieves for scofflaws who 
failed to appear in court for traffic and misdemeanor offenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants named in the recalled warrants are off the hook "at least for 
now," Kreber said, but could face arrest again if the orders are reissued by 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned with people getting arrested on a warrant for failure to 
appear where the statute has been ruled unconstitutional," Kreber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The canceled warrants are the result of defendant Kurt Albert Stapf's 
successful legal challenge of a 1989 state law that empowered court clerks to 
issue arrest warrants for people who failed to appear in court as ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Romney, the district attorney's director of Municipal Court operations, 
said his department's position is that the courts don't have the constitutional 
authority to issue the warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought (Stapf's) position was well taken," Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "it's still up in the air what's going to happen" while the case is 
on appeal, Romney said the district attorney's office intends to reissue many 
warrants after obtaining affidavits from court clerks to verify that defendants 
failed to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrants older than a year probably won't be reissued, he said, because "we 
feel the statute of limitations has run." 
</P>
<P>
 In adopting the law, the Legislature intended to create a cost-effective 
method of issuing the arrest warrants, Kreber said. But the appellate 
department of the Superior Court ruled July 8 that the warrant-issuing 
procedure is unconstitutional because it gives powers to court clerks that are 
reserved for the district attorney's office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling could have statewide impact because the same practice is followed 
in many counties, Kreber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th Appellate District in Santa Ana agreed Monday to hear an appeal of the 
case filed by Orange County Municipal Court officials. Oral arguments are set 
for September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court's appellate department overturned five $140 
fines for failure to appear that were levied against Stapf, a Laguna Niguel 
resident who failed to show up in court for motorcycle speeding tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said traffic-court clerks using computers to systematically charge 
traffic offenders violates the constitutionally mandated separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an apparent, if not actual conflict of interest," the panel ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Terry Andrus argued unsuccessfully that the appeal of Stapf's 
charges was "a direct attack upon the court's inherent and statutory powers to 
control its proceedings and efficiently administer justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the practice declared unconstitutional, clerks issued warrants for 
defendants who failed to appear, offering them "a choice of paying a fine or 
jail time," Kreber said. "Fines usually run from $225 up to . . . the vicinity 
of several hundred dollars. If it gets too high, a person will just take the 
jail time." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies have been advised by the county's municipal courts to 
recall all warrants issued under the 1989 law, and have begun doing so, 
according to Kreber and a Sheriff's Department memo issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our estimate is that this invalidates approximately 175,000 warrants," Capt. 
Jack Devereaux of the Sheriff's support services division wrote in the memo, 
issued to county Sherifhf's stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot more (warrants) than what's been named by the Sheriff's 
Department," Kreber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Martini of Sheriff's Department said he could not comment on such a 
"major order" without talking to Sheriff Brad Gates, who could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Kreber said it is unknown how the ruling will affect the cases of people 
who have already served jail time or paid fines stemming from warrants issued 
by court clerks since the law went into effect in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really predict" how courts will deal with those cases, Kreber said. 
"I don't know what the remedy will be on that."

HOT PROPERTY; BEVERLY HILLS POLICE PUT ON A GRAND LINEUP OF ALLEGEDLY STOLEN 
GOODS IN BID FOR EVIDENCE AGAINST SUSPECT 
</P>

 Ginger Atherton came to Beverly Hills police headquarters Wednesday for what 
resembled the high-end garage sale of the century. In a crowded storeroom, she 
scanned bronze busts of Greek gods, stereo equipment stacked like cafeteria 
trays, oil paintings lining the walls and Tiffany lamps accustomed to more 
congenial settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a flash of recognition, the interior designer became a potential 
witness against a man police say did his own decorating by burglarizing luxury 
homes and antique shops in the Westside's most gilded neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "My chairs! That's my chairs!" Atherton shouted in unmitigated delight, 
pointing to two French-style, tapestry-covered armchairs that she said were 
stolen from her Holmby Hills estate last month. To prove her point, she showed 
detectives color photographs of the chairs when they graced her tastefully 
appointed living room. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officers nodded in satisfaction and took notes. For them, this was 
more welcome evidence in the large case they are mounting against Wayne Robert 
Reiner, a 40-year-old accountant who allegedly did not let personal finances 
stand in the way of expensive tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 10 policemen 30 hours last month to pack up and truck all the antique 
furnishings, refrigerators, microwave ovens, chandeliers, pool pumps, big 
screen TVs, statues and wine cases they seized from the mansion that Reiner is 
building on a Bel-Air hillside. "I don't think we've ever seen so much stuff in 
one location," said Beverly Hills Police Sgt. Michael Corren. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have three or four ovens and three or four microwaves is out of character 
for most homes," dryly added Detective Thomas Linehan. In all, 500 items were 
confiscated, including some police found at Reiner's Beverly Hills apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner has been charged with two counts each of burglary and receiving stolen 
property, but police say they expect to add charges soon as a result of more 
items being identified in Wednesday's storeroom showing to the public. 
Authorities say he is suspected of 13 burglaries, most often at homes for sale 
or under construction or renovation in Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the allegedly stolen property is conservatively estimated at $1 
million, although police said that could increase sharply after appraisers 
examine the paintings, a few of which appear to date to the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Free on $50,000 bail, Reiner must stay at his three-story house on Glenroy 
Place in Bel-Air and his whereabouts are being monitored by an anklet radio 
transmitter. He did not answer the door when a reporter came by seeking an 
interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Planks and other construction material cluttered the driveway, and a 
chain-link fence was stretched in front. Faced in white stones, the 
20,000-square-foot house hugs the hilltop in three wings and has several 
balconies with great views of the flatlands below. A glass tent-like skylight 
juts through the roof of its main lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner's attorney, Gary Amsterdam, was said to be tied up in court on another 
matter and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors report that Reiner insists that he is innocent. "He told us he 
denies all the charges, that he is totally appalled by all this," said Chris 
Gabriele, whose family owns a house next door on the leafy Bel-Air cul-de-sac. 
Although some neighbors had squabbled with Reiner over the size of his new 
house, Gabriele said no one anticipated that criminal charges would be pressed 
against a man she described as "very friendly, very courteous." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that was questionable to us was that he drove a pickup with a 
forklift, and he's an accountant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, 16-year-old Scott Wilson, said he used to visit Reiner and 
play computer games with him in a room set aside for Nintendo. The accountant's 
"prize possession," Wilson recalled, was a '50s-style Coca-Cola machine. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Wilson household feuded with Reiner over construction 
debris left in the street, Scott said. Then they became suspicious about the 
frequent truck unloadings into the Reiner house about 1 and 2 a.m. "It seemed 
the guy never slept," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A real estate broker spotted a man inside a vacant Beverly Hills home on June 
22, according to Beverly Hills police spokesman Lt. Frank Salcido. The man gave 
the agent "some hokey story" about repairs and quickly drove away in a pickup 
truck, Salcido said. The broker noted the license plate number and alerted 
police, who arrested Reiner a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of some items led police to conclude that Reiner had accomplices; 
an antique cast-iron fireplace grate on display Wednesday weighs about 400 
pounds. And a man working alone could barely budge the beloved Coca-Cola 
machine, not to mention the three refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to media reports, about 50 people viewed the booty at the police 
station's cinder-block storeroom. Preliminary counts showed that five or so 
visitors identified possessions, such as a brass urn and a marble sink, Salcido 
said. The merchandise is to be returned to rightful owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharyl Mendez did not find the plumbing fixtures, locks and gates stolen 
during renovation of her Bel-Air house six months ago. But she called the 
police display "incredible, just amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designer Atherton found her chairs but was disappointed that a 
valuable tapestry stolen at the same time was not in the show. Still, she was 
impressed by the overall array. "Someone was very selective," she said. "They 
had some very good taste, actually."

STROLLING THROUGH MOONWALK MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a moment when all of humanity seemed linked, when national pride edged 
aside just enough to share the spotlight with derring-do. The landing of the 
Eagle on the moon was a Cold War triumph and a victory of the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 It united a raucous auditorium of college students in Hawaii with a party 
under way on Balboa Island; it joined a mother whose husband and three children 
had fallen asleep in San Pedro with a family of six who crowded around a 
television in a den in Orange, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Those reminiscences, as well as strong emotions, came flooding back Wednesday 
for visitors to Griffith Observatory, 25 years to the day after technology and 
political will put man on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the only memory was of staying up a little late -- the moonwalk 
occurred at 11 p.m. EDT. For many others, the sensation of those moments is 
still sharply etched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was overjoyed, just like the rest of the people," said Albert Medina, a 
76-year-old retired linen supply deliveryman. "It was something. I couldn't 
believe my eyes when I saw they were landing on the moon and walking, after all 
these centuries, and for something like that to come true in your lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Medina watched the now familiar scenes of the landing at 1:17 p.m. PDT in 
Hollywood and then watched the moonwalk with his two children, who broke into 
whoops of joy as soon as the Eagle's metal feet settled several inches into the 
moon dust.  
</P>
<P>
 Allen Yost, 72, watched it with his brother, who insisted that they stay up to 
watch Neil Armstrong take his giant leap for mankind on his snowy-screened TV 
on a remote Saskatchewan ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it was a big deal for all of us," said Yost, who lives in Los Feliz. 
The hoopla over the 25th anniversary reminded him that 1969 also marked another 
achievement of American technology: that was the year he bought the Chevrolet 
Camaro he has driven for 276,000 miles, enough to get him to the moon and a bit 
beyond.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem that long ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is long enough to blur most of the details of the event for Greg 
McNair, who was 9 years old and living in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project 
with his family when the moon was brought into the realm of human exploration. 
"I do remember that everyone . . . did sit down and watch intently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a 34-year-old attorney, he took the day off Wednesday to take his three 
daughters to the daylong celebration of the historic spaceflight at the 
observatory, hoping to stir in them a sense of awe and curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think at the time that I could appreciate the enormity of what was 
happening," he said. "As I've gotten older and realized man's limitations, it's 
amazing to me that it happened 25 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierina Beck was studying English literature in Hawaii 25 years ago when she 
and fellow students gathered in a large auditorium to watch the events. 
"Everybody was screaming and yelling" at the touchdown, said Beck, who is 
visiting Los Angeles from Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like 'Mission Impossible,' " said Simone Dennewill, 72, who was 
riveted to the TV screen in San Pedro while her insurance adjuster husband, 
Bob, and their three children slept. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Mitchell, who stopped off at the observatory as part of a family visit to 
Los Angeles from their home outside Houston in Orange, Tex., remembered that 
the moon mission was part of the daily lesson plan in his school. When the day 
came, finally, his parents and four brothers and sisters were there to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our part of the country it was a major, major deal," said Mitchell, who 
was 9 at the time. "But I remember my grandmother didn't believe they were 
actually going to the moon . . . so I still had this doubt a person could go 
that far and that high." 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood artist Rita Blum said she was having a one-woman show on Balboa 
Island when the Eagle, the name given to the lunar module, touched down; she 
and her husband, Marvin, were invited to a posh party given by the gallery 
owner to watch the event. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a personal connection to the achievement because Marvin Blum, a 
mathematician, had worked on calculations that were related to the $30-billion 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very exciting when we thought of the millions of things that had to go 
right to make it work," she said. "It was magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry and Alice Bucci had an even more personal connection to the events 
surrounding the landing and the astronauts' return four days later. Gerry Bucci 
was a technical director for ABC News and, like everyone else, was home 
watching Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Jr. cavort across the moon's cratered face. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he got a call asking him to go to Hawaii to work on the broadcast of the 
astronauts' re-entry and return. Alice went along and for both of them the 
memories of that trip remain fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The three astronauts, who were to remain quarantined for 18 days to ensure 
that they would not contaminate others with unknown diseases, were driven close 
to a crowd of greeters in an Airstream travel trailer. Gerry Bucci said he got 
close enough to see that astronaut Michael Collins was playing the banjo and 
then Collins stopped long enough to wave out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys had gone to the moon, and they had come back all that way, and it 
just seemed they were in awe that all these people were gathered there," Alice 
Bucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a measure of how things have changed, Gerry Bucci said, "there's a shuttle 
up there today and I don't even think people know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldering a video camera, Bucci taped his wife standing in front of a model 
of the landing craft set up on the observatory lawn. And standing in front of a 
display on the mission technology. And in front of a mock-up of a lunar rover 
used in a later mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings back a lot of memories," she said.

WOMAN BANK ROBBER KILLS SECURITY GUARD; CRIME: SHE FLEES WITH TWO ACCOMPLICES 
WHO TAKE AN UNKNOWN AMOUNT OF MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual twist on an all-too-frequent crime, a woman bank robber shot and 
killed a San Pedro bank security guard Wednesday and fled with two male 
accomplices who had vaulted over the counter and scooped an unknown amount of 
money from tellers' cash drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard, identified by police as Juan A. Corona-Garcia, 36, of Los 
Angeles, was shot in the neck -- possibly with his own gun -- when he struggled 
with the bank robber inside the Home Bank branch in the 700 block of South 
Gaffey Street at 9:20 a.m. He died later at San Pedro Peninsula Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the robbery, a blue van that apparently was used as a getaway 
car was discovered a few blocks away. Nearby, police found wigs and clothing -- 
including what appeared to be a security guard's uniform -- believed to have 
been abandoned by the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona-Garcia, who was employed by Intercept Private Security of Los Angeles, 
had only been assigned to the bank since Monday, when it reopened as a branch 
of Home Bank after the closure last week of the Bank of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 787th bank robbery so far this year in the seven-county Los Angeles 
area, described by law enforcement officials as "the bank robbery capital of 
the world." FBI spokesman John Hoos said it was the 120th "takeover" bank 
robbery -- in which everyone in the bank is held at gunpoint.  
</P>
<P>
 Hoos said that women are involved in only 5% of Los Angeles bank robberies 
overall, and those almost always are "note jobs" in which the robber demands 
money from an individual teller. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, women "note job" bank robbers in the Los Angeles area have 
included a stout woman -- nicknamed "Large Marge" by FBI investigators -- who 
robbed at least six banks in Glendale and the San Gabriel Valley; the so-called 
"Miss America Bandit," who robbed at least 10 banks; and a 66-year-old woman 
who faced misdemeanor weapons charges after brandishing a gun at a San Fernando 
Valley bank teller and demanding exactly $242 -- the amount of her Social 
Security check that she claimed should have been automatically deposited to her 
account but wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But a woman's participation in a takeover bank robbery is "definitely 
unusual," Hoos said. And for a female to shoot someone during a bank robbery, 
he said, is "very rare."  
</P>
<P>
 The last time it happened in Los Angeles may have been last August, when two 
people dressed as women nurses shot and wounded an armored car guard outside a 
bank in the Fairfax district. However, police said, they may have been men 
disguised as women. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman, Officer Lorie Taylor, said 
investigators are assuming that the person involved in the Home Bank robbery 
was in fact a woman and not a disguised man. Police, FBI officials and victim 
counselors said at least 20 people, mostly employees, were in the bank when the 
robbery and shooting occurred. The female robber, dressed in a green jumpsuit, 
shouted that a robbery was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone yelled 'Get down!' and everyone hit the floor," said Carlyn Belsky, a 
volunteer counselor with the LAPD's Crisis Response Team who talked to some of 
the witnesses. "They (bank employees) were all very shaken up by it." 
</P>
<P>
 While the female robber stood near the security guard, Hoos said, two male 
robbers, at least one of whom may have been wearing a security guard uniform, 
jumped over the tellers' counter and started emptying the cash drawers. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona-Garcia began struggling with the woman robber and a gun went off, 
hitting him in the left side of the neck, Hoos said. Hoos said it is believed 
the gun was Corona-Garcia's, but police would not confirm that. The robbers 
then fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Williams, a spokesman at Intercept Private Security, said Corona-Garcia 
had worked at the security firm for about one year in a variety of assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials said the branch bank will be closed today.

MARKET WEATHERS THE YEARS; OPEN-AIR STALLS STILL THRIVING AFTER SIX DECADES IN 
L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The strangest sights in Los Angeles have been served up for six decades over 
at Blanche Magee's lunch counter. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the day the world's only combination drive-in, walk-in movie theater 
opened next door. The day motorists started pumping their own at the country's 
first self-service gas station out back. The time they built a swimming pool 
for Esther Williams and then drained it after one swim. The weekend that 500 
USC Trojan busts were molded out of vanilla ice cream as wedding favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee's lunch counter is in the middle of Farmers Market, the plain-wrapped 
Los Angeles landmark that has survived the Depression, recessions and 
redevelopment schemes and today will mark its 60th anniversary in ceremonies at 
3rd Street and Fairfax Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanche Magee was there the first morning in 1934 when 17 egg ranchers, fruit 
growers and produce farmers from the San Fernando Valley parked their beat-up 
trucks at the corner and began hawking their wares. She sat on a wood box and 
carved a ham to feed the hungry growers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 96 and living in Claremont, she plans to return for today's 11 a.m. 
commemoration beneath Farmers Market's famed clock tower. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she'll stop by Magee's lunch counter -- the last of the original 
Farmers Market tenants -- to check on the turkey sandwiches and on the fresh 
peanut butter that daughter-in-law Phyllis Magee still churns out each day from 
a 1903 peanut grinding machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Market's first year was a nightmare, according to Blanche Magee, who 
remembers winter rains turning the dirt field into a quagmire that almost 
buried the farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I begged the tenants to stay one more year because the sun 
would shine again," according to Magee. "They did."  
</P>
<P>
 The Magees brought the first electricity into the market so they could 
refrigerate their homemade products and built the first restrooms so shoppers 
did not have to traipse down the street to use a gas station's toilets. Magee 
remembers battling with market operators to replace orange-crate seating with 
diners' tables and chairs. Market co-founder Roger Dahlhjelm was worried the 
changes would ruin the original idea of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlhjelm had been a down-on-his-luck former Stanley Steamer car salesman when 
he teamed up with a friend, advertising writer Fred Beck, to propose a village 
marketplace where families and craftsmen could rent stalls and sell their 
wares. 
</P>
<P>
 Landowner Earl B. Gilmore refined their idea, persuading them to set up a 
place where Depression-plagued Valley farmers could sell their goods to city 
dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The market was not all that Gilmore installed on his property, which had 
earlier been enriched when oil was discovered during drilling for a water well. 
In 1934 he also built an 18,000-seat sports stadium for auto racing, Esther 
Williams' one-time water ballet and games by the Bulldogs, Los Angeles' first 
professional football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge Pan-Pacific Auditorium opened in 1935. A ballpark for the city's 
first baseball team, the Hollywood Stars, sprang up next to the market in 1938. 
The self-serve station (with a nickel-per-gallon discount for pumping your own) 
opened in the 1940s. The walk-in, drive-in opened in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those places survived. But Farmers Market has thrived: These days it 
draws about 10,000 shoppers (60% of them are tourists) each weekday. And loyal 
supporters have balked at ideas to modernize it -- including a $300-million 
redevelopment plan proposed in the late 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 Any future construction will "build on the character" of the market, Hank 
Hilty, a grandson of Gilmore and current president of the A.F. Gilmore Co., 
promised Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A new master plan for the 31-acre site has been approved by city officials 
that keeps the funky, open-air market as a permanent centerpiece. "We won't be 
reducing or removing that at all," pledged Hilty, a Van Nuys resident. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news to old-timers and first-time visitors alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "A modern concept wouldn't fit here," said Ted Smith, who started as a busboy 
at the market's Dupar's Restaurant in 1941 and today manages a staff that 
serves an average of 1,750 hot cakes every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my home," said Barbara Williams, who has run a tie shop and men's 
store there for 39 years. Her customers have included Ronald Reagan and Dwight 
D. Eisenhower. Ike even held her hand while he told her a story about neckties 
and West Point.  
</P>
<P>
 Over on the south side of the market, where informal groups of writers, 
homemakers and others meet daily for breakfast, frequent visitor E.F. McGlone 
was finishing his corned beef sandwich. He and wife, Edna, had driven in from 
Studio City. "I've been coming here 40 years. I like this place the way it is," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Magee's lunch counter, near the Farmers Market wishing well where over 
$325,000 in tossed-in change has been collected for charity since 1949, a 
busload of tourists was deciding on lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitor Jean Lamb of Glasgow, Scotland, bought $32 worth of sandwiches and 
drinks for her family from Phyllis Magee. "When the tour guide said we were 
coming here, we thought we were going to a farm. I'm glad we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Magee laughed at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get wet, we get cold. But I don't think any of us would change it here," 
she said.

FUNDS FOR PASADENA BLUE LINE APPROVED; TRANSIT: MTA BOARD OKS $123 MILLION FOR 
THE RAIL SYSTEM AS PART OF $2.9-BILLION BUDGET. MEANWHILE, NEGOTIATIONS 
CONTINUE TO AVERT A STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a hotly debated meeting marked by a raucous public demonstration, the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority adopted a $2.9-billion budget Wednesday 
that includes spending $123 million for projects on the Pasadena Blue Line 
light rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority's approval of a 1994-95 fiscal budget was unanimous. But a 
separate action to spend additional monies for the Pasadena project provoked 
heated discussion and was passed despite the vigorous objections of about two 
dozen protesters and the authority's chief executive officer, Franklin E. 
White. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters argued that the agency's action, in effect, sacrifices monies that 
might be spent on bus operations instead of rail systems, which they contend 
are primarily used by more affluent residents. Several protesters who refused 
to stop speaking were removed by MTA police. 
</P>
<P>
 White argued that the MTA should steer a more conservative spending course. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Mayor Richard Riordan and other top officials met privately with 
union leaders in an attempt to avert a transit strike Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we made some progress," Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the MTA 
board, said after the nearly two-hour meeting in his office. But, he added, 
"I'm sure it's going to go right down to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the agency cut bus service and raised fares in an effort to erase a 
$126-million budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a private session Wednesday, the MTA board authorized one week of severance 
pay for the 61 employees who were laid off last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations were scheduled to resume today between the transit agency and 
unions representing 6,400 bus and train operators, mechanics and clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 However, proponents of the Pasadena rail line, which has been slowed by 
cutbacks, argued that a new infusion of money was needed to keep the project on 
track and is in line with the wishes of a majority of county residents who have 
voted in favor of expanding the light rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a commitment that had to be made or the line would have been 
stopped," said Pasadena Mayor Kathryn (Katie) Nack. "Not to have approved it 
would have been a real slap in the face to taxpayers who voted for light rail." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena project had been allocated $62.2 million in the proposed 1994-95 
budget. The additional monies will come from three sources: 
</P>
<P>
 * $32.8 million from reserves created from HOV (high occupancy vehicle) 
projects completed under budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * $18 million from a fund used for message signs, sensors and other traffic 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * $10 million in capital funds. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he had no objection to the latter two funding sources. But he 
strongly opposed depleting the HOV reserve and said the agency could regret its 
action in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization is broke and has been broke for the last three years," he 
told MTA directors. "This is not a cash management issue. If money from the HOV 
fund is taken, from where will it be replaced? Last year should have taught us 
that we have to get back to a sensible policy, which is don't spend money we 
don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 The motion to use the HOV reserves, proposed by Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 
passed on an 8-2 vote. One board member absented. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said additional spending for the Pasadena line would not jeopardize 
MTA finances and does not come at the expense of bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are funds that been specifically designated for rail projects by the 
voters; the money could not be used on anything else," Antonovich said. "People 
can try to create controversy and can try and demagogue over this issue . . . 
but in fact it is not an issue."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: YORBA LINDA; NO-SMOKING AREA AT RESTAURANTS 
EXPANDED

 The city's smoking ordinance was amended Tuesday to increase the seating area 
restaurant owners must set aside for nonsmoking customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Aug. 18, restaurants must have a nonsmoking area that takes up at 
least 70% of the business' seating capacity.Currently, the ordinance calls for 
33% of the restaurant to be reserved for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's action was the latest salvo in a months-long battle over a proposed 
ban on smoking in public places. Councilman John M. Gullixson introduced the 
amendment last month in response to an earlier amendment proposed by Councilman 
Henry W. Wedaa that would have eliminated smoking completely from restaurants, 
places of employment and other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Most restaurants in the city already set aside 70% for nonsmokers, Gullixson 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need a law (restricting smoking) because the public has 
already forced business owners to do that on their own," Gullixson said. "I 
introduced the 70% (ordinance) as an attempt to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses covered by the city's smoking ordinance were not affected by 
the amendment. An advisory measure asking residents if the city should ban 
smoking in all public places including restaurants is scheduled to be on the 
November ballot. The City Council will reconsider whether to keep the advisory 
measure on the ballot at its Aug. 2 meeting. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: SANTA ANA; FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE! MOBILE PLANETARIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 It may have been midday, but Hahn Le, 10, glimpsed the night sky in striking 
clarity on Wednesday. He was inside a special, mobile planetarium that will 
soon be visiting classrooms countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 During her 20-minute visit inside the giant tent-like dome, she gasped as 
constellations swirled above her and comets streaked across the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like you're on the moon and seeing everything in space," Hahn said 
after the show. "It was fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn was one of about two-dozen fifth-grade students at Monte Vista Elementary 
School Wednesday who crawled into the inflatable, portable planetarium known as 
"Starlab." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a program sponsored by the Discovery Science Center, the 
12-foot-tall dome will offer students throughout the Santa Ana Unified School 
District an opportunity to learn about the heavens in a dynamic way. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is being funded with a $64,000 grant from the Toyota USA 
Foundation. Schools outside the district may use the planetarium for a fee of 
$3.50 per student, said Karen Johnson, spokeswoman for the Science Center. 
</P>
<P>
 During the show on Wednesday, students crawled through a short tunnel into the 
main viewing room of the planetarium. Huddled in darkness, they peered upward, 
waiting for stars to appear. Moments later, entire constellations swirled and 
danced before their eyes and the children gasped in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoa, this is so cool!" someone exclaimed in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Chester, an Air Force Auxiliary education officer, guided the children on 
a tour of the heavens, which began with conditions that simulated local 
nighttime skies. She showed how light pollution from cities interferes with our 
view by keeping a dim bulb turned on; it obscured all but the brightest stars 
and the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she turned it off to simulate conditions found in the mountains away 
from cities, and 4,000 stars of the night sky burst into view.JON NALICK

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH HILLS; $25,000 
OFFERED IN DEATH OF WOMAN HIT IN CROSS-FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council posted a $25,000 reward Tuesday for tips leading 
to the arrest and conviction of whoever killed a woman caught in a June 11 
cross-fire in North Hills involving a drug dealer.  
</P>
<P>
 Renee Milagros Hurtado, 21, was outside a liquor store when two stray bullets 
hit her.They just missed her daughter, who was in her mother's arms.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this reward will stop a killer from killing again," said 
Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who are looking for a neighborhood drug dealer known as "Little Man," 
asked for a reward because they believe he might flee the area.  
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, the assailant began firing at a man hiding behind 
a car that Hurtado and her sister-in-law had taken to the store. Hurtado, who 
was hit in the chest, died minutes later.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ELEPHANT 
RETURNED TO NEW $1.2-MILLION BARN AT ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy, an 11-year-old Asian bull elephant, came home to the Los Angeles Zoo on 
Wednesday after a few months hiatus, then strolled around his state-of-the-art 
quarters in the $1.2-million pachyderm barn.  
</P>
<P>
 Billy was moved to a Riverside County boarding facility Sept. 1 during 
construction of the barn because it would have been unsafe for workers to be 
near the animal, zoo Director Mark Goldstein said.Billy arrived at the Griffith 
Park zoo about 7 a.m., was met by Annie, a 24-year-old Asian elephant, and 
followed her into the barn, Goldstein said.  
</P>
<P>
 The barn was upgraded to improve care for the animals and make it safer for 
elephant keepers, officials said. It has individual stalls for the mammals, and 
remote-controlled mechanical doors and video cameras so that keepers can put 
the animals to bed at night without entering the barn, according to zoo 
officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The improvements also include protective bars, behind which animal handlers 
and veterinarians can work while trimming an elephant's hoofs or drawing blood. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring's announcement that Billy, a brown, 10-foot-high pachyderm, would 
be moved to a Perris Valley facility a few months later prompted immediate 
controversy.  
</P>
<P>
 It came about a year after an elephant named Hannibal died at the Los Angeles 
Zoo as his keepers were trying to transfer him to a zoo in Mexico. The 
elephant, tranquilized before being loaded into a truck, collapsed and died. 
Zoo officials came under condemnation from animal rights groups and others.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think watching Billy come back, and watching how the staff worked and how 
the (renovated) barn (has) worked . . . we can stand up and say we responsibly 
care for and manage our elephants," Goldstein said. He said another female 
elephant will be brought to the zoo in September.

<P>
 A Paramount man who got out of his car to help friends whose vehicle had 
broken down was killed Wednesday in a hit-and-run crash, a Highway Patrol 
officer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Javier Monje, 24, stopped alongside the northbound San Gabriel River Freeway 
near Del Amo Boulevard about 2 a.m., said California Highway Patrol Officer 
Bill Dance.A few minutes later, a maroon or dark red Volkswagen "bug" drifted 
onto the shoulder and hit Monje, Dance said.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Volkswagen continued northbound and was last seen near Rose 
Hills Road. The right headlight of the subcompact car was broken and there was 
damage to the right front, Dance said.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the driver or the whereabouts of the damaged 
Volkswagen is asked to call the Santa Fe Springs CHP office, (310) 868-0503, 
during business hours, or (213) 669-4472 anytime.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RAPE 
SUSPECT SEIZED AFTER WOMAN SEES HIM DRIVE BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspected rapist was arrested Wednesday after the alleged victim saw the man 
drive by as she was being interviewed by police, who chased him down.  
</P>
<P>
 "Officers were talking to the victim when she pointed to a passing car and 
said, 'That's the guy,' " said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Robert Courtland of the 
Rampart Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers jumped into their patrol car and chased the blue Datsun 280-Z out 
of the Westlake neighborhood, where the rape allegedly occurred, and onto the 
southbound Hollywood Freeway about 11 a.m., Courtland said. The pursuit 
continued south toward Downtown, then north on the Harbor Freeway toward 
Pasadena, the sergeant said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Datsun exited the freeway near Dodger Stadium and was stopped by officers 
near Figueroa Street and Cypress Avenue, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, whose name was not released, was arrested without incident and 
booked on suspicion of rape, Courtland said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
COUNCIL DELAYS DEBATE ON PAYING DWP PARTY TAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council delayed a debate Wednesday on whether to pay a 
$60,000 tab for meals provided to utility workers during a post-strike party 
after a nine-day walkout last fall.  
</P>
<P>
 By a 6-7 vote, the council refused to override the Department of Water and 
Power board's decision to pay the bill, though many council members previously 
denounced it as an unnecessary expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Governmental Efficiency Committee discussed the matter. The full 
council will take up the issue again in a few days when city Controller Rick 
Tuttle presents the bill.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how this thing is going to be resolved, but I think the council 
is unanimous in feeling that the charges incurred by DWP are out of order," 
Councilman Hal Bernson said. Tuttle said he would not sign the check because he 
regards the expense as "a gift of public funds."  
</P>
<P>
 The city's attorneys are expected to argue that the city is liable, especially 
because the caterer, Marriott Corp., sued and agreed to settle for 20% less 
than the original $75,000 bill.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, a longtime critic of the DWP, said he still expects a 
majority of his colleagues to vote against payment. He dubbed the entire affair 
"Muffingate."  
</P>
<P>
 Since fall, DWP officials have defended offering the free meals as a means of 
making peace between employees who walked out and those who crossed picket 
lines.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
LAPD TO HOLD EXPOSITION IN BID TO RECRUIT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department -- trying hard to recruit women -- will hold 
a community exposition Saturday at San Fernando High School.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Los Angeles City Council wants 43% of the city's police 
officers to be women, and just under 56% to be men, to match the gender mix of 
the city work force as a whole.Women will fill about 400 of the 900 slots for 
cadets at the Police Academy next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a goal to meet of 43.4% women on the Los Angeles Police Department," 
Officer Leticia Dotson said. "Today, we have approximately 15%. This is a very 
exciting time because we are changing the face of the (LAPD)."  
</P>
<P>
 Recruiters hope to attract applicants from female-dominated professions, such 
as teaching and social work. Previously, the LAPD relied on gimmicks, such as 
cosmetics giveaways and celebrity appearances at women's career fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the LAPD's recruitment strategies focused on military bases, 
sporting venues and male-dominated workplaces, such as security firms.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: IRVINE; FAMILY SEEKING 
DELAY ON RAZING OF HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge on Wednesday agreed to rule next month on a request by 
the Ganish family to delay the planned demolition of their castle-like home 
until a court decides whether Irvine's public-nuisance laws are constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes a week after the City Council declared the Kron Street home a 
public nuisance. The council said that exposed wires and debris inside the 
unfinished structure make it a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The council gave Fern and Haym Ganish until October to meet city codes or the 
city would tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ganishes' attorney, Robert Sainburg, contends that the city's nuisance 
law is "unconstitutionally vague and over-broad." 
</P>
<P>
 Sainburg said he will ask Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock at an Aug. 
18 hearing to temporarily halt the demolition proceedings until the court rules 
on the constitutionality of the laws. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city's nuisance rules are struck down, the city might eventually be 
forced to write new laws, Sainburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Attorney Patrick Munoz said Wednesday he is "confident that the 
judge will rule in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes began transforming their ranch-style home into a two-story 
mansion with rock facade more than 12 years ago. The remodeling work is still 
not completed. The Ganishes continue to live in the home even though the 
interior lacks drywall, ceiling materials, plumbing and proper electrical 
wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 City code inspectors and county fire officials said the exposed wires could 
spark a blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has pressed the Ganishes for years to complete construction. Fern 
Ganish said work has been stalled in part because of her husband's poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 Sainburg said the Ganishes are willing to discuss the issues with city 
officials. He objected to the city's demand that any visits to the home by 
building inspectors be videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to make a circus out of this with videotape," Sainburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz said the city wants the video recording so that "we have an absolutely 
accurate record of what occurred." SHELBY GRAD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; LAPD OFFICER 
DETAINED AFTER GUN INCIDENT IN BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer was detained but not arrested by Burbank 
authorities after a bar manager alleged that he placed a gun on the counter and 
threatened to shoot anyone who tried to make him put it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources identified the officer as Peter Ceinion Jones, a 14-year veteran of 
the department who works as a mounted patrol officer with the Metropolitan 
Division. Jones, 38, was not at work Wednesday and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was taken to Burbank police headquarters shortly after 8 p.m. 
Tuesday but was not booked. He was later turned over to the LAPD, which is 
conducting an internal investigation into the officer's conduct, authorities 
said. Neither department would identify the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank police said the criminal investigation was continuing into the 
incident and that city prosecutors will determine if Jones will face 
misdemeanor charges. "Based on what I've heard about the case, I think it would 
be appropriate to file criminal charges," Lt. Bob Giles, the night watch 
commander in Burbank, said Wednesday. Los Angeles police spokesman Lt. John 
Dunkin said the LAPD is conducting its own internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has been suspended twice without pay in the past two years, according to 
police records. He was suspended for five days this year for having 
"inappropriately touched" a female police officer at her home, according to 
department documents and interviews with police officials. Jones acknowledged 
having a drinking problem and admitted himself to an alcohol treatment 
facility, according to police records of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second case, Jones was suspended for two days for neglect of duty for a 
November, 1991, incident in which he failed to conduct a proper weapons search 
of a suspect, which led to an officer-involved shooting, a police panel ruled.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Tuesday incident, a bartender who claimed to have witnessed Jones' 
actions said he had only served him two beers and that he did not appear to be 
drunk. The bartender, Lou Rinker, said that after the man placed a gun on the 
bar, he made threatening remarks to him and to a female bar patron. "I asked 
him to put it away. And he said he didn't have to," Rinker said. "He said if I 
tried to take it away from him he'd blow my head off with it. . . . And he 
threatened to beat up and shoot one of my customers, a lady."

VENICE CITIZENS URGED TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA BIRCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community activist Alex Cota says it is time for Venice residents to fight 
back against the "cowardly termites" who he says have taken over the Oakwood 
neighborhood and stripped law-abiding people of their civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atrocities committed by gangs are violations of our civil rights, the right 
to walk and talk freely in our streets," said Cota, president of the 
Eastside/Westside Concerned Citizen's Committee, a grass-roots group that 
raises funds for youth organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's belief that violence in Oakwood has diminished the quality of 
life there will be discussed at a public meeting at 7 tonight at the Oakwood 
Recreation Center, 767 California Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Cruz Reynoso, a former California Supreme Court associate 
justice and current vice chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, is 
scheduled to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynoso said he hopes the community forum will motivate residents to work 
together for solutions. It is unfair, Reynoso said in an interview, when people 
"can't enjoy the Constitutional freedoms we have; the right to free speech and 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting comes in response to fighting between black and Latino gangs in 
Oakwood that in 10 months has killed at least 17 people and injured 55, many of 
whom were bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you feel like going to the market, you shouldn't have to worry about 
someone gunning you down in the street," Cota said. "We don't want to surrender 
to the gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 To advertise the meeting, Cota distributed hundreds of flyers with photos of 
grieving Latina and African-American women and images of Abraham Lincoln, 
Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez. "We must follow their example and 
continue their work to strengthen freedom," the message read. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would be appalled at the dirty race war being conducted in the 
Venice-Oakwood area." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related move, representatives from the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development are expected to meet privately this morning with the owner of 
the Holiday Venice apartment complex in Oakwood and with LAPD officers to 
discuss security complaints. During the 1970s, the city approved construction 
of the complex, which consists of 15 HUD-subsidized apartment buildings. DONNA

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER: YOUTH BACKER PULLED 
STRINGS FOR ORCHESTRA

 Sue Bozman says she's jazzed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I'm lucky enough to have people paying me to lobby for music, 
art and education, when I would do that as a volunteer," says the director of 
public information for College of the Canyons.  
</P>
<P>
 Bozman, who has been at the college since 1988, says she sees herself 
primarily as an "advocate for students." She is also credited as being the 
driving force behind keeping the Santa Clarita Valley Youth Orchestra alive and 
helping it move in 1990 from the nearby California Institute of the Arts to its 
present location at COC. 
</P>
<P>
 Having moved to the Southland from Massachusetts in 1983, Bozman says she and 
her husband picked the area specifically because they wanted to move to an area 
that had a youth orchestra for her two young boys. Santa Clarita's youth 
orchestra began in 1961 at the L. A. Conservatory of Music as a program for 
gifted high school musicians. In 1969, the conservatory was merged into the 
music department at the California Institute of the Arts by Cesare Pascarella, 
the late original music director and conductor of the youth orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozman and her husband, David, first got involved in 1985 when CalArts planned 
on ending the orchestra program because of budget problems. At the time, their 
son Alex played cello in the orchestra. "One day Alex came home from his music 
lessons," Bozman says, "looking heartbroken and said: 'Mom, they just told us 
there's no more money to keep the orchestra going. We can't let it die. Please 
do something to help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bozman called CalArts, a stone's throw from COC, and worked out an agreement 
to stave off the orchestra's impending closure. Then she and her husband began 
pulling together the funding effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like Betty Castleberry, the foundation's first president, really 
helped," Bozman says. "No pun intended, but she was instrumental in getting a 
music program into the Newhall school district, and she wrote our first grant." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardo Feldman, COC's music department director and foundation vice 
president, says Bozman is underplaying her own contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working with people as unselfish as Sue and her husband . . . makes you work 
harder just to keep up," Feldman says. "If I had a hat, I'd take it off to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bozmans founded the Santa Clarita Valley Youth Orchestra Foundation, a 
nonprofit, volunteer group made up of parents, teachers, business people and 
artists from Santa Clarita, Valencia and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has used everything from bake sales, wine tastings, concerts 
and grants to raise approximately $90,000 over the years. The money has been 
used to pay the salary for one of the orchestra's two conductors, buy and 
repair instruments loaned to students and since 1990 to help finance the 
college credit training for an average of 75 aspiring classical musicians a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra, which has also sparked the creation of an adult orchestra, is 
now part of COC's regular curriculum. College of the Canyons pays the other 
conductor salary. Playing in the youth orchestra is open to students of all 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bozman, who now wants to establish scholarships specifically designed to bring 
minority students into the orchestra, says her most satisfying moment with the 
orchestra came at its June fund-raising concert at the Lancaster Performing 
Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting in the audience, and there was our orchestra dressed in formal 
black attire, under professional lighting with a professional actress (Tippi 
Hedren) narrating on stage," she says. "I felt so proud, my heart almost burst. 
It was then I really saw we had created something very special, something which 
now has a life of its own and will be here for a long, long time to come."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: GARDEN GROVE; CLERK IS ACCUSED IN LIBRARY THEFTS 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A county library clerk in Garden Grove was arrested after he allegedly stole 
more than $25,000 worth of library books, videotapes, compact discs and 
cassettes over two years, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, Martin F. Meza, 28, of Stanton, was booked on suspicion of grand 
theft Friday after authorities who searched his home and a rented storage 
locker found more than 500 videotapes, 358 books and 152 CDs representing pop 
artists from Garth Brooks to Sade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the gamut. He had a variety of music and a variety of videos from all 
the genres," said Orange County Sheriff's Department investigator Julie Kearns. 
"We're talking about popular artists here. We're not talking about educational 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the works had been missing from various county libraries since late 
1992, Kearns said. Meza, who worked checking out books at the main branch in 
Garden Grove, handled materials that are shared among libraries throughout the 
27-branch system, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meza denied the charges.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really have anything to say," he said when reached at his home. "I 
wasn't going to steal it. I was just keeping it here." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were told by library employees that Meza allegedly had taken 
material home without checking it out. He agreed to a search of his Stanton 
apartment last week, Kearns said, and investigators found books, videos, CDs 
and cassettes stripped of library tags and bar codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also arranged a search of a rented storage locker in Iola, Kan., 
where Meza had planned to join his wife last year after moving her and 
belongings, Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 200 books and more than 400 videos were found in the locker, she said. 
In all, the property amounted to well over $25,000 and included mostly pop 
fare, including the videos "Home Alone," "Last of the Mohicans" and "Dances 
With Wolves," Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meza, a four-year employee of the library, told investigators that he 
originally planned to return the materials but lost track of time, Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Librarian John Adams said Wednesday that library employees are 
required to check out books just as everyone else is. The arrest of an employee 
has "not occurred since I've been here," said Adams, who has been on the job 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meza, who was released from custody on his own recognizance, is scheduled to 
be arraigned Aug. 15. Kearns said he was placed on administrative leave as his 
case proceeds. KEN ELLINGWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: BREA; COUNCIL APPROVES HIKE IN WATER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water bills will go up an average of $4 per month under an annual rate 
adjustment approved by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary reason for the increase is the continuing rise in water prices 
charged to cities by the Municipal Water District of Orange County.Since 1991, 
district prices have risen 58%. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Kathryn E. Wiser said the city is "being held hostage" by the 
district. The city needs to do more to keep water costs down, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Frank Benest countered that the city has mounted a "very 
aggressive effort" to find alternative water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 One step it has taken is purchasing more of its water from Cal Domestic Water 
Co., which charges lower rates than the district. To obtain the cheaper water, 
the city has been buying Cal Domestic stock, along with lease rights to 
additional Cal Domestic water. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also uses well water for some irrigation purposes. Attempts were made 
to establish additional wells in nearby Craig Regional Park and the downtown 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's water there, but we can't get it at a lower cost," Mayor Glenn G. 
Parker said. The bottom line, he said, is that water rates for residential and 
commercial customers must be raised to cover the city's costs. "I don't see a 
way of getting around it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Burnie Dunlap said "it would be irresponsible if we didn't cover 
our expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice," he said. "We either buy water or go dry." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase took effect Wednesday. The average water bill will be $30. ALAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTH: FULLERTON; CITY COMPROMISES, OKS BIKE LANE PAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved construction of a paved bicycle lane on Valencia 
Mesa Drive, a compromise decision welcomed by both critics and supporters of 
the bike lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 3-1 vote Tuesday night authorized paving of a dirt path adjacent 
to Valencia Mesa currently used by bicyclists and the narrowing of the street 
itself to allow more bicycle traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, and council members Molly McClanahan and Chris Norby 
supported the compromise. Councilwoman Julie Sa voted against the bike lane, 
saying she wanted to postpone a decision until residents and city officials 
could get together to hammer out an alternative proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don Bankhead abstained, saying he owned property in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had originally proposed a striped bike lane on which automobile 
parking would have been prohibited. But cars will be allowed to park on the 
bike lane approved Tuesday night, which will be designated by a white stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists, city transportation commissioners, the League of Women Voters of 
North Orange County, the American Assn. of University Women, business people 
and parents had endorsed the city's original plan, saying it would have 
provided a safe route for youths and adults to ride their bicycles.  
</P>
<P>
 After the decision, however, many supporters said the council's action was 
better than no bike lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Mesa property owners, many of whom had initially fought against a 
paved bike lane, also applauded the council's action. They had argued that a 
bicycle lane would cater to a special interest group, ignoring the horse-back 
riders, pedestrians, runners, skaters and other people who use the existing 
unmarked lane on their street. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the approved bike lane is better than one separated from the street, 
which would not accommodate parked cars. MIMI KO

 An earthquake shook North County at 3:28 p.m. Wednesday, but with a magnitude

 Brea police said no damage was reported, and the department received only

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COSTA MESA / NEWPORT / IRVINE: NEWPORT BEACH; COYOTE 
ALERT ISSUED FOR UPPER BAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department has issued a rare coyote advisory this week warning 
residents living near the Upper Newport Bay that the predatory animals are 
becoming increasingly brazen.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Sgt. Andy Gonis said that a coyote approached to within several 
feet of a child recently not far from the bay and scampered away only when an 
adult appeared.There have also been two reported coyote attacks on dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a concern right now because of four coyotes that are very brazen," 
Gonis said. "It may be because they are being displaced with development and 
(as a consequence) they are running across people more regularly." 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory suggests that residents watch children and pets, especially in 
the early morning and early evening hours. Also, pet owners should feed their 
animals indoors and not leave food outside, which can attract hungry coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 For people who might confront a coyote walking along Back Bay Drive, police 
suggest that pedestrians "let it know it is not welcome. Yell, throw rocks and 
create a disturbance to discourage the animal." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Police Department's animal control officers are 
attempting to trap some or all of the fearless coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said officers would kill a coyote if it threatens people.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: BUENA PARK; VOTE TO CUT PLANNING PANEL IS 
POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has postponed consideration of a plan to reduce the Planning 
Commission from seven to five members. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had decided to reduce the commission last month, when four 
seats came up for renewal.Commissioner Brenda Miller said she was stepping 
down, but the other three commissioners wanted to keep their posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than dismissing the sixth person to create a five-member panel, council 
members had considered creating an alternate position. They eventually 
discarded the idea as being too cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's Council meeting, Mayor Donald L. Bone stopped the vote that would 
have established a five-member commission and asked his colleagues to again 
consider adding an alternate slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, I was the one who came to the council with the idea of an 
alternate," he said. "Frankly, I didn't do a good job of presenting the issue 
at that time, and I didn't do a good job of fighting for what I believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 The council renewed the two-year terms of commissioners Larry Wieck and Robert 
Niccum (Commissioner Jack Mauller's reappointment is still pending) but 
postponed voting on the ordinance that would restructure the commission until 
after the July 25 study session. 
</P>
<P>
 That law will have to be drafted again if the alternate slot is added, city 
attorney James L. Markman said. The council will have to consider the 
parameters of an alternate's job and whether that position will have voting 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 The council acquiesced to Bone's request, but Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune 
noted that they originally considered the alternate "because it would be so 
hard to let someone go, not because of what's best for the community."LESLEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: MISSION VIEJO; PANEL SEEKS 
STUDY ON SWAP MEET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback College and the Mission Viejo Mall are confronting each other over 
plans for an outdoor swap meet on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission this week asked the company that is proposing the 
Saddleback Outdoor Marketplace to develop an economic study with city staff 
that would address the major concern of mall officials: whether the swap meet 
would take sales away from city merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be competition for revenue," Commissioner Sherri Butterfield 
said. "If that should result in substantial sales tax drain, it could be a 
problem. A report of this kind would show us if that is true." 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor market would operate 50 weekends a year, selling a combination of 
new and used merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Other community colleges in Orange County run profitable swap meets. Orange 
Coast College in Costa Mesa has operated one successfully for several years, 
even though the huge Orange County Marketplace on the Orange County Fairgrounds 
takes place on the same days across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the proposed swap meet might require an amendment to the city's 
general plan. Under the plan, which maps out how the city is developed, the 
Saddleback College campus is considered a community facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Although occasional art sales are held there, a continuing commercial venture 
might require changing the general plan, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters rallied by both the college and mall officials spoke on the 
proposed swap meet at Monday's Planning Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor market organizers will return to the commission on Aug. 15 to detail 
issues to be discussed in the economic report. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: KISSINGER SPEAKS AT NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who helped end America's involvement in the Vietnam War autographed 
his new book for Yorba Linda resident Ted Wells on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a genius," said Wells, 38, a real estate broker, clutching two 
signed copies of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's $35 book. "This 
is a major event and I wouldn't have missed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells was among hundreds of people who stood in line at the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace waiting for Kissinger to scrawl his signature on copies of 
"Diplomacy," his new 835-page opus. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the Nobel Peace Prize winner spoke to about 300 people in the library 
auditorium, where he paid tribute to former President Richard Nixon and 
castigated what he views as the media-driven Clinton Administration for its 
"wishy-washy" foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first return to Yorba Linda since eulogizing Nixon in April, Kissinger 
again praised the late President's skill and foresight in conducting U.S. 
foreign policy, even in the face of unprecedented "concentrated hostility" at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I was here was at the funeral of Richard Nixon," Kissinger 
said. "It was a sad and moving and inspiring event. It brought together 
Americans like nothing else that I can remember in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even he would have been astonished at the outpouring of affection and 
unifying impact his death had on America," he said. "He was a patriot." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Clinton Administration, the Nixon presidency was marked by clearly 
defined foreign policy objectives, said Kissinger, who served as national 
security adviser and secretary of state under Nixon. Clinton's use of military 
force in Somalia was a mistake, especially in view of a U.S. withdrawal from 
the African nation after 18 casualties, Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we commit U.S. forces, we have to know the outcome we want and we have 
to be able to define the national interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Kissinger said, dispatching U.S. soldiers to Haiti, as Clinton has 
threatened to do in past weeks, would be equally unwise. "I do not favor a 
military invasion because I can't describe the threat Haiti presents to the 
United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger said the Clinton Administration must also develop a strategy for 
dealing with the post-Cold War world, which the President Clinton has failed to 
do thus far. Clinton must pay special attention to fostering good relations 
with the Russia on the one hand, but also insuring ensure the superpower 
doesn't resume its 400-year policy of imperialism. , said Kissinger. Also, said 
Kissinger, Clinton must work to prevent nuclear proliferation in Asia, 
particularly by North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the difficulty in fashioning a coherent U.S. foreign policy, 
Kissinger said, is the enormous detrimental impact of television. He blamed TV 
for eroding the national intellect, especially among the young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our generation, Richard Nixon's generation, grew up on books," he said. "We 
could form concepts. The television generation is brought up on pictures and 
they react to sentiment and emotion and therefore it becomes very difficult to 
develop a long-range (foreign) policy." 
</P>
<P>
 After his address, a smiling Kissinger signed hundreds of books for those who 
purchased the tomes in the Nixon library store. Wednesday's sales of the 
bestseller, which contrasts the foreign policies of the United States during 
World War I and 17th-Century European powers, goes toward supporting the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, visitors who eagerly awaited Kissinger's signature in their new 
books agreed with his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a brilliant speaker," said Jim Fish, a 60-year-old film producer from 
Corona del Mar. "I'm just excited to be here to listen to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even younger people, who took a knock for their television viewing habits, 
applauded Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact he was talking about our generation watching too much TV," 
said 16-year-old Kyle Vaughn of Modesto. "We aren't able to conceptualize 
things. That's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "He sees the whole (global) picture," Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone hailed Kissinger's appearance. Outside the library grounds, John 
Eisloeffel, a government teacher at Irvine High School, conducted a lone 
peaceful protest. Eisloeffel criticized what he said was Kissinger's role in 
launching secret bombings in Cambodia and undermining a democratically elected 
government in Chile nearly two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the high school teacher said he plans to read Kissinger's book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably buy it, but I'll wait for the paperback. It's cheaper." MARTIN 
MILLER

POST-QUAKE INSURANCE CANCELLATIONS PROBED; CONSUMERS: STATE IS CHECKING WHETHER 
20TH CENTURY ILLEGALLY TERMINATED HOMEOWNER POLICIES. SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN 
UNABLE TO GET NEW COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State insurance officials are investigating whether earthquake-battered 20th 
Century Insurance Co. is illegally canceling homeowners policies, leaving some 
customers unable to obtain replacement insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said Wednesday that Woodland Hills-based 
20th Century has canceled an unknown number of its 240,000 homeowner policies, 
some only days after agreeing last month to renew them for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement sent shock waves through the California insurance market, 
causing many other companies to limit the number of new homeowner policies they 
issue -- or stop selling them altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 That ripple effect is leaving homeowners whose 20th Century policies are being 
canceled stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very much aware that the insurance industry in many different ways is 
attempting to reduce its quake exposure," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those mechanisms are legal, others are not," he said. "The ones that 
are not we will stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is headed by Nettie Hoge, the Insurance Department's chief 
of consumer services.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to very carefully scrutinize whether they (20th Century) are 
circumventing either the order or the intent of the order," said Hoge, a lawyer 
who previously worked for Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge said the Insurance Department has received about 10 formal complaints 
from 20th Century customers who have lost their homeowner coverage since the 
Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But others believe the problem is more widespread.  
</P>
<P>
 "About 10% of our 350 members have had their homeowner policies canceled and 
several others have been told they might be carried to their next renewal date, 
but then not renewed," said George Kehrer, executive director of CARe, a 
Northridge-based consumer group formed after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on what has happened to his members, Kehrer said, there may be several 
thousand more 20th Century policies being canceled or not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're playing games with people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for 20th Century said the company has not kept tabs on the number 
of homeowner policies it has canceled since the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said the company's reasons for canceling policies are 
confidential between the insurer and its policyholders. The state's 
ninth-largest insurer, 20th Century announced in June that it would withdraw 
from the California homeowner market, citing $600 million in quake-related 
claims that wiped out two-thirds of its cushion against future losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 200 outraged 20th Century policyholders met Wednesday night 
at the First Presbyterian Church in Granada Hills to demand action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired of being taken advantage of," said Michael Ramirez-Mares of 
Granada Hills, president of 20th Century Policyholders Quake Action Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's order calls for the company to phase out its quake policies over 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the impact of the withdrawal on 20th Century customers with 
existing homeowner coverage -- including 90,000 with quake protection -- 
Garamendi ordered the company to offer two more annual renewals. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than a week after agreeing to comply with the order, 20th Century 
launched a drive to cancel homeowner policies for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, some customers' policies were canceled because they had quake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 One cancellation notice obtained by The Times reads: "Your residence sustained 
damage in the recent earthquake(s) and, therefore, does not meet our 
underwriting guidelines. The earthquake damage has caused physical changes in 
the property insured against, which has resulted in the property becoming 
uninsurable." 
</P>
<P>
 That notice is dated June 14, only five days after the Insurance Department 
insisted that 20th Century continue protecting current customers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Garamendi said the company's existing homeowner policyholders 
"should have an average 2 1/2 years to get a new policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Other customers were told their homeowner coverage would be canceled because 
they had too many claims last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcella Contreras of Mission Hills has been without homeowner insurance since 
her 20th Century coverage ceased July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said she had a homeowner policy with the company for eight years 
before her first claim, for $710 of wind damage, last November. Since then, 
20th Century has paid or agreed to pay $30,000 for quake damage and $99,000 to 
a friend of Contreras who was bitten by the family's nervous, 110-pound 
Rottweiler the day after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do we do? We can't get anybody to cover us because we have quake 
damage," she said. "In order to for us to get repairs going, we have to get the 
money from 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said she has only received $5,000 from the company.

DEATHS ON GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY PROBED; ACCIDENTS: STATE LABOR OFFICIAL SAYS 
IMPROPER BOLT REMOVAL MAY HAVE CAUSED A WALL TO COLLAPSE IN ARLETA. TRUCKING 
INCIDENT IS ALSO INVESTIGATED.

<P>
 A construction accident on an Arleta freeway on-ramp that killed one man may 
have been caused by human error when workers broke from their routine and 
removed all of the bolts that held a 5,000-pound, quake-damaged sound wall in 
place, according to a state labor safety official. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction worker Brian Fourte, 24, of Los Angeles was killed Tuesday when 
one section of the sound wall collapsed, possibly because workers removed all 
the bolts that held it in place before attaching clamps from a crane that would 
have supported it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourte was pronounced dead at the scene at the Branford Street on-ramp to the 
southbound Golden State Freeway, said Brian Humphrey, a Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it could have been prevented," said Rick Rice, a spokesman for 
the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will look to see if proper procedures were followed and if the (Rondeau 
Bay Construction Co. of Oakland) had a system in place to prevent this type of 
thing from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Dones, president of Rondeau Bay, said company officials do not know what 
caused the accident and are conducting an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, California Highway Patrol officers are continuing an investigation 
into an accident on the same freeway, about three hours earlier, in which a 
Santa Clarita Valley man was killed by a 30-foot iron pipe that fell on his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Fedorko, 46, was traveling north on the Golden State, near its 
intersection with the Foothill and Antelope Valley freeways, about 4:15 p.m. 
when a load of the pipes, each weighing about a ton, fell from a big-rig truck 
on a ramp above, police said. One of the pipes sheared off the roof of 
Fedorko's car and killed him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 How the pipes, bound to a flatbed trailer by nylon straps, came loose is still 
under investigation, said CHP Officer Wendy Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials said a truck driver is normally responsible for securing his 
load, but they have not yet determined if charges will be sought. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck was owned by Westran Inc., a trucking company with offices in 
Vancouver, Wash. Westran officials declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko lived in the Stevenson Ranch area, just west of the Santa Clarita city 
limits, with his 14-year-old son.

CITYWIDE SEARCH CONTINUES FOR 6-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been three weeks, but Jane Newman believes her daughter is still trying 
to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel in my heart that she's probably looking for me and is going in the 
wrong direction," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman's daughter, Crystal Tymich, has been missing since June 30. Police and 
the FBI are scouring the city to find the 6-year-old. There has been one 
large-scale sweep of the South-Central Los Angeles neighborhood where Crystal 
disappeared, and police may search that area again or bring in a psychic to try 
to find Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is posting a $10,000 reward for her return. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal grew up in South-Central but now splits time between her mother's home 
in Santa Monica and her father's in the Hyde Park district near Inglewood. The 
day she disappeared, she was near her father's home, playing with her three 
brothers, ages 12, 10 and 8, in the 6000 block of Bryhurst Avenue. The brothers 
were riding on bicycles ahead of her, and when they turned around to look back 
about 2 p.m., Crystal was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said neighbors had seen Crystal wandering off other times that day and 
had brought her back to her brothers. She said Crystal had been talking about 
running away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have no solid leads. However, after a television report on 
Crystal's disappearance, police received calls from people who said they 
thought they had seen her in Downey, Santa Fe Springs and Bell Gardens. The 
girl was last seen wearing a pink T-shirt, flowered shorts and white tennis 
shoes with a Little Mermaid design. She is about 4 feet tall with brown hair 
and brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One minute she was playing with her brothers four or five houses away, and 
the next minute she vanished in broad daylight," said Officer Tim McRath, who 
is investigating the case. "We haven't ruled anything out." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are considering using a psychic to help find Crystal, a technique 
sometimes employed in missing person cases. "We're trying for anything now," 
said Officer Robert Castaneda, McRath's partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said Crystal enjoys arcades and might be seen around video games or 
stores. Anyone who sees Crystal is asked to call police at (213) 485-4164, 
(213) 485-4175 or 911. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just praying every day for my daughter," Newman said. "She's a very 
high-spirited girl. She's a fighter."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: BUENA PARK; COUNCIL VOTES 4-1 FOR TERM LIMIT 
INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 1 to put a term limit initiative on the November 
ballot despite opposition from some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is termed an "advisory vote" because cities that are bound by 
general California law do not have the power to enforce term limits on local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don R. Griffin, who voted against the proposal, noted the law is 
not enforceable and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the barometer to measure the will of the electorate regarding term 
limits already exists in the ballot process. "In fact, this very last election, 
the voters elected me to my fifth term," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin also said he shared the anger of some residents who had strongly urged 
the council to draft an initiative on the controversial transfer of the city's 
fire department to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Terry Longacre picked up that theme when he spoke to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be remiss on behalf of a number of people who were appealing to you, 
begging you, to put the issue of the fire department -- an issue of life and 
safety -- on the ballot," he said. "You ignored the wishes of the people to put 
that on the ballot and now you thumb your nose at them and put this issue on." 
</P>
<P>
 But councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune, who voted in favor of the measure, said 
earlier that she feels so strongly about term limits that she will not run for 
a third term this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone said the council will push legislators to change state 
law so local governments can set the term limits. Assemblyman Curt Pringle told 
him several such bills have been introduced but never made it out of committee, 
Bone said. Pringle also said that an advisory vote from a city in support of 
the law might give the assemblyman some leverage to persuade other legislators 
to change the law, Bone added. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: LAGUNA NIGUEL; CROSSING GUARDS 
OKD FOR 2 SCHOOLS 
</P>

 Concerned parents emerged victorious from this week's City Council meeting 
after the council unanimously agreed to spend nearly $30,000 to pay for 
crossing guards at the city's two new elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In approving crossing guards for Hidden Hills and John S. Malcom elementary 
schools, the council overturned the traffic commission's recommendation to 
place only three-way stop signs at the intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crucial to be correct right out of the box," Councilman Thomas W. Wilson 
said. "You can't afford to make a mistake that first year." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Hidden Hills parents who had packed the council chambers Tuesday 
night said the decision boded well for the inaugural school year.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're off to a good start," said Nancy Nimmo, president of the Hidden Hills 
Parent-Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three crossing guards will cost the city $9,400 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-way stop, a crosswalk and a crossing guard will be placed at Hidden 
Hills Road and Sandling Court. The city's traffic engineers estimate that more 
than 200 students may have to cross Hidden Hills to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic studies show that about 5,000 cars travel Hidden Hills Road every day, 
many of them moving at well over the posted speed limit of 35 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 For Malcom Elementary, with 450 students within walking distance, the council 
approved three-way stops, crosswalks and crossing guards where Charles Road 
intersects Ridgeway Avenue, and where it meets Brighton Place. 
</P>
<P>
 The council chose not to place a crossing guard at the intersection of 
Ridgeway and Niguel Road, saying that the traffic signal is sufficient to help 
children cross safely. However, the time of the walk signal will be lengthened 
to give children more time to cross. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COUNCIL 
OVERTURNS PERMIT ON APPEAL

<P>
 The City Council has killed a proposal to build a car wash/gas station and 
retail space downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 A permit for the car wash/gas station on a 1.44-acre site at 27000 Ortega 
Highway was approved in May by the city's Planning Commission.But a resident 
filed an appeal to the council, citing traffic problems and aesthetic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 Tuesday night to uphold the appeal, thus denying the 
permit. Councilman Gil Jones cast the only vote in favor of the project. 
Councilman Jeff Vasquez was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that turning down the development plan, which also called for 
nearly 7,500 square feet of retail space fronting on Del Obispo Street, sends 
the wrong signal to a struggling business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Collene Campbell said a different type of development would be more 
suitable. She pledged that the city would work with the landowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell disagreed with some of the project's opponents who said it would not 
blend with the area, which is close to historical buildings, but dotted with 
fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel has been unoccupied for about four years, according to Thomas 
Tomlinson, the city's director of planning services.JEFFREY BEAN

OWNERS LOSING HOUSE TO HILLSIDE AWARDED $898,000; COURTS: JURY FINDS HOMEOWNERS 
GROUP AND DEVELOPER ARE AT FAULT FOR WATER DAMAGE CAUSED BY CRACKED SPRINKLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Clemente couple whose home is creeping down a hillside was awarded 
$898,000 in damages by an Orange County Superior Court jury that found a 
homeowners association and the developer responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 The case rested on whether a cracked sprinkler line maintained by the Coast 
Homeowners Assn. soaked Daniel and Donna McClintock's property for two years, 
causing the slippage, attorneys for both sides said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had pretty good evidence that the waterline had leaked water," said Robert 
Balmuth, an Irvine-based attorney for the McClintocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association was required to pay $379,000 of the judgment. A 
$200,000 settlement was reached earlier with several other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavilion Homes was found responsible for $319,000 in punitive and actual 
damages for not informing the McClintocks that their house in the Seacliffs 
neighborhood was built on an ancient landslide. However, Balmuth said the firm 
declared bankruptcy last December. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the McClintocks first noticed cracks in their outdoor deck that 
eventually grew more than a foot long. A geotechnical expert later found that 
the house's foundation had tilted, Balmuth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Durst, an attorney for the homeowners association, said the jury was 
confused over who bore the most responsibility for the damages and "they felt 
sympathy" for the McClintocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach lawyer, who maintained during the weeklong trial that the 
sprinkler lines were not leaking, said his client is considering appealing the 
judgment reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Balmuth said the property needs more than $500,000 in repairs to stabilize the 
ground, adding that the McClintocks must wait until they receive damage payment 
before starting the work.

 Three Orange County residents were among six people indicted Wednesday on 
charges of wire fraud after allegedly defrauding foreign and domestic airlines 
of nearly $800,000 through bogus ticket sales, authorities in Los Angeles said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. David F. Taylor said the six men are accused of paying 
the owner of Atlas International Travel in Garden Grove $60,000 for more than 
8,000 blank airline boarding passes and access to the agency's printing 
computer and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The men used the equipment to issue 95 validated airline tickets worth about 
$300,000, which they then sold to passengers without paying the airlines in 
November and December of 1992, Taylor said. Among the airlines defrauded are 
Delta, TWA, American, United, America West, Cathay Pacific and KLM. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents seized the equipment and remaining blank passes before more 
tickets could be issued, Taylor said. The owner of Atlas International Travel 
has not been charged and is not named in the indictment, Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 He would not comment on how the FBI and the U.S. Postal Service found out 
about the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men, Haroon Amin, 32, of Upland, is also charged in a second 
indictment with carrying out a similar scheme six years ago at Travel Quick 
Inc., an Anaheim travel agency that folded after the fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said Amin gained access to the agency's computer system and used it to 
issue tickets with a total face value of $189,000, which he allegedly sold 
without reimbursing the airlines. He used other agency documents to order 
tickets worth another $300,000, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those indicted from Orange County were Afif Sami Masri, 46, of Lake Forest; 
Ghassan Kmeid, 36, of Orange, and his brother, Charles Kmeid, 38, of Placentia. 
Masri owns TFS Travel in Orange. He and Charles Kmeid were arrested Tuesday. 
Ghassan Kmeid remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Also indicted were Shahzada Mohd Farooq, 52, of Upland and Suchpreet Singh 
Dhillon, 38, of Sylmar. Farooq also remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The six men face 79 counts of wire fraud. Amin faces an additional nine 
counts. The maximum penalty for each count is five years in prison, a $250,000 
fine and three years of supervised release, Taylor said.

FIRE DESTROYS 5 BOATS AT NEWPORT DUNES RESORT; BLAZE: FLAMES BEGAN IN ONE OF 
THE CRAFTS PARKED IN THE STORAGE AREA, OFFICIALS SAY. THEY EXPECT TO FIND OUT 
THE CAUSE TODAY.

 A fire destroyed five pleasure boats at the Newport Dunes Resort Marina 
storage area Wednesday, sending up a thick plume of black smoke and causing an 
undetermined amount of damage to the craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach fire officials said they do not know what caused the blaze, 
which spread quickly among the five boats parked side by side in the open-air 
storage area, where about 200 other boats and recreational vehicles are parked. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Division Chief Tom Arnold of the Newport Beach Fire Department said the fire 
started inside one of the boats, but officials will not know why until today, 
when the investigation is expected to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were called to the storage area shortly after 6 p.m. when an 
unidentified witness reported that three boats were engulfed in flames, Arnold 
said. When the first firetruck arrived five minutes later, two other boats were 
ablaze. The fire was extinguished within 15 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Griffin, 40, a book publisher from Corona del Mar, said he owned one of 
the destroyed boats, a 25-foot Fiberglas Champion. He said the boat did not 
contain any fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just used it a week or a week and a half ago," Griffin said. "I remember 
we were going to Catalina when we almost ran out of gas. It just happened to be 
empty because I didn't have a chance to refuel it" after the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin estimated his loss at $70,000. "It is terrible," he said. "I just got 
done putting a lot of money into it with expensive electrical gear." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had been parking the boat at the Dunes for about a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it is wiped out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Quinn, general manager of the resort, said he was in his office when he 
saw the smoke coming from the boats near the edge of the lot. He said that this 
was the first fire in 10 years at the storage area.

SAN CLEMENTE COUNCIL RAISES ISSUES ABOUT MILITARY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Wednesday night authorized Mayor Scott Diehl to send a 
letter of concern to the U.S. Marine Corps that city officials have over a 
proposed military residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 5-0 vote, the council approved a letter that addresses questions about 
the project, including design, traffic and impact on city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen people, mostly in favor of the Marine Corps project, 
turned out for the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Oliver, a past commander of the San Clemente chapter of the Military Order 
of the World Wars, drew applause when he criticized the council over its 
initial draft of the letter. "We believe you are taking the low road in your 
response at the request of a vocal but wealthy minority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps wants to build duplexes for 128 Marine officer families on 
San Mateo Point, a bluff top just south of the San Diego County line and across 
from some of San Clemente's most beautiful and expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine officials say the project is badly needed because of a severe housing 
shortage at Camp Pendleton, where more than 30,000 Marines are stationed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not required to consult civilian authorities about the project, which 
is planned on federal land, the military had asked city officials for their 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Jim Barnes said before the council meeting that the duplexes 
would not serve the "highest and best use" for the land. That phrase, which was 
contained in the initial draft of the letter, was deleted by the council after 
Councilwoman Candace Haggard suggested that the letter take "a more friendly 
tone." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said earlier that the property is near large homes, and would be better 
suited for a development offering similar housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said city planners want a guarantee that certain design amenities would 
be made so the military housing would be compatible with the nearby civilian 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hundred residents near the proposed development have signed petitions 
against the project, which Marines have said will blend in with the communities 
of Cyprus Cove, the Breakers, Cotton Point, and Cyprus Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Corps officials plan to spend between $6 million and $10 million on the 
project, which is 7% more than is usually spent on military housing, in an 
effort to make it attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for two-story buildings with stucco walls and tile roofs to mix 
in with the city's Spanish architecture. The units would have two and three 
bedrooms. There would also be open spaces, a jogging path and play lots for 
small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Lt. David Steele, a base spokesman, said Wednesday that the project 
would take from a year to 18 months to build. It would cover 40 acres, eight of 
which would remain open space, Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Koehn, who began building a new 2,500-square-foot house Wednesday in 
Cyprus Cove, said the Marines Corps could find other locations at Camp 
Pendleton base for the duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the best things about San Clemente is that it is funky California," 
Koehn said. "It is one of the last places left that is not overbuilt."

11-YEAR-OLD BOY CRITICALLY INJURED IN AUTO COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 11-year-old boy was in critical but stable condition Wednesday after the 
car he was riding in was struck by a motorist who allegedly ran a red light, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Anthony Rua, of Whittier, was being treated for head injuries and broken 
legs at UCI Medical Center in Orange, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Rua was a passenger in an auto that was struck when the driver of 
a Jeep ran a red light at Beach Boulevard and Warner Avenue about 10 p.m. 
Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers of the two vehicles suffered only minor injuries, Lt. Luis Ochoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the driver of the Cherokee, William Hardy, 37, of Newport Beach, 
was under investigation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police alleged that Hardy ran a red light as he turned his Jeep onto Warner 
Avenue and collided with the oncoming auto, driven by Rafael Quintana, 29, of 
La Habra. A car behind Quintana's also was struck, and the driver, 21-year-old 
Mark Seafort, was slightly injured, Ochoa said.

GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY TRAGEDIES INVESTIGATED; TRUCK: WHY PIPES FELL OFF THE 
TRAILER STILL ISN'T KNOWN. VICTIM WAS FROM SANTA CLARITA AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Charles Fedorko left work a little early Tuesday afternoon to get home to his 
teen-age son, who he had been raising on his own for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Through no fault of his own, Fedorko's anxiousness to get home cost him his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko, 46, was traveling north on the Golden State Freeway near its 
intersection with the Foothill and Antelope Valley freeways at about 4:15 p.m. 
At the exact moment he drove under an entrance ramp, a load of 30-foot iron 
pipes, each weighing about a ton, fell from a big-rig truck on the ramp, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pipes sheared off the roof of his 1992 Oldsmobile Bravada and 
killed him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, California Highway Patrol officers identified Fedorko as the 
only person killed by the falling pipes. Two other motorists sustained minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason that the pipes, bound to a flatbed trailer by nylon straps, came 
loose is still under investigation, said Officer Wendy Moore of the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officials said a truck driver is normally responsible for securing his 
load, but they have not yet determined if charges will be sought against the 
big-rig driver, Harold Haines, 56, of Aumsville, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Haines was driving for Westran Inc., a trucking company with offices in 
Vancouver, Wash., according to records filed with the Washington state 
corporation division. The company is headquartered in Clackamas, Ore., said 
Marilyn Meehan, a spokeswoman with the Washington Utilities and Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Westran officials, reached in Vancouver, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko lived in the Stevenson Ranch area, just west of the Santa Clarita city 
limits, with his 14-year-old son, David. He was vice president and general 
manager for the western region of Keystone Communications, a Salt Lake 
City-based company that provides satellite uplinks for television broadcasters. 
The local office is on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko had formerly been a radio broadcaster, according to a statement 
released by Keystone, before moving on to television positions. He had worked 
as a satellite system engineer for NBC and a satellite operations manager for 
Hughes Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very elegant, successful man," said Priscilla Wright, who used to 
baby-sit David Fedorko while his father was traveling for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko loved airplanes, according to friends, and he collected gauges and 
other aviation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officer at the scene said he at first thought he was a pilot because of 
all the equipment in his car," said Rob Schwenker, a classmate of Fedorko's 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 David Fedorko is staying with a friend in Canyon Country, said next-door 
neighbor Bernadine Monk. David's mother is due to arrive from Florida today. 
</P>
<P>
 Both father and son were described by those who knew them as private, but 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know a whole lot about his private life, but he was always very nice, 
very polite," Monk said of Fedorko. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko is survived by two other children, his son, Charles, and daughter, 
Melissa. Both are grown and live outside of the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwenker said David became worried when his father didn't arrive home at 5 
p.m. as expected. The teen-ager tried to phone and page his father, then joined 
Schwenker in a game of street hockey "to take his mind off of it," Schwenker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers arrived that evening to look for family members and friends. They 
delivered the news that Fedorko had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with (David) all last night," Schwenker said. "He was pretty crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are pending.

GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY TRAGEDIES INVESTIGATED; CONSTRUCTION: STATE SAYS HUMAN 
ERROR IS A POSSIBLE REASON FOR FATAL COLLAPSE OF WALL.

 A construction accident on a freeway on-ramp in Arleta that killed one man may 
have been caused by human error when workers broke from their routine and 
removed all of the bolts that held a 5,000-pound quake-damaged sound wall in 
place, according to state labor safety officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Fourte, 24, of Los Angeles was killed Tuesday when one 8- by 10-foot 
section of the sound wall collapsed, possibly because workers removed all the 
bolts that held the wall in place before attaching clamps from a crane that 
would have supported it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourte was pronounced dead at the scene at the Branford Street on-ramp to the 
southbound Golden State Freeway, said Brian Humphrey, a Los Angeles Fire 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it could have been prevented," said Rick Rice, a spokesman for 
the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which 
investigates industrial accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will look to see if proper procedures were followed and if the company had 
a system in place to prevent this type of thing from happening." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the investigation, Rice said Cal/OSHA investigators expect to 
complete a thorough background check of the company's safety record by today.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lawson, spokesperson for Granite Construction in Watsonville, which hired 
the Oakland -based Rondeau Bay Construction Co. to remove the damaged panels, 
said the seven- or eight-man crew had a system to remove two of the four bolts 
that held the 10-foot high walls before attaching two clamps from the crane 
before removing the final two bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that on this particular panel, all four bolts were taken out 
before the crane was clamped on," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alan Dones, the president of Rondeau Bay Construction Co., said company 
officials don't know what caused the accident and were conducting an internal 
investigation into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not clear if all the bolts were removed, he said, and company officials 
have found a bolt that was sheared off and another that appeared to be 
stripped, Dones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rondeau has replaced about 170 wall panels along Southland freeways that were 
damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, Dones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dones said there is a lot of speculation but nobody really saw what happened. 
"We really don't know at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, workers and company officials were still coping with 
Fourte's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great guy," Dones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourte was hired by the company about six weeks ago through a state Employment 
Development Department program to hire military veterans, Dones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dones also identified Mike Andrews as the worker who was injured in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Andrews was treated and released Tuesday night from Pacifica Hospital 
of the Valley, but that no one from the company has been able to contact him.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LOVE OF JOB STILL BURNS BRIGHTLY FOR FIREFIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just look at the facts of his 50 years of experience -- 40 with the Los 
Angeles City Fire Department -- and it is clear that Larry Schneider, a 
rugged-looking fellow with a stubborn cowlick, holds his love for firefighting 
closer to his heart than the Pall Mall cigarettes he carries in his breast 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider made his first ill-advised jump into firefighting at the age of 6 
when he followed his firefighter father up a ladder and onto the roof of a 
burning building. His father, Ted, who started with the city Fire Department in 
1912, was mad at his wife for letting the boy get away, but the other 
firefighters loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What impressed me the most was that firefighters thought it was funny," said 
Schneider, now 66 and chief of Battalion 15, which covers the northwest Valley. 
He learned early about the camaraderie of the life of a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider and the men under him had to draw on a lifetime of experience when 
the Jan. 17 earthquake struck. As they rolled out of Station 28 in Porter 
Ranch, Schneider said, the area looked like it had been hit by a B-52 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hour after the quake was the most difficult, he said. Schneider had 
only one fire company to send to the Northridge Meadows apartments, where 16 
people died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I didn't have any backup for them at all," Schneider said. "If 
they had gotten trapped inside, I had nobody else to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
 To be a good firefighter requires experience, training and the willingness to 
take a calculated risk. Although the Northridge earthquake pushed firefighters 
to the limit, no one under his command died or suffered serious injuries, 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lucked out, we really did," said Schneider, who was in command of fighting 
the Topanga/Chatsworth brush fire last year when the blaze overran one of the 
engines and critically burned four men. Schneider lost a brother, Bob, who was 
killed by a bulldozer while fighting a fire in Malibu in 1940. And Schneider 
himself once fell through a burning roof, seriously burning his legs. He was 
saved by a fellow firefighter who grabbed him by the collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighting has become safer during the years Schneider has been on the job, 
with the introduction of breathing apparatuses and fire-resistant clothing. He 
remembers handling mattress fires in hotels where "you had to just breathe the 
stuff until you put it out." The smoke could cause vomiting, and still can, as 
the gases are absorbed through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 But having all that protection has its downside, Schneider said. It gives a 
false sense of security and leads firefighters into spots that are far too 
dangerous.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that in the old days days a firefighter would feel his way into a 
burning building and could tell from the heat and smoke where to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me a better firefighter," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's 40th anniversary with the Los Angeles Fire Department was last 
month, but the celebration continues. His battalion has organized a dinner for 
July 28, saluting his 50 years in firefighting. He previously had been with the 
Torrance and county fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of embarrassing, to tell you the truth," Schneider said of the fuss 
over his anniversary. Other firefighters have gone on much longer, and 
Schneider talks the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably another 20 years, and then I'll call it quits, that's what I tell 
people," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing he expects to miss the most is sitting at a dinner table with a 
bunch of firefighters, sharing in that camaraderie that he first understood 
when he was 6. ED BOND

 Better Valley Services will receive an $80,000 grant from the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development to provide counseling for renters and 
prospective homeowners in and around Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, funded by HUD's housing counseling grant program, will provide 
counseling for about 500 clients a month, Irene Gizzi, manager of the North 
Hollywood-based nonprofit program, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest grant we have ever been awarded," Gizzi said. She said 
the ongoing counseling program was in danger of ending without the funds, which 
will kick in in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which began in 1986, provides counseling for seniors, the 
disabled and the impoverished on how to rent low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors also work with prospective home buyers and sellers and provide 
mediation services between tenants and landlords to prevent people from losing 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1973, Better Valley Services is a homeless and human services 
program that also provides referrals to food banks and other services to about 
25,000 clients each year. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; LAND PURCHASED FOR PARK NEXT TO LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Studio City will get a new -- albeit small -- park based on a decision 
Wednesday by the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Commission to spend $375,000 
for land next to the Studio City Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is part of a .45-acre vacant parcel on the corner of Moorpark Street 
and Whitsett Avenue that the city has been eyeing for an expansion of the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's Library Department does not need and can not afford the entire 
$1-million parcel for the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes the library, suggested the 
city purchase a .17-acre portion of the land with $375,000 in fees that the 
city collects from developers to buy and develop parks. The rest of the 
property can then be used for the expansion, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the park site was once occupied by a gas station, an environmental 
study by the city found no soil contamination. If all goes as planned, the park 
can be open within six months to a year, park officials said. HUGO MARTIN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MORATORIUM ON CINEMAS NARROWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to stop movie theaters from locating outside the downtown Glendale area 
for a 45-day moratorium period was amended to Brand Boulevard only. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council asked city staff members on Tuesday to narrow the proposed 
moratorium.  
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 0 to introduce the moratorium, but asked that it be 
rewritten to allow only cinemas that would front on Brand Boulevard to be given 
permits. Council members will vote on the revised measure next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The more general moratorium introduced Tuesday would have allowed for review 
of movie theater companies applying for permits throughout the city's central 
business district.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure will not affect an eight-screen theater planned for the third 
floor in Glendale Fashion Center -- which is outside the downtown area -- 
because project owners have obtained a conditional use permit to rebuild the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and the council agreed earlier this month that a moratorium on 
cinemas outside the downtown area is necessary to give the city time to work on 
a plan to create a cinema zone.  
</P>
<P>
 A cinema zone is what the downtown redevelopment area needs to draw new 
retailers as well as pedestrians to the central business district, said City 
Manager David Ramsay.  
</P>
<P>
 Other cities such as Pasadena and Santa Monica have successfully limited movie 
theaters to certain areas to create bustling entertainment and shopping 
districts such as Old Town and the Third Street Promenade, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members also expressed concern about the moratorium's effect on movie 
theaters currently operating in the city and if it would prohibit these cinemas 
from expanding.  
</P>
<P>
 The council asked city staff to determine if the moratorium would allow 
current theaters such as the eight-screen Mann Theater on Maryland Avenue to 
place signs on Brand Boulevard -- which would allow them to expand under the 
moratorium because the signs would front Brand Boulevard. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; $250 IN QUAKE AID GOES A LONG WAY FOR STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering the multimillion-dollar recovery estimates that circulated in the 
aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, $250 might not sound like very much 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Richard-Edward de Vere, who lost his home, his possessions and two of 
three part-time jobs to the temblor, it's practically a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have breathing room," said the 36-year-old Cal State Northridge theater 
major, one of six recipients of a student-sponsored scholarship. "It's such a 
pressure off me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Earthquake Relief Scholarship was created by CSUN public relations 
students in May to assist fellow students whose education was put in jeopardy 
after the quake. To raise money, the students distributed about 1,000 
collection canisters to retail stores and restaurants near campus. They 
collected enough to give six students $250. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant means de Vere will be able to complete his degree program. 
</P>
<P>
 A television set crashed into de Vere's forehead during the pre-dawn quake, 
leaving a wide gash that required stitches. But his injury was only a precursor 
to the turmoil that followed. He lost nearly all his possessions when his 
apartment was red-tagged, including his theater books and notes from his 
classes. He temporarily lost two of his three part-time jobs, which were on the 
CSUN campus. His other workplace, in a Woodland Hills office building, was also 
shut down for several weeks while repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
 De Vere said he will use the $250 to defray the cost of tuition, about $625 
for the fall semester. He was supposed to graduate in the spring, but the 
financial strain made it impossible for him to pay for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have one pair of shoes," he said. "That tells you how I've been 
cutting corners."  
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the relief effort say the canisters are no longer in stores, but 
they plan to keep the fund open to assist as many of the students who applied 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyndy Perry-Rodgers, who helped organize the effort, read the grant 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could feel my heart just wrenching," she said. "CSUN is made up of a lot of 
people who are putting themselves through college, and this sort of set them 
over the edge." SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CHAMBER UNDERGOES REORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to make the Glendale Chamber of Commerce more member friendly, 
officials are restructuring the organization to include fewer divisions and 
more feedback from its 1,600 members.  
</P>
<P>
 Reorganization efforts were initiated by Ron Watson, the new executive vice 
president, who came to the chamber six weeks ago from Reno where he was the 
chief executive officer of that city's chamber for 11 years. Watson replaced 
Aulden Schlatter who retired in March, 1993, after 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials decided to revamp the chamber after business representatives who 
replied to membership surveys said they did not believe the organization was 
responsive to their needs, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a real high perception of the value of their membership -- we 
weren't communicating what they were supposed to be deriving from us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber -- which represents about 250 business categories including 
retail, hotels and restaurants -- is also struggling to overcome the 
repercussions of the disastrous 1992 Glenfest celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 The chamber lost about $230,000 and suffered a blow to its reputation after 
the street celebration -- which was supposed to garner about $1 million -- went 
awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson plans to reorganize the chamber by paring down its six major divisions 
to four. The new divisions include, business development, public affairs, 
member services and local concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new logo to be designed by a marketing committee, the chamber will ask 
its members to serve on task forces that will provide the board with feedback 
about local business concerns and pending legislation, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to promote Glendale, chamber officials are advertising for a 
publisher to put together a 200-page hardcover book featuring photographs taken 
by local artists and copy written by community members.  
</P>
<P>
 The limited edition book, of which officials plan to print about 4,000 copies, 
is scheduled to be in bookstores sometime next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber also plans to sponsor a program to recognize future community 
leaders. The program will search rosters of volunteer organizations to 
determine which members may be leaders in the next three years, Watson said.  
</P>
<P>
 These future leaders will then be invited to workshops, and upon graduation 
will have their name publicized by the chamber to be used by organizations 
searching for leaders, he said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; RESTAURANT TO APPEAL LIQUOR LICENSE DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying it has the support of the community, a well-established Italian 
restaurant will appeal its denial of a liquor license at a hearing in Los 
Angeles today. 
</P>
<P>
 Paoli's Pizzeria & Piano Bar wants to transfer its liquor license to a new 
location, 21618-20-22 Ventura Blvd., about a half-mile down the street from its 
current site. On April 21, however, the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control denied its application for a transfer, saying that Paoli's was within 
100 feet of residences and refused to take steps that would alleviate potential 
problems for nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Barsi, assistant manager at Paoli's, contended that 4,000 customers have 
signed a petition that restaurant owner Chairon Miller will present at the 9 
a.m. hearing at the Office of Administrative Hearings, 314 W. 1st St., Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "Give us a chance," Barsi said. "We're here nine years. We cater to a nice 
clientele." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four residents who live within 100 feet of the property -- which is two 
blocks west of Canoga Avenue on the south side of Ventura Boulevard -- one was 
opposed, one had no objections and two did not respond to inquiries, according 
to Jim Smith, district administrator for the ABC's Van Nuys district office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 15, 1993, less than a month after Paoli's applied for the license, the 
office received a petition signed by 24 opponents of the license who expressed 
fears of late-night noise, parking shortages, traffic congestion and 
intoxicated patrons.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the petition was not a factor in the department's decision because 
petitioners did not meet the agency's requirements for a legal petition -- even 
after the ABC informed them of its criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrator placed the chances of the administrative law judge 
overturning the agency's decision at "50-50." 
</P>
<P>
 "We denied it based on the rule (that the ABC may deny licenses to applicants 
within 100 feet of residences) and comments from that one resident who 
objected," Smith said. "We would like to have those people appear. If they 
refuse to appear, that kind of weakens our case." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge will listen to arguments from both sides today, and will issue a 
ruling within 30 days. If Paoli's does not win its appeal, it will have the 
opportunity to plead its case at three successively higher levels in the 
appeals process. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; RESIDENTS FORM 1ST SYNAGOGUE IN CITY 
</P>

<P>
 In response to the growth of the Calabasas Jewish community, residents have 
organized the town's first synagogue at a local elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The synagogue -- or shul -- will offer orthodox Shabbat services at Bay Laurel 
Elementary School every Saturday starting Sept. 3, giving many local Jews a 
place of worship within walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Sabbath, it's preferred that we not use mechanical means of 
transportation," said Nigel Hamer, one of the founders of the Calabasas Shul. 
"A lot of us will be able to walk, instead of having to drive to Woodland Hills 
or Encino." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1979 and 1993, the Jewish population in Calabasas grew 631% to 5,509 
people -- faster than in any other part of Los Angeles County, according to 
figures compiled by the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But no Jewish temple or synagogue was ever built in the city, Hamer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Agoura Hills, which has the conservative Temple Beth Haverim, the Jewish 
population grew 394% during that period. 
</P>
<P>
 A Shabbat service held June 18 drew more than 80 people to Bay Laurel 
Elementary, 24740 Paseo Primario. Another service is scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Shabbat services begin with a family dinner at home on Friday 
night, followed by a service at the synagogue, classes and socializing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to be with family and friends, and not to do anything 
business-wise," Hamer said. "It is also a tradition to invite someone else to 
Shabbat, to always have a guest." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; 10 TREES PLANTED AS PROJECT BEGINS

 Kermit the Frog was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to be green -- at least a little more so -- in the city of Los 
Angeles, as a tree-planting project was kicked off Wednesday in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 10 of 1,000 trees planned for the project were planted by the 
Quakertown Street Neighborhood Watch group of Canoga Park. The trees were 
donated by Woodland Hills' Treeland Nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a release, Councilwoman Laura Chick said: "Trees are more than beautiful. 
The positive effect of every tree we plant in terms of its ability to remove 
polluting carbon dioxide from the air is staggering." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of trees are available to community groups interested in 
participating in the greening effort. For more information, call the Street 
Tree Division at (213) 485-5675. MAKI BECKER

OFFICER CLEARED IN VALLEY MAN'S FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rookie Oxnard police officer who shot and killed a suspected car thief last 
April acted in self-defense and did not commit any crime, the Ventura County 
district attorney's office concluded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 2 1/2-month investigation, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes 
found that Officer Patrick Dolan fired only after 20-year-old Alfonso Bravo -- 
an alleged gang member from Los Angeles -- pointed a gun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can hardly imagine a more life-threatening situation to a police 
officer," Holmes concluded in a 15-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police officials said they were satisfied with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the time the shooting occurred, it appeared that it was justifiable," 
Assistant Chief Tom Cady said. "I think we're just very lucky the officer 
wasn't injured in the incident. The facts show that he was in great danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan, who had only been on the force nine months at the time of the shooting, 
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. He was placed on paid leave for 
about two weeks after the shooting and then returned to duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo, a Van Nuys resident, stole a 1988 Mustang GT from a Studio City parking 
garage on April 18, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Dolan spotted him driving the car erratically near Silver Strand 
beach in Oxnard about 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-mile high-speed chase, Bravo jumped out of the car on Wooley 
Road while the vehicle was still running and Dolan went after him. The car 
jumped a curb and crashed into a concrete wall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who later searched the Mustang found the car's ignition had been torn 
out, the exterior lock on the driver's side had been removed, and an anti-theft 
device was lying on the passenger's seat, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan ordered Bravo to stop, but he continued to flee through the residential 
area. After Bravo climbed a wooden fence in the 3000 block of Taffrail Lane, 
Dolan attempted to follow suit when he saw Bravo crouched in the side of the 
yard, pointing a gun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan said he fell back onto the street side of the fence, crouched, and fired 
three shots through the fence in self-defense, according to the report. 
Investigators later determined he actually fired four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after he heard Bravo say, "I'm shot," and groan, Dolan called the 
police dispatcher and other officers arrived at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Bravo apparently tried to scale another fence and escape but 
was injured too badly. He fell inside the fence, dropping his gun -- which was 
loaded and cocked with the safety removed -- on the other side, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
 He was found dead by police shortly afterward. An autopsy found that Bravo 
died of gunshot wounds to his torso, thigh and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviewing witnesses, including relatives of Bravo, and examining 
coroners' and police investigators' reports during his probe, Holmes concluded 
that the case was a justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officer Dolan knew that he had cornered a fleeing felon who suddenly produced 
a firearm and pointed it at him," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a passage on Bravo's background, Holmes said the dead man was known to 
carry guns and had been considered a suspect in a series of armed robberies in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The activities attributed to Mr. Bravo on April 25, 1994, are perfectly 
consistent with his past behavior," Holmes wrote. "Bravo was a known member of 
the Valerio Street gang with a nickname of 'Temper,' which even he acknowledged 
was well-deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes added that when a coroner's investigator described the circumstances of 
Bravo's death to the man's mother, she responded that "knowing her son, she 
believed he would have shot the officer."

PLAN FOR BIGGER CASTAWAY RESTAURANT IS REJECTED; BURBANK: COUNCIL SIDES WITH 
RESIDENTS WHO FEAR LARGER FACILITY WOULD INCREASE NOISE AND TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A plan to rebuild a larger version of the Castaway restaurant has been 
rejected by the Burbank City Council, a decision which will delay by at least 
four months the reopening of the popular hilltop landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-0 vote Tuesday, the council sided with residents who feared a larger 
facility would increase noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a federal investigation into the arson fire which destroyed the 
structure June 29, 1993, has produced no suspects, authorities said. The Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms formed an investigatory task force soon after 
the fire, said ATF spokesman John D'Angelo. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the Verdugo Hills during the early 1960s, the Castaway became popular 
with Burbank celebrities and residents for its breathtaking views. 
</P>
<P>
 A Burbank fire investigator said flammable liquid was used to destroy the 
restaurant and was probably the work of several people. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby meeting rooms remained standing and are still being used for weddings, 
company parties and high school proms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castaway was insured for $5.5 million, most of which has yet to be paid to 
the restaurant's Anaheim-based owner, Specialty Restaurants Corp., said 
corporation President David Tallichet. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with one of Specialty Restaurant's insurance carriers, Wausau 
Insurance Cos., said, "We are looking into the claim right now and verifying 
the merits of the claim." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Specialty Restaurants hoped to expand a rebuilt restaurant by 
4,124 square feet, add an outdoor deck of even greater size and reopen for 
business in December. But opposition from residents forced the company to 
reconsider its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm made last-minute changes to its proposal, forcing the matter to be 
postponed twice before reaching the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposal rejected by the council called for a restaurant that would 
be 2,854 square feet larger than the original, with additional space for 
outdoor dining and cocktails. Tallichet later remarked that the rejection was 
"just the cost of doing business." 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty Restaurants filed for bankruptcy last year and has been beset by 
fires at its other restaurants nationwide. Within the past 12 years, the 
corporation has had restaurants in Atlanta, Tennessee, Florida, Colorado and 
California destroyed by fire, Tallichet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is," Tallichet said. "There may be some fire bug out 
there that's going against our company." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The council voted 4 to 1 to allow merchants in the Burbank Village area to 
impose an annual assessment on themselves that will fund promotions and 
improvements in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 * Council members met on the playing field of the Olive Memorial Baseball 
Stadium for a briefing on the condition of the 48-year-old facility. The 
stadium was once the spring training site for the St. Louis Browns baseball 
team, but has fallen into disrepair and may be replaced if the council 
determines enough funding is available.

POLICEWOMAN-MOTHER HELPS LEAD FEMALE RECRUITMENT DRIVE; LAPD: CAMPAIGN AIMS TO 
MEET THE CITY COUNCIL'S GOAL THAT 43% OF THE OFFICERS HIRED ANNUALLY BE WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Leticia Dotson, it was no simple task balancing her life as a mother of 
three and her job as an undercover cop in North Hollywood, where she tried to 
break up narcotic rings and put drug pushers behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't much easier running a household when her assignment in the Los 
Angeles Police Department later became a foot beat on the gritty, crime-plagued 
streets of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the eight-year LAPD veteran has become a vocal advocate for a 
recruitment drive to put more women into blue uniforms, though she is the first 
to concede it's not an easy choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that is what you really want, it takes work," said Dotson, now a training 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's recruitment drive begins Saturday at San Fernando High School in 
Pacoima for the first of several community expos. The objective is lofty: The 
City Council has set a goal that 43% of the officers hired each year be women. 
</P>
<P>
 But police and city officials say the time is ripe for women because the city 
has for the first time in years launched a major expansion of the department 
and has recently approved a $50-million pay raise package for its officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, they say, the growing attention to the issue of domestic violence 
brought about by the O.J. Simpson case makes the need for more women on the 
force that much more important. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is never a better time than now for women in the LAPD," Councilman Joel 
Wachs said at a news conference Wednesday to promote the expo. He was joined by 
Councilman Richard Alarcon, Dotson and other LAPD officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are about 1,100 women on the force, representing about 15% of 
the department. Last year, only a quarter of the recruit applicants were women. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of increasing that number to 43% -- the same percentage of women in 
the region's total work force -- the City Council voted in April to spend 
$250,000 on a recruitment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials concede that it may be difficult to find enough 
qualified women to meet the goal. For example, under Mayor Richard Riordan's 
plan to improve public safety, the city is expected to hire 780 officers next 
year. To meet the 43% goal, 335 of those new officers must be women. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see it is a great difference between 15% and 43%," Dotson said at the 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials acknowledged that they must also combat the image of 
the LAPD as a "good old boys" organization plagued by incidents of sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say that sexual harassment doesn't exist. It exists in every 
organization in the world as far as I know," said Capt. Bob Gale of the LAPD's 
Foothill Division. "But we cannot fix it unless we become aware of it . . . and 
we try to train people so we can prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dotson agreed. "If there are women out there who fear that they will be 
victimized by their peers, they need not fear this," she said. "We are 
addressing these issues on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Amy Popma said women are particularly important to the department when 
it comes to investigating crimes against women. On several occasions, she said 
victims of rape or domestic violence have requested her or other female 
officers to take the crime report. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to talk to a female because they feel more comfortable speaking to 
a female officer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Christopher Commission, which reviewed department practices 
after the 1991 beating of Rodney G. King, found that women officers are less 
prone to violence and often are able to de-escalate volatile situations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dotson said the biggest hurdle to reaching the city's goal may be that 
many women believe they cannot be an officer and have a fulfilling family life 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proof that you can do that," she said. "It took a little managing, but it 
is possible. It is possible for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's expo runs from 9 a.m. to noon at the high school at 11133 O'Melveny 
Ave. in Pacoima. Female officers from the Foothill Division will conduct an 
orientation program for potential recruits, and a written test for interested 
candidates will also be offered.

CHICK ARRANGES 2 BILLBOARDS AGAINST BATTERING OF WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stirred by the slaying of Nicole Brown Simpson, a city councilwoman and an 
advertising agency have worked together to create a graphic reminder of the 
costs of domestic violence and publicize hot-line numbers for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 14- by 48-foot hand-painted billboards will go up this week in Reseda and 
Hollywood, showing the stark image of a woman's body shrouded by a coroner's 
sheet.The caption above the corpse reads, "Some Women Will Never Talk to Anyone 
About Being Abused." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda billboard, to be erected Friday, will list the phone number for the 
Haven Hills women's shelter in Canoga Park, while the Hollywood version, to go 
up today, will give the phone number of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults 
Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards came about after the much-publicized slayings of O.J. Simpson's 
ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman as Councilwoman Laura 
Chick sought a way to publicize the Valley's only shelter for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick contacted Dash Stolarz, who works in public relations at the nation's 
largest billboard company, Patrick Media Group in Los Angeles. Stolarz helped 
Chick with her City Council campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 The company donated both the space for the signs and the painters. 
</P>
<P>
 The disturbing, predominantly black-and-white image of the shrouded body was 
taken from an award-winning 1989 campaign for the Commission on Assaults 
Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda billboard will be located near the intersection of Sherman Way and 
Balboa Boulevard and will be moved to another Valley location after about 30 
days. The Hollywood billboard will also be moved from its initial location 
after about a month. ERIC SLATER

ROOKIE GETS A BANG OUT OF TRIP TO NEIGHBORHOOD FIRING RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's learning to shoot the Woodland Hills way. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples on dates, parents with young children, attorneys and even rock stars 
gather at the Warner Center Gun Club, a tony firing range where customers relax 
in the lobby on leather sofas and sip juice while watching a TV set up for 
their enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a luxurious place to fire a gun, either for sport or to sharpen up on 
self-defense skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-owner Paulo Marin says he opened the business about a year ago after being 
unable to find a comfortable range in a good neighborhood. To solve his 
dilemma, Marin says he has spent $750,000 transforming the club into the most 
sophisticated, state-of-the-art shooting range around. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit juice and leather sofas aside, shooting is exactly what most people go 
there to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Boom, boom, boom, boom, like mini-explosions, the staccato rhythm of a rifle 
shooting invades a classroom where instructor Steve Franklin is teaching 
Barbara and Roger Stephens, a retired Winnetka couple, and me how to use a 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexperienced shooters are required to attend the three-hour class before they 
are allowed to fire a gun at the range. The class costs $55. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stephenses said they were drawn to the class because they inherited a 
handgun from a relative a couple of months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger says he wants to learn how to use the gun for sport and for personal 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me put it this way," Roger says. "If you come at me, you'd get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara says she's certain that she could never fire a gun at another person, 
but if one is going to be around the house, she wants to know how to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really don't know what you'll do when you're threatened," Barbara says. 
"But I don't know if a gun is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm taking the class to write about the experience. I don't own a gun, and the 
closest I had ever got to one were those the cops wore when I covered the 
police beat.  
</P>
<P>
 Together, we gather in a small room filled with fold-out chairs with desks 
attached. Franklin sits in front of us behind a big table where three revolvers 
and a semiautomatic are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The class starts out with Franklin reviewing safety tips. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get a second chance with guns," he warns. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning the differences between revolvers and semiautomatic handguns, 
we practice loading and then shooting revolvers without bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Once we've gotten the form down, we each pick a revolver and head to the front 
desk, where we are each given a plastic orange basket filled with eye and ear 
protection, a bag filled with real bullets and two paper silhouettes, both of 
the upper body of a man with an orange bull's-eye on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the range, the smell of gunpowder fills the air, despite a ventilation 
system that, according to Franklin, pumps out 300 pounds of fresh air per 
minute.  
</P>
<P>
 We pin our silhouettes up on the lines and hit switches sending them back 20 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger goes first, and he ends up being a hard if not impossible act for 
Barbara and me to follow. By the time he finishes, there's barely any orange 
paper remaining in the bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Barbara while her husband is shooting if she's scared. She nods her 
head.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like it's real bullets," she says. "I don't want to play this game. I'm 
going home." 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't. She stays and shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm last, and, yes, I'm scared. I figure I will try firing at least three 
rounds. I load my Smith & Wesson 686, raise it toward my target, take a deep 
breath, aim and fire. I take an even deeper breath afterward, and before I know 
it, I find myself bitten by a competitive bug and yearning to hit the orange 
bull's-eye as many times as I can. 
</P>
<P>
 I hit it once. 
</P>
<P>
 I stop after firing about a dozen rounds. Despite how easy Clint, Arnold and 
Sylvester make shooting look, guns are heavy and my arms have grown tired. 
Afterward, I realize I will probably never choose to fire a gun again, but I 
don't regret learning how. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, I ask Barbara what she thought of it, and she smiles as 
she says, "I'll do it again."

EARTHQUAKE MEMORIAL CASH IS DONATED TO PET RESCUERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after her parents were killed in the Northridge earthquake, Elise 
Kaplan has found a way to bring some good out of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents both loved animals," said Kaplan, the daughter of earthquake 
victims David and Cecilia Pressman, both 72 and married for 51 years, who died 
in an embrace in Apartment 105 at Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan of Granada Hills started a memorial fund after their deaths, and has 
decided to donate the $900 now in it to the Pet Rescue Assn. in Sun Valley, she 
said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a recent newspaper article about how donations for the group had 
dropped because of the earthquake, potentially forcing the group to close, 
prompted her decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than having people send flowers, I thought it would be better to 
collect some money and do some good with it," said Kaplan, who admits she at 
first had dreamed of getting "thousands of dollars and finding the cure for 
cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 But her parents would be pleased with the donation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had lived to read that article, they would have wanted to donate," 
said Kaplan, who had her parents' mail forwarded to her after the earthquake 
and discovered that they had made donations to several animal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help keep us going a bit longer," said Annette Petelle, president of 
the Pet Rescue Assn., who added that donations had picked up recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her parents had two dachshunds and a mutt years ago, they did not 
have any pets at the time of the quake. Ironically, they had planned to move 
out of the apartment complex in a few months and to get a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always knew they loved animals," said Kaplan. "They were like their babies 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pet Rescue Assn. has kennels for 125 animals. Some of the animals they 
rescued were made homeless by the Northridge earthquake, Petelle said. ED BOND

SANTA CLARITA MAN TELLS POLICE HE SHOT GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Clarita gang member Wednesday confessed to shooting a security guard 
as the man patrolled a vacant apartment building in Newhall, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigoberto Medrano, 18, is in custody in lieu of $500,000 bail and is scheduled 
to be arraigned today on one count of attempted murder. He also faces two 
counts of spousal assault, one count of receiving stolen property and one count 
of child endangerment -- all stemming from an alleged attack on his girlfriend 
Tuesday, said Deputy Greg La Val of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 An informant identified Medrano as the shooter in the July 3 late-night 
incident that left security guard Dago Natareno, 38, wounded by a .25 caliber 
bullet that entered his right shoulder and lodged several inches deep in his 
chest, La Val said. 
</P>
<P>
 Natareno was one of two armed guards patrolling an apartment building in the 
24000 block of Pine Street that was declared unsafe and abandoned after the 
Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Natareno was shot at several times, but hit only once. It was his first day on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting is believed to have been partly motivated by gangs staking out 
their turf in the area, La Val said. Medrano is a member of a Newhall gang, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Natareno told deputies a group of people drove by the apartment building in a 
maroon Chevrolet Monte Carlo before the shooting and threatened to shoot him if 
he did not leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Medrano was arrested Tuesday night when deputies responded to a call that he 
had attacked his girlfriend, punching and kicking in the windshield of a 
vehicle occupied by the girlfriend and the couple's 15-month-old child. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department's anti-gang unit was already seeking Medrano in the 
July 3 shooting and obtained a search warrant for his Newhall residence on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No weapon was found, although deputies found a Newhall Avenue street sign, 
which prompted the charge of possessing stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Medrano first denied involvement in the shooting, but changed his story 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He broke down -- crying -- telling us he shot the security guard and was 
remorseful about it," La Val said. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 3 shooting was one of three in the Newhall community in a two-week 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say that the incidents are unrelated, but that they are concerned 
about the flurry of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 His department plans "to up patrols . . . down there to try and overcome it," 
La Val said.

MAN SUSPECTED OF 2 ROBBERIES AT CANYON COUNTRY BANK ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Torrance man suspected of committing two robberies at a Canyon Country bank 
was arrested in Granada Hills by police acting on a tip, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montez Day, 23, nicknamed the "Canyon Country bandit" by federal officials, 
was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of committing a July 13 robbery at the Wells 
Fargo branch at 19310 Soledad Canyon Road, said FBI spokesman John Hoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Day is suspected of robbing the same bank on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the course of the second robbery, he (robs) one teller and looks over 
and sees the teller he robbed the first time, and he goes over and robs her," 
Hoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoos declined to say how much money was taken during the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Day is being held in federal custody in Los Angeles without bail while a grand 
jury determines if there is enough evidence to indict him on one count of bank 
robbery, said Carol Levitsky, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. Day 
could face up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted.

TASK FORCE TO FIGHT BASE CLOSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A task force of Ventura County business leaders plans to spend $260,000 to 
hire a Washington lobbying firm to represent the county and its two Navy bases 
as they prepare to undergo scrutiny by the federal Base Realignment and Closure 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders said Wednesday that hiring a lobbyist will help prevent the 
possible closure of the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme and 
the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, which together pump $1.5 billion into 
the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the military continues to downsize, the local leaders, who call themselves 
the BRAC '95 Task Force, said they fear both bases could be vulnerable but that 
Point Mugu may be at greater risk. Federal officials have said that military 
testing and evaluation facilities such as those at Point Mugu will undergo 
examination by the commission for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, task force members are expected to sign a 12-month contract 
with the firm of Thicksten, Grimm and Burgum Inc. for lobbying services in 
Washington, said Jerry Etchingham, an Oxnard lawyer who is coordinating the 
lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "This firm has already been involved in the (base-closure) process several 
times and has specialized in this area," Etchingham said. "We are hoping that 
they will provide us with the kind of voice in Washington that will help keep 
our bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the lobbying firm could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a breakfast meeting Wednesday, members of the task force painted a grim 
picture for the county should the bases close. 
</P>
<P>
 The county could lose as much as $1.5 billion in federal contracts and money 
spent on utilities and other expenses to keep the bases operating. 
Additionally, $600 million in payroll dollars would be lost, affecting more 
than 20,000 families, said Rod Franz, a spokesman for the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we have communities in northern Florida and Maryland actively 
marketing their bases directly against ours," Franz said at the meeting. 
"Historically, if a military base is included on an initial (base closure) list 
it has over a 90% chance of being closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, a committee of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn., 
hopes to raise more than $350,000 in the upcoming months to pay for the 
lobbying firm's contract and underwrite the campaign to keep the bases open, 
Etchingham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will seek an estimated $150,000 from Ventura County and local city 
governments, $50,000 from companies with government contracts, $50,000 in 
donations from federal employees and $100,000 from the Ventura County business 
community at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Navy officials said they were pleased to hear that the lobbying firm 
will soon be working to help keep their facilities open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate the task force's commitment in improving awareness of the 
Navy's contributions to the Ventura County community," said Alan Alpers, a Navy 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both bases said they are continuing to provide the Department 
of Defense with detailed information about the installations and the 
communities around them -- a process known as a "data call." The gathering of 
such information is the first step in the biannual base-closing system. All 
military installations in the country are subject to answering the data call. 
</P>
<P>
 The next round of closures will be decided by the federally appointed 
base-closure commission next February and announced to the public in July, 
1995.

LAST FLIGHT; POINT MUGU STUNG BY LOSS OF ITS HORNET FIGHTER SQUADRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Roger White pushed forward the throttle of his F/A-18 Hornet and, 
seconds later, was thundering aloft in an ear-splitting roar from the main 
runway at Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 No ordinary training flight, White's Wednesday morning mission was a sad one. 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime naval aviator's job was to fly one of three remaining fighter 
jets in his Navy reserve unit to a base in Texas where it was being permanently 
reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight is one of a series of acts involved in the shutting down of Point 
Mugu's last fighter squadron. After 24 years standing ready for action, Naval 
Reserve Squadron VFA-305 will become formally decommissioned Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The squadron's demise is part of Navy-wide cutbacks aimed at cutting defense 
spending and is estimated to save the service $22 million annually. In total, 
the reserve squadron, known as the Lobos, is staffed by more than 100 officers 
and enlisted crew members, most of them in the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station has dozens of 
high-performance Navy jets. But these warplanes are used exclusively to test 
and evaluate various weapons systems. The last active-duty fighter squadron 
left Point Mugu in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 For White, Wednesday's flight took on special meaning. Knowing that it well 
may be his last chance to race across the sky as a Navy aviator, he wasted no 
time pushing his war bird aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 No more than 200 feet off the ground, White cranked a hard left turn around 
the control tower -- a last salute to his comrades standing on the Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have real mixed feelings about this," he said of the unit's imminent 
demise. "On one hand, I will have more time to pursue my interests in civilian 
aviation," said White, a commercial airlines pilot. "But on the other hand, I 
will definitely miss flying jets like these and I will definitely miss my 
squadron mates." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos were slated for shutdown earlier this year on a recommendation of 
President Clinton's federal budget for fiscal year 1995. Although never ordered 
into combat, the unit was called up and deployed as a temporary fighter 
squadron aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 While based at Point Mugu, a primary role for the 22-pilot squadron has been 
to provide "adversary training" to other Navy squadrons in the fleet. This 
training involves the pilots flying their Hornets in such a way as to simulate 
the tactics of Russian or other Eastern European adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr. Barry Rainey, the squadron's commanding officer, said the closure of the 
unit has been difficult to accept for many reservists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough, really tough," Rainey said. "But we realize the world is changing 
and that downsizing our military is going to be a fact of life. We're dealing 
with it by keeping our thumb on (our emotions). I'm sure after it's over and 
I'm sitting at home, it'll be a different story." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos are not scheduled to be replaced by any similar squadron, leaving 
the Point Mugu Navy base without a fighter jet squadron training for war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it's kind of a sad thing that we won't have a squadron here anymore," 
said Capt. Michael Kellard, commander of all Navy reserve units at Point Mugu. 
"This is something that strikes deep in our hearts. We're going to miss them." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Wednesday, Capt. Dave Kendall flew the last operational Hornet in the 
squadron to Point Mugu's sister base at China Lake, near Ridgecrest. There the 
jet will be converted into a test aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other Hornet remained in the squadron's hangar at day's end. Rainey 
said that if engine overhauls can be made in time before the unit's 
decommissioning, he hopes to fly the last Hornet out himself. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, the jet may have to be trucked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad thing, especially when the aircraft go," Kendall said before 
departing to China Lake. "But I've never served with a better bunch of people. 
It's been an honor."

FRIENDSHIP IS FORGED OVER LOVE OF SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gently dribbling the ball from foot to foot, 12-year-old Casey Schmidt crossed 
the uneven grass at Borchard Park, dodging an older player and dashing away 
with the soccer ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning quickly, he flashed a giant smile at his newfound friend, Charles 
Anchang, a visiting Cameroonian he met during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just play soccer all the time," Casey said. "That's my dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park boy and 28-year-old Cameroonian would seemingly have nothing 
in common. But they share a deep love for soccer and the World Cup team from 
the tiny west African nation. And out of that common bond has blossomed a 
friendship bridging age, race and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely pair met weeks ago during the World Cup tournament, where Anchang 
and four friends opened a booth at Soccerfest displaying artifacts and clothing 
from their small African nation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Cameroonians joined Casey and his family for an American-style 
barbecue in Newbury Park, swapping soccer stories over burgers and hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to be my friends for life," Casey said, putting his arm around 
Anchang, who traveled from the northwestern region of Cameroon to watch his 
nation's team play in the international tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casey is my younger brother," Anchang said, smiling warmly at the boy sitting 
next to him in the park. "There's some attraction that brings us together. 
Maybe it's soccer, maybe we're just people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was through soccer that Casey discovered the young African nation, which he 
now adores even though he has never been there. Four years ago, Cameroon's 
Cinderella team shocked the soccer world by advancing to the quarterfinals in 
the World Cup. That was when Casey -- then 8 -- found his dream team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cameroon team has so much joy and passion for the game," he said. His 
buddies wonder about his interest in the obscure team. "They're always asking, 
'Why Cameroon?' It was a miracle when they made it in '90." 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Cameroon national team arrived in Oxnard for its pre-World Cup 
training this spring, Casey was among the most faithful fans on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thrilled," Casey said. "I was there almost everyday." 
</P>
<P>
 During the practices at Oxnard College, Casey persuaded the Cameroon team 
members to sign his T-shirt -- a feat that impressed Anchang and his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "What amazed me was Casey had all the autographs of our soccer team's 
players," Anchang said, pointing to the scribbles on Casey's white and green 
shirt. "That proved he has his dream in Cameroon." 
</P>
<P>
 While Casey's passion for the game might seem foreign to some Americans, 
Anchang said the boy would fit right in with soccer-crazed Cameroonians. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate his point, he recalls visiting a tribe of African pygmies as 
part of a research project in Cameroon's forests. Of the 300 natives he 
interviewed, Anchang said about 250 knew of Cameroon soccer star Roger Milla, 
but only about 50 knew the name of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "You understand now, Casey, what soccer is in my country?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anchang said he hopes to arrange a trip for Casey to visit his country, 
possibly through his marketing firm, Cameroon Promo Loisir. "I will keep 
writing to him," he said. "I hope next summer we will be able to invite him 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey's parents, Jim and Kathy Schmidt, have always supported Casey's soccer 
playing and passion for Africa. A professor at Cal Lutheran, Jim Schmidt 
traveled to Kenya for seven months, and said he's delighted how his son has 
developed international friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really put a nice ending to our World Cup," he said. "In years to come, we 
won't remember who won, but I'll remember making new friends from Cameroon." As 
for Casey, someday he hopes to move to Cameroon and play for its national team. 
"My goal right now is to get a scholarship to college," he said. "Then I want 
to move there and become a citizen and play."

SCHOOLS ASK COMMUNITY TO HELP OUT; FILLMORE: SUPT. MARIO CONTINI HOPES LOCAL 
BUSINESSES, CHURCHES AND PARENTS WILL RAISE EXPECTATIONS IN TWO AREAS: SPELLING 
AND HOMEWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Year after year, students in the Fillmore Unified School District have scored 
near the bottom on standardized assessment tests, compared to other Ventura 
County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in Fillmore have complained they get little support from parents. 
Parents have argued that the schools fail to demand enough from their children. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly everyone in Fillmore has come to expect little from students in the 
public schools, parents and educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 So Fillmore school officials have decided to dump the problem of improving 
education in everyone's lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan to take effect when Fillmore schools reopen Aug. 4, the district 
is enlisting the help of the entire community -- including businesses, churches 
and parents -- to raise expectations of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools blame society," said Mario Contini, the recently appointed 
superintendent who launched the campaign. "Society blames the schools, and my 
opinion is if we get everybody in this community together, there's nobody left 
to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than try to do too much too soon, however, the plan is to push students 
to improve in two main areas: homework and spelling. If students put more 
attention on these tasks, Contini said, everything else should follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people out there who might say, 'My gosh, there's so much that 
ought to go on in education and they're fooling around with spelling and 
homework,' " he said. "My feeling is that they're going to be the things that 
are going to open the door to real substantial change in the performance of 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Expectations for Achievement," the campaign drawn up by Contini and a 
group of teachers and parents will set consistent standards for homework and 
spelling that all teachers and students will be expected to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in every grade will be required to assign a minimum amount of 
homework, ranging from 10 minutes three nights a week for third-graders to two 
hours five nights a week for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in every grade will also receive lists of commonly misspelled words 
that they will be expected to spell correctly on every school paper they turn 
in -- words such as right and write for second-graders and they're and their 
for sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents will be asked to sign contracts with teachers pledging to help their 
children meet these goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Local merchants and restaurants will be urged to hire only students who 
demonstrate a record of completing their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And churches will be encouraged to recognize in their weekly bulletins 
students who meet the homework goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to send a clear and consistent message," said Susan Dollar, the 
new principal of Sespe Elementary School who helped Contini draft the campaign. 
"And I think that's real important." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many teachers have long stressed the importance of homework and 
correct spelling, some have grown frustrated after repeatedly assigning 
homework that students did not do, Dollar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you get really discouraged when you spend all that time and effort 
on preparation and a large number of children don't do it," she said. Teachers 
"gave up in frustration sometimes," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true with spelling, Dollar said. 
</P>
<P>
 While some teachers have emphasized spelling by consistently lowering the 
grades of children who turn in sloppy work, others have not. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she said, a high proportion of Fillmore students get the simplest 
words wrong, confusing witch and which , for example, and misspelling a lot as 
alot . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more carelessness than anything else," Dollar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor performance of students has showed up in the latest statewide test 
scores -- the California Learning Assessment System exams given in spring, 
1993. Fillmore students scored at or near the bottom in most areas compared to 
the other 20 districts in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore's scores have been similarly low on the most recent Scholastic 
Aptitude Test scores and in advanced placement tests for college. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we kept on seeing was really fine instruction going on, but the 
performance wasn't there," Contini said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After years of growing frustration among both parents and teachers, Contini 
decided in the spring to ask the community for solutions. In meetings with 
about 20 different groups, ranging from teachers organizations to neighborhood 
councils, Contini said he heard a common theme: Raise expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some district leaders have argued that schools in the small 
community, with about 13,000 residents, face special challenges: More than half 
of its students are poor enough to qualify for subsidized lunches, and a third 
have limited proficiency in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to use that as an excuse anymore," Contini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business leaders and parents said they think the district is on the right 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employers are going to cooperate tremendously," Fillmore Chamber of 
Commerce Executive Director Hank Carrillo said. "So many of the merchants know 
these young people or know their parents and I think that's going to be a big 
plus for the community. The advantage is that it's a small town." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Windmill, a parent who sat on a committee that gave ideas on the 
campaign, said one of the best things about the plan is that it will get 
community members more involved in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need to bring the community into ownership in the school district," 
said Windmill, who has four children in the Fillmore schools. "There's been a 
distance there, unnecessarily so. I really think maybe nobody has taken the 
time to build the links and build the ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing the campaign on spelling and homework, educators said they hope to 
generate among students a stronger sense of discipline and a pride in doing 
good work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can change the mind-set," Dollar said, the community can "make kids 
realize that all of this is very important in their success at life." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students said they welcome greater academic challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Baro was one of about six children at a Fillmore youth club this week who 
gave opinions on the upcoming campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, 15-year-old Anna said, some of her teachers at Fillmore High School 
don't require students to spell words correctly on tests and essays. Anna said 
she is about a C-plus student when it comes to spelling, but she would like to 
get better before she graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go into college," she said, "you're going to need it, right?"

EPA URGED TO ADOPT LOCAL SMOG CLEANUP PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: COUNTY BUSINESS AND 
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES SAY FEDERAL PROPOSAL COULD ACTUALLY PUT MORE 
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying a federal plan to clean up smog could do more harm than good, Ventura 
County business and government representatives urged federal officials 
Wednesday to adopt a locally written proposal instead. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing attended by an overflow crowd in Ventura, one Camarillo 
school board member said the proposed cleanup measures would cost schools so 
much in new equipment that many would be forced to discontinue busing -- 
resulting in more cars on the road and more pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 1 million of 5 million students in California ride buses to 
school," said Val Rains, a Pleasant Valley School District trustee who 
represented the California School Boards Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 "That could easily be doubled or tripled if operating revenues were 
available," Rains said. "But the federal implementation plan would have exactly 
the opposite effect on schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials called on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulators 
conducting the hearing to adopt the locally written plan, which emphasizes that 
those responsible for the most pollution bear more of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Paulger, a Procter & Gamble executive who helped draft the local 
alternative plan, said the coalition of business and agricultural leaders 
figured out a way to reduce emissions by 40% needed to meet federal health 
standards without threatening local industry or farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the same outcome as the federal plan, but with less impact on jobs," 
Paulger said. The local coalition estimates that the proposed federal plan 
would cost the county nearly 130,000 jobs if it is implemented as proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other provisions, the local plan would impose fees on all motorists who 
drive gasoline or diesel-burning cars based on the miles they drive each year. 
Such a fee would require the blessing of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's public hearing on the proposed "federal implementation plan," 
the railroad, aviation, trucking and automotive industries asked for leniency 
from the crackdown on pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Felicia Marcus, regional administrator for the EPA, opened the daylong meeting 
at the Board of Supervisors hearing room by asking speakers for constructive 
criticism of the proposed EPA plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, she said, was better than she had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thrilled by the spirit of collaboration here, that the whole group got 
together," she said. "It's a road map to a successful local plan. And if you 
have that, we're out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said the EPA will consider all viable alternatives and may incorporate 
them into the final cleanup plan. 
</P>
<P>
 She said EPA has worked closely with industries for decades, working out 
pollution rules. "The stationary sources who have been in the game for 25 years 
know we're being fair," she said. "But it's pretty clear to anyone who's driven 
behind a big rig truck that mobile sources have not been as regulated as other 
sectors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although a federal court is forcing the EPA to develop the cleanup plan for 
Ventura County, and the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas, the federal proposal 
would not be needed if the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District can 
adopt enough measures to meet federal clean air standards on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said that the EPA plan can be used as a type of backstop, offering some 
regulations that are outside local jurisdiction to bring the county's air into 
compliance with federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Mount, deputy director of the local air district, said it is unlikely 
that the county will be able to lower air pollution enough to meet health 
standards without adopting some federal measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Technical studies are now under way to find out how close local measures will 
bring the county to compliance with the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was designated as an area with a "severe" air pollution problem for 
ozone, a lung-damaging gas created when emissions from cars and industry mix in 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed federal plan calls for new restrictions on emissions from 
trucking, railroads, aircraft and shipping, none of which the local government 
can regulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroad industry, which operates both freight and passenger trains 
through Ventura County, asked the EPA to exempt some interstate trains from new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve the required emission reductions, the industry proposed to buy new, 
more efficient locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stand ready to do our fair share," said Travis Hinton, Amtrak's 
transportation superintendent for the region. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking industry opposes a measure that would limit heavy-duty trucks to 
one stop in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Local growers object to that provision as well, saying they depend on trucks 
to move their goods to market. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan has the potential to severely damage, if not completely destroy, 
Ventura County's citrus industry," said Carolyn Leavens, a major citrus and 
avocado grower. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers in the county have also objected to a provision that would regulate 
some pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Weinberg of the American Lung Assn., and Stan Greene, who spoke on 
behalf of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, reminded the group that the reason for 
the plan is public health. 
</P>
<P>
 "The latest findings have shown that nonsmokers in highly polluted areas had 
steeper decline in lung function than smokers in non-polluted areas," she said. 
"We're doing this because it's for our health." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, whose organization sued the EPA in 1988 to force the county to reach 
clean air goals, said the cost of air pollution, both to public health and 
industry, can no longer go unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be borne by those who produce it, whether it's industry, agriculture, 
or transportation. There is no going backward." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will continue to accept written 
comments on the proposed federal cleanup plan through Aug. 31. The EPA will 
then finalize its smog cleanup rules, which will be adopted in February. 
Written comments can be sent to Felicia Marcus, regional administrator, Region 
9, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, Calif., 94105.

OXNARD OFFICER CLEARED IN FATAL SHOOTING OF SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rookie Oxnard police officer who shot and killed a suspected car thief last 
April acted in self-defense and did not commit any crime, the Ventura County 
district attorney's office concluded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 2 1/2-month investigation, Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes 
found that Officer Patrick Dolan fired only after 20-year-old Alfonso Bravo -- 
an alleged gang member from Los Angeles -- pointed a gun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can hardly imagine a more life-threatening situation to a police 
officer," Holmes concluded in a 15-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police officials said they were satisfied with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the time the shooting occurred, it appeared that it was justifiable," 
Assistant Chief Tom Cady said. "I think we're just very lucky the officer 
wasn't injured in the incident. The facts show that he was in great danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan, who had only been on the force nine months at the time of the shooting, 
could not be reached for comment Wednesday. He was placed on paid leave for 
about two weeks after the shooting and then returned to duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo, a Van Nuys resident, stole a 1988 Mustang GT from a Studio City parking 
garage on April 18, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Dolan spotted him driving the car erratically near Silver Strand 
beach in Oxnard about 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-mile high-speed chase, Bravo jumped out of the car on Wooley 
Road while the vehicle was still running and Dolan went after him. The car 
jumped a curb and crashed into a concrete wall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who later searched the Mustang found the car's ignition had been torn 
out, the exterior lock on the driver's side had been removed, and an anti-theft 
device was lying on the passenger's seat, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan ordered Bravo to stop, but he continued to flee through the residential 
area. After Bravo climbed a wooden fence in the 3000 block of Taffrail Lane, 
Dolan attempted to follow suit when he saw Bravo crouched in the side of the 
yard, pointing a gun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan said he fell back onto the street side of the fence, crouched, and fired 
three shots through the fence in self-defense, according to the report. 
Investigators later determined he actually fired four shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after he heard Bravo say, "I'm shot," and groan, Dolan called the 
police dispatcher and other officers arrived at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Bravo apparently tried to scale another fence and escape but 
was injured too badly. He fell inside the fence, dropping his gun -- which was 
loaded and cocked with the safety removed -- on the other side, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
 He was found dead by police shortly afterward. An autopsy found that Bravo 
died of gunshot wounds to his torso, thigh and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviewing witnesses, including relatives of Bravo, and examining 
coroners' and police investigators' reports during his probe, Holmes concluded 
that the case was a justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officer Dolan knew that he had cornered a fleeing felon who suddenly produced 
a firearm and pointed it at him," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a passage on Bravo's background, Holmes said the dead man was known to 
carry guns and had been considered a suspect in a series of armed robberies in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The activities attributed to Mr. Bravo on April 25, 1994, are perfectly 
consistent with his past behavior," Holmes wrote. "Bravo was a known member of 
the Valerio Street gang with a nickname of 'Temper,' which even he acknowledged 
was well-deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes added that when a coroner's investigator described the circumstances of 
Bravo's death to the man's mother, she responded that "knowing her son, she 
believed he would have shot the officer."

ARTS PLAZA CAN SURVIVE 6.5 QUAKE, ENGINEER SAYS; THOUSAND OAKS: THE DESIGNER 
TELLS RESIDENTS THAT THE COMPLEX EXCEEDS STATE CODES. 'THESE BUILDINGS ARE NOT 
GOING TO COME APART.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 So strong, in fact, that it could stand tall even if a 6.5-magnitude 
earthquake tore through the bedrock under its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what structural engineer John A. Martin Jr. believes. And he's willing 
to bet his life on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who designed the Civic Arts Plaza's seismic braces, said he would 
"have no concern at all being in the office building or the auditorium during 
an earthquake." If he were in the City Hall side of the complex during a quake, 
he said, "the biggest damage would probably be from falling stacks of books." 
</P>
<P>
 In a half-hour presentation designed to quell residents' concerns about the 
Civic Arts Plaza's quake-worthiness, Martin said he had designed the complex to 
be even sturdier than state codes mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These buildings," he told the council, "are not going to come apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin praised the garage design as well, because the concrete was poured on 
the site itself, rather than precast and trucked over in pieces. The Northridge 
quake revealed that prefabricated garage pieces can split apart during intense 
shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've heard," Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said, "it's as structurally 
sound as a building can get." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials invited Martin to discuss the Civic Arts Plaza's seismic 
safeguards after several residents expressed fear that a violent quake could 
crumple the 10-story tower and its five-level parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 After January's 6.8-magnitude earthquake flattened many buildings in 
Northridge, some Thousand Oaks residents worried aloud about the faults that 
crisscross the Conejo Valley. If a quake were centered in Thousand Oaks, they 
asked, how would local buildings fare? 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Civic Arts Plaza engineers said they had designed the complex to 
stand up to a 6.5-magnitude quake centered in Thousand Oaks -- a seismic event 
that geologists think could happen only once in about 475 years. Scientists 
recommended that he design the building for a quake of that magnitude based on 
their analysis of the area's geology. The building's performance in a larger 
quake would depend on the location of the fault and the magnitude of the quake, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building sits on solid bedrock, which holds up much better in a quake than 
shifting sandy soil, Martin said. But engineers faced other challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an auditorium's physical layout and acoustical requirements, 
structural engineers often have a tough time shoring up a theater to meet 
seismic standards. They cannot plop concrete pillars in spots that would block 
the audience's view of the stage, for example, and they cannot brace balconies 
with bulky supports. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we structural engineers had our way," Martin said, "we'd have all 
buildings be boxes with no windows." 
</P>
<P>
 But to accommodate theater design, Martin and his colleagues tinkered with 
stress points and incorporated the most up-to-date seismic safeguards. They 
then tested their theories with a computer-simulated quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that God can mobilize more force than we can (mobilize) steel," 
Martin said. "A building's performance (during a quake) depends not so much on 
strength as on how it's designed and where (supports) are placed."

PORT HUENEME ADOPTS NEW TAX TO FUND POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the urging of city residents, the Port Hueneme City Council Wednesday night 
agreed to adopt a utility tax to raise money needed to keep the city's 
independent police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 4-0 decision was met by cheers and applause from residents who 
packed the council's chambers. Mayor Orvene Carpenter abstained from the vote 
because he said he has difficulties taxing people on utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than I expected," said Port Hueneme Police Chief John Hopkins. 
"I am thrilled to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the council directed city staff to draft a utility tax that 
would be tacked onto bills for water, electricity, gas and cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 The council did not set a specific rate for the tax, but instructed city 
workers to figure out what it would take to raise the $500,000 a year the city 
needs to maintain its 19-officer Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's decision comes after a property tax measure fell just shy of 
the two-thirds majority needed for approval in the June 7 election. The tax was 
designed to raise enough revenue to save the Police Department from closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to approve the utility tax after about 150 residents 
crowded the council chambers to urge council members to preserve the city's 
independent police force. "I beg you, do not take our Police Department away," 
said Robin Streuber, a longtime Port Hueneme resident. "For the sake of our 
children and senior citizens, keep them."  
</P>
<P>
 Several residents urged council members to impose a tax on residents, even 
though city voters rejected a property tax in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a retired senior citizen on a fixed income, I oppose (new) taxes," said 
Geraldine Woody, a Port Hueneme resident for 38 years. "But I urge the council 
to pass the utility tax because I firmly support our local Police Department."  
</P>
<P>
 The council has been considering a utility tax ever since Measure Z fell short 
of the two-thirds majority needed for approval. The property tax was designed 
to raise the $500,000 a year required to fund the city's police force. 
</P>
<P>
 When it takes effect in the fall, a utility tax will be applied on services 
for water, electricity, gas and cable television. But City Manager Richard 
Velthoen said the council will have to determine the rate of such a utility 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen said it will be several weeks before city staff return to the council 
with a final draft of the proposed utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has a utility tax and charges its residents 5% on cable television, 
telephone, electricity and gas services, which brings the city more than $5 
million a year, said Kaye Mirabelli, a Ventura city official. But a similar 
rate in Port Hueneme would generate far less because it has less than 
one-quarter Ventura's population. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also considered other options, including shutting down the Police 
Department and contracting for less-expensive police services from the county 
Sheriff's Department or neighboring Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, council members received more than 480 letters from 
residents urging them to save the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 100 residents who make up the Save Our Port Hueneme Police 
Department committee have mounted a public relations campaign in recent weeks 
to win support of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 With donations from local businesses and residents, they paid more than $300 
to run ads in newspapers. One of the ads asked residents "to make the will of 
the people a reality" by cutting out a printed letter to the council, signing 
their names and mailing it to City Hall.

3 YOUTHS MUST STAND TRIAL IN WESTLAKE BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three 16-year-old youths must stand trial for participating in a violent 
February brawl that left two Westlake High School students hospitalized with 
gunshot wounds, a Ventura County judge ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark, who listened to three days of 
testimony during the preliminary hearing, dismissed two firearms charges 
against one of the youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark ruled that prosecutors failed to present sufficient evidence that 
defendant William Huang helped in the shootings during the Feb. 3 melee. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, however, refused to drop an assault charge against Huang, of 
Rowland Heights in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Asian American youths were charged in the brawl, which focused community 
attention on youth violence in Thousand Oaks. The fourth defendant, James Lee, 
16, of Thousand Oaks, is a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee began after Westlake High football player Curtis Simmons and Lee 
agreed to meet at North Ranch Park after school for a fistfight to settle a 
long-running feud, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons arrived at the scene with dozens of backers, many of them fellow 
football players, and Lee showed up with five carloads of supporters, some 
armed with sticks, bats and guns, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's supporters emerged from their vehicles, announcing: "We're the Asian 
Mafia," then attacked Simmons and his friends with the weapons, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Lee and Huang, authorities charged John Yi of Thousand Oaks and 
Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet of Brea in Orange County. Those four were 
charged because they -- unlike others at the brawl -- had weapons, prosecutors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their ages, the defendants were all ordered to be tried as adults by a 
Ventura County judge. Shortly after that decision, Lee, who had been released 
on $5,000 bail, failed to appear in court. Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Vanarelli 
said authorities believe Lee -- who was facing two charges of assault -- and 
his family have fled to their native Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonethanouphet and Huang have been at Juvenile Hall since shortly after the 
shooting. Yi posted $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonethanouphet was ordered to go to trial on two counts of assault with a 
firearm for allegedly shooting football players Scott Smith, 16, and David 
Behling, 17, both of whom required hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi will face trial on four felony counts, the most of any of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with assault with a firearm for allegedly shooting 16-year-old 
Jarad Kline, who was not hospitalized. Yi also faces charges for allegedly 
shooting at an occupied vehicle, discharging a firearm with gross negligence 
and possession of a firearm on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yi's attorney, William T. Graysen, contended in court that his client was at 
the park to help Curtis Simmons. Graysen denied that Yi arrived with the other 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Graysen, Yi fired his .25-caliber handgun in the air only to 
distract other youths who were pounding Simmons with blunt objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight starts, baseball bats are taken out, Curtis Simmons is on the 
ground having his head smashed in and John Yi fires," Graysen said. He said Yi 
"saved the life of Curtis Simmons." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonethanouphet's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Donna L. Forry, acknowledged 
that her client also fired a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said prosecutors failed to prove that he is the person who shot Smith 
and Behling. And, she said, any shots he fired were in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, prosecutor Vanarelli declined to comment on the judge's 
decision to drop two of the three charges against Huang. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listened very closely to the evidence," Vanarelli said of the judge. 
"That's all I've got to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark scheduled arraignment in Superior Court for Aug. 3.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY CONTRIBUTION TO CHAMBER DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last six months, staff members at the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce 
spent 56 hours preparing information about Thousand Oaks apartment vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 They also took 27 hours to discuss the city's hotels with potential 
visitors.And they devoted 25 hours to helping senior citizens find services. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that work, they expect to be paid. By Thousand Oaks taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the chamber's $1-million annual budget comes from membership dues. But 
for more than a decade, the city has offered its own contribution, to help pay 
for public service work such as compiling city data and logging consumer 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, city officials have proposed paying the chamber $19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the payment came up for a vote this week, Councilwomen Elois Zeanah 
and Jaime Zukowski balked. Suggesting that the chamber's work could be 
performed just as effectively in-house, they urged city staff to consider 
taking on more public service duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members will write a memo on the issue and report back to the council 
within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Chamber Executive Director Steve Rubenstein is furious. He 
said he views the city contribution as a symbol of support for the local 
business community and the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all we do," he said, "I guess we're unappreciated." STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 'STOLEN RECIPE' GIVES KIDS THEIR DAY 
IN COURT

<P>
 A trial was held in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was testimony from a fingerprint expert. Lawyers cross-examined 
witnesses. The defendant presented an alibi. And defense strategy was debated 
quietly in the corner of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the drama and tension of a classic whodunit, two dozen third- and 
fourth-graders acted out the case of the stolen chocolate recipe Wednesday in a 
summer class at the Conejo Valley Adult School. 
</P>
<P>
 The mock trial, which is part of a series of summer classes that teach 
everything from art to public speaking to law, was held with the aid of a 
Conejo Valley sheriff's deputy and a Westlake Village attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the formality of a real trial, the children all rose when Zachary 
Kramer, 8, entered the room dressed in a judge's robe. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the way through the trial's first day -- it will continue today -- the 
children read from scripts to keep them on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't understand every aspect of this," said Scott Woodman, the attorney 
who volunteered to supervise the trial. "But it's amazing how much they did 
pick up on." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the children, this classroom court was their first exposure to the 
process used to conduct a trial and the concepts upon which trials are based -- 
including the notion that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how any of this worked before," said Jean Parks, 7, who is 
playing the role of the defendant in the case. "I didn't know that the 
defendants got their own lawyer, but I'm glad that they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Brayer, the teacher who runs the class, said many of the children 
expressed interest in the mock trial because of the publicity surrounding the 
O.J. Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in with a whole vocabulary picked up by watching the O.J. Simpson 
trial on television," Brayer said. "Unfortunately, they all want the death 
penalty for this person who stole a chocolate recipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a jury will decide whether Parks is innocent or guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Brayer said, Parks will be allowed to participate in the 
post-trial celebration -- when the students dispense with formality, unseal 
Exhibit A and cook up a batch of the controversial chocolate. MATTHEW MOSK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months before the general election in November, Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley) is trouncing Democratic challenger Kevin Ready in campaign 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who is seeking his fifth term, had $149,217 in his campaign account 
as of June 30, according to recently filed campaign finance reports.In 
contrast, Ready, a Santa Barbara County deputy counsel, had $169. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his huge financial advantage, Gallegly said he is not taking his 
opponent lightly.  
</P>
<P>
 "I will continue to take (Ready) as seriously as I would any candidate," said 
Gallegly, whose district covers all of Ventura County except for most of 
Thousand Oaks. "If I ever fail, it will not be due to complacency." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ready said he is undaunted by Gallegly's fund-raising prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an incumbent, he's going to have an enormous advantage in collecting 
money," said Ready, who spent $9,170 to win the Democratic nomination in June.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL EXTENDS RENT-CONTROL LAW

<P>
 To the delight of mobile home owners, Thousand Oaks council members have 
agreed to extend a rent-control ordinance through the fall of 1999, thereby 
protecting hundreds of senior citizens from skyrocketing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent-control ordinance, originally adopted in 1980, sets a formula 
limiting rent increases at mobile home parks to a percentage less than annual 
inflation as defined by the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
 With rents approaching $500 a month in some parks, mobile home residents 
implored council members to hold the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a matter of just dollars and cents," mobile home resident Ed 
Conway said. "I beg you people to consider the human impact." 
</P>
<P>
 But park owners asked the council to rethink the price controls, noting that 
their water and utility costs have soared in recent years. They also warned 
that they might have to defer improvements at the mobile home parks unless the 
rent-control law changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, if you want these parks to be well-maintained and stay part 
of your affordable housing stock," park landlords must be allowed more freedom, 
said Bill Schweinfurth, who owns Vallecito Mobile Estates in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members rejected the landlords' arguments, to the applause and 
cheers of about 125 senior citizens in the audience. The council voted 4 to 0, 
with Councilwoman Judy Lazar absent, to extend the rent-control law for another 
five years. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 A fire sparked by a low-heat oven charred a classroom and lab at Ventura 
College on Wednesday, causing an estimated $45,000 in damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance workers reported the blaze in the agriculture building about noon 
after a college instructor noticed smoke pouring from the east end of the 
locked building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see flames inside the room and there was quite a bit of smoke," 
maintenance worker Conrad Rieder said. "I unlocked the door and tried to turn 
the lights on, but they didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city firefighters extinguished the flames within minutes of arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Glenn True, who investigated the blaze, said a small crack in an oven 
used to dry plant samples caused the fire. For three weeks, the crack had 
allowed heat to escape, drying out the counter beneath the oven and sparking 
the fire on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long-term process," True said. "It didn't happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Flames charred several microscopes sitting on a counter near the oven and 
heavily damaged cabinets containing glassware for experiments. Smoke blackened 
the classroom's walls and several wooden tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The agriculture building sits on the northeast edge of the campus near Loma 
Vista Road. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; STATE SUPPORT SOUGHT FOR VETERANS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council will ask state officials to consider 22 acres on the 
city's eastside for a state-funded veterans nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted this week to send a letter inviting state officials to 
inspect the site, southeast of Telephone Road, between Saticoy Avenue and Wells 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 If the officials like what they see, a 400-bed nursing home for veterans could 
be built, bringing up to 400 jobs to Ventura at no cost to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch is that the city does not own the land in question -- developer Eric 
Wittenberg does. He's willing to donate the land to the city, which in turn 
would donate it to the state. In exchange, Wittenberg wants the city's 
permission to build 439 homes on 33 adjoining acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg seeks to build 50 homes in 1998, 50 homes in 1999, and the rest 
after the year 2000. That would mean allotting him nearly 10% of all the 
housing allocations available in Ventura through 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need the jobs here," the Newport Beach-based builder told the 
council Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for jobs, for clean industry," Carson said. "In the past, we 
have blown some opportunities. I think we need to go before (the state 
officials) and be positive." CONSTANCE SOMMER

<P>
 Oxnard residents will once again be able to recycle used motor oil, latex 
paint, and other types of hazardous household waste under a new collection 
program starting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Bailard Landfill Recyclable Household Hazardous Waste Station closed 
in January, Oxnard residents have had no way to safely dispose of such 
household wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Regional Sanitation District will operate a recycling station at 
the landfill, 4105 Gonzales Road, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the second Thursday

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; AMBULANCE CONTRACT COMPETITION IS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura officials agreed this week to allow city firefighters to compete for a 
contract to provide ambulance service in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Irvine-based Careline holds the contract with the county to serve 
Ventura residents through June 30, 1996, said Barbara Brodfuehrer, the 
administrator of the county's emergency medical services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But the supervisors are considering opening that contract up to competitive 
bid as early as this fall, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura firefighters argue that the city should have the contract because 
firefighters often arrive first on an emergency scene, but don't get to collect 
from the patients' insurance companies since it is the private ambulance 
service which transports people to hospitals.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the city of Ventura's Fire Department can deliver paramedic services 
better and faster to the city than (private firms)," Capt. Rod Smith told 
council members this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how the city organized its ambulance service, firefighters say 
Ventura could generate between $350,000 and $1.3 million in revenues in the 
first five years of operation. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FREEWAY ON-RAMP IDEAS WILL BE SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura will schedule a public meeting on the design of a southbound freeway 
on-ramp at Seaward Avenue, following heated objections by nearby residents to a 
design proposal submitted by the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caltrans sketch calls for widening the Seaward Avenue freeway overpass and 
constructing a southbound on-ramp on Peninsula Street.Caltrans expects to spend 
$9.5 million on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The new on-ramp, which would replace the one now on Seaward Avenue, is 
designed to relieve the congestion at the crowded Seaward Avenue-Harbor 
Boulevard interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of the Ventura Keys oppose the redesign because they fear it 
will generate more traffic in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will cause excessive noise pollution and a further drop in property 
value" in the community, Peninsula Street resident David Hefferich told the 
Ventura City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because council members felt they needed more public input on the issue, they 
said they will schedule another meeting at which residents may again offer 
suggestions for what the on-ramp should look like. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; ELY WILL NOT SEEK REELECTION TO COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a need to finish school and spend more time with her family, first-term 
Councilwoman Margaret A. Ely said Wednesday that she will not seek reelection 
to the Santa Paula City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life is too hectic," said Ely, 48, a Ventura College student who plans to 
transfer to Cal State Northridge to pursue a psychology degree."I'm still a 
single mother. I'm trying to go to school and work, and that requires a lot 
more time than I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely, who works as an assistant in the Ventura County public defender's office, 
said she is proud of the city's accomplishments since her election in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a wonderful experience," she said. "In the four years I've been on 
the council, we've done some of the best things the city has ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely cited an increase in senior housing, the newly opened VISTA bus service, 
establishment of more citizen advisory panels and an update of the General Plan 
as some of the accomplishments during her tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the things I had hoped would come to pass, have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no one else has taken out nomination papers to run for the vacant 
seat, the city clerk said. Incumbents John Melton and Wayne D. Johnson, 
however, both have begun their reelection efforts. JEFF McDONALD

POP MUSIC REVIEW; UNEVEN EVENING FOR CHILDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toni Childs is an immensely gifted singer, but she may not be her own best 
friend when it comes to making artistic choices. Six years after her appealing 
debut, "Union," written primarily on her own, she's come up with an ambitious 
and sorely misguided concept album that any reasonable collaborator would have 
talked her out of. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Woman's Boat," played almost in its entirety and in order, provided the 
gist of Childs' wildly uneven show Tuesday at House of Blues. The song cycle 
emblematically charts a human life from beginning to end, and what passed for 
life between "Womb" and "Death" often consisted of light, not overly tuneful 
world-beat/rock rhythms. They were an undercurrent for successions of 
overwrought and underwritten statements about existence and earnest expressions 
of universal Angst whose baldly primal nature didn't quite substitute for 
songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 The full house nonetheless lapped up the latest offerings from the sultry 
beauty, whose unique chops -- at her best, she's a bona fide white soul singer, 
somewhere between Phoebe Snow and Johnette Napolitano -- can sometimes sell 
even questionable material. Childs wasn't beyond overreaching vocally, too, 
turning her hit "Don't Walk Away" (one of five older numbers) into 
nodule-scratching overkill, but the singer also proved capable of investing 
quieter numbers with a subtlety that made them as touching as intended.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; BUCK: JUST PRICELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who was at the Crazy Horse Steak House on Tuesday is undoubtedly still 
grinning like the cat that ate the canary. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that the canary warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Those lucky fans had ringside seats at a once-in-a-lifetime show, akin to what 
Barbra Streisand lovers are paying $350 for, and superstar tenor-lovers forked 
over $1,000 for last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 And these folks didn't have to spend a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 What did they get? Just Buck Owens, one of the true giants, in a staggering 
53-song, three-hour (no intermissions) free show at which the audience called 
most of the tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 With a set that expansive, it was no surprise that Owens managed to include 
virtually all of his hits. He also provided a wondrous dose of offbeat choices 
from his extensive catalogue and still had time for a good sampling of songs by 
fellow Bakersfield-sound architect Merle Haggard, plus snatches from Chuck 
Berry, Ray Price, Randy Travis, Steppenwolf, the Surfaris and even Santo & 
Johnny. 
</P>
<P>
 The icing on this unusually tasty and nourishing cake came when Owens 
encouraged those at the tables in front of the stage to clear a spot so people 
could dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Club owner Fred Reiser, who has been booking top-name country acts into the 
Crazy Horse for 15 years, grinned and shook his head in amazement as he gazed 
out at his dance floor full of two-steppers -- with Buck Owens & the Buckaroos 
serving as his house band, playing request upon request. 
</P>
<P>
 When Owens invited the folks to ask for anything, they really took him at his 
word. After all, when would they ever get another chance to have Buck Owens 
serenade them with "Happy Birthday" or a snippet of "The Anniversary Waltz," 
which is just what he did. 
</P>
<P>
 The dancers on the floor seemed to give Owens an extra shot of adrenalin, and 
it didn't seem to bother anyone when he reprised a couple of numbers for the 
boot-shakers that he'd already covered earlier in the show.  
</P>
<P>
 The concert -- a last-minute booking -- was a shakedown run for a trip Owens 
and the band will be making this week to Europe. But the "shakedown" turned out 
to be three times as long as the entire overseas gig. Bassist Doyle Curtsinger 
said after the show that the European tour is to consist of a one-hour set at a 
country-music festival outside Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been two years since Owens performed anywhere live. Given the long 
layoff, and the fact that he turns 65 next month, he might reasonably have been 
expected to ease off and to use this free test run simply to get his wind back. 
</P>
<P>
 His years showed -- in a face more weather-beaten than the rock piles in 
Monument Valley, and in 30- to 40-minutes of rough-around-the-edges vocals and 
nervous joking at the outset. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He opened with "Act Naturally," his signature behind-the-beat phrasing intact 
but his voice sounding somewhat restricted, as if he were battling a cold. But 
after a while, out came the taut, back-of-the-throat vocals that make his 
records instantly recognizable, and the years seemed to melt away. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point, he settled into peak form and appeared determined to give 
Bruce Springsteen a run for his money. He checked his watch periodically, but 
the time didn't seem to matter. Either the watch was broken, or he simply was 
waiting for the date to change. 
</P>
<P>
 He sang "Under Your Spell Again," "Sam's Place," "Together Again," "Love's 
Gonna Live Here," "Cryin' Time," "Streets of Bakersfield," "I've Got a Tiger by 
the Tail," "Close Up the Honky Tonks" . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The surprise choices included "Buck's Polka," an instrumental from 1964 in 
which, after allowing guitarist-steel player Terry Christoffersen to handle 
most of the solos, Owens let loose with a display of his own considerable 
guitar chops; "In the Palm of Your Hand," the B-side of his 1966 single 
"Waitin' in Your Welfare Line," played at the behest of and in harmony with 
guest singer Herb Pedersen; and a thoroughly straight reading of the 
traditional "Long Black Veil," and he never so much as winked at the song's 
melodramatics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckaroos -- Christoffersen, Curtsinger, keyboard player Jim Shaw and 
drummer Jim McCarty -- went even further afield, venturing Steppenwolf's "Born 
to Be Wild," Elvis' "Heartbreak Hotel" and, with Christoffersen on pedal steel, 
an exquisite rendition of Santo & Johnny's 1959 instrumental "Sleep Walk." 
</P>
<P>
 To see a musician of Owens' stature shaking off the dust and rediscovering the 
primal joy of making music was as much an honor to behold as a pleasure to 
watch -- and enough to make even the most cynical viewer believe anew that the 
best things in life really are free.

JAZZ REVIEW; SINGER JULIE KELLY RISES ABOVE THE DIN AT SPAGHETTINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a common sight at most popular watering holes where people come to unwind 
after work. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of women, neatly dressed, come in and stake out a corner where they 
indulge in an animated exchange. Naturally, they get attention from other 
patrons, sometimes sharing small talk and a couple of laughs with those seated 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what singer Julie Kelly and pianist Karen Hammack did Tuesday 
at Spaghettini, only this wasn't clock-out time for them. It was work, though 
you'd never think of it as that considering the way they carried on. 
</P>
<P>
 Their corner was the one with the piano and Kelly was singing standards with a 
lot of South-of-the-Border flavor. But the exchange between Kelly and Hammack 
was as lively as any in the room, and believe me, there was a lot of lively 
discussion going on. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the happy-hour holdover crowd often treated the two musicians as just 
another pair of patrons. If, during their first set, the two often seemed in 
competition with the noisy crowd, they didn't seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some songs that will go just perfectly with all the things you're 
talking about," Kelly announced above the din as she opened the first set. And 
she was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly introduced "I've Never Been in Love Before" by explaining that she met 
her husband shortly after once doing the number. That seemed to make two 
singles sitting close by perk their ears. 
</P>
<P>
 From there she went on to demonstrate her fine scatting ability, taking off 
from the word "never" and improvising in almost saxophone-like tones with 
wordless syllables as Hammack supported her with softly stated chords. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, a vocal instructor at the Musicians' Institute in Hollywood who will 
release her second album for the Chase Music Group, "Stories to Tell," in 
August, proved again why she's one of the handful of Southern California female 
singers worthy of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with warm, pleasant tones, she applied sophisticated rhythmic 
treatments to songs from Duke Ellington, Cole Porter and Johnny Mercer without 
reliance on gimmicks or stylistic high jinks. Each phrase was clearly 
enunciated and delivered in a straightforward way. 
</P>
<P>
 She's especially adept at Brazilian rhythms. On Luiz Bonfa's "Gentle Rain" she 
developed a melancholy mood inside the swaying pace, while Hammack responded 
with a series descending lines that swirled like an autumn mist. Cole Porter's 
"I Love You" was done with a samba flavor, bringing an invigorating twist to 
the well-worn piece. Her best efforts came on a pair of tunes from Antonio 
Carlos Jobim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hammack, who played earlier this year at Spaghettini with vocalist Stephanie 
Haynes, proved an able accompanist, tracing mere shadows of the tunes behind 
the singer before developing more detailed improvisations on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Nobody Else but Me," she echoed Kelly's phrasing in call-and-response 
style. And no matter how long Kelly extended the conclusion of the song, 
Hammack followed gamely, adding just the right dynamic touch before drawing the 
tune to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of interplay was the evening's biggest reward as the women showed 
attention and empathy for each other's efforts. When "Nobody Else but Me" 
started off on the wrong rhythmic foot, Kelly laughed and said she would start 
again. Hammack, not missing a beat, kept the song flowing until the singer 
dropped in just so. Both were especially responsive as they stretched the 
endings of tune after tune into extended displays of teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the second set began and the happy-hour hors d'oeuvres had been 
put away, Kelly and Hammack had become the center of attention. And they 
deserved to be.

WESTSIDE WATCH: DESPITE NAFTA, HARMAN GETS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last fall, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor tried his best to persuade 
Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) to support the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though President Clinton called her as the vote approached, she never 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pact signed, sealed and delivered, it looks like they've let bygones 
be bygones. Last week, Kantor was stumping for Harman at a $500-a-plate 
fund-raiser in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enthusiasm for the congresswoman to come back," he said after the 
luncheon. "I wouldn't be here otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor noted Harman was an early opponent of NAFTA, even during her 1992 
election race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harman's opponent, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks, issued a 
press release on Kantor's visit, calling it "extremely ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 "One person endorsed the pact and supported free trade, the other spearheaded 
the fight against free trade," Brooks said. "Either Kantor or Harman is very 
hypocritical." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, said it was the pact -- not free trade -- that she opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends can disagree," Harman said. "My opposition was we should do a better 
NAFTA, not that we shouldn't have a trade agreement." 
</P>

 UNNAMED SOURCES: When you are a council member in the second largest city in 
America, it can be difficult to keep straight the names of all those 
bureaucrats, constituents and community leaders that you deal with every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude, who had such trouble during a 
recent council discussion on a plan by a coalition of churches and synagogues 
to use city funding for an anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the organization was at the podium when Braude arose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. McAllister," he said, getting no response. "Mr. McAllister," Braude said 
louder, still unable to get the man's attention. "Mr. McAllister, would you 
please look at me when I'm speaking to you," he said, almost shouting.  
</P>
<P>
 "My name is Mr. Fitzgerald," answered Greg Fitzgerald, the director of Hope in 
Youth, as some observers in the council chamber bit their tongues to keep from 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>

 WHAT UNITY?: Post-primary Republican Party unity is still proving elusive in 
the 24th Congressional District, where attorney Richard Sybert got 47% of the 
vote in June to win the GOP nod to run against U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), whose district includes parts of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than a month has elapsed since the primary, several of Sybert's 
GOP peers have yet to lend support for their party's standard-bearer as he 
prepares to go against Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking consultant Bob Hammer reaffirmed this week that he will not back 
Sybert and real estate broker Emery Shane is taking a similar position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong -- I'm not supporting Beilenson either," said Shane, who 
got 8% of the vote. "The big dilemma for me is this: I feel Beilenson is 
honestly wrong in his politics but Sybert is a guy I can't trust, even though I 
agree with him on a number of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer, who came in second with 17% of the vote, said of the Sybert campaign: 
"I acknowledge that they ran a clever campaign, but it was not one designed to 
unite the party afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a contrary stance was public relations man Mark Boos Benhard, an aide 
to former Rep. William Dannemeyer, who scored 12% of the vote in the June 7 
primary. Benhard, who allied himself with right-wing Republicans during the 
race, said he would encourage all Republicans to back the party's nominees in 
November. "And that includes Sybert," Benhard said this week. On the other 
hand, Benhard said, no one from Sybert's camp has approached him to help out.

BELIZEAN BEAT; IMMIGRANTS BRING VIBRANT MUSIC AND ART TO SOUTH-CENTRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is sweltering outside, and as they do on most Saturday afternoons, the 
Belizeans gather at the Caribbean Market with their chairs and stools, their 
lilting accents and their staunch opinions.  
</P>
<P>
 Painted on the store's outside wall behind them is a fading Caribbean scene: 
palm trees, mountains and fishing boats in azure water. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 miles away from Belize, the Caribbean Market sits in the heart 
of a burgeoning Belizean community in the Crenshaw District and South-Central 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Though their numbers are small compared with other ethnic groups in the city, 
Belizeans have made their presence felt in their neighborhood, infusing it with 
pulsating African-influenced music, vibrant art and distinctive West Indian and 
Latino foods such as conch, cassava, garanaches, fried plantains and 
johnnycake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason anyone can point to of why we ended up settling in this 
area. You follow somebody in your family and you usually stay in the 
community," said Paul Warren, Belize's first honorary consul in Los Angeles 
from 1984 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon you have a whole group of people settled in one place," he said. 
"I guess that's what happened with we Belizeans." 
</P>
<P>
 More Belizeans live in Los Angeles -- about 30,000 -- than anywhere outside 
Belize, a Central American country bordering the Caribbean Sea, Mexico and 
Guatemala whose 229,000 citizens live in an area the size of New Hampshire. 
Many have settled in a 10-square-mile area bordered by Adams Boulevard to the 
north, Slauson Avenue to the south, Crenshaw Boulevard to the west and Avalon 
Avenue to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this small community are more than 30 civic organizations, half a dozen 
musical bands, a radio show, three newspapers and a string of more than 50 
Belizean-owned and -operated restaurants and businesses, many of which maintain 
close ties to their native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk down Western Avenue from Adams to Vernon and it's as if you have stepped 
into a Little Belize. This short stretch has the city's largest concentration 
of Belizean eateries and businesses and reveals the greatest sense of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts with the Belizean Fish Market near Adams with its assortment of 
conch, king and jack fish, and runs past the Plum Tree nightclub near 39th 
Street, blaring with Belizean punta rock music. In between is a string of 
Belizean restaurants of simple decor, each competing with an assortment of 
piquant Caribbean dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics, patriotism and news from Belize pervade almost every store and 
restaurant, whether in casual conversation or on the bumper stickers (I Punta 
Gorda or Corazol or Orange Walk), posters or T-shirts that line the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nel and John's Belizean American restaurant near Exposition Boulevard is 
painted in the blue and white colors of the Belizean flag, and of owners Nel 
and John Wells' political party, the People's United Party, or PUP, now in 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 But politics wasn't the impetus for the exodus from Belize to the United 
States. A 1961 hurricane that nearly leveled Belize City sent the first wave of 
Belizeans to Los Angeles, where they easily settled into African American 
neighborhoods here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's when we open our mouths that you can tell there's a difference," Warren 
said with the singsong accent of his homeland, a poor country relying on a 
largely agricultural economy, where sugar cane, citrus fruit and bananas make 
up 73% of exports.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all grew up hearing that America is the land of milk and honey. So when 
you get the chance to come here, you take it and try to make the best," said 
Patrick Barrow, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow moved to Los Angeles in 1967 at age 20 to catch a piece of the American 
Dream. Now the owner of a furniture refinishing business, he started a 
recording company and heads a Belizean band, the Babylon Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the proliferation of black Belizeans here, Belize itself is a medley 
of ethnic groups: Creole, Carib, Garifuna, East Indian, Mestizo (a mixture of 
Mayan and Spanish) and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups don't always harmonize. For decades, there has been a rift between 
northern Belizeans, mainly Creoles, and Garifuna, an ethnic group whose members 
descend from Carib Indians and Africans who mainly live in the southern region 
of Belize. The Creoles looked down on the Garinagu (plural of Garifuna), whose 
language sounds distinctly African. 
</P>
<P>
 The schism between Garinagu and Creoles can be seen in Los Angeles. For the 
most part, the Garinagu have settled east of Western Avenue, while Creoles 
mainly live to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of Belizeans into Los Angeles has been so vast that many have 
rediscovered neighbors and childhood friends from their hometowns at parties, 
in musical circles and at local churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Belizean music and art are also channels to keep the culture and history of 
Belize fresh for second-generation Belizeans and younger immigrants, the 
immigrants say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although music is an important ingredient at a Belizean fete, it is the food 
that is vital for party-goers. And it is the women, mainly, who have kept this 
tradition of good cooking alive for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all born cooking and dancing, honey," said Enid Patton, playfully gyrating 
her hips as her sister, Leta Flowers, busily kneaded dough for powder buns 
(sweet scones). 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Belizeans, most of Flowers' extended family live nearby, sometimes 
down the street, at most a five-minute drive away. Easy access to the meals, 
admits Flowers' niece-in-law, Mary Barrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the food is eaten and the pots are cleaned, Flowers is still 
cooking. This time it's on the dance floor. Dressed in a flowing aqua pantsuit, 
Flowers shimmies on the dance floor of Ashton's Shatto on Slauson Avenue to 
reggae and soca music. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music, the art, the food, the dancing, it's in all Belizeans," said 
artist Greg Palacio. "We all get homesick for the country, but we all can't go 
there. Doing these things here makes sure that we never lose what we've got."

MERCHANT PAYS PRICE FOR 'CUTTHROAT' AD; RETAILING: ALTHOUGH THE FLYERS WERE 
PRINTED IN MAY, CUSTOMERS ARE FUMING OVER WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS A TASTELESS 
ATTEMPT TO CAPITALIZE ON SLAYINGS OF SIMPSON AND GOLDMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Barry Zeldes, the first inkling of trouble came half an hour after he 
opened his Brentwood men's clothing store on July 10 -- a regular customer 
phoned to berate him and say he was "ashamed" of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, another man walked into the store, Z 90049, and began 
screaming at Zeldes, concluding that the store owner should be shot. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearly two weeks since Zeldes' summer clearance advertisement appeared, 
announcing "These are cutthroat days," the 43-year-old merchant has been 
bombarded with complaints and two death threats from people who believe that 
Zeldes tried to turn the notorious slayings of Ronald Lyle Goldman, who was 
stabbed repeatedly, and Nicole Brown Simpson, who was slashed across the 
throat, into ad fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been ballistic," said Zeldes, who said that his ad, 59,000 copies of 
which were inserted in that day's Times and other papers, has nothing to do 
with the June 12 killings for which O.J. Simpson, Nicole Brown Simpson's former 
husband, will stand trial. "I spend half the day explaining myself." 
</P>
<P>
 What Zeldes, who opened Z 90049 2 1/2 years ago, explains to people is that 
the ad was conceived in January, printed in May and sent to a distribution 
center later that month. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeldes has also tried to impress upon the angry and curious that Goldman, who 
had worked for him as a model, was a friend and "a real good soul." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who knows me knows my mind doesn't work that way," said Zeldes, who 
says he attended Goldman's funeral and saw him every day when Goldman worked at 
the California Pizza Kitchen next to Z 90049 in the Brentwood Gardens mall. 
"But I'm blowing away a lot of potential customers by appearing as a sick 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that has been precisely the initial reaction of some Brentwood 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Here's someone who's trying to cash in on something very 
traumatic,' " said Suzanne Chapman, an investment banker who lives near Nicole 
Brown Simpson's Brentwood condominium. "I was ready to go down to the store and 
say, 'How dare you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the ad didn't appear until almost a month after the slayings, some 
wonder why Zeldes didn't pull the ad beforehand. Zeldes said that even when he 
reviewed the ad just days after the killings with the ad's designer, the notion 
that it could be connected with the case didn't occur to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that . . . nobody picked it up," said Zeldes, adding that 
members of his family also failed to pick up on any link. "Nobody thought about 
it until we got the first call." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman said: "If I were him, I would definitely circulate a new flyer and 
apologize. It behooves him to send out another ad." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeldes, who said his summer sale failed to attract many customers, would just 
like to take the whole thing back. "I never in my wildest dreams would benefit 
from anything so tragic," he said. "I would have pulled it in two seconds had I 
known what pain this (would have) caused."

TOPICS / MUSIC; SOME CHOPIN, THEN TO THE KITCHEN FOR TEA

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The lobby of the Bel Age Hotel is bustling on a recent weekday night as punk 
rockers and stylish matrons mingle in the trendy West Hollywood hotel. Those in 
the mood for fine jazz tend to go to the hotel's restaurant and music room. 
</P>
<P>
 But just a few steps away, in the Grand Ballroom, a very different cultural 
experience is taking place. An audience of 100 or so listens raptly to the 
strains of Beethoven, performed by the Shanghai String Quartet as part of 
L'Ermitage Foundation's private concert series. 
</P>
<P>
 An unlikely setting for classical music? Not for the growing number of 
Westsiders who find the commute to the area's big concert halls less than 
appealing and who long for a more intimate and friendlier setting in which to 
relax and simply enjoy the music. 
</P>
<P>
 In the search for comfortable and accessible concert-going, dozens of 
organizations have sprouted in the Westside, offering classical concerts in the 
comfort of private homes, lush gardens, historical settings and posh hotels. At 
these gatherings, members of the audiences can drink champagne, mingle with the 
artists and discuss the performances afterward, all without going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Some series showcase world-renowned figures; others feature local artists. 
Some offer only chamber music, but others concentrate on soloists. Some cater 
only to members or subscribers, whereas others are open to the public. But they 
all pride themselves on allowing artists to play for small audiences, the 
members of which in turn have an opportunity to be closer to the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The common goal of all the various series is, after all, to celebrate music in 
an intimate setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Such intimacy has its rewards, and some series spice their evenings with a 
little pre- or post-concert socializing, ranging from meeting the artist over 
coffee and dessert to full-fledged fetes with dancing and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being invited to a beautiful party where (flutist James) Galway 
happens to be playing," says Janet Colburn, referring to her Mozart & Co. 
series, formerly known as Magic of Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mozart & Co. concerts, usually held once a month, are expensive at $100 
apiece and are no doubt the most lavish of the alternative breed of musical 
soirees, socially speaking. Held in elegant Beverly Hills homes, they place as 
much emphasis on the food, the dress code and the clientele as on the music. 
"People have gotten married, and business deals have been made here," said 
Colburn. 
</P>
<P>
 When the series went on a brief hiatus last year, subscribers bemoaned not 
only the loss of music. "They were the most wonderful parties," said a Beverly 
Hills doctor who has attended several of the concerts. "The champagne, the 
food, there was nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the yearly subscription to L'Ermitage Foundation Performing Arts 
Series doesn't include champagne or food, but its members get to hear the cream 
of classical music performers on the eve of their performances in such hallowed 
halls as the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion or the Ambassador Auditorium in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the increased pace of life, this is an oasis," said Don Cohen, a member 
of L'Ermitage who regularly attends the concerts at the Bel Age Hotel. "This is 
convenient, eclectic and it's the way to feel like you're in the 18th Century. 
. . . It's like being in your living room." 
</P>
<P>
 L'Ermitage strives to re-create European soirees "where the audience can 
communicate directly with the artist," according to Earl Cherniak, president of 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from L'Ermitage, contributed by members, go to children's charities, 
which is one of the reasons top musicians such as violinist Maxim Vengerov and 
pianist Andre Watts are willing to perform for free. No matter how big the 
name, however, a typical concert seats no more than 120 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ima Concert series, meanwhile, caters to people whose passion is simply 
listening to chamber music. The series offers concerts for both subscribers and 
single-ticket holders (prices range from $20 to $30 a ticket) in homes and in 
public venues such as the Clark Library in the West Adams district. Not 
coincidentally, ima means "living room" in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerts at homes are more expensive but are smaller, and the price includes a 
small reception afterward. Independent of the setting, the music is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play only chamber music, because much of the literature was composed to be 
enjoyed at home with friends," said violinist Yoko Matsuda, who founded the 
series nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other similar series, where a stable group of performers, with guest 
artists, play exclusively chamber music in homes and smaller venues. Musica 
Hermosa, in Hermosa Beach, under the direction of pianist Dragana Bajalovic, 
presents "very informal and intimate recitals" at homes that patrons volunteer 
for the occasion. Bajalovic, however, wants to expand her series to public 
venues where more people can hear the music.  
</P>
<P>
 It is also possible to create your own musical environment, as Aaron 
Mendelsohn did when he rebuilt his house in Santa Monica so it could 
accommodate a small concert hall. The halls serves as the home of the Maestro 
Foundation series, which, according to Mendelsohn, focuses on one thing: "That 
the music be of good quality. We don't serve truffles or salmon, and no one 
comes here to meet anyone. People are here for the music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Maestro Foundation's musical director, Leonard Altman, screens dozens of 
tapes and applications and decides who will play the 15 or so concerts in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Seating is limited at Mendelsohn's home -- the space was meant for 60 people, 
although regularly the number of attendees is closer to 100. The series is 
funded through member contributions and prides itself on its intimacy and in 
offering an "organic" experience, where performers share their thoughts with 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 It harks back to the concept of musicians playing for their friends, and, says 
Mendelsohn, it's an ideal way to keep chamber music alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Proudly surveying his home after a recent concert, he said: "This is the best 
concert hall in the city."

TOPICS / BRIEFLY; AIDS: PROVOCATIVE SAFE-SEX CAMPAIGN TARGETS GAY MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new campaign promoting safe sex among young gay men has been launched in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a $3,000 grant from the city of West Hollywood, the nonprofit 
health organization L.A. Shanti is distributing flyers, business cards, condoms 
and posters featuring gay men in provocative embraces designed to promote safe 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Unprotected sex is common among young men, especially men of color, said L.A. 
Shanti spokesman Paul Lerner. "Young people often have a sense of 
invulnerability and that extends even to AIDS," Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad campaign, being done free by Marina del Rey-based Hajjar/Kaufman, aims 
to grab attention with the slogan "Touching, Caressing, Arousing, Stimulating. 
Coming?" surrounded by three provocative photographs of male models embracing 
and kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted (the education campaign) to address gay men in Hollywood," said Tom 
West of West Hollywood's Human Resources Department. "The more provocative the 
better. (We want) anything that is eye-catching, to get the attention of the 
target population."

<P>
 West Los Angeles resident Roger Marshutz has received the California State 
Fair Juror's Award for his two-part multimedia work "Bruno: Ex-Gang Member" and 
"Oscar: Ex-Gang Member." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshutz's work, selected from 1,091 entries, are two 20-by-27-inch stucco 
covered boxes covered with graffiti.A photograph of Bruno and Oscar and a 
speaker hang in the front while a cassette tape player inside the box plays an 
interview with the former gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-year-old photographer said he was surprised he won. "It's not pretty 
art. It's not the kind of art you buy to hang over the couch. It makes a social 
statement. It's combative art, and a touchy subject," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Juror's Award winners received $500 and a Golden Bear trophy. Their 
work will be on display at the California State Fair in Sacramento through 
Sept. 5.

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BEVERLY HILLS: The Beverly Hills City Council has adopted a $76.6-million 
budget that Mayor Vicki Reynolds called conservative, with only slightly higher 
expenditures and anticipated revenues than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the budget for the fiscal year that began July 1 includes 
"reasonable expenditures . . . that won't deplete the level of service we pride 
ourselves on in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 The operating budget anticipates revenues of about $78.8 million, up about 
$2.2 million from last year. The increases are due to an expected $1-million 
increase in sales tax revenue, for a total of $12.8 million, and a $900,000 
increase from business license taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for most of the city's 14 departments was increased about $1 million 
to cover a 3% cost-of-living raise awarded to most of the 617 full-time city 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1.2 million was earmarked for tourism promotion, with the monies coming 
from a 2% increase in the transit-occupancy tax on hotel bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget contains $6.5 million in community assistance funding, with the 
bulk of the funds, $5.4 million, going to the Beverly Hills Unified School 
District. Included in the budget was $34.4 million in capital improvement 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects, which include water main replacements and rebuilding of a 
reservoir, are budgeted separately from the operating budget.

'OH, WHAT A PROUD MOMENT IT WAS'; SPACE: ROCKWELL EMPLOYEES CELEBRATE THE 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOON LANDING AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a Sunday afternoon, but Earl Theaker was at work when he and a group of 
Rockwell employees stood spellbound around a television to witness an event 
unfolding a world away. 
</P>
<P>
 When Neil Armstrong radioed to NASA's Mission Control, "The Eagle has landed," 
Theaker and the others exhaled. Later, when Armstrong stepped on the sandy 
surface of the moon and offered the poetic words, "one small step for a man, 
one giant leap for mankind," Theaker and his co-workers broke into thunderous 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 The shouts of jubilation were accompanied by church bells ringing throughout a 
proud nation that day 25 years ago. Around the world, more than 500 million 
people sat in front of television sets, watching grainy images of two men in 
white bulky spacesuits planting a U.S. flag on the lunar landscape with its 
black horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a quarter century to the day after the world's attention was 
riveted on Armstrong and the Apollo 11 astronauts, Theaker, now 67 and retired, 
returned to Rockwell International to celebrate the anniversary of the moon 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, which was the prime contractor for the Apollo spacecraft and the 
second stage of the Saturn V launch rocket, threw a party for about 2,000 
employees and retirees at its world headquarters here to celebrate the success 
of the first lunar landing. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities were held outdoors, complete with a band and giant television 
screen that showed films of the memorable landing and the U.S. space program. 
Gov. Pete Wilson and astronaut Edward G. Gibson, who completed 84 days in the 
Skylab space station in 1974, were the featured speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Theaker, who lives in Lomita, the giddy years between 1961 and 1971 when 
he worked in the infant space program were some of the best in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent 40 years in aerospace, but those 10 were the most exciting," said 
Theaker, who was assistant to the director of aerospace sciences at Rockwell 
before he retired 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 However, nothing before or since compares to the day when two U.S. astronauts, 
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, walked on the moon on July 20, 1969, Theaker said. 
The third Apollo 11 astronaut, Michael Collins, piloted the command module 
around the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin romped on the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Americans, the landing was a brief respite from the turbulence of the 
time. The country was bitterly divided by the Vietnam War and racial strife in 
the cities. But for a single day, the sight of two Americans on the moon 
briefly united the nation in patriotic fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, what a proud moment it was," said John Burnett of Torrance. Burnett, 64, 
and a Rockwell employee for 34 years, worked on both the Saturn rocket and 
Apollo spacecraft more than 25 years ago. "It was such an unbelievable sight. 
Many of us here could hardly contain our pride over what we had accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot understand the feeling we had. To actually see something you 
worked on going to the moon. It was such a good feeling to see this, and 
knowing that my hands touched the rocket and spacecraft. It was the best 
project I ever worked on." 
</P>
<P>
 While most Americans were able to see the moon landing live, Henry Phan, then 
a child in Vietnam, didn't see the footage until two years later. Phan, now 27 
and an aerospace engineer at Rockwell, remembered when the moon landing finally 
was shown on television in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it very well. I was a little boy and my family was watching it on 
television. It was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the decline of the aerospace and defense industries in Southern 
California, Wilson told Rockwell workers that the exploration of space will 
continue to provide jobs for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 California will be converted from "the arsenal of democracy into the launching 
pad of space discovery," Wilson said. "I am convinced that space exploration is 
our destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 The crew of Apollo 11 was honored in the White House on Wednesday and could 
not make the Rockwell celebration. But Gibson, who also was an astronaut on the 
Apollo 12 moon mission, recalled the first time he viewed the Earth from space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earth appears seamless and without boundaries," he said.

RAMS SAY THEY'LL PASS ON EFFORTS TO SAVE TEAM; SPORTS: CLUB EXECUTIVE JOHN SHAW 
EXPRESSES DISAPPOINTMENT IN WEDNESDAY'S NEWS REPORTS THAT O.C. GROUP MAY OFFER 
PACKAGE SHORT OF A NEW STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rams dumped icy cold water Wednesday on an emerging Orange County strategy 
for keeping the football team here. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, the team's executive vice president, said he was "disappointed" 
that Save the Rams, the group working to keep the team in Orange County, is 
"already switching gears and will not be able to make an offer that includes a 
new football-only stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he was responding to news reports Tuesday that the group was 
shelving plans to build the Rams a new stadium and focusing instead on giving 
Anaheim Stadium a $50-million to $70-million overhaul while building the 
California Angels a new $100-million stadium nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he believed, after an exploratory meeting with Save the Rams members 
last month, that the group planned to offer a proposal similar to those offered 
by Baltimore, St. Louis and Hartford, Conn., "one which would include a new 
football-only stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, co-chairman of the group, 
responded that it would be a mistake for the Rams to "prejudge" the group's 
proposal for upgrading the 28-year-old Anaheim Stadium. "Until Monday, my 
concept of a remodeled stadium was a new paint job. It's hardly that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Save the Rams met with a representative of HNTB, a Kansas 
City-based stadium construction firm, Monday night to hear about remodeling 
options. It was after this meeting that the group decided it could not raise 
the funds to build a new stadium for the Rams before the team accepted another 
city's offer, said members of the group, which includes about 45 local 
political and business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said it had always been the group's position "whether it's new or 
remodeled, that a football-only stadium with better sight lines, with premium 
seating, with luxury boxes and guaranteed sales, is the only one that would be 
acceptable to the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 In comments conveyed in a letter to The Times through the Burson-Marsteller 
public relations firm on Wednesday, Shaw also took issue with Save the Rams' 
efforts to round up investors to buy up to 40% of the team from owner Georgia 
Frontiere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rams owner Georgia Frontiere has repeatedly stated that the Rams are not for 
sale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That contradicts Frontiere's statement to The Times last May, however, when 
she said she was open to selling a non-controlling interest in the team should 
that figure in a deal to keep the Rams in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said no one in his group was "attempting to be presumptuous," and it 
was Frontiere's "prerogative to make decisions about ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Steinberg said, "Most owners would at least listen with interest to the 
possibility of a strong cash infusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw also made a rare reference to what the other cities courting the team 
have put on the table. He said Steinberg's comments to The Times that Save the 
Rams would have to guarantee at least 10,000 to 15,000 season ticket holders 
and a substantial number of luxury box seats fell short of what other cities 
were offering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other cities are providing seat guarantees of upwards of 60,000, and 
guarantees all club seating and box suites," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said his group "will be competitive. We are obviously exploring the 
ability to guarantee the highest possible number of seats." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said that at this time, the Rams had no timeline for when the team will 
announce its plans. A "move-related" announcement will not be made before the 
football season begins in September, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Shaw said the team remains hopeful that if Save the Rams makes a 
formal proposal, "it will be competitive to those from other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the group's proposal, which it hopes to unveil at the annual 
Rams booster luncheon Sept. 19, will "achieve the same effect and goal" of a 
new stadium. "We hope to present the Rams with an offer they won't want to 
refuse," he said.

HUBER SUSPECT THREATS RELATED; TESTIMONY: INVESTIGATOR SAYS FAMALARO HAS 
HISTORY OF ASSAULTING WOMEN. ORANGE COUNTY POLICE SAY THEY FOUND VEHICLE 
POSSIBLY USED IN DENISE HUBER'S ABDUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Appearing in court for the first time since Denise Huber's body was found last 
week in a freezer at his country club home, murder suspect John J. Famalaro 
listened impassively Wednesday as an investigator testified that the house 
painter had a history of threatening and assaulting women. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County Sheriff's Lt. Scott Mascher told a packed courtroom that 
several of Famalaro's former girlfriends had described being threatened or 
feeling threatened by him, Mascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, Mascher testified, told investigators she once was "forced down and 
handcuffed from behind" by Famalaro, 37. When investigators last week found the 
body of the Newport Beach woman -- missing for three years -- she, too, had 
been handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately following the hearing, Justice of the Peace Robert W. Kuebler Jr. 
denied Famalaro's request for bail. A grand jury was expected to indict 
Famalaro by today. If not, a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day punctuated by multiple developments in the case: 
</P>
<P>
 * Famalaro fired his attorney because of his religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investigators said they have quizzed Famalaro's brother, Warren, a convicted 
child molester who lives in Lake Forest, several times, and described him as 
"being anywhere from a witness to a suspect" in the Huber case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arizona authorities revealed deputies had visited Famalaro's house in March 
when the handyman reported a burglary, but the freezer containing Huber's body 
went undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Detectives in Orange County said they have identified a vehicle they think 
was used in Huber's abduction but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investigators still had not located at least one woman whose name was found 
in Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the grisly details of last week's discovery, Mascher told the judge 
Wednesday that Huber's body had been crammed into the freezer chest, her eyes 
and mouth covered by cotton wads and then sealed with duct tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher also testified that two witnesses had come forward with additional 
information: a man who said he once helped Famalaro measure the 23-foot-long 
freezer to see if it would fit in the Prescott Country Club home where the 
suspect lived; and a woman who said she once found an 18-inch bone while 
digging at Famalaro's house but thought nothing of it. Since the arrest, 
investigators have unearthed portions of Famalaro's house and yard in a search 
for more bodies but turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, authorities said Wednesday that they have homed in on 
Famalaro's whereabouts during the week of Huber's disappearance three years ago 
and believe they can show he was in the area at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on Famalaro's business records, receipts and interviews with people 
who saw him, investigators have confirmed that Famalaro was in the Orange 
County area on June 3, 1991, the night that 23-year-old Huber vanished after 
her car blew a tire on the Corona del Mar Freeway. Investigators also have 
collected receipts, job work orders and sworn declarations from people who 
encountered Famalaro around the time of Huber's abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a very good timeline put together," said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. 
Jerry Holloway, who is coordinating the Orange County portion of the murder 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional court records filed Wednesday indicated authorities also seized 
from Famalaro's house a wood-handled claw hammer and metal nail puller 
apparently stained with blood. A weeklong search of Famalaro's house has 
already turned up a crowbar that appears to be bloodied and some of Huber's 
belongings, including clothing, a purse and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they believe Huber was bludgeoned to death shortly after 
her kidnaping and then carted around in a freezer for more than three years. 
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said a crowbar would be consistent with Huber's 
wounds, which police have described as inflicted with a blunt but not rounded 
object. 
</P>
<P>
 Following up on a list of women's names garnered from items found during a 
search of Famalaro's home -- including identification, credit cards and 
clothing, some with crimson stains -- investigators have successfully located 
all but two. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Mascher testified that the two women were considered missing, but a 
relative of one of the women disputed that claim late Wednesday night, saying 
she is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Wattier III, the stepbrother of Melody Mendick, told The Times that 
investigators found Mendick's food stamps inside Famalaro's home. "I don't know 
how they got there. I don't know what the relationship is. But I understand 
she's OK," Wattier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by telephone, Mendick's mother, Doris Wattier, told a reporter 
"everything's fine" before hanging up. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they still want to speak with Mendick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the nature of this crime, we still have the possibility of other 
victims," Costa Mesa's Lt. Smith said. "If somebody can do this once, what 
would stop you from doing that again, once you cross that threshold?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just this month, court records revealed, authorities received a Silent Witness 
call -- an anonymous tip -- reporting that a bone had been found in Famalaro's 
house in spring, 1993, while workers were removing dirt. A woman identified as 
Marla Tollett was interviewed July 16 -- three days after Huber's body was 
found -- and told authorities she was helping Famalaro remove dirt from his 
basement in March or April, 1993, when an 18-inch bone was found -- and later 
thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 "She recalls a bone approximately 18 inches long being dug up in the process 
of removing the dirt from the area," court documents said. "This bone and other 
dirt was removed in a bucket and dumped out at an unknown location." 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach Tollett Wednesday night were unsuccessful. But Costa Mesa's 
Lt. Smith said after the hearing that police suspect the bone might have 
belonged to a large animal, perhaps a deer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was dismissed, defense attorney Lawrence William Katz repeatedly 
criticized the prosecution's case as largely circumstantial and lacking in 
evidence to prove his client is guilty -- or even that he knew about the body. 
</P>
<P>
 'He is no danger to the community," Katz said in a request for the bail 
hearing, adding that any theories that more victims would be discovered were 
"hogwash." 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's hearing, Famalaro, wearing a short-sleeved orange jail 
uniform and slip-on sandals, appeared subdued as he sat with his defense 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was leashed to a deputy -- a routine security measure in Yavapai 
County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't leave this building unless they're on a leash," Yavapai County 
Sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie Berra said. "It's sort of like a standard dog 
leash." 
</P>
<P>
 As the proceeding dragged on throughout the afternoon, courthouse employees 
padded into the courtroom, which held about three dozen seats, and strained for 
a peek. With seats at a premium, some onlookers kneeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Though members of Famalaro's family live in the area, none apparently attended 
the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In his testimony, Lt. Mascher said Famalaro was driving with his mother in a 
red Jeep when he was arrested July 13. A key to the padlocked Ryder rental 
truck that contained the freezer was found on the key ring Famalaro was using 
to operate the Jeep. A key to the freezer was found at Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher said the keys to the handcuffs used to bind Huber's hands behind her 
back were also found in Famalaro's desk, while a second pair of similar 
handcuffs was found under a bed in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another twist, Mascher said Famalaro once sought out a local Arizona 
man to help him move the freezer while he measured its dimensions to see if it 
would fit inside his home. The man told authorities the freezer was unplugged 
during the moving and measuring and later plugged back in when it was 
determined it would not fit indoors, Mascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's efforts to keep the freezer plugged in and his efforts to find a 
better spot for it point to "consciousness of guilt," the prosecution said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro had originally been held on $250,000 bail, but Justice of the Peace 
John Kennedy revoked his bail without a hearing after prosecutors argued that 
the crime was especially "depraved," that there might be other victims and that 
the crime may justify the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Yavapai County Attorney Thomas Lindberg also said investigators found a 
bullet hole and possibly blood on a white panel van to which Famalaro held the 
keys when he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Wednesday's hearing, Kennedy recused himself from the case, so the 
proceeding could be transferred to Kuebler's more commodious courtroom -- 
testament to the attention the case has garnered in an area of the country 
unaccustomed to making such headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents filed in support of his request to reinstate bail, Katz 
said that Famalaro is a "good Catholic" who attends church and deserves a 
chance at freedom while charges are pending. The attorney also cited his 
client's links to the community, lack of a criminal record and past attempts to 
become a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy in support of Famalaro's 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Kuebler said the evidence presented by the prosecution was enough 
to justify holding Famalaro without bail. "I believe the state has proved its 
case, and the defendant is held without bond," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also served as the stage for an unusual confrontation between 
defense attorney Katz, and another attorney, Thomas K. Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said he had been contacted by the Famalaro family two days ago and had 
been asked to take over the case -- in part because of the family's religious 
beliefs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctant to say much until he officially assumes the reins of the defense, 
Kelly said the family "did contact me and part of the rationale in hiring me is 
that I am Catholic." Katz is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can tell," Kelly said, "Famalaro is an Italian Catholic name. I am an 
Irish Catholic. When a person is involved in a matter of this magnitude 
(religion) is a spinoff aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kelly, who lives in nearby Prescott, he met with Famalaro 
Wednesday morning before the hearing and the defendant signed a motion 
approving the counsel swap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama wants a Catholic. No Jews allowed," Katz said later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Another figure who has emerged in the case is Famalaro's brother-in-law, Duane 
A. Thobe, whose name has surfaced in court documents as the owner of the 
Prescott Country Club home where Famalaro lived. Two days before Huber's body 
was discovered, Thobe went to the Arizona Public Service and asked that the 
power to Famalaro's house be turned off. The next day, Famalaro's mother asked 
the utility company to restore the power. 
</P>
<P>
 Thobe was a Davenport, Iowa, police officer between 1973 and 1977. 
Investigators have talked with Thobe's attorney, Eric Chester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to say, and Mr. Thobe has nothing to say," Chester said. "If I 
have anything to clear up, I will clear it up with the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have questioned Famalaro's brother, Warren, several times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at the possibility of him being anywhere from a witness to a 
suspect," Sgt. Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 While authorities continued to examine Famalaro in connection with two 
slayings in Phoenix and another in Sedona, investigators also revealed 
Wednesday that Famalaro had another recent encounter with police at his house 
in which Huber's body went undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro himself, investigators said, summoned sheriff's deputies to his home 
in March to report a burglary. According to the March 20 report filed by 
deputies, Famalaro told officers three men were attempting to break into a 
stolen rental truck in his yard, which at that time, it is believed, housed the 
freezer containing Huber's corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio, it turned out, were former employees of Famalaro's who had not been 
paid. Famalaro paid the employees while the police were there, and the incident 
was considered a closed case. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Famalaro identified himself as "Jay Samalero," and although 
"scared," did not exhibit suspicious behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lighter moment during Wednesday's deliberations, defense attorney Katz 
got Lt. Mascher to agree that most murderers would not summon police to their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 While awaiting the results of forensic tests on the items found at Famalaro's 
home -- including the crowbar -- detectives also have begun to focus on what 
happened to Huber between the time she disappeared and the time a freezer was 
delivered to Famalaro on June 12, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators and experts say the timing of her death will prove tricky 
because she has remained frozen for as long as three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway said investigators have completed searches of Famalaro's former Lake 
Forest residence and a Trabuco Road mailbox location. No search warrants have 
been necessary because authorities have received permission from owners at each 
location, Costa Mesa police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Famalaro exited the courtroom during the afternoon recess, reporters 
shouted questions to him, but Katz refused to let him speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's innocent until proven guilty," Katz said, "and that's why we're here 
right now."

GERMANS MARK GLIMMER OF NAZI RESISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the stone courtyard of the Nazi army headquarters where four officers were 
executed after a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, the German 
government on Wednesday celebrated the one day in a year of World War II 
anniversaries in which this country could take pride. 
</P>
<P>
 This was to be nothing less than reunified Germany's "Shining Day," as the 
Berliner Morgenpost called the 50th anniversary of July 20, 1944, when a young 
colonel of the General Staff, Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, placed a 
bomb in Hitler's East Prussian headquarters that injured the Fuehrer but failed 
to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl, excluded from last month's Allied D-day ceremonies, 
personally led the nationally televised commemoration of the "other Germany" -- 
the courageous individuals who actively opposed Nazi tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
 "July 20th became the epitome of German resistance against National Socialist 
barbarism," Kohl said solemnly. "The men and women of July 20th helped us 
Germans to find our way back into the community of free peoples soon after the 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as usual when Germany addresses its tortured history head-on, the shine 
was off the day long before sunrise, as controversy and passionate polemics 
overshadowed the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl was accused of exploiting the occasion for his reelection campaign by 
giving the commemorative speech himself -- instead of allowing the president to 
do so as on the 40th anniversary -- and by excluding the opposition Social 
Democrats, who were among those most persecuted by Hitler, along with Jews, 
Gypsies and Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, on television and in the national press, the country engaged 
in an intense debate over who should be considered the rightful heirs of German 
resistance: Could conservative officers be heroes if they had initially 
supported Hitler's Nazism and did not turn against him until the war was all 
but lost? What about the Communist opposition -- why should it be included 
among the honorable resistance if members fought from the safety of exile and 
turned out to be Stalinists? 
</P>
<P>
 Each side accused the other's resistance fighters of having been undemocratic 
and, therefore, ineligible for hero status. 
</P>
<P>
 And, meanwhile, there was one sad, indisputable fact underlying this occasion: 
The resistance had been minute. There was no mass movement against Hitler. 
Rather, most Germans supported the Nazis or at least went along with them. Few 
had the will or courage to fight; those who did were ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
 The "other Germany" is perhaps best illustrated in a sepia-toned photograph at 
the German Resistance Memorial Center in the old army headquarters. The photo 
shows row after row of shipyard workers in 1936 with arms raised in a Nazi 
salute; hidden among them is a lone soul whose arms are folded across his chest 
in defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 To the government's credit, the photograph leads its traveling exhibition 
titled "Against Hitler: German Resistance to National Socialism, 1933-1945," 
which opened this week at the Library of Congress in Washington. The exhibit 
will move to Los Angeles in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to exonerate Germany or to say we were a people of 
resistance," said Ekkehard Klausa, who oversees the memorial for the state of 
Berlin. "Certainly we were not. But you have to see both sides. July 20th is a 
symbol of the other Germany. . . . Tens of thousands of people went to 
concentration camps early on (for their opposition), were driven into exile or 
were members of the resistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The center's permanent exhibit includes the range of opposition: conservatives 
and Communists, Protestants and Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 Most controversial among rightists is an exhibit on the resistance-in-exile. 
It includes two photographs of the former East German Stalinist leaders Wilhelm 
Pieck and Walter Ulbricht. 
</P>
<P>
 But the memorial primarily emphasizes the July 20th attack, which Klausa says 
was the most important single act of resistance, although those officers also 
represented a minority. Out of 2,000 generals, only 22 were certainly involved 
in the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 20, Stauffenberg, 36, who had lost an eye and his right hand on the 
Russian front, planted a briefcase full of explosives in Hitler's "Wolf's Lair" 
headquarters, where the Fuehrer and officers were gathered for a military 
briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stauffenberg had time to activate only half of the explosives he brought with 
him; the bag was pushed under a solid oak table that protected Hitler from the 
blast. Four people died and the room was destroyed, but Hitler lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Stauffenberg rushed back to Berlin to organize a coup, but that effort failed. 
SS troops soon surrounded the army headquarters, and, shortly after midnight, 
Stauffenberg was executed along with three co-conspirators. In the attack's 
aftermath, about 200 other people were executed and 5,000 were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Some historians have argued that the officers' plot does not deserve such 
honor since the men were essentially authoritarians and anti-Semites who 
believed in an imperial Germany and supported Hitler until the country's defeat 
at Stalingrad. Two days before the ceremony, unidentified protesters occupied 
the memorial center saying the tribute to military officers who had been Nazis 
fed German nationalist sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Stauffenberg's son, Franz Ludwig, argued that Communists such as 
Ulbricht and Pieck should be excised from the memorial because they were "the 
worst scoundrels of German history" and that his father did not deserve to be 
in "the ugly company of tyrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the memorial argue that active opposition or resistance to 
Hitler alone qualifies Germans to be in the memorial, not their democratic 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kohl disagreed in the speech Wednesday that is likely to fuel the national 
polemic. Before a largely conservative crowd, including many German 
aristocrats, Kohl painted Stauffenberg and his cohorts as forefathers of German 
democracy, pursuers of truth and justice. And he argued that Communists had no 
place in the historical resistance memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "To entirely understand the lasting meaning of German resistance for the 
present and future, we may not limit ourselves to the question of what it was 
aimed against," he said. "We have to ask ourselves what the people who took 
part in it were for. The inheritance lies in the what for."

COMET SHOWN HITTING DARK SIDE OF JUPITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From its unique vantage point in space, the Galileo probe Wednesday relayed 
the first direct evidence from the dark side of Jupiter showing a shattered 
comet streaking into the planet's atmosphere, even as the most devastating 
salvo of comet debris yet began to pummel the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 While astronomers around the world gaped at the catastrophe unfolding in the 
heavens, the scientific fallout on Earth was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said that the 
$892-million Galileo probe, which has the only direct view of the fragments as 
they hit Jupiter's nightside, had detected the intense flare from two immense 
chunks of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 entering the planet's atmosphere. This was a 
prelude to what they hope will be actual images of the unusual shooting stars 
plummeting into Jupiter's clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 The spacecraft's light-detecting infrared photometer caught the meteoric 
streaks of Fragment H, which struck Monday, and Fragment L, which hit Tuesday, 
Terry Z. Martin, JPL science coordinator for the sensor, said Wednesday. The 
probe, which is scheduled to begin a two-year orbit of the planet in December, 
1995, was about 150 million miles from the planet when it recorded the flashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, planetary scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland 
and elsewhere around the country began to sift through mountains of data from 
the impacts. They are looking for clues to what lies in Jupiter's hidden depths 
and to the composition of comets, which scientists believe have been circling 
the solar system since creation. The results of their research will be hammered 
out in science journals and astronomy conferences for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to see how something works is to give it a poke and see what 
happens. We just gave Jupiter's atmosphere a great poke," said University of 
Arizona scientist Roger Yelle, who is analyzing spectrograph readings from the 
Hubble Space Telescope. "Eventually (by analyzing comet debris) we might be 
able to say something about the composition of the early solar system." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, scientists taking their first detailed look at the roiling clouds of 
debris have been chagrined to find no trace of water and surprised to discover 
sulfur. Preliminary analysis has also revealed ammonia, methane and, possibly, 
hydrogen sulfide. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding moisture in Jupiter's thick atmosphere is important because it would 
help confirm or refute scientists' calculations as to how the air on planets is 
formed and how it evolves. Analyzing the sulfur content could provide clues to 
the depth to which the fragments penetrated before exploding and to the yellow 
in Jupiter's colorful clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Arizona astronomers Marcia J. Reike and George H. Reike, 
however, reported via electronic mail that their observations on the 90-inch 
telescope at Steward Observatory on Kitt Peak indicate the vast dark plumes on 
Jupiter are not methane, ammonia or water from deep in the planet's atmosphere, 
but dirt and dust from the disintegrating comet. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the preliminary chemical evidence, scientists were not yet completely 
certain whether Shoemaker-Levy 9 is a true comet -- an icy cement of water, 
carbon dust and boulders from the farthest reaches of the solar system -- or a 
solid, rocky asteroid pulled out of the belt of debris orbiting between Jupiter 
and Mars, said Lucy McFadden, a University of Maryland scientist. She is 
coordinating viewing reports from observatories around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As scientists pored through printouts, the bombardment continued. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, five more fragments struck Jupiter, beginning an unusual 
combination punch. Three of the largest fragments were expected to slam into 
the same location on Jupiter's southern hemisphere 10 hours apart Wednesday and 
early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jovian rotation is 10 hours, each of the fragments will hit at 
nearly the same spot with a force believed to be equal to the impact of 
Fragment G, which on Monday produced the largest planetary explosion ever 
observed. The spreading cloud of debris, dust and hot gas is the most prominent 
feature astronomers have seen on Jupiter in 300 years of observing the planet, 
more visible even than the Great Red Spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the three major fragments, Q, apparently hit just after 1 p.m. 
Wednesday. This was expected to be followed by Fragment R 10 hours later and 
then by Fragment S 10 hours after that, at 8:12 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are mostly running around like giddy little kids," said University of 
Texas astronomer Anita Cochran at the McDonald Observatory in Ft. Davis, Tex. 
"It is so much fun to watch Jupiter change before our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sutherland Observatory in South Africa, astronomers using an infrared 
telescope late Wednesday reported a large fireball from what was believed to be 
the first of the three impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of seven images taken by astronomers at the W.M. Keck Observatory on 
Mauna Kea in Hawaii show that impact sites are still glowing from the immense 
heat of the explosions this week, even three or four days after the initial 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Kuiper Airborne 
Observatory -- a C-141 jet which has watched the comet impacts from 41,000 feet 
off the coast of Australia this week -- astronomer Gordon Bjoraker reported 
measuring extreme temperature changes at each impact point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like seeing a super nova going off . . . a star going off," he said.

ISRAEL-JORDAN MEETING PAVES WAY FOR TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam 
Majali met here at the lowest point on Earth on Wednesday to pave the way for a 
formal end to their countries' 46-year-old conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The first public summit in the region between leaders of the former 
adversaries was presided over by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
who lauded Jordan and Israel for their vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ancient land's cries for peace are finally being heard," he said. "To a 
troubled world, you send forth a simple message that exalts our vision and 
strengthens our faith -- that the scars of war can be healed, the divisions of 
memory can be overcome, peace between Arab and Jew can be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating White House talks Monday in Washington between Jordan's King 
Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, both sides hinted that they 
will announce an end to the state of belligerency that dates to Israel's 
creation in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Hussein heralded the recent progress 
in relations between the two nations as the "breaking of a new dawn." He said 
he hoped to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel as soon as possible, 
although he noted that the two sides "still have a long way to go." When 
pressed on timing of a treaty, he replied, "A month might be too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The king, whose secret talks with Israeli leaders have gone on for decades but 
never bore fruit until now, added that Jordan is prepared to move ahead without 
Syria: "We have taken a sovereign decision regarding our right to move." 
</P>
<P>
 But he made clear that Jordanians shared the Syrian goal of a comprehensive 
peace that would end all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict and in which 
Damascus would play a central role. 
</P>
<P>
 At the talks here in the Dead Sea, the Jordanian and Israeli delegations 
discussed five issues on which they hope to make progress as a foundation for 
permanent peace, senior U.S. sources said. These include plans for cooperation 
in developing areas of joint interest, roads from Jordan through Israel to 
Egypt, a framework for trade, civil aviation links and a transnational park. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the ideas on the table: an airport to serve the Red Sea tourist and port 
cities of Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel, and a canal to take water from 
the Red Sea to the Dead Sea to ease environmental, water and power problems, 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 As preliminary steps, Jordan and Israel agreed Wednesday to develop a master 
plan for developing the Jordan Rift Valley and to find means to facilitate new 
border crossings for third-party nationals, they said in a final communique. 
But much of the work they discussed will be dealt with Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the air was thick with accolades and historic claims by all 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for peace. The people desire it," Peres said at the opening 
ceremony held at a hotel overlooking the salty waters of the Dead Sea. "The 
land needs it. The Dead Sea, silent and deep, may become a symbol of new life." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that, when Christopher first raised the idea of a direct meeting 
in the region six months ago, the idea seemed impossible. Now, he noted, he has 
a sense of frustration "that we waited so long" to make peace. And of all peace 
efforts with the four Arab front-line states, negotiations with Jordan enjoy 
the greatest public support in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Majali, who also serves as Jordan's foreign minister, described the talks as 
"vital and critical moments which historians shall cherish and poets shall 
relish. They will be recorded in the annals of history in block letters, for 
they separate the age between peace and war, construction and destruction, and 
even life and death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsequent closed talks were characterized by a participant as "relaxed 
and open. Both sides have a problem-solving approach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That amiable mood offered a sharp contrast to the atmosphere that prevailed 
just nine months ago, when these talks were launched by President Clinton. In 
Washington, the United States then had to cajole low-level officials from 
Jordan and Israel to discuss basics; now, in the region, independent of 
American mediators, senior officials from the countries are conducting friendly 
conversations about a range of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 This meeting, conducted in sweltering heat, fell on the anniversary of the 
1951 assassination in Jerusalem of King Abdullah, grandfather of the current 
Jordanian monarch, who witnessed the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres paid tribute to Abdullah, who he said was the first Jordanian monarch to 
hold secret talks with Israeli leaders and laid the foundation for "a unique 
relationship -- hidden and open" that has endured erratically "even in the 
gloomy days of open warfare. . . . The silent pledge of the wise king became 
the destiny of his grandson," who, Peres said, had "demonstrated stamina in the 
face of uninvited dangers . . . and shown courage in reading impending 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 The changing relationship between the two states was reflected in vignettes 
throughout the day. A Jordanian soldier asked an Israeli official what she 
thought about being in the Arab state for the first time. An Israeli journalist 
searched all corners of the isolated hotel for a souvenir labeled "Jordan." 
When she couldn't find anything, a Jordanian gift shop attendant offered to 
write it in Arabic for her on a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Wednesday's talks, as he was leaving the Dead Sea Spa Hotel to 
take a helicopter back to Israel, Peres stopped to invite Majali to visit 
Jerusalem. "Thank you very much," the Jordanian premier replied. "When the time 
is right, we will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the precariousness of peace was also underscored Wednesday when Israeli 
warplanes hit bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southern 
Lebanon. In stark contrast to their work with the Palestinians and Jordan, the 
Israelis and their neighbors in Syria and Lebanon have not made any 
breakthroughs in their peace processes.SUMMIT CONFERENCES

REFUGEES FACE DISEASE, DEATH IN ZAIRE CAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A weeklong exodus of biblical proportions of Rwandan refugees into neighboring 
Zaire appeared to slow Wednesday, relief workers said, but deadly disease and 
hunger are growing among the estimated 2 million people who have already fled 
the tiny war-torn nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of rotting corpses -- victims of hunger, thirst, exhaustion and 
infection -- lay under rags and thin-reed mats on the streets of Goma, the 
dusty Zairian border town where 1 million desperate refugees have encamped on a 
volcanic plain amid squalor and despair. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of more than 200 men, women and children were taken by truck and 
dumped in a narrow trench dug at the edge of a banana plantation near Goma's 
airport. Survivors clambered over the gruesome pile of corpses searching for 
loved ones. Two crude crosses, cut from a tree branch, were placed on the mass 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid officials said a massive humanitarian effort had begun, but the sheer 
scope and logistical challenge of the crisis is limiting swift, effective 
relief. Digging wells and latrines, for example, has proved nearly impossible 
in the hard, rocky soil. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross said tens of 
thousands of bedraggled refugees were waiting patiently when trucks rumbled 
into the sprawling Kibumba camp north of Goma and two other smaller camps. But 
aid officials estimate that 600 tons of food are needed each day to feed the 
growing multitude. 
</P>
<P>
 With little sanitation and endless lines for clean water, aid officials said 
dehydration, severe dysentery and suspected cases of cholera already have begun 
to take a deadly toll in the teeming camps. Vicious strains of malaria are 
endemic in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people are going to die," Dr. Jacques de Milliano, president 
of Doctors Without Borders, told reporters in Goma. "It is one of the biggest 
catastrophes I have ever faced." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 300,000 refugees have also moved this week into miserable 
makeshift camps in Bukavu, about 50 miles further south along Lake Kivu, and 
Uvira on Lake Tanganyika in Zaire. Other refugees have fled in massive waves to 
neighboring Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 The staggering, weeklong migration, experts say, may be the largest sudden 
movement of refugees in modern times and has created nightmares for beleaguered 
relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions are appalling," said Panos Moumtzis, spokesman for the Office 
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. "The humanitarian organizations 
were unprepared to deal with a crisis of these proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Redding, an official from CARE International, observed: "We're talking 
about a situation that's beyond the capacity of anybody out there. The 
interventions we can make are effective, but they're limited. The sheer numbers 
tend to boggle all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the influx of refugees had slowed considerably Wednesday, after the 
border crossing near Goma was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Penelope Lewis, Nairobi spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program, said the 
agency now estimates that 3.3 million Rwandans -- of a prewar population of 
about 8 million -- have either fled or were forced from their homes within the 
rugged country, which is about the size of the state of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said aid officials hoped to persuade the refugees to return home as 
quickly as possible, especially since the country's maize and sorghum harvest 
has begun. "What we're trying to do is create a system so people stop panicking 
and start moving back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, aid workers said, attempts to distribute critically needed blankets, 
plastic sheeting, medicine, bulk food and water have been hampered by a 
logistical nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads in the area are so clogged with refugees that truck convoys carrying 
relief goods can only crawl through. The tiny airport at Goma has no equipment 
to offload aircraft; each giant Hercules cargo plane and other relief flights 
must be offloaded by hand, a laborious process that can take up to six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the congestion, only 14 humanitarian aid flights were able to land 
at Goma's airstrip Wednesday. Despite stockpiles in the region, Lewis said the 
World Food Program was able to send only two planes with food, "which was 
fairly useless." She said the agency would now focus on using trucks to bring 
supplies in more swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Lasore, a U.S. Embassy spokesman here, said U.S. Air Force planes were en 
route to Uganda and Kenya on Wednesday night with donated Swedish trucks for 
use in relief convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the refugees are Hutus, members of Rwanda's ethnic majority. 
They have fled Rwanda fearing retribution from a Tutsi-led rebel army that 
toppled the Hutu government after a brutal three-month war. The new regime has 
urged the refugees to return home, saying no reprisals are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Government-sponsored Hutu death squads have been blamed for the systematic 
slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi civilians since fighting broke out 
in April in what was once one of Africa's most densely populated countries.

POLL FINDS GAP CLOSING; WILSON, BROWN NEARLY EVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Heading toward the final rounds, the battle for California's governorship is 
about what many political experts had long expected it to be at this point: a 
real horse race between Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic challenger 
Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first independent statewide poll since the June primary, the Field Poll 
published Wednesday showed Brown, the state treasurer, leading Wilson 44% to 
39%, with 17% undecided. The 5-point lead is within the poll's statistical 
margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows that over the past 14 months, Wilson has doggedly fought back 
from the brink of political perdition to within a statistical whisper of Brown. 
At the same time, Brown, running a sometimes uncertain campaign, has seen the 
glitter fade from a 23-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Both campaigns found reason for happiness in the latest poll -- for Brown it 
was her continuing lead, and for Wilson it was the long-term direction of 
polling numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials with both campaigns and other political experts said the 
tightening of the race is something they have long expected. Much of the early 
polling spread rested on a combination of Wilson's unpopularity and Brown's 
name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 All candidates' poll numbers drop as potential voters get to know more about 
them -- and this has happened to Brown. Meanwhile, Wilson has been helped by 
rising voter optimism about the state's economic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown led by 8 points in the Field Poll last May -- before the June 8 primary 
election -- and the difference from that poll is marginal, not a sign of a 
dramatic shift in the contest, Los Angeles Times Poll Director John Brennan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each candidate's negative ratings had increased since May, an indication that 
the candidates' ads attacking each other were having an impact, although Wilson 
aides said they were not running any anti-Brown ads during the polling period, 
July 12-17. Brown was running anti-Wilson commercials during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Field Poll founder Mervin Field said the poll of 608 registered voters 
indicates that at this point, "people are voting no on Wilson, but not yet 
voting yes on Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that "polls cannot forecast the outcome," Brennan said: "This is a very 
competitive race and it's certainly far too early to start betting your farm on 
either one of these candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wilson, 60, was suffering the worst job approval rating, as 
measured by the polls, of any governor in modern California history. Experts 
were beginning to write his political memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 48, was regarded as the glamorous new star on the California political 
horizon, or even the national political scene. The telegenic mother and 
grandmother is the daughter and sister of former California governors, and the 
idea of a Brown dynasty caught the fancy of national magazines and television, 
who celebrated her as an almost certain winner. She became one of the state's 
most successful political fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Brown led Wilson by 23 points in the Field Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the scenario has become quite different. Wilson has rebounded, although 
his job ratings are still quite low. Private polls taken by various campaigns 
in recent weeks have shown Wilson overcoming Brown's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's political obituaries were set aside and campaign handicappers have 
begun talking about him as a potential 1996 GOP presidential nominee if he wins 
reelection in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson has campaigned strongly since last year, the Brown campaign 
has at times been tentative and uncertain. Critics, including some of her 
friends, said Brown did not seem to know just what it was she wanted to do as 
governor, other than to return the state to some of the glory it had under her 
father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's poll figures against Wilson have continued to decline, even after she 
easily won her June 8 primary election over Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 To a great extent, the campaign has followed a normal and predictable course. 
</P>
<P>
 No candidate could be expected to maintain a 23-point lead through a tough 
primary in which she was attacked by opponents within her own party as well as 
by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said Brown's early lead was based to a great degree on people's 
association with the Brown name in California politics and her image as an 
attractive newcomer to big-time California politics. It is normal for 
candidates' negative image ratings to increase as prospective voters learn more 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's comeback was helped by the fact that he became a very visible and 
active governor over the last year, especially during last fall's disastrous 
brush fires, in the aftermath of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and at a 
string of funerals and memorials for crime victims and slain police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important, Brennan said, Wilson enjoyed a surge of popularity 
this spring on the basis of perceptions that the California economy is 
rebounding. The "landscape of optimism and pessimism" can be an important 
factor in the election, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's performance Monday before a statewide meeting of broadcasters in 
Monterey may be a sign that she has hit her stride as a candidate with the 
primary over and the race -- as she put it -- " mano a mano " between Wilson 
and her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel liberated," she told reporters after laying out in concise, vigorous 
fashion the alleged failings of the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, Wilson said that things were beginning to work in 
California and he honed his attack on Brown by portraying her as a liberal 
Democrat who is not in sync with voters on the crime issue, especially the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign said it is trying to reinforce in voters' minds the fact 
that Wilson has been a bad governor, and why. Then, campaign manager Clint 
Reilly said, Brown will outline her own programs in an effort to convince 
voters that they should take a chance on change. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, the Wilson campaign's communications director, concurred that 
Brown must do more than convince voters that Wilson has been a bad governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting Republican humorist P. J. O'Rourke, Schnur said: "If you want the 
tooth fairy to come, you've got to put something under the pillow." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly argued Wednesday that the latest public and private polls indicate that 
the momentum of the race has changed again in Brown's favor even before that 
phase of the campaign has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The momentum has shifted back toward Brown as people begin to refocus on 
Wilson and his record," he said.

SIMPSON OFFERING $500,000 REWARD FOR TIPS IN CASE; INVESTIGATION: DEFENSE SAYS 
OTHER POSSIBLE SUSPECTS WERE IGNORED. POLICE SOURCES DISCOUNT CHANCE GLOVE WAS 
PLANTED. 
</P>

 Moving on two fronts to assert the innocence of their high-profile client, 
lawyers for O.J. Simpson on Wednesday announced a $500,000 reward for 
information leading to the "real killer or killers" and filed a motion accusing 
police of ignoring evidence that points to other possible suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become apparent to me that the investigative resources available to 
the prosecution of this case have, from the first discovery of the bodies, been 
exclusively devoted to only one theory: that the defendant Orenthal James 
Simpson was personally responsible for these murders," Simpson lawyer Robert L. 
Shapiro stated in a declaration accompanying the motion. "Evidence suggesting 
his innocence has been ignored in the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Law enforcement sources said the Los Angeles Police Department has 
tentatively determined that it would have been almost impossible for Detective 
Mark Fuhrman to have pocketed a key piece of evidence -- a bloody glove later 
found outside Simpson's home -- from the scene where the bodies of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were discovered. Members of Simpson's defense 
team have suggested that Fuhrman might have planted the glove at the Simpson 
estate, an assertion that department officials say is far-fetched. According to 
sources, 14 police officers and supervisors were on hand when Fuhrman arrived 
at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minutes from a June 29 supervisors' meeting at the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office indicate that 16 evidence errors were made during the murder 
investigation. An office spokesman downplayed the significance of those errors, 
which include placement of incorrect labels on fluid samples. The spokesman 
said that would not compromise any evidence in the case, but even minor 
mistakes could reinforce defense challenges to the integrity and competence of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * In announcing the reward offer, a Simpson attorney said the defense team is 
launching its own investigation into the killings, hiring another private 
investigator and opening a toll-free hot line for tipsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion filed Wednesday was signed by Shapiro, Gerald F. Uelmen and Alan M. 
Dershowitz. In the motion and Shapiro's accompanying declaration, the defense 
attorneys cited several items that they said could bolster their client's 
claims of innocence and which they alleged have not been adequately 
investigated. For instance, Shapiro said an officer at the scene of the murders 
suggested that the killer might have been bitten by a dog; he requested access 
to any records of visits to emergency rooms in the area by people seeking 
treatment for dog bite wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Nicole Simpson received a number of threatening, obscene phone 
calls in December, 1992, from a suspect who was not O.J. Simpson. Shapiro asked 
for immediate access to any official information on that topic as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro further alleged that files turned over to him by prosecutors quote a 
neighbor who heard Nicole Simpson's garage door being opened on the night of 
the killings. A number of fingerprints at the crime scene do not match the 
victims' or O.J. Simpson's, Shapiro added, demanding that more material on 
those leads be forwarded to him immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Another piece of information cited by Shapiro was a comment by the Simpsons' 
daughter, overheard by a police officer immediately after the killings. "I 
heard Mommy's best friend's voice and heard Mommy crying," he quoted the 
8-year-old as saying, but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the defense lawyers asked for records including: police reports 
on any prowlers or burglaries in the Brentwood neighborhood in the six months 
before the killings; reports of "unsolved similar murders in California in the 
past year," and reports on internal investigations involving detectives or 
other authorities involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is scheduled to be arraigned Friday, and his attorneys asked for a 
hearing prior to that so that a judge could consider their requests for access 
to information in the case. Superior Court Judge Lance Ito denied that request, 
saying the motion should be handled by the trial judge, who will be announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Simpson camp launched its latest offensive, police were completing 
an internal inquiry opened after the defense team suggested that Detective 
Fuhrman might have planted a bloody glove at the football Hall of Famer's 
Brentwood estate. According to law enforcement sources, police officials have 
interviewed nearly every officer who was at the murder scene and have 
tentatively concluded that it would have been all but impossible for the 
investigator to carry away a bloody glove from that location without being 
spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sources said Police Department records and interviews indicate that 10 
patrol officers and three sergeants had been at the scene for roughly two hours 
by the time Fuhrman arrived with his supervisor, Detective Ronald Phillips. A 
fire captain also was there, as is often the case when bodies are found. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time he (Fuhrman) gets there, the scene is frozen for all intents and 
purposes," one police source said. "Uniformed people and supervisors were all 
over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman and Phillips arrived about 2:10 a.m. on June 13, sources said, adding 
that the area already had been cordoned off with yellow police tape. The 
detectives, according to police sources, were shown the scene by patrol 
officers, who pointed out a knit cap and a bloody glove near the bodies. 
Without touching any items, patrol officers also showed them a pager, an 
envelope, some keys and other items lying on the ground, some covered in blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman and Phillips looked at those items from several feet away using 
flashlights, according to the police sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sources said they believed that it would have been impossible for 
Fuhrman to slip into the area where the bodies were lying and grab evidence 
without one of the 14 other officers at the scene noticing him. Moreover, those 
sources said they considered it unlikely that so many officers would have 
missed a second glove as they were securing the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as police tried to resolve that issue, however, the defense team was 
moving on another front, appealing to the public for its help in solving the 
murders and clearing the former football star of charges he committed the 
double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy (Skip) Taft, who has served as Simpson's personal attorney and adviser 
for 25 years, announced to a throng of reporters Wednesday afternoon that 
Simpson was "personally offering a reward of $500,000 for production of 
evidence establishing his innocence and further leads to the real killer or 
killers in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a Brentwood plaza about a mile from the scene of the June 12 
killings, Taft said Simpson has retained well-known private investigator John 
McNally, a retired New York police detective, to head a probe intended to prove 
the athlete-turned-actor's innocence. Taft also announced creation of a 
toll-free line to field tips on the case. The number -- (800) 322-3632 -- 
includes the two numbers Simpson wore during his football career, 32 and 36. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft, who declined to take questions, said Simpson had decided to offer the 
reward and sponsor his own investigation in part because authorities rejected 
the services of Simpson's hired experts in conducting their probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards, especially large ones, often turn up valuable tips, but legal experts 
caution that witnesses who come forward in response to offers of money can be 
questioned about their motives -- just as witnesses who sell their stories to 
tabloid publications have come under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the strongly worded motion accusing the police of failing to 
investigate, the offer of the reward is the latest move by Simpson attorneys to 
drive home their contention that authorities have mishandled the explosive 
murder case from the beginning. The attorneys have accused police of lying to 
obtain a search warrant and have suggested that the Police Department and the 
Los Angeles County coroner's office used sloppy procedures in handling some of 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal coroner's office document made available to The Times on Wednesday 
could provide defense attorneys with further ammunition on that point. Minutes 
from a June 29 supervisors' meeting refer to "16 evidence problems" related to 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The minutes do not go into more detail, but a source in the coroner's office 
said they involved such things as placing bodily fluids in mislabeled 
containers (bile in a container marked urine, for instance), failing to examine 
the stomach contents of one victim, drying clothes from the victims improperly, 
and storing the bodies in unlocked crypts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would not comment on the specific allegations, a spokesman for the 
office downplayed their significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this is anything that is going to be detrimental to the case," said 
coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier, adding that the defense team is aware of the 
mishaps. "There's nothing that compromises any evidence and nothing that will 
affect either side." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the defense has challenged many aspects of the investigation, no one 
has come under greater scrutiny or attack than Fuhrman, the detective who said 
he discovered a bloody glove on the grounds of Simpson's Brentwood estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have seized on a 1983 case filed by Fuhrman in which he 
claimed he had a stress disability and have used that case to suggest that his 
credibility is suspect. Documents accompanying that case quote Fuhrman using 
racially charged language and discussing his preoccupation with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fuhrman has come under investigation by LAPD officials probing 
allegations of sexual harassment and mistreatment of female officers at the 
department's West Los Angeles police station. Fuhrman has worked at that 
station for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source, a female police officer interviewed as part of the 
intense inquiry under way at that station said Fuhrman made an inappropriate 
remark in her presence. 
</P>
<P>
 But one source familiar with the inquiry said the female officer's credibility 
has subsequently been challenged based on incidents unrelated to Fuhrman. 
Several sources said that no disciplinary action is likely to be taken against 
the detective. The sexual harassment audit is complete and the report is being 
reviewed by department leaders. Once it is approved, it will be turned over to 
Internal Affairs to see whether departmental charges should be brought against 
any officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources added that though Fuhrman was one of many male West Los Angeles 
officers associated with an informal group that dubbed itself "Men Against 
Women," his performance in recent years has won him plaudits from supervisors 
and has allowed him to be promoted through the patrol ranks and placed in a 
coveted detective slot. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, however, passed over for a recent opening in the esteemed 
robbery-homicide division, considered the premier LAPD detective unit. 
Simpson's defense team has suggested that Fuhrman might have planted a glove at 
Simpson's home to be hailed for cracking the high-profile case. 
</P>
<P>
 As both sides gear for a trial that could commence in late September, 
investigators are eagerly awaiting the results of DNA tests conducted on blood 
samples recovered from Simpson's home and car, as well as from the murder 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the testing procedures, the definitive DNA 
tests still have not been run on the samples. Results of PCR tests, an 
expedited form of the testing, have suggested that droplets found at the murder 
scene and in Simpson's car could be from the former athlete. Other tests 
conducted on the glove discovered outside his Brentwood estate were 
inconclusive but suggested that while the blood of the two victims might be on 
that item, his blood did not appear to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Further tests will be needed to produce more conclusive findings, and those 
results will not be known for days or even weeks, sources said. 
</P>

 Times staff writer Henry Weinstein contributed to this report. Defense Sets Up 
Toll-Free Number 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's legal advisers, offering a $500,000 reward for leads in the 
double-murder case, said a toll-free number for such information would be 
activated Friday. On Wednesday afternoon, people who called the number, (800) 
322-3632, heard the following message: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, this is the law office of Robert Shapiro. Thank you for your call. If 
you would like the address where you can send a letter of support to O.J. 
Simpson, press 1 now. If you have an important lead regarding the O.J. Simpson 
case, press 2 now. If you are an expert in a field relating to the O.J. Simpson 
case and would like to offer your services, press 3 now. If you are seeking 
legal representation, press 4 now."

CLINTON SAYS HE'S FOR FULL COVERAGE; HEALTH REFORM: PRESIDENT CLARIFIES 
REMARKS, INSISTS HE HASN'T DILUTED HIS PLEDGE. WHITE HOUSE AIDES SEEK TO 
PORTRAY MODERATE BILLS AS ATTRACTIVE, BUT UNWORKABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton insisted Wednesday that he has not abandoned his goal of 
health coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry that after all my skills and efforts at communicating that the 
point I really made yesterday somehow didn't get through," Clinton told 
reporters before a meeting with congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks Tuesday, Clinton had appeared to water down his pledge of universal 
coverage, suggesting that he would accept legislation that covered only 95% of 
Americans. But, Clinton and his aides insisted Wednesday, his words really were 
not intended to convey that message. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said he meant to suggest that even legislation intended to provide 
coverage for 100% of the population would in fact fail to reach everyone. He 
said he did not mean that Congress should deliberately set out to reach only 
95% coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's aides, meantime, attempted to refocus their strategy in an 
effort to convince members of Congress that alternative plans which have 
attracted support from congressional moderates may look good but cannot work. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's efforts at damage control mollified some, but by no means all, of 
his congressional supporters. And advocates of universal coverage stepped up 
their pressure against any attempt to dilute the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt in my mind that the President has not moved from his 
original position," said Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). "We will 
have to vote on 100% coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, advocates of universal coverage got a major boost when three 
of the nation's most powerful lobbying organizations -- the American Medical 
Assn., the AFL-CIO and the American Assn. of Retired Persons -- joined forces 
to press Congress to pass legislation that would guarantee coverage for all by 
requiring companies to insure all their workers -- the so-called employer 
mandate. The doctors group and labor unions often have been sharp antagonists 
in health care wars of the past, making the alliance particularly notable. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, despite the confusion of the last two days, the strategy 
that Clinton and his aides hope to pursue has begun to come into focus. It 
begins with the premise that in a head-to-head confrontation, Clinton can 
defeat the sort of minimalist alternatives proposed by conservative 
Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest threat to achieving far-reaching reform of the health care 
system, White House officials believe, lies not in those conservative ideas but 
in the halfway approaches pushed by a loose coalition of moderates and 
conservatives in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of Congress like the alternative proposals because they appear to 
offer a safe political middle ground. To defeat those proposals and return the 
debate to the head-to-head fight that Clinton and his aides prefer, they plan 
to argue that those plans are the equivalent of trying to jump halfway across a 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have a lot of evidence that if we tinker around with the system and 
don't try to do something comprehensive, we could actually make it worse for 
ordinary Americans," Clinton said Wednesday. "We could increase the cost to 
middle-class Americans and decrease coverage. We have to do something that 
works. That's going to be my bottom line. Let's don't do something that won't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's chief Senate ally, Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), made 
a similar point after the White House meeting -- ticking off deficiencies in 
the alternative plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems with the alternative plans that have been presented is 
that they don't achieve any cost-control," Mitchell said. "If we're to do these 
things we must control costs." 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined that chorus, telling a coalition of 
health care advocates that universal coverage is "the cornerstone of what it is 
we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of national universal coverage, you will not get the results 
you want," Mrs. Clinton said, holding in her arms a 7-year-old Nebraska boy who 
had undergone multiple surgeries for a rare medical condition. The boy's father 
had lost his job, leaving the family with no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The target of the Administration's strategy is a set of proposals -- most of 
them not yet reduced to formal legislative language -- that have attracted 
considerable congressional support because they appear to offer a way out of 
the stark choice between some version of the Administration's plan and the much 
more modest offerings of Dole and his fellow Republicans. Those bills feed into 
the natural tendency of members of Congress to solve most problems by splitting 
the difference between opposing sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a group of 104 members of the House, led by Reps. Fred Grandy 
(R-Iowa) and Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), sent a letter to House leaders demanding 
assurances that the full House would be allowed to vote on a proposal that they 
plan to offer which would not include employer mandates or government controls 
on insurance company rates. A somewhat similar plan passed the Senate Finance 
Committee at the beginning of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion behind the alternative plans is to expand coverage with insurance 
market reforms plus incentives and subsidies aimed at lowering the cost of 
insurance for working families. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, including Clinton and his allies, argue that the bills make an 
expensive promise that they do not fulfill. Clinton's plan would put much of 
the cost of expanding insurance on business by requiring companies to provide 
insurance to workers. Replacing that requirement with subsidies puts the burden 
on taxpayers, argue the Administration and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has picked up on the cost of no mandate," said Sen. Tom Daschle 
(D-S.D.). Various analysts, he said, have estimated that it would cost as much 
as $1.3 trillion over the next five years to provide the subsidies necessary to 
meet the goals that Cooper, Grandy and others profess to want to meet -- making 
insurance affordable to all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, that argument could have considerable power in a deficit-leery 
Congress. Before truly being able to focus attention on that argument, however, 
Clinton must resolve the confusion in his own ranks that his remarks on Tuesday 
caused. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout was apparent in comments by liberal Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), 
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. Obey said that, if Clinton's 
remarks indicate he is "backing away from universal health care reform that 
covers every citizen in this country, then I will walk away from the Clinton 
health plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in the Senate, several liberal Democrats mocked Clinton's 
references to 95% coverage by drawing the names of five of the 100 senators, 
saying that if Congress passes a plan covering only 95% of the population, then 
only 95% of the Senate and the White House staff should get health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Karen Tumulty and Jeffrey Leeds contributed to this story. 
Where the President Stands 
</P>
<P>
 When introducing his health legislation to Congress last October, President 
Clinton said coverage for every American was an absolute requirement. But 
recently, he has appeared to soften his stance. A review of his statements: 
</P>
<P>
 DEC. 3, 1993: Clintons stresses that providing coverage to the 37 million 
uninsured was the cornerstone of reform. "Do not give up on universal 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 JUNE 12, 1994: While President insists publicly that he'll veto anything short 
of universal coverage, officials privately say he might be prepared to accept 
something less. 
</P>
<P>
 JUNE 21, 1994: Clinton vows to fight for universal coverage, saying that "it 
goes to the heart of whether we can make government work for ordinary people." 
</P>
<P>
 JUNE 25, 1994: In weekly radio address, stands firmly behind his call for 
universal coverage, denouncing "Half-hearted measures" that would fall short of 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 TUESDAY, JULY 19: "We know we're not going to get right at 100% (coverage) but 
we know that you've got to get somewhere in the ballpark of 95% or upwards." 
</P>
<P>
 WEDNESDAY, JULY 20: "The point I was trying to make (Tuesday) is that we have 
no way of knowing ... that there is any available and affordable way to get 
close to 100% of coverage without some sort of requirement that involves 
everybody paying." 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in Congress 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders in the House and Senate are currently sorting through the major plans, 
keeping what they like and discarding what they don't. They will then present a 
single plan to their respective chambers. Here are the major plans now in 
Congress*: 
</P>
<P>
 Summary 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Plan: Guaranteed coverage for all by 1998. Wide-ranging package of 
benefits. Employers would pay portion of premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 House Ways and Means: Less generous than Clinton plan. Establishes new program 
to cover Medicaid recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Finance: Two basic benefits packages. No employer mandate. Aims to 
cover 95% of Americans through subsidies and insurance reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate GOP (Dole plan): Voluntary. No guarantee of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two other plans -- by the Senate Labor and House Education and Labor 
committees -- are not listed here because they closely resemble the President's 
plan 
</P>
<P>
 Before it Passes 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders are hoping for passaage of a final bill this fall. The 
final bill would come out of this process: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Clinton introduces plan, which serves as a guide to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 2) House subcommittees approve their own plans (no work done at subcommittee 
level in Senate) 
</P>
<P>
 3) House and Senate committees revise and approve varying plans. 
</P>
<P>
 4) House and Senate leaders take plans from their respective committees and 
blend the elements into one plan. (Current step) 
</P>
<P>
 5) Members debate bill in full sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Bills go to conference committees to work out differences. 
</P>
<P>
 7) House and Senate vote on final version. 
</P>
<P>
 8) Bill goes to President's desk for his signature.

COLUMN ONE; LAST BREATH FOR INDIA'S STEAMERS; IN A LAND SHAPED BY ITS 
RAILROADS, COAL-BURNING TRAINS SOON WILL GIVE WAY TO MODERN MODELS. OFFICIALS 
CITE PROGRESS, BUT OTHERS LAMENT THEIR LOSS. WITHOUT THEM, ASKS AN ENGINEER, 
'WHERE IS THE FIRE OF LIFE?'

<P>
 A metal dragon exhaling orange sparks and a scalding plume of vapor, this 
vintage steam locomotive rumbles over the rails, shattering the stillness of 
India's plains at twilight. 
</P>
<P>
 First Fireman Anil Sharma, a bandanna wrapped around his head to keep out coal 
dust, yanks open the firebox. With a few expert flicks of the shovel, the 
square-shouldered 26-year-old piles more A-grade Bihar coal onto the flames, 
then clangs the door shut. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Delhi-bound train -- made up of 10 cars, a tender laden with 20 tons 
of coal and 5,000 gallons of water, four crewmen and several hundred passengers 
-- accelerates. Its trembling speedometer needle shows a bone-shaking 75 
kilometers per hour -- 46 m.p.h. -- and the thick steel plate under foot in the 
cab vibrates weirdly. 
</P>
<P>
 In fields greened by the recent arrival of the monsoon rains, naked children 
taking the day's final dip in muddy ponds and drovers coaxing water buffalo 
homeward look up at the sudden approach of the hissing, thundering engine. Many 
smile and wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes on the plains of Uttar Pradesh may seem like the quintessence of 
Indian life, tableaux virtually frozen since the years of British rule. But 
their days are numbered. By the end of this year, if the officials who run 
India's railroads implement their plans as scheduled, the bullet-nosed 
locomotive that makes the 100-mile run west from Moradabad to the country's 
capital will be no more. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1996, steam is to be gone from all regular rail service throughout India, 
to be replaced by diesel or electric traction. The reasons are cold 
considerations of efficiency and cost, and the decrepit state of many aging 
steam locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You simply can't afford to keep an antique in operation," says Jasbir Pal 
Singh, chief mechanical engineer on the Northern Railway, the largest of 
India's nine regional rail networks. 
</P>
<P>
 For a vast land where railroads were indispensable in creating an industrial 
economy, and even the movement for independence and national identity itself, 
the passing of steam will be the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
 In many fields, India is striving to modernize and open itself to the outside 
world. But many feel the country is losing much of its uniqueness and heritage 
in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "A steam locomotive is like a human monster," Rajagopalan Gopal, Singh's 
counterpart on the Bombay-based Western Railway, says with evident emotion. 
"But today, neither the puff is there, nor the fire. Where is the fire of 
life?" 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 140 years, chugging steam locomotives have been a ubiquitous 
feature of the Indian landscape. They rushed British reinforcements to the 
rebellious Northwest Frontier, brought tea from the Himalayan foothills to 
ships waiting at Calcutta, and carried untold billions of passengers, many in 
cattle car-like third-class coaches that no longer exist, others on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the last century, Lord Dalhousie, India's governor general, 
advocated railroads -- they were all steam-powered then, of course -- along 
with the telegraph and uniform postage, as three "great engines of social 
improvement" to hasten the modernization of Britain's premier colonial 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon of April 16, 1853, guns boomed from the ramparts of Bombay's 
fort as three small steam engines, spouting smoke, rattled off with 400 
passengers on a maiden 21-mile run. The "iron horse" had come to India. The 
Bombay Times gushed that "a sun is rising on the darkened land." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody rejoiced, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Railways accentuate the evil nature of man. Bad men fulfill their evil 
designs with greater rapidity," Mohandas K. Gandhi, the "Great Soul" who turned 
hostile to Western technology, once fulminated. "It may be a debatable matter 
whether railways spread famine, but it is beyond dispute that they propagate 
evil." 
</P>
<P>
 The apostle of nonviolence never said whether trains might not help propagate 
good, but no Indian took greater advantage of what is today the world's 
second-largest rail network to spread his views. 
</P>
<P>
 (Asked why he always traveled in third class as he crisscrossed India, Gandhi 
answered, "Because there is no fourth class."). 
</P>
<P>
 Steam-powered trains, although enough of an endangered species in this age of 
supercomputers and interplanetary probes to lure many rail buffs to India, have 
grown increasingly unpopular with administrators and accountants at the 
Ministry of Railways. Steam is labor-intensive, they say, and the cost of labor 
is increasing in India these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Digging and then transporting coal throughout the nation is also becoming more 
expensive, and burning it pollutes the environment more than other fuels now 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, these locos will have to go into a museum," concludes Singh, who 
half-jokingly presents himself as "the man who is killing off steam" on the 
Northern Railway. 
</P>
<P>
 Conscious of the valuable drawing power of steam, railroad officials have 
modified their original plan and will allow half a dozen old engines to remain 
on routes popular with foreign and Indian tourists, like the "toy train" that 
climbs to Darjeeling or the ritzy "Palace on Wheels" in Rajasthan. But for the 
ordinary Indian passenger, steam will pass into history within the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is already well under way. In 1992 and 1993, 786 steam locomotives 
were retired and 38 sheds where they had been based were shut down. In the same 
period, the number of electric engines in service topped steam for the first 
time. The share of passenger trains pulled by steam, as high as 15% a few years 
ago, is dropping every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Such trends cause pangs of regret even among those responsible for them. In 
1944, when he was 7, Gopal watched from his home in Meerut as a crack express, 
the Frontier Mail, roared by, sending glowing constellations of sparks into the 
night sky. He dreamed of being at the throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he went into the mechanical side of railroading. Two summers ago, as 
chief official in his field on India's second-biggest railroad, he phased out 
all steam-powered locomotives of the class designated WP -- for 
wide-gauge/passenger -- and a sister model designed for pulling freight trains. 
It left him heartsick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is efficiency all we look for in life?" asks the mechanical engineer with the 
soul of a romantic. "What about beauty? Or class? There is something truly 
beautiful and song-like about a steam locomotive. In comparison, diesel or 
electric is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 For the average passenger, the demise of steam is probably a welcome thing. 
</P>
<P>
 After chugging off one recent Saturday in a nimbus of black smoke and steam 
from Moradabad, and sounding a shrill whistle as cows grazed on the neighboring 
track, this New Delhi-bound passenger train took no less than 7 hours, 53 
minutes to reach the Gothic-arched station at Delhi Junction only 100 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 When it panted to a halt at 1:27 a.m., Train No. 307 was more than an hour 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steam locomotives are very unreliable. They have a very high running cost," 
groused one passenger, Usman Ali, 18. "Diesel locos are fast and economical." 
</P>
<P>
 In microcosm, the train carried the picturesque universe of humanity that is 
India. There were three eunuchs dressed as women, and at least as many Hindu 
religious ascetics with Christ-like coiffures and some unbiblical aluminum 
lunch pails. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers who had sold their milk that morning in Moradabad slung the empty cans 
from the bars that run across the glassless apertures substituting for windows 
in second class, and stretched out on the hard wooden benches to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The doors to the toilets had been torn off. Inside, holes in the floor opened 
right onto the tracks. Not a single ceiling fan was working. Vendors plied the 
filthy aisles, selling peanuts mixed with chopped onions and tomatoes, slices 
of fresh melon and coconut, hot tea spiked with sugar and milk, spiced lentils 
and boxed lunches of unleavened bread and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 There was just one track on several stretches of the route, so passengers 
piled out at four different station sidings to wait for higher-priority 
expresses, none pulled by steam, to go by. (Those enforced halts, driver Madan 
Singh later said defensively, were why he arrived at Delhi so late.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rail travel is cheap in India, and a ticket in second class -- the only class 
available for the Moradabad-to-Delhi run -- costs just 77 cents. But like 
passengers almost everywhere, the people riding Train No. 307 complained about 
service. A farmer worried about what the demise of steam would do to the price 
and availability of diesel fuel, which he uses to run irrigation pumps. But it 
was day laborer Satpal Singh, 45, who had the last word. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trains never run on time, so it hardly makes a difference whether they 
run on steam or electric," he said philosophically. Many other passengers 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts, though, say there is a difference and that India's steam 
locomotives, of which 1,725 remained in service as of March, 1993, are 
relatively old and slow. The country hasn't manufactured a steam-powered engine 
since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is proper maintenance, these locos can run 75 to 80 kilometers per 
hour (46 to 50 m.p.h.)," said Niaz Ahmad, an official with the Northern Railway 
Locomotive Training School. "But the maintenance is decaying these days. These 
are outdated engines." 
</P>
<P>
 Steam is also notoriously temperamental. One recent day, Train 307's opposite 
number bound for Moradabad from Delhi had to be pulled by diesel when a steam 
crew bungled and had to drop their coal fire onto the tracks to prevent the 
boiler from blowing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Engine No. 7102 showed its age badly. Its rounded nose was jauntily adorned 
with the spread white wings that mark a steam locomotive based in Moradabad. 
But the rest of it looked aged and shabby. 
</P>
<P>
 The plates that compose the engine's metal skin were pitted, ill-fitting and 
caked with soot. The whistle stuck. The nameplate in the cab that should have 
shown the locomotive's serial number and age had fallen off. The crew guessed 
No. 7102 was around half a century old. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a humble end facing a machine that for decades had figured among the 
thoroughbreds of India's railroads. Gandhi might not have approved, but the 
genesis of the WP-class locomotive can be traced to 16 American-made prototypes 
built and delivered to India by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia in 
1947. By 1970, when production ceased, 755 had been built. 
</P>
<P>
 In railroad jargon, the 102-ton locomotive is called a 4-6-2 because of its 
wheel configuration. The "6" means three pairs of driving wheels, which stand 
more than five feet high, move the engine and the train. They are linked on 
both sides by a connecting rod to a large piston, which is shoved back and 
forth by steam. 
</P>
<P>
 Such technology, now almost ancient, gives an exhilarating sensation of speed. 
In the locomotive cab, buffeted by gusts of pungent coal smoke and steam, it 
feels as if the crew can barely control the awesome power unleashed by the 
heating of water into vapor. The engine hisses and seethes, like a giant 
pressure cooker, and seems ready to burst. 
</P>
<P>
 As the modernization of India's railroads continues, skills that allowed 
people to earn a living through steam are becoming more and more irrelevant. 
Sharma, a railroad employee since 1988, uses his shovel like a precision 
instrument. He can heave coal evenly throughout the firebox and appears to know 
intuitively when it's time to toss in more to maintain an even, 12-inch-high 
layer of burning anthracite. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh, No. 7102's 43-year-old engineer, or "driver," as they say in India, has 
worked with steam so long that he seems to have organically meshed with his 
handlebar-shaped regulator handle and reversing wheel. By manipulating those 
two controls as he stands by the engine's right-hand window, he regulates the 
flow of steam and motion of the pistons that make the driving wheels speed up 
or slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 As steam locomotives are retired, their crewmen are supposed to be provided by 
Indian Railways with new jobs. Sharma, though, isn't confident. Sweat streaming 
down his bearded face, he says he will likely be transferred to work as an 
assistant in an electric or diesel locomotive, but will probably never advance 
because of quotas that reserve some railroad jobs for people of lower castes. 
Sharma is a Brahman, a member of Hinduism's highest stratum. 
</P>
<P>
 On impulse, Second Fireman Ghan Shyam Singh grabs a hunk of coal, and sends it 
spinning into the darkness. The 24-year-old joins his hands together in a sign 
of reverence. He has given the sacred river some coal as an offering, he says, 
because he isn't carrying any coins.

GREENSPAN VOWS FAST RATE HIKE IF INFLATION BUILDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that the U.S. 
economy shows no signs of accelerating inflation, but he warned that the 
central bank will move quickly to boost interest rates again if it appears that 
price pressures are building. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that he 
sees scattered evidence of the kinds of scarcities that eventually can fuel 
inflation: shortages of certain workers, such as truck drivers and construction 
specialists, and increases in the costs of some raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, he said, "we do not see any evidence of costs flowing through into 
final prices." 
</P>
<P>
 "I said it back in May and I say it again today," Greenspan told the 
committee, recalling his recent congressional testimony and underlining his 
insistence that the economy is in good shape and growing at a reasonable pace 
without overheating, even after absorbing four interest-rate increases 
engineered by the Federal Reserve between February and May. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he acknowledged that the decline in the dollar against the Japanese 
yen and the German mark, about 5% since he last testified, will raise the price 
of imported goods, increasing inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed must remain vigilant, he said, because the United States has only a 
small amount of slack industrial capacity and "it is an open question whether 
our actions to date have been sufficient to head off inflationary pressures and 
thus maintain favorable trends in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's warnings about possible further interest rate hikes took a toll in 
the financial markets. Stocks declined, as the Dow Jones average of key 
industrial issues dropped 21.04 points to close at 3,727.27. Interest rates in 
the bond market had been falling for three weeks, but began rising after 
Greenspan's testimony. Yields rose across the board, with the key 30-year 
Treasury bond closing at 7.54%, up from 7.46% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's testimony was accompanied by the issuance of the central bank's 
semiannual report, which disclosed the Federal Reserve's strategy of keeping 
its targets for monetary growth basically unchanged from this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed expects that its efforts will restrain the "central tendency" of 
inflation to a range between 2.75% and 3% for this year, and between 2.75% and 
3.5% for 1995, the report said. Retail prices paid by consumers rose 2.7% last 
year, the best performance in the fight against inflation since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan and his Federal Reserve colleagues are engaged in a delicate and 
difficult balancing act, hoping that this year's interest rate hikes have taken 
the speculative steam out of the financial markets and slowed the rapidly 
expanding economy to a healthier pace of moderate growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's offensive in raising rates was an early strike to head off future 
troubles. There was no imminent inflationary threat, but the Fed governors were 
fearful that the rapid growth in business output and consumption during the 
final quarter of 1993 and early this year could have produced a burst of higher 
prices a year or 18 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the economy's performance seems "unduly constrained" later, the 
Fed can reverse policy with minimal risk and quickly drive down interest rates, 
providing a rapid stimulus to growth, Greenspan told the committee. Easing up 
on the monetary brakes is much easier to do than combatting inflation after it 
already has spread through the economy, a painful lesson learned during the 
last 15 years, the Fed governors believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at a complex economy with a rate of growth which has been 
extraordinary," Greenspan said. "If we are simmering down to more long-term, 
sustainable levels (of growth), that is all to the good. We're trying to get an 
economy which is balanced over time." 
</P>
<P>
 This approach -- hiking rates now to avoid inflation later -- was berated as 
unduly cautious by two Democratic members of the committee, Sens. Paul S. 
Sarbanes of Maryland and Jim Sasser of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly disagree with the Federal Reserve policy -- I am still at a loss 
to find evidence of an overheating economy," Sasser said. Sarbanes held up 
several large-scale reproductions of editorial cartoons, each showing a 
caricature of Greenspan as worried and fearful of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sasser and Sarbanes were particularly critical of the higher interest rates 
because of the impact on the housing industry, where some customers are priced 
out of the market with any upward move in mortgage rates. The rising cost of a 
mortgage has forced many Americans, "especially young couples," to forgo their 
dream of homeownership, Sasser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing starts plunged 9.8% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
1.35 million, down from a revised figure of 1.5 million in May, the Commerce 
Department reported Wednesday. Housing starts have fallen for three straight 
months. Home mortgage rates, which fell to 6.74% last fall, a 25-year low, 
reached 8.7% last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), was more diplomatic in her dialogue with 
Greenspan, avoiding any direct criticism of the Fed chairman. She urged him to 
avoid cracking down too hard on business expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look to your leadership; we don't want to choke off a recovery that in our 
state is nascent," Boxer said. "We can't go back to high interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
 California is lagging behind the rest of the nation in economic recovery as it 
slowly moves away from a dependence on military contracts, Boxer said. 
</P>
<P>
 * MARKET REACTION: Bond yields rose and stocks fell after Greenspan's remarks. 
D1 Greenspan Impact 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's talk of higher interest rates ahead 
this year depressed financial markets, which had been rallying in recent days. 
A glance at what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 STOCKS: Prices fell, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending down 20.40 
points at 3,727.91. Declining issues outnumbered advancing stocks about 2-to-1 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 BONDS: Treasury bond prices, a barometer of investor confidence and inflation 
fear, were sharply lower in late afternoon trading. The benchmark 30-year bond 
fell nearly $9 per $1,000 in face value, as its yield rose to 7.54%. 
</P>
<P>
 DOLLAR: The dollar fell against major currencies in New York trading following 
the stock and bond market drops. In New York, the dollar traded at 98.65 
Japanese yen, down from 99.25 late Tuesday, and 1.5650 German marks, down from 
1.5680 marks Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMODITIES: Most commodity markets seemed little affected by Greenspan's 
comments. Gold prices declined; corn and soybean futures prices fell sharply; 
and wheat futures were mostly lower. The Commodity Research Bureau index, an 
indicator of inflationary trends in basics ranging from grain to oil, was down 
2.30 to 231.90.

20TH CENTURY CANCELLATIONS INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State insurance officials are investigating whether earthquake-battered 20th 
Century Insurance Co. is illegally canceling homeowners policies, leaving some 
customers unable to obtain replacement insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said Wednesday that Woodland Hills-based 
20th Century has canceled an unknown number of its 240,000 homeowners policies, 
some only days after agreeing last month to renew them for two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 That agreement caused many other companies to limit the number of new 
homeowners policies they issue in the state -- or to stop selling them 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that ripple effect is leaving homeowners whose 20th Century policies are 
being canceled stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very much aware that the insurance industry in many different ways is 
attempting to reduce its quake exposure," said Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those mechanisms are legal; others are not. The ones that are not we 
will stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is headed by Nettie Hoge, the Insurance Department's chief 
of consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to very carefully scrutinize whether they (20th Century) are 
circumventing either the order or the intent of the order," said Hoge, a lawyer 
who previously worked for Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge said the Insurance Department has received about 10 formal complaints 
from 20th Century customers who have lost their homeowners coverage since the 
Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But others think the problem is far more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 10% of our 350 members have had their homeowners policies canceled, and 
several others have been told they might be carried to their next renewal date, 
but then not renewed," said George Kehrer, executive director of CARe, a 
Northridge-based consumer group formed since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Extrapolating from what has happened to his members, Kehrer reasons that 
several thousand more 20th Century policyholders are probably being canceled or 
not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're playing games with people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based 20th Century said through a spokesman that the company 
hasn't kept tabs on the number of homeowners policies it has canceled since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman added that the company's reasons for canceling policies are 
confidential between the insurer and its policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, it has always been nearly impossible for homeowners who still have 
unresolved claims against one insurer to get coverage from a new company. That 
has been truer than ever since the Northridge quake, according to state 
insurance officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 200 outraged 20th Century policyholders met Wednesday night 
at the First Presbyterian Church in Granada Hills to demand action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired of being taken advantage of," said Michael Ramirez-Mares of 
Granada Hills, president of 20th Century Policyholders Quake Action Group. 
</P>
<P>
 He signaled that the group may try to pressure 20th Century by threatening its 
very lucrative car insurance business, which the company will keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of you also have 20th Century car insurance?" he asked the audience. 
Virtually everyone raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Ramirez-Mares asked how many were thinking of "canceling that car 
insurance when this mess is over." This time, at least half raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's ninth-largest insurer, 20th Century announced in June it would 
withdraw from the California homeowners market, citing $600 million in 
quake-related claims that wiped out two-thirds of its cushion against future 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's agreement with the state also calls for it to phase out its 
quake policies over the next year, in addition to the requirement to provide 
homeowners policies for two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday night's meeting organizers handed out form letters addressed to 
Garamendi urging him to order 20th Century to renew quake coverage of any 
policyholder who still has a pending claim from a policy that was in effect 
when the Northridge temblor struck Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize the impact of the withdrawal on 20th Century customers with 
existing homeowners coverage -- including 90,000 with quake protection -- 
Garamendi ordered the company to offer them two more annual renewals. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than a week after agreeing to comply with the order, 20th Century 
launched a seemingly aggressive drive to cancel homeowners policies for a 
variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, some customers' policies were canceled because they had quake 
damage . 
</P>
<P>
 One cancellation notice obtained by The Times reads "Your residence sustained 
damage in the recent earthquake(s) and, therefore, does not meet our 
underwriting guidelines. The earthquake damage has caused physical changes in 
the property insured against, which has resulted in the property becoming 
uninsurable." 
</P>
<P>
 That notice is dated June 14, just five days after the Insurance Department 
insisted that 20th Century continue protecting existing customers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Garamendi said in a news release that the company's existing 
homeowners policyholders "should have an average two and a half years to get a 
new policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Other customers were told their homeowners coverage would be canceled because 
they had too many claims last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcella Contreras of Mission Hills is one of those. She has been without 
homeowners insurance since her 20th Century coverage ceased July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said she had had her homeowners policy with the company for eight 
years before her first claim, for $710 of wind damage, last November. Since 
then, 20th Century has either paid or agreed to pay $30,000 for quake damage 
and $99,000 to a friend of Contreras who was bitten by the family's nervous, 
110-pound Rottweiler the day after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do we do? We can't get anybody to cover us because we have quake 
damage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said that so far, she has received only $5,000 from the company, not 
enough even to rebuild a wall around her back-yard swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest fear is some little kid will get in there and drown," she said.

11 BACTERIA CASES PROMPT L.A. COUNTY WARNING; HEALTH: GROUND BEEF IS NOW A 
'RISK FOOD' THAT SHOULD NOT BE EATEN UNLESS IT IS THOROUGHLY COOKED, OFFICIAL 
SAYS. TAINTED MEAT CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS ILLNESS. 
</P>

<P>
 Recent food poisonings by the E. coli bacteria have prompted Los Angeles 
County health authorities to now consider ground beef a "risk food" that should 
not be eaten unless it is thoroughly cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shirley Fannin, the county's chief of communicable disease control, said 
Wednesday the recent outbreak and growing knowledge about the health dangers of 
undercooked hamburger have led health authorities to put ground beef in the 
same classification as chicken, unpasteurized milk, and pork -- meaning that if 
not handled right, it can be harmful, even lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since April, 11 cases of E. coli poisoning have been reported in Los Angeles 
County, but 10 have developed since May, enough to alarm public health 
officials. The cause is a particularly virulent strain of bacteria known as E. 
coli 0157:H7. 
</P>
<P>
 An outbreak of E. coli contamination in Washington state last year that was 
linked to hamburgers in fast-food restaurants resulted in 614 reported cases 
and three deaths. Many of the cases were traced to Jack-in-the-Box restaurants. 
There have been four E. coli -related deaths in the western United States since 
November, 1992. The very young and elderly are considered especially 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now identifying hamburger as a risk food," Fannin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like chicken, Fannin said, hamburger "must be thoroughly cooked, meaning there 
can be no pink or red in it." She also said that like chicken, cooking surfaces 
used to prepare hamburger should be carefully washed after the food is 
prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to consider ground beef as a risk food that should never be consumed 
raw or undercooked," said Fannin, whose department has been monitoring the 
problem of tainted meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's warning comes on the heels of a strongly worded statement 
released in Washington last week by the American Gastroenterological Assn. 
Foundation calling federal meat inspection systems "insufficient in themselves 
to identify microbial contamination such as E. coli OI57:H7." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Martin Brotman, a San Francisco physician and chairman of the foundation, 
said infections from the E. coli strain "pose a clear and present danger to our 
public health." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 11 cases reported locally, eight have required hospitalization. No 
deaths have been reported in the county. Two victims were siblings, ages 2 and 
3, from Lancaster. The most severe case was a 69-year-old man from Canoga Park 
who became ill on June 22 and was hospitalized for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin said the county learns of only the most serious cases and suggested 
that there had been "many more" than 11 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Local health officials have not pinpointed a specific source, such as a 
fast-food chain or supermarket chain. The cases have also been scattered 
throughout the county, Fannin said, and have been associated with home cooking 
as well as restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Health authorities say the bacteria -- found in the intestines and feces of 
humans and animals -- produce a range of symptoms -- from mild diarrhea lasting 
six to seven days to bloody diarrhea. It can also cause severe abdominal 
cramps, low-grade fever and -- in some cases -- vomiting. In its 
life-endangering forms, it can cause renal failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although steak is less susceptible than hamburger to the bacteria, the 
California Beef Council warns that any marinade used to flavor meat before 
cooking should be boiled at least a minute before being eaten and that platters 
used for raw roasts and steaks should be washed with hot soap and water before 
the cooked meat is placed back on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ryan, a spokeswoman for the beef council, said her organization has been 
issuing safe cooking and handling guidelines in English and Spanish for several 
months. Hamburger accounts for about 40% of beef consumed in California, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we tell anyone who eats out is if you ever get a hamburger 
that is pink, send it back, and don't ever feed anything but (well-cooked) 
brown meat to your children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ben Werner, a medical epidemiologist with the state Department of Health 
Services, suggested that the increase this year may reflect increased testing 
for E. coli by doctors in the wake of the Washington deaths. " E. coli is a lot 
more prevalent than people might imagine, but it is just not routinely looked 
for by doctors," Werner said.

PRISONERS OF TRANS-BORDER CUSTODY WARS; FAMILIES: WHEN A CHILD IS UNLAWFULLY 
TAKEN ABROAD BY A PARENT, THE LEGAL AND CULTURAL DIFFICULTIES CAN BECOME 
INSURMOUNTABLE. DESPITE A TREATY DESIGNED TO SET A WORLDWIDE STANDARD, THE 
PROBLEM IS GROWING.

<P>
 On a Friday evening in July last year, Jon M. Ramirez drove to the home of his 
ex-wife to pick up their 2-year-old daughter for the weekend. But neither the 
girl nor her mother was there, and for 48 hours, a panicked Ramirez heard 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the restless quiet of a Sunday night, the phone call finally came. The 
voice on the other end was that of Roswita Olejniczak, the mother of their 
daughter, Tanyta. She told him she had flown to her native country, the 
Netherlands, and would not be returning to California. And neither, she said, 
would their child. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began a harrowing and expensive ordeal for Ramirez, 33, an insurance 
underwriter whose mission to bring back his daughter, now 3, has taken him from 
the Orange County district attorney's office -- which has kidnaping charges 
pending against the mother -- to the U.S. State Department to the Dutch courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with a foreign government is maddening enough, he said, but "when the 
fate of your 3-year-old girl hangs in the balance, the fear and frustration -- 
the terror -- take on a whole new meaning. Suddenly, your life comes apart, and 
you feel incredibly hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Cases like that of Ramirez have increased sharply in recent years. There are 
at least 50 like it in Orange County, according to the district attorney's 
office. Some have been on the books for longer than 20 years, and some of the 
"children" involved are now in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures are also rising in Los Angeles County, where Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Linda Acaldo says the trend of parents moving children from one country to 
another unlawfully is creating an almost insoluble legal and cultural problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County in 1992-93, investigators opened 11 such cases and 
resolved eight of them, Acaldo said; in 1993-94, 20 were opened, with 15 
resolved, and, based on pending reports, investigators estimate opening 35 
cases during the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego County, 25 cases have been resolved over the past year, with 10 
pending, according to Caryn Rosen, chief of the county's child abduction unit. 
More than half the cases in San Diego County involve parents taking children 
from the United States to Mexico, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures from the State Department show that 441 children were taken unlawfully 
from homes in the United States in 1993 to the 32 countries that honor the 
Hague Convention, a 1988 treaty designed to create a worldwide standard in 
mitigating such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty stipulates that when a child is wrongfully removed from one member 
nation to another, "the child should be immediately returned to the place of 
habitual residence" -- meaning the country from which the child was taken, said 
State Department spokesman Gary Sheaffer. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials say the Ramirez case points up flaws in a treaty that at times 
seems to defeat its very purpose. The situation is complicated by the ways in 
which member countries interpret the treaty, Sheaffer said, which leads to the 
heart of the predicament involving Tanyta Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign courts have the option of granting an exception to the treaty if, in 
their view, it would be "psychologically or physically harmful to return the 
child" -- which is why Tanyta remains in the Netherlands, even though Ramirez 
was granted her sole physical custody by a California court after she was taken 
by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts there ruled that it would be damaging to return the child to the 
U.S." because state and federal kidnaping charges are pending against the 
mother, Sheaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a Dutch court made its ruling "only because it feared that the 
mother's arrest would do lasting damage to the child." Tanyta has lived with 
her mother since birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that the Hague Convention has stopped short of accomplishing 
its desired objective. The numbers show an increase in child abductions each 
year since the pact was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 268 children were taken from the United States to Hague Convention 
countries and 247 were taken to countries that have not signed the treaty. For 
the previous year, the figures were 207 and 245, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of children from Hague countries to the United States is higher, with 
357 ending up here in 1993, compared to 178 in 1992 and 148 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Parental child abduction occurring within the United States has become a 
staggering problem, according to a recent Department of Justice study that says 
there are 350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most children are returned to their homes within a week or so, as 
many as 160,000 remain missing for longer, according to the study. The longer a 
child is missing, the less likely he or she will be returned to the custodial 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ramirez, the seemingly endless hours of phone-calling, letter-writing and 
lobbying -- and more than $9,000 in legal and travel expenses -- have failed to 
reunite father and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time she was taken, Tanyta lived with her mother and saw her father on 
weekends. Both parents shared joint legal custody, meaning the law required 
them to agree on all major decisions. Ramirez said he had "no inkling" that his 
ex-wife would flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has written to President Clinton, U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein 
and Barbara Boxer, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), Queen Beatrix of the 
Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Justice. No one, he said, has offered 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts in the Netherlands -- including its Supreme Court -- have ruled against 
Ramirez and in favor of the mother, citing the welfare of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at her home in Land-graaf, the Netherlands, Olejniczak, 31, said she 
left the United States because she feared that her temporary green card, which 
expired in June, 1993, would not be renewed. And if she had been deported, "I 
felt I might never see my daughter again," she said. "Tanyta . . . she's my 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Olejniczak met Ramirez in 1987 in the Netherlands, where he was stationed in 
the Army and she worked for the U.S. military. They were married in August, 
1990, celebrated the birth of Tanyta in March, 1991, separated in October, 
1991, and were divorced by July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was a difficult and often volatile marriage and life afterward was 
even harder. Ramirez paid $385 a month in child support, but no alimony. Having 
trouble making ends meet, Olejniczak approached county welfare authorities for 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 She received $627 for one month, just before the expiration of her green card, 
but said welfare officials told her that without a valid visa she could no 
longer qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here were these welfare people telling me I was an illegal alien," she said, 
"so I thought, 'I better get out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez disputes her version of events, saying her green card had been 
extended to December. Olejniczak claims to have learned about the extension 
only recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just an emptiness," Ramirez said recently. "At night, I look up at 
the sky and wonder if Tanyta sees the same stars I do -- and misses me as much 
as I miss her. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you explain losing your child?"

CHP INVESTIGATING OFFICERS WHO LEFT ILL WOMAN IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two California Highway Patrol officers may have violated department policy 
when they left an ill woman in her car beside the Riverside Freeway, a CHP 
spokesperson said. She died in the car two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP officers could face discipline if they are found to have violated the 
rule that normally bars officers from leaving people on the freeway, CHP 
spokesman Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers discovered Kirsten Harrington, 43, of Cypress in her Mazda on the 
freeway shoulder near Coal Canyon Road about 2 a.m. Monday, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington had vomit on her clothes, and the officers said she was alive, 
Johnson said. But Johnson did not know whether Harrington was conscious or 
spoke to the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason -- I don't know what reason -- they got back in their car 
and left," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A tow truck driver who stopped to check the car about 5:30 a.m. notified 
authorities when he could not wake her, Johnson said. Paramedics found her 
dead. Investigators at the Orange County coroner's office said Harrington died 
of a brain aneurysm about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Aneurysms are weakened artery walls caused by disease or aging that can 
rupture and spur fatal hemorrhaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Coroner Kurt Murine said Wednesday that Harrington's brain 
hemorrhage may have occurred minutes or hours before the estimated time of 
death, making it impossible to determine Harrington's condition when the 
officers checked her. 
</P>
<P>
 The case angered survivors of brain aneurysms, who said Harrington showed 
classic signs of having had such an attack, and they called for more training 
to help police recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the same kind of case as happened with epileptics a decade ago who 
were thrown in the tank as drunks because too many cops didn't know the 
difference," said Jay Murley, president of the Newport Beach-based Brain 
Aneurysm Survivors of North America, which has 22 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Murley said he had symptoms like Harrington's when he suffered an aneurysm in 
late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what the CHP officers concluded when they checked on 
Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1986 CHP policy, an officer must stay with anyone on the side of the 
freeway unless replaced, called away to a bigger emergency or no longer needed 
for help or protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the CHP policy concludes: "Nothing in this order shall be construed as 
requiring an officer to remain with a disabled motorist or other person after 
all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the incident, so long as there 
exists no foreseeable danger to the individual or other traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is based in part on court cases that refined the definition of an 
officer's "special relationship" with people who could be in danger. In some 
instances, California courts have found officers may be liable for failing to 
protect motorists they have stopped to help or investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she did not know whether the officers, who have been interviewed 
by internal investigators, had been ordered elsewhere at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers, who were not identified, will remain on duty during the CHP 
investigation, which is expected to take two weeks, Johnson said.

WILSON TO SIGN STRICT STATEWIDE SMOKING BAN; LEGISLATION: RESTAURANTS, OFFICES, 
STORES, FACTORIES, HOSPITALS AND OTHER LARGE ENCLOSED WORKPLACES WILL BE 
INCLUDED. TOBACCO COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE THEIR BATTLE TO COURT.

<P>
 In a major triumph for anti-smoking advocates, Gov. Pete Wilson announced 
Wednesday that he will sign into law a statewide prohibition on smoking in most 
workplaces that will make California one of the most inhospitable places in the 
nation for smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite intense opposition from the tobacco industry, Wilson said he will sign 
the legislation today at a ceremony in San Francisco. It will be attended by 
representatives of a broad coalition of health and business interests who 
shepherded the measure through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 For several weeks Wilson had hinted that he would approve the measure, telling 
a radio audience this month that "it's (smoking) clearly not a thing that's 
good for anybody's health and the studies are indicating that secondhand smoke 
can be very harmful as well." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until Wednesday that anti-smoking advocates got the formal word 
that the Republican governor was putting his signature on one of the nation's 
toughest smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is making history," said a jubilant Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), the author of the bill who had to outmaneuver the powerful 
tobacco industry to win its passage. "This will be the strongest statewide 
anti-smoking law in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, bans smoking in restaurants, offices, 
stores, factories, hospitals and other large enclosed workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempted from the ban are bars, hotels, warehouses in which 20 or fewer 
employees work, and businesses that employ five or fewer workers where all 
agree to allow smoking and where minors are not allowed. Also permitted is 
smoking in theaters and movie sets where smoking is part of the production, in 
tobacco shops, in medical research facilities studying the effects of smoking 
and in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and the California Medical Assn., one of his chief allies, insisted 
that strong public sentiment against smoking finally gave them the victory over 
the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time it seemed the tobacco lobbyists had killed the bill, the public 
rose up and turned it around," Friedman said. "This is a classic case of David 
slaying the tobacco giant. They've spent millions and millions of dollars on 
lobbyists and campaign contributions to stop this bill and they lost." 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that it still required compromise to pass. As the measure 
faltered at several junctures in the legislative process, he was forced to make 
concessions to push it along. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointed tobacco interests called the new law a de facto prohibition 
against smoking and accused the governor and the Legislature of playing 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The measure) is clearly a statewide ban," said Lee Stitzenberger, campaign 
director of Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions, a group promoting 
an industry-backed initiative that would strike down the new law and water down 
local anti-smoking ordinances as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor and some members of the Legislature are clearly out of step with 
the public and have gone too far," he said. "They've removed any element of 
choice on the part of the individual business owner on how he deals with his 
customers. It's a Draconian measure." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman disputed Stitzenberger's view, saying his measure not only had wide 
public support but also the backing of health organizations and business, 
including "the twin pillars of the tourist industry": restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge victory for the health of California," said Dean Chalios, a 
lobbyist for the medical association. 
</P>
<P>
 However, not all anti-smoking groups were supportive of Friedman's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Goebel, lobbyist for Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, said: "Looking at 
the bill, there's awfully confusing language. Its effectiveness ultimately will 
depend on how it's interpreted." 
</P>
<P>
 Goebel said his organization fears that the tobacco industry will go to the 
courts to impose the worst possible interpretation of the statute -- using the 
bill to overturn stronger local ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman and other backers of the statewide smoking ban are braced for what 
they see as inevitable lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would imagine the tobacco industry will do everything it can to defeat 
this," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 No state has gone as far as California in imposing a statewide smoking ban, 
according to Friedman and others.

CAL STATE TRUSTEES APPROVE INCREASING FEES TO $1,584 A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Acting at the direction of state legislators, Cal State University trustees 
approved a 10% student fee increase Wednesday for the next academic year, 
bringing the basic annual bill at the 20-campus system to $1,584. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is less than half of what trustees had recommended in October, 
when they sought a 24% raise in the 1994-95 state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees pressed for the larger increase -- which would have brought the 
annual fee to $1,782 -- as part of their long-term strategy to make students 
pay charges that are about equal to a third of the cost of their instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 But during budget deliberations this summer, Gov. Pete Wilson and legislators 
set the CSU increase at 10% as part of a budget deal that gave the 
247,000-student system $1.55 billion with which to operate this year -- about 
$60 million more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase will take effect for the fall term and is the eighth in a row 
since 1986, when CSU charged students $573 a year. The fees crept up each year 
thereafter, but escalated sharply after legislators began making significant 
budget cuts in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 10% increase was unanimously approved, university trustees and 
Chancellor Barry Munitz affirmed their goal to keep pressing for student fee 
increases until annual charges reach about $2,500, or about a third of the 
estimated $7,500 cost to educate an undergraduate, spokeswoman Colleen 
Bentley-Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed to try to meet the Legislature's goal of enrolling 250,000 
students in the next academic year, about 3,000 more than now attend CSU 
campuses. In recent years, however, some campuses have been forced to limit 
enrollment and close classes because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the basic fee, CSU students pay $200 a year in special campus activity 
fees.

MAJOR FIRES 4 MINISTERS IN BRITISH CABINET SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major fired four senior Cabinet members Wednesday in the 
largest shake-up of his government, a move that analysts said would allow him 
to present a fresh, forward-looking team to bolster his sagging popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Major's biggest surprise was the appointment of Jeremy Hanley, the relatively 
unknown armed forces minister, as Conservative Party chairman with Cabinet 
rank. Hanley now is expected to mastermind the next Tory electoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed over for the party job was Jeffrey Archer, the novelist and 
Conservative politician who had been touted for the chairmanship but who became 
involved in an investigation of alleged insider stock trading. A final report 
on Archer's case is on the desk of Michael Heseltine, minister of trade and 
industry, but has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's Cabinet shuffle was also designed to counter the new Labor Party 
team. Its new leader will be announced today and is expected to be Tony Blair, 
41, an engaging moderate who preaches "modernism." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tory party's fortunes have been sagging badly in opinion polls, and, 
analysts said, the Cabinet shuffle -- on the day before Parliament recesses for 
the summer -- was intended to get rid of ministers who had been disappointing 
and to introduce fresh blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropped from the Cabinet were: Education and Science Minister John Patten, 
once a high-flier in government circles; Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke, who 
botched the D-day celebrations; Transport Minister John MacGregor, who has been 
tarred by the railroad strike, and John Wakeham, leader in the House of Lords. 
</P>
<P>
 The new faces are: Jonathan Aitken, who went from defense minister to chief 
secretary to the Treasury; Steven Dorrell, former junior Treasury minister, to 
heritage secretary; Brian Mawhinney, former No. 2 at the Health Department, to 
transport minister, and Lord Cranborne, new leader in the House of Lords. 
</P>
<P>
 Three major Cabinet posts were left unchanged: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 
Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting Cabinet jobs were: Gillian Shephard from agriculture to education; 
Michael Portillo from Treasury to employment; David Hunt from employment to 
chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, in which he is expected to coordinate 
government policy; William Waldegrave from chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 
to agriculture minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The shake-up also involved several junior ministers in various government 
departments and political aides to government ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers said the Cabinet's political coloration had not 
drastically changed -- pro-Europeans vs. Euroskeptics -- but that Major's 
selections had edged it slightly to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanley, 48, is boisterous and popular. He will have two deputies, including 
writer Michael Dobbs, author of the television series, "To Play the King," a 
political thriller. Hanley succeeds former party chairman Sir Norman Fowler, 
who had expressed a wish to step down from the exhausting job.

YELTSIN CRITICIZES DIVIDE BETWEEN RICH AND POOR; RUSSIA: LEADER ATTACKS 
BUREAUCRATS, CORRUPT FACTORY CHIEFS. HE REITERATES VOW TO COMBAT CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sounding like the fiery crusader of old, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
lashed out Wednesday at fat-cat bureaucrats who behave like "nobility" and 
factory directors who live "like Russian sheiks" while failing to pay their 
workers for months on end. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare interview published Wednesday, Yeltsin bemoaned the growing divide 
between rich and poor in this formerly egalitarian society. He suggested that 
taxing the nouveaux riches might help close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said that inflation, now running at 6% a month, should be down to 2% 
or 3% per month by the end of 1995. And he insisted that Russia needs to pursue 
the crackdown on crime that he ordered, despite criticisms that it violates 
human rights and the Russian constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian public opinion seems squarely behind the president on this issue. The 
perception that crime is out of control was reinforced this week when the 
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that twice as many Russians were killed 
in gang wars last year than during the nine-year Soviet war in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Flexing the more muscular foreign policy that has kept his nationalist critics 
at bay -- but disconcerts his Western allies -- Yeltsin promised that 1994 
would bring "a breakthrough in Russia's status in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are not just listening," he said. "We are actively formulating 
proposals, conditions and demands. This is a brand-new situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old Siberian has not been seen in public since the Naples, Italy, 
summit of leaders of the world's most powerful economies. Yeltsin missed two 
days of work because of what aides called a minor flu. But he was reported back 
at work in the Kremlin on Wednesday, and sent out feisty written answers to 
questions submitted by the Interfax news service. 
</P>
<P>
 In vintage Yeltsin style, the president lambasted his own government for its 
failures, flayed those who are living high while their countrymen suffer 
through 2 1/2 years of painful economic transformation, raged that his orders 
were not being implemented -- and was tantalizingly short on details about how 
he plans to change all this. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Yeltsin, whose aides have been hinting that he may run for 
reelection, sounded a lot like a presidential candidate, an outsider attacking 
a government that has become arrogant and indifferent to the mistreatment of 
its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said the Kremlin has been tracking 109 Russian enterprises that are 
not paying their workers or debts to suppliers -- a chronic problem in Russia 
that has created financial gridlock and paralyzed the economy. Yeltsin said the 
problem is not that factories are broke but that they are misusing funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture in many of them is simply disgusting," he said. "Workers have not 
been paid in three or four months. The directors cry, 'Give us money!' And at 
the very same time, millions of dollars are being held in hard-currency bank 
accounts, invested in dubious enterprises and private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is being spent on some unthinkable luxuries for the managers" who 
drive expensive cars and pay themselves salaries of up to $5,400 a month, a sum 
that seems obscene in a nation where the average monthly salary is less than 
$100, Yeltsin said, noting, "Some of these directors are turning into Russian 
sheiks at state expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials who used to act like democrats now imagine themselves as "a 
special noble class, completely cut off from the sinful Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Such delicious rhetoric is reminiscent of the Politburo-bashing that brought 
Yeltsin such popularity in the late 1980s. But other than calling for a general 
crackdown, the president did not say how he would curb his minions' appetites 
for the perquisites of post-Soviet power. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview was also silent on another touchy subject: the talks with 
Estonia over a Russian troop pullout. In Naples, Yeltsin upstaged President 
Clinton by announcing his troops would not pull out of Estonia by Aug. 31 as 
promised because of "gross violations of human rights" of Russian speakers 
living there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin promised Clinton he would meet with Estonian President Lennart 
Meri, and ace Russian negotiator Vitaly S. Churkin, a deputy foreign minister, 
was dispatched to Helsinki, Finland, to try to negotiate a deal for withdrawing 
the 2,000 Russian troops. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday the talks ended in an apparent stalemate. Russia is demanding 
social guarantees for retired Red Army officers who wish to remain in Estonia, 
while the Baltic nation sees them as a potential "fifth column" that has been 
demobilized on its territory.

AMERICAN ALBUM: CONGRESS RELISHES ANOTHER FRANKING PRIVILEGE; MEAT LOBBY PUTS 
ON THE DOG WITH EXCLUSIVE LUNCHEON FOR LAWMAKERS -- EXPERTS ON PORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 From the outside, it might have been an intimate afternoon cocktail soiree for 
some distinguished head of state. One hundred lawmakers and their families. By 
invitation only. Press secretaries must be accompanied by a member of Congress. 
Guest passes not transferable. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside it was just a bunch of lawmakers stuffing foot-longs in their 
faces, thinking of patriotic musings about hot dogs and contemplating one of 
life's great mysteries: Why do they sell weenies in packs of 10 and buns in 
packs of eight? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were born and raised in America, if you ever heard about America, if 
you came to America after you were born, you gotta love hot dogs," Rep. Austin 
J. Murphy (D-Pa.) declared before devouring a traditional with mustard and 
relish, a red Hebrew National cap on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hot Dog Lunch of 1994 has become the social ticket of the summer. OK, so 
that's a slight exaggeration. But they were turning them away at the door 
Wednesday in a Capitol Hill courtyard where the American Meat Institute served 
up hundreds of free hot dogs and sodas in an effort to remind Congress of a 
great American institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The uninvited were flashing congressional passes and begging to get in. One 
man said he absolutely had to clean the courtyard fountain. And why wouldn't it 
go over big? This party combined two of Congress' most affectionately held 
institutions: pork and a free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, congressman. We got all-beef, low-fat," someone from OhSe Foods of 
Topeka, Kan., told Rep. John J. (Jimmy) Duncan Jr. (R-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't eat anything fat-free," said the congressman, who used to be a batboy 
and knows his way around a hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, this has some fat in it," the hot dog man replied, eager to put the 
dog's best foot forward, it being National Hot Dog Month and all. 
</P>
<P>
 This was more than just food. It was a cultural experience. And this was more 
than just lunch. It was lobbying in a bun. Not since the ice cream freebie had 
buttonholing been such fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our chance to highlight the meat and poultry industry. This is the 
one big event we do, " Meat Institute spokeswoman Janet Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a perfect day. There was some concern that the humans inhabiting the 
Arnie the Hot Dog and Smiley the Pig suits might pass out in the searing heat. 
And President Clinton failed to show up again, his nametag left unpinned on the 
greeting table. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the meat industry seemed to be preaching to the converted. 
Congressmen gleefully wolfed down every imaginable version of the hot dog -- 
smoked kielbasas, jumbo grillers, Big & Juicy's, kosher dogs and spiced dogs -- 
topped with every imaginable condiment -- hot mustard, sweet mustard, 
jalapenos, spaghetti sauce, regular relish, corn relish, maple syrup salsa and 
the secret sauce of Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.). ("If I told you the recipe," an 
aide explained, "I'd have to shoot you.") 
</P>
<P>
 The Meat Institute crew worked to debunk the popularly held notion that hot 
dogs will kill you faster than movie popcorn or nachos. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the urban myth," Riley said. "Hot dogs are made from trimmings, which 
come from perfectly good cuts of meat. If they use liver or kidney . . . it 
will say 'variety meats' on the package. Otherwise it's whole muscle meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Yummie. 
</P>
<P>
 Several congressman got quite involved in the event, even submitting their 
favorite hot dog recipes, which were assembled into "The Congressional Hot Dog 
Recipe Book: the Private Hot Dog Recipes of Members of Congress." Contributions 
from ever-health-conscious California were conspicuously absent, although it is 
said that Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) once submitted the San FranKcisco, 
which called for sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 For those not seduced by the dogs, there were former baseball players Jim 
(Catfish) Hunter, Warren Spahn, Bobby Thomson and Jim Bouton on hand to sign 
free baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the meat industry made its point. A good hot dog is hard to 
resist, although the less one thinks about the ingredients, the better. As one 
news photographer put it, beholding the last bite of her Hebrew National: 
"We're all gonna die anyway."

MAO, STALIN GAVE KIM OK TO WAGE WAR, DOCUMENTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after North Korea completed a memorial ceremony Wednesday for its late 
leader, Kim Il Sung, South Korea offered a different recollection of him 
through Soviet documents that show he plotted the 1950-53 Korean War with the 
approval of Moscow and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Seoul's Foreign Ministry released documents that Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin had given President Kim Young Sam during a visit to Moscow in June. 
They showed that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung 
approved Kim Il Sung's attack on South Korea in June, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, when Kim asked Stalin for troop support from the Soviet 
Union, China and other Communist nations, the Soviet dictator told him, "Ask 
China." 
</P>
<P>
 Chou En-lai, then China's prime minister and foreign minister, wanted to 
reject the request. But the documents show that he was overruled, according to 
Seoul's Foreign Ministry. Chinese troops entered the war in late October, 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 The release, in summary form, of 216 Korean War-related Soviet government 
records -- along with the full texts of what were called "four key documents" 
-- appeared to be timed to counteract moves among a small minority of South 
Koreans to pay tribute to Kim Il Sung as a nationalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Their disclosure, which officials here concede will upset North Korea, also 
underscored earlier indications that the Seoul government is not interested in 
quickly rescheduling a first-ever North-South summit that Kim Young Sam and Kim 
Il Sung had agreed upon before the North Korean leader's death July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea informed the South on July 11 that it would be forced to 
"postpone" a meeting between the leaders of the two governments, which, if now 
held, presumably would be attended by Kim Jong Il for the North. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of South Korean officials, Kim Jong Il, who has never 
delivered a speech, again remained silent during the 75-minute memorial 
ceremony that appeared to be designed to consolidate support for him as his 
father's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's silence and his haggard appearance spurred South Korean media to 
speculate that the new "Dear Leader" was ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts interpreted the memorial ceremony as the official conclusion 
of mourning and predicted that another occasion would be created for Kim's 
debut. Officially, North Korea has not announced Kim's assumption of three key 
positions that were held by his father.

MURAYAMA SAYS FORCES ARE CONSTITUTIONAL; JAPAN: IN TURNABOUT, NEW SOCIALIST 
PREMIER DECLARES MILITARY OK IF USED FOR DEFENSIVE PURPOSES. CRITICS SAY HE 
SOLD OUT PARTY'S PRINCIPLES FOR POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialist Party chairman elected Japan's prime minister 
last month, on Wednesday overturned more than 40 years of party policy and 
declared that Japan's Self-Defense Forces do not violate the nation's pacifist 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lively parliamentary session, Murayama declared that the forces do not 
violate the constitutional ban on use of military power to settle international 
disputes as long as they are kept at a minimum and used for purely defensive 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 His turnabout on one of the Socialists' most defining policies drew hoots and 
applause from both the ruling party coalition and the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's statement laid to rest fears that Japan's first Socialist prime 
minister since 1947 would seek to impose his party's leftist views on 
longstanding national policies. 
</P>
<P>
 He drew sharp criticism, however, from opposition leaders and some Socialists, 
who say he sold out the party's principles for the sake of political 
expediency. 
</P>
<P>
 In other departures from entrenched Socialist policies, Murayama reiterated 
support for the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and said he would "respect" the 
rising-sun flag and "Kimigayo" anthem as national symbols. Most Socialists 
opposed them as symbols of Japan's imperialism during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a big step toward national consensus on defense, the security 
treaty and the SDF (security forces)," said a visibly delighted Tetsuya 
Nishimoto, the Japan Defense Agency's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the magnitude of Murayama's policy flip-flop, most Socialists seemed 
resigned to it as an acceptance of reality. The issue will be formally decided 
at the party's general meeting in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese news media reported a "heavy mood" in the Socialist section of 
the lower house of Parliament, where Murayama made his statement in response to 
sharp questioning by former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the opposition 
Renewal Party. But most Socialists felt the switch "couldn't be helped," the 
press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Party spokesman Masamitsu Saito said 80% of the executive committee supported 
Murayama's position, which he said was the culmination of a new, more realistic 
policy shift that began in 1991. Last year, the party drafted a new policy, 
declaring the forces themselves constitutional but their present size and 
military capabilities beyond constitutional limits because they went beyond 
mere defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy was never officially adopted, but Saito said it remains the party's 
general position. He argued that Murayama has not actually contradicted the 
party position because he has stressed the need for a reduction in forces -- a 
direction the Japan Defense Agency is headed toward anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Socialists have not tackled the question of how far military 
capabilities must be curtailed to bring them in line with the constitution, 
Saito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saito said he did not believe the party is in danger of splintering over the 
issue. Asked what the Socialists now stand for since they have abandoned many 
of their defining principles, Saito said they will seek alliance with other 
forces to limit the size and scope of Japan's political and military muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 That position -- that Japan should be a "small but shining nation" -- has been 
chiefly advocated by Masayoshi Takemura, the head of the New Party Harbinger 
who is now serving as finance minister in the current coalition government. His 
party jointly rules with the Socialists and the Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition advocates a more active role for Japan in international 
diplomacy and U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But if most Socialists seemed unperturbed by the turnabout, many Japanese 
expressed bewilderment or disgust. "They have changed their approach 
completely," one woman told television reporters. "It sounds like they're 
telling a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two new newspaper polls showed widespread disapproval of the 
Murayama Cabinet. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported a 46.2% disapproval rating -- 
the second-highest in history for a newly inaugurated administration -- 
compared with 37.1% approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asahi Shimbun found a 44% disapproval rating, compared with 35% approval. 
The survey also found that 56% of those asked felt uneasy about Murayama's 
international debut at the recent summit of leaders of the world's most 
powerful industrialized nations in Naples, Italy.

U.S. TO SEEK U.N. OK FOR HAITI ATTACK, OFFICIALS SAY; CARIBBEAN: ADMINISTRATION 
PLANS TO LINE UP AS MANY AS 3,000 TROOPS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES FOR INVASION 
FORCE. 
</P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration has decided to seek a U.N. Security Council 
resolution authorizing an invasion of Haiti by a U.S.-led multinational force 
to topple the military regime, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Administration plans to back up the threat by lining up 
units for an invasion force of as many as 15,000 troops -- most of them 
American, but as many as 3,000 from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats already have begun seeking commitments from other countries 
both to support the proposed Security Council resolution and to offer troops 
for a "multilateral force," reporters were told. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the new effort, officials said, is to persuade Haiti's military 
rulers to step down peacefully rather than risk an invasion this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Haiti's Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras refuses to leave, the U.N. resolution and 
the multilateral force would make it easier for President Clinton to order an 
invasion because he would then have international authority for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. diplomatic effort thus reflects two competing desires on 
Clinton's part: to persuade Cedras that the American threat to invade Haiti is 
serious but also to ensure that the United States is not left to act alone in 
any military action in the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
 It also reflects what officials have described as an increasing willingness to 
consider the use of force on the part of U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali and some members of the Security Council, including not only 
Russia and France but also Argentina and Brazil, Latin American countries 
traditionally opposed to U.S. military action in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman David Johnson said the Administration's goal is to 
assemble "a U.N.-sanctioned coalition force with a mandate to establish a 
secure and stable environment" in Haiti. He said Undersecretary of State Peter 
Tarnoff flew to New York on Tuesday and discussed the idea with Boutros-Ghali, 
who encouraged the U.S.-led effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson reaffirmed the Administration's basic policy of seeking a peaceful end 
to the impasse in Haiti, where the Security Council has demanded that the 
military leaders who overthrew the nation's elected president, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, step down. "Our strong preference is for this to be resolved by 
diplomatic means," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he confirmed that the Administration is moving ahead with plans for 
multilateral military action if diplomacy fails to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials refused to say how long it would be before a multinational invasion 
force is ready. But the diplomatic task of winning a Security Council 
resolution would normally require at least two weeks and the job of assembling 
military units from several countries longer than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, American and foreign diplomats in Haiti predicted that no 
invasion is possible before September because of the time needed to put 
together a U.N.-authorized force. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have refused to discuss how large a force would be needed to 
overwhelm the lightly armed Haitian army of about 7,000 troops. But 
Boutros-Ghali, in a report to the Security Council last week, estimated that 
15,000 troops would be needed to restore order in Haiti even if Cedras and his 
supporters left the country peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and other officials said the Administration is basing its plans on 
Boutros-Ghali's report, which said the initial U.S.-run force of 15,000 could 
gradually give way to a U.N.-led peacekeeping operation with fewer than 4,000 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have said they do not expect other countries to 
contribute large numbers of troops to the initial invasion force. But if the 
Security Council is willing to authorize a largely U.S. force, the need for 
foreign contingents is viewed as minimal -- and the task of assembling the 
force is made easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a likely diplomatic scenario, the United States would circulate as early 
as this week a proposed Security Council resolution that would authorize 
unnamed countries to use "all necessary means" to compel Cedras to step down. 
The same phrase was used in the 1990 resolution that authorized the United 
States and its allies to go to war with Iraq to reverse its invasion of 
neighboring Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf War resolution gave Iraq's regime a six-week deadline to comply with 
the United Nations' demands before allied military action was authorized. 
Whether the proposed Haiti resolution will include a similar deadline for 
Cedras is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning Security Council approval for such a resolution will be a major test 
of skill for Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Administration's 
other diplomats. In the months before the Gulf War, then-Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III jetted around the world in a frantic campaign to win support 
from council members, including China, with which the United States has prickly 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Clinton succeeds in winning a strong Security Council resolution, he 
is expected to declare that he still retains the option of a unilateral 
invasion by the United States -- to maximize pressure on the Haitian regime.

SUSPECT'S FAMILY ASSAILS PROBE OF COLOSIO CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a former Tijuana factory worker, who is accused of assassinating 
a leading Mexican presidential candidate, on Wednesday harshly criticized the 
government investigation of the case in letters to Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari and other top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's family, writing with the aid of prominent Los Angeles human 
rights attorneys, asserts that Mario Aburto Martinez may have been tortured 
into confessing to the killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was widely expected 
to be elected Mexico's next president before he was gunned down March 23 at a 
Tijuana rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican authorities say Aburto has admitted to the crime. But he later told 
interviewers that he was beaten by interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have serious doubts whether the investigation conducted has been complete, 
or whether Mario will receive a fair trial," wrote his parents, Ruben Aburto 
and Maria Luis Martinez of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Their comments come at an important time in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The special prosecutor who had handled the Colosio investigation resigned last 
week amid sharp criticism of his conclusion that Aburto acted alone. Salinas 
appointed a new prosecutor, insisting that the case is not closed. Delays in 
concluding the assassination inquiry have increased the air of uncertainty in 
Mexico, where national elections are scheduled one month from today. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's relatives, who believe he is being singled out unfairly in what they 
say may be an assassination conspiracy, have indicated they will take an active 
role in the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, Ruben Aburto is scheduled to provide his first sworn testimony in 
the case in a special proceeding before U.S. prosecutors in Los Angeles. They 
are acting on a request from Mexican officials. The father could be a 
significant new witness because he says his son's behavior before the 
assassination indicated that Mario Aburto may have been drawn into a plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing concern for Aburto's well-being and questioning the adequacy of his 
government-provided defense, relatives want to visit the suspect in his cell 
near Mexico City. They want to bring along independent lawyers and physicians, 
including a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The family challenges authorities' portrayal of a politically obsessed Aburto 
whose writings and drawings attest to unstable character. Relatives call Aburto 
sane, law-abiding, hard-working and indifferent to politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the government's focus on Mario Aburto as the sole assassin 
results from a desire to complete this matter as quickly as possible, and Mr. 
Aburto's lack of political and economic status," attorneys Peter A. Schey and 
Carlos Holguin, both affiliated with the Los Angeles-based Center for Human 
Rights and Constitutional Law, wrote in a letter accompanying the parents' 
correspondence. Salinas' office had no immediate response.

COMMENTS ON FOSTER DECRIED AS 'SHAMEFUL'; SUICIDE: FAMILY AND WHITE HOUSE 
DENOUNCE LAWMAKER'S CALL FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION BECAUSE OF HAIRS AND OTHER 
EVIDENCE FOUND ON THE AIDE'S BODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the anniversary of White House aide Vincent Foster's suicide, his family 
Wednesday joined the White House in denouncing Republican Rep. Dan Burton's 
declaration from the House floor that blond hairs found on Foster's body, and 
other evidence, merit further investigation of the death. 
</P>
<P>
 One week before the start of Whitewater hearings in Congress that may explore 
the subject, Foster's wife, sister and children broke a yearlong silence to say 
they were "particularly appalled by the shameful statements . . . of a 
legislator . . . purposefully employing outrageous innuendo and speculation for 
partisan ends." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House called statements by the Indiana Republican outrageous and 
portrayed them as part of a concerted effort by conservatives to increase the 
publicity about the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The former White House deputy counsel, one of the Clintons' closest friends, 
was found dead of a pistol wound July 20, 1993, in Ft. Marcy Park in Virginia, 
just across the Potomac from Washington. Robert B. Fiske Jr., the independent 
counsel charged with investigating Whitewater, found in a report June 30 that 
the evidence "overwhelmingly supports" the original police finding of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House statement, underscoring Administration officials' genuine 
distaste at continuing questions about the death, also seemed designed to throw 
the opposition on the defensive by highlighting comments that even some 
Republicans have privately questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, in a speech last week, pointed to a variety of evidence that he said 
is insufficiently explained. It included blond and light-brown head hairs found 
on Foster's undershirt, pants, belt, socks and shoes, and multicolored carpet 
fibers found on his clothing and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of this evidence, if any, was not directly addressed in the 
Fiske report. A White House aide said the hair could have come from fair-haired 
members of Foster's family. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also said Fiske has asked for all files connected to the 
Foster death in an effort to clear up lingering questions about his suicide. 
Joel Klein, deputy White House counsel, directed the White House staff to turn 
over all such documents by close of business Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum, Klein said staff members should turn over "all documents in 
your custody, possession or control relating to any activities or events in 
connection with Vincent Foster's death, or the search of his office following 
his death or the disposition of any documents in his office or in the safe" in 
the office of then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 In their statement, Foster's widow, Lisa, sister, Sheila Foster Anthony, and 
children said there was "no justification for the painful, repetitious 
examination of the issues," which appeared to be "chiefly motivated by 
mean-spirited partisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 "Also despicable are the speculations about Vince's death being spread by 
those calling themselves Christian ministers," it said. "It is so unfair for 
the family's privacy and emotions to be part of a partisan struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Burton insisted Wednesday that he had been "very careful 
throughout this whole process not to make any irresponsible accusations or 
unsubstantiated allegations." He said in a statement that, although he had "a 
great deal of compassion" for Foster's family, "I believe that getting answers 
to these questions is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Since issuance of the Fiske report, some conservative Republicans, columnists 
and talk-show hosts have assailed the investigation as a cover-up and clamored 
for a broadened look in the upcoming hearings in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The televised hearings that begin next week are to be limited to two topics: 
the propriety of contacts between White House officials and federal banking 
regulators looking into the Clintons' Whitewater Development Corp. investment, 
and Foster's death.

BOSNIAN SERBS TURN DOWN PEACE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs turned down a take-it-or-leave-it peace deal Wednesday, dashing 
hopes for peace and testing the international resolve for reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. envoy Charles Redman told reporters that "the Serbs have not been able to 
accept" the plan, sponsored by the United States, Russia, France, Britain and 
Germany.Serbian leaders refused to talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The five nations had threatened to lift the arms embargo on the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government if Serbs rejected the proposal, presented two weeks ago in a 
bid to end 27 months of war. They also threatened to tighten sanctions against 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic arrived in Geneva on Wednesday and 
refused to discuss the Serbian position before meeting with the plan's 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, sources close to the Serbian leadership said the Serbs' 
self-styled parliament set conditions for acceptance that amount to a 
renegotiation of the entire plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its allies said they would not accept any conditional 
response from the warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all disappointed that the answer was not what we expected," Redman 
said.

LITTLE HOPE FOR BOMB SURVIVORS IN ARGENTINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hopes for finding more survivors buried in the blast rubble of Argentina's 
main Jewish community center dwindled Wednesday as 76 people were missing and 
feared dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Monday's bomb explosion razed the building, the number of known 
dead hit 39 as Argentine and Israeli rescue workers pulled four corpses out of 
the wreckage and a hospitalized survivor died. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Meir Zamir, the military attache at Israel's embassy here, said the type 
and amount of explosive used is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Saul Menem and Jewish leaders say the attack looks like the 
work of Islamic extremists, and Israeli officials have pointed the finger at 
Iran and its allies in Lebanon.

<P>
 The most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the central Pacific was on track 
Wednesday to pass 350 miles south of Hawaii, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane Emilia, packing sustained winds of 160 m.p.h. with gusts to 195 
m.p.h., was expected to move past Hawaii today. While the storm was not 
expected to cause problems for the state, forecasters warned that it could 
change direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very dangerous and powerful storm," said Dick Sasaki, a forecaster 
with the National Weather Service. The storm is listed as a Category 5 
hurricane -- the most powerful storm designation.

CHRONIC ADDICTS SEEN AT CORE OF U.S. DRUG ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Illicit drug use by Americans leveled off last year after declining for 13 
years, illustrating that many of the nation's remaining drug users are chronic 
addicts and not casual users, the government reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Releasing their annual household survey on drug abuse, officials of the 
Department of Health and Human Services said that the remaining 11.7 million 
drug users include many hard-core addicts who have been difficult to reach with 
education and treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said that, from a peak of 
24.3 million in 1979, the number of Americans who used cocaine, heroin, 
marijuana and other drugs dropped gradually to 11.4 million in 1992. Drug abuse 
then rose to 11.7 million last year, a marginal increase not statistically 
significant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the survey show the need to focus treatment efforts on longer-term, 
hard-core drug users "if we are ever going to solve America's drug problem," 
Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee P. Brown, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, said at a news briefing with Shalala that "there should be no question 
now about treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Treatment does work and can save this country millions of dollars in lost 
productivity in the workplace and can reduce crime and violence in our 
communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting a rise in the rate of marijuana use by 12- to 17-year-olds from 4% in 
1992 to 4.9% last year, Shalala told reporters: "It's worrisome news that we 
have not changed young people's minds about the dangers of drug use." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that she fears young pot smokers will show up as users of hard-core 
drugs in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The national rise of marijuana use among the young mirrors results of a 
California-wide study released last month by state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. In 
that study, two of five California 11th-graders said that they had used pot at 
least once within a six-month period, an increase of 10% from a similar study 
conducted two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of current cocaine users was placed at 1.3 million by the national 
survey, the same as in 1992 and down from a peak of 5.3 million in 1985. 
Occasional users -- less often than monthly -- numbered 3 million last year, 
down from 8.1 million in 1985, according to the study. There was no significant 
change in the number of hard-core, weekly users of cocaine, which remained 
stable at slightly under 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brown said that the annual household drug survey traditionally 
underestimates some chronic groups of addicts because it does not reach 
prisoners, institutionalized persons, the homeless, students living at college 
and active-duty military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's office estimates that there are 2.1 million hard-core cocaine addicts, 
for example, while the survey placed the figure at less than one-fourth that 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Shalala both made a pitch for passage of Clinton Administration 
legislation that they said is needed to treat hard-core users, even though they 
acknowledged that it might be politically unpopular.

POWERFUL ALLIES PUSH UNIVERSAL COVERAGE; LEGISLATION: AFL-CIO, DOCTORS AND 
SENIORS' LOBBY CALL FOR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH REFORM. THEY FEAR CLINTON, 
CONGRESS MAY SETTLE FOR SOMETHING LESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a boost for President Clinton's health reform initiative, leaders of three 
powerful groups forged an unusual alliance Wednesday and called on Congress to 
enact comprehensive reform that achieves universal coverage by requiring 
employers to provide insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand was issued by the AFL-CIO, the American Medical Assn. and the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons amid growing signs that the White House and 
Congress may settle for something less than coverage for everyone and rely on 
financing mechanisms that will not deliver sufficient subsidies to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 If those proposals are followed, new hardships will be inflicted on the three 
groups in the alliance. For instance, reimbursement rates for doctors will be 
lower, union members will have a smaller field of providers to chose from and 
the elderly will see deeper cuts in the Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
 Reform measures that do not provide universal coverage are expected to raise 
the cost of insurance premiums and may actually increase the number of 
uninsured, now estimated at 38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Covering all Americans is essential to effective insurance reform, 
eliminating cost-shifting, and ensuring patient choice of physician and health 
plan," the groups' leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing nothing is a prescription for disaster," Horace Deets, AARP executive 
director, said at a press conference. "Doing too little, too late is a 
prescription for slow-motion disaster." Deets was joined by James Todd, AMA 
executive vice president, and Lane Kirkland, AFL-CIO president. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's late in the day for Congress," Deets said. "We can't let this 
opportunity slip by." 
</P>
<P>
 In urging Congress to take bold action this year, the three groups put aside 
their differences over narrower issues, touching off speculation that other 
major interest groups may follow suit in these climactic weeks of congressional 
action. For instance, the American Hospital Assn., which has differences with 
the three groups on various issues, issued a letter hailing the alliance's call 
to action. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts were dubious about a new outpouring of support and wondered 
whether Wednesday's announcement will breathe new life into Clinton's agenda 
or, in the words of Washington analyst Bruce Fried, merely "add to the 
cacophony." 
</P>
<P>
 The three groups got together once before -- when they called a little-noticed 
press conference two years ago to urge candidates in the 1992 presidential 
campaign to discuss health care reform thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disappointingly, much of the ensuing public dialogue has been clouded by 
misinformation, scare tactics and negative messages," the three leaders said in 
their statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for reform now is "more urgent, more timely and more crucial," Deets 
said. He also said that true reform must offer universal coverage "not as a 
vague promise but on a timetable specified in law." 
</P>
<P>
 All three men said that their organizations would step up pressure on Congress 
to act. Kirkland said that he fears Congress will adopt "some kind of 
pseudo-reform that will exact an enormous price from working people." 
</P>
<P>
 All three warned against enacting reforms only in the insurance market, such 
as barring insurers from jacking up premiums on those who develop costly 
illnesses or refusing to cover those with such conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibiting such discriminatory practices without also providing universal 
coverage could lead to higher rates for the insured and increase the ranks of 
uninsured, as the experience of New York state has demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without universal coverage and an employer mandate, any health care reform 
bill will betray the hopes of America's working families and the AFL-CIO would 
oppose such legislation," Kirkland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton made that same point, warning 
Senate supporters on Capitol Hill against "piecemeal reform." 
</P>

 Todd's 300,000-member AMA has come full circle on workplace-based coverage, 
from supporting to opposing to supporting it again. "We agree that universal 
coverage is important," he said. "We agree that it should be a shared 
responsibility between employers and employees. It is a historic point that 
cannot be missed and health system reform of a meaningful nature must occur 
this year."

25 YEARS AFTER MOONWALK, A STARRY SALUTE; ANNIVERSARY: AT WHITE HOUSE, 
PRESIDENT PRAISES APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUTS AND THE PROMISE OF THAT 1969 MISSION. 
BUT SOME FEAR THE PIONEER SPIRIT HAS WANED.

 Twenty-five years after American astronauts left their footprints in the lunar 
dust and on human history, President Clinton on Wednesday commended the first 
moon explorers and the U.S. space program for expanding the horizons of science 
and the imaginations of a generation of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the veterans of the Apollo 11 mission "realized the dreams of a 
nation" the day Neil Armstrong announced that he had taken "one small step for 
a man, one giant leap for mankind," Clinton used the White House ceremony 
commemorating the first lunar landing to demonstrate support for the current 
space program, which has been riddled with cost overruns and charges of 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong, fellow moonwalker Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin and Michael Collins, who 
circled the moon in the command ship, Columbia, while his colleagues went to 
the moon's surface on the lunar lander, Eagle, took center stage in front of a 
giant photograph of Aldrin standing on the bleak, gray surface of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the Space Age, we have increased the knowledge of our universe a 
thousandfold," said Armstrong, now a graying electronics executive. Turning to 
a group of science students, he said: "We leave you much that is undone. There 
are great ideas undiscovered, breakthroughs available to those who can remove 
one of truth's protective layers. There are places to go beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
 But some former astronauts and National Aerospace and Space Administration 
officials voiced doubts about whether Americans will ever reach those places, 
saying that the silver-anniversary celebration underscores a lack of vision and 
commitment to space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 In breakfast remarks to members of Congress and former astronauts, Aldrin 
bemoaned "a withered capacity for wonder and a growing retreat to delusions of 
a risk-free society" that he said have overtaken what were once bright-eyed 
visions of space travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Kranz, who served as Apollo 11's flight controller, said in a 
television interview Wednesday that failure to follow up lunar landings with 
construction of a permanent moon station is "like Columbus discovering America 
and then deciding never to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton assured the Apollo 11 explorers and the 18 other Apollo astronauts 
attending the White House ceremony that "our commitment to the space program is 
strong and unwavering. The best way to honor these men and all the others who 
have helped us so much is to continue that quest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back on that mission, one thing is clear that we ought to remember 
today -- it wasn't easy," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic 1969 flight came close to failure when a computer that was 
supposed to safely maneuver the tiny landing craft, which measured only 13 feet 
in diameter, brought the vehicle dangerously close to a crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong took over the controls and touched down on the moon with only 20 
seconds of fuel remaining. NASA navigators 250,000 miles away in Houston heaved 
a sigh of relief when they heard a garbled transmission: "the Eagle has 
landed." 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 1 billion people watched on television as America cemented its 
triumph over the Soviet Union in a space race born of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a sign that today's scientists are hoping for greater international 
cooperation in future space exploration, two Russian cosmonauts were among the 
guests at the White House ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee -- who earlier in 
the day had approved a bill authorizing construction of the $14-billion space 
station -- also filed into the East Room ceremony after their vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that the project would hasten discoveries in medicine and other 
fields, bolster the aerospace industry and inspire young people to follow in 
the footsteps of Armstrong, Aldrin and their moonwalking colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some already have a head start. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I didn't really believe people could go to the moon," said Kristina 
McNeill, a 12-year-old student from Wilmington, N.C., who attended the ceremony 
with her classmates from the Young Astronaut science program. "I do want be an 
astronaut someday."

EFFORT TO CONTROL COMPUTER DATA ENCODING ENDED

 The Clinton Administration retreated Wednesday from its efforts to control the 
method of scrambling private communications on the information superhighway 
when it said the federal standard will apply only to telephone conversations, 
not to computer exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement is a significant victory for the U.S. computer software 
industry.It has said an electronic device called the Clipper Chip -- the name 
for the government's method of maintaining its ability to eavesdrop -- 
endangers privacy and damages U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore announced the new government position in a letter to 
Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), a Clipper opponent who represents the district 
that is home to software giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clipper is dead," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation, a high-technology policy and advocacy group. He called 
Gore's announcement a "big step, both for privacy and security." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's letter outlines a framework for future negotiations on the complex 
subject of how to secure data transmissions and guarantee government access to 
them. Gore said the new encoding standard "would be voluntary and would be 
exportable."

PANEL BACKS VACCINE PROGRAM DELAY, CITES WAREHOUSE

 The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a proposal Wednesday to delay the 
start of President Clinton's immunization program beyond Oct. 1 because of 
concern over plans for distribution of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), a leading critic of the Clinton Administration's 
plans to begin the $500-million program in the fall, challenged the selection 
of a single government warehouse in New Jersey to receive and distribute nearly 
one-third of the nation's vaccine supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his amendment the Administration would have to satisfy the Senate and 
House Appropriations committees that the New Jersey facility would meet federal 
standards for safe storage and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Bumpers amendment -- to a Labor, Health, Human Services and 
Education money bill -- would require the Health and Human Services Department 
to seek bids from private firms to see if they could provide the same 
distribution services at a lower cost than the General Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have vowed to press ahead with the vaccination 
program on schedule.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPORTS CONTINUE TO SOAR IN WAKE OF SIMPSON CASE; CRIME: 
PROSECUTORS ARE FILING NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF CHARGES SINCE ATTENTION 
FOCUSED ON SPOUSAL ABUSE. CALLS TO POLICE AND COUNSELING HOT LINES ARE ALSO 
MUCH HIGHER. 
</P>

<P>
 The number of domestic violence charges filed in the Los Angeles courts in the 
last few weeks is soaring, apparently the result of Nicole Brown Simpson's 
homicide and people identifying with her, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing rate in June -- during and after the initial surge of publicity 
surrounding the Simpson murder investigation -- was dramatically higher than in 
May, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Van Nuys Municipal Court, prosecutors in the city attorney's office 
filed charges in 117 cases in May. They brought 229 in June, a 96% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown, the district attorney's domestic violence unit is so busy that 
prosecutors are still playing catch-up with statistics. They estimate that they 
may have filed up to 120 cases in June, about one-third more than the 90 filed 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that I'm seeing is that women are nervous about what 
happened with the Simpson case," Deputy Dist. Atty. Lydia Bodin said. "It 
scares them. They think, 'Uh-oh, I could end up like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so," she said, "they're tending to report more" complaints to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in court filings is another sign of the intense public attention 
devoted to spousal abuse and domestic violence -- a focus prompted by the June 
12 slayings of Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman and the arrest 
of O.J. Simpson, the superstar athlete turned actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to domestic violence hot lines have also skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women recorded about 3,000 
calls during June, up more than two times from the average of 1,300 calls per 
month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to police are on the rise as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department took 10,930 domestic violence reports from 
April through June, up 8.6% from the 10,064 reports officers took from January 
through March. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all LAPD divisions saw more reports. The Foothill Division, which 
serves the east San Fernando Valley, took 749 reports from April through June, 
up 23% from 608 the previous three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Division, in the central Valley, took the most reports of any 
division in the city from April through June, 1,005. That was a 21% increase 
from 829 reports the previous three months. 
</P>
<P>
 And calls to prosecutors are up -- a particularly telling barometer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost always, when women come to us, it's the second or third or fourth 
incident," said Deputy City Atty. Richard A. Schmidt, supervisor of the city 
attorney's Van Nuys branch. "These women have often suffered in silence and 
finally decided they can't take it anymore, or they become afraid enough that 
they report it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office wins 77% of the domestic violence cases it files. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in complaints, Schmidt said, does not indicate an abrupt increase 
in beatings: "I don't think there was a sudden spasm of domestic violence in 
June." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Schmidt said, the avalanche of publicity surrounding the Simpson case 
seems to have made victims aware that "they can find some redress and some 
assistance from the criminal justice system, ponderous as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 In an average month, Van Nuys deputies file 122 domestic violence cases, 
Schmidt said. In one workweek in June, the five-day span that ended June 17 -- 
when O.J. Simpson was arrested -- they took on 50 such cases, or 10 new cases 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge shows no signs of stopping soon, Schmidt said. Through Wednesday, he 
said, Van Nuys prosecutors had filed 156 domestic violence cases in July -- an 
average of 12 each working day. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 229 domestic violence complaints filed in June in the Van Nuys 
Municipal Court, 82%, or 189, include allegations of physical violence or the 
use of a weapon, Schmidt said. The remaining 30, he said, are charges of 
vandalism or violations of a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors elsewhere around the county also are recording increases in 
domestic violence filing rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando branch of the city attorney's office filed 18 complaints in 
May. In June, the figure was 42, a 133% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro branch filed 74 cases in May, 106 in June, a 43% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood branch, which filed 17 spousal battery cases in May, filed 22 in 
June -- and through Tuesday, had filed 21 in July.

KISSINGER PRAISES NIXON, CRITICIZES CLINTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger spoke to about 300 people at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace on Wednesday, paying tribute to former 
President Richard Nixon and criticizing the Clinton Administration for its 
"wishy-washy" foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger praised the late President's skill and foresight in conducting U.S. 
foreign policy, even in the face of unprecedented "concentrated hostility" at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Clinton Administration, the Nixon presidency was marked by clearly 
defined foreign policy objectives, said Kissinger, who served as national 
security adviser and secretary of state under Nixon. Clinton's use of military 
force in Somalia was a mistake, especially in view of a U.S. withdrawal from 
the African nation after 18 casualties, Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we commit U.S. forces, we have to know the outcome we want and we have 
to be able to define the national interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Kissinger said, dispatching U.S. soldiers to Haiti, as Clinton has 
threatened to do, would be equally unwise. "I do not favor a military invasion, 
because I can't describe the threat Haiti presents to the United States," he 
said.

COURT STAYS SUSPENSION OF ATTORNEY YAGMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco has stayed an order barring Venice 
civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman from practicing in Los Angeles federal court 
for criticizing a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued the stay late Monday, pending a 
full appeal, just hours before the two-year suspension was to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Appellate Judges Alex Kozinski and Jerome Faris responded to an emergency 
motion filed by Yagman's attorney, Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Yagman will suffer irreparable harm both to his reputation, to his 
practice and financially" if the suspension goes into effect, Clark contended 
in his emergency motion seeking the stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief also contends that Yagman's clients would suffer irreparable harm if 
the suspension went into effect. Yagman, who specializes in representing 
plaintiffs who are suing law enforcement officers on brutality charges, has 14 
trials scheduled between now and the end of the year, according to the brief, 
which also asserts that the clients would have a difficult time obtaining other 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also contended that three Los Angeles federal trial judges denied Yagman 
his due process rights during the hearings that led to the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the brief argued that the key witness against Yagman in the 
hearing lacks credibility and that lawyers on a federal court disciplinary 
committee that lodged the charges against him were biased against him. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 8, federal trial judges Edward Rafeedie, John G. Davies and David W. 
Williams issued the highly unusual suspension after finding that Yagman had 
"impugned the integrity" of the court by his stinging criticisms of their 
colleague, U.S. District Judge William D. Keller. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman had accused Keller of being anti-Semitic, drunk on the bench, 
"ignorant, dishonest . . . a bully . . . and one of the worst judges in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said Yagman had made these statements in an attempt to force Keller 
to remove himself from Yagman's cases. Yagman has consistently denied that he 
made the criticisms for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 To buttress this contention, Clark's brief states that some of Yagman's 
comments were made in a letter to Prentice-Hall, which publishes books of 
judicial profiles, and that the publisher does not state the source of the 
quotes. "This negates the comments as a technique for inducing recusal," the 
brief states. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman said he was pleased with the appeals court action and in a written news 
release once again lambasted Keller, whom he described as "an 
ultra-conservative judge who sympathizes with defendants in police brutality 
cases and who often is intemperate, rude and sarcastic with both attorneys and 
others in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman also criticized the jurists who suspended him. "These judges want to 
punish me for expressing my thoughts, but as U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix 
Frankfurter said: 'Without freedom of expression, liberty of thought is a 
mockery, (because) truth cannot be pursued in an atmosphere hostile to that 
endeavor or under dangers which only heroes hazard.' "

CAR DEALER LINKED TO SUSPECT, VICTIM; CONNECTION: WHILE LIVING IN O.C., HE AND 
FRIENDS SEARCHED FOR THE MISSING HUBER. AFTER MOVING TO ARIZONA THIS YEAR, HE 
TRIED TO REPOSSESS A TRUCK FROM FAMALARO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The instant Lee Sattley, an auto sales manager, heard that John J. Famalaro 
had been arrested and that police had found a frozen body inside a stolen truck 
at his home, Sattley knew he had a story to tell the police. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Sattley had had numerous run-ins with Famalaro and 
Famalaro's mother, Anne, and he believed the truck with the body in it was the 
brand new vehicle Famalaro had "borrowed" from his auto dealership in January 
and refused to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until the body was identified as that of Denise Huber of Newport Beach, 
did Sattley, who had moved to Arizona from Huntington Beach, realize that he 
also had a connection to the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the truck containing the body was reported stolen from a 
Ryder Truck franchise in San Clemente. The white Chevrolet truck owned by the 
Phoenix dealership where Sattley is a manager was impounded by Yavapai County 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's department spokeswoman said the truck is being dusted for 
fingerprints. It has a bullet hole in its shell and a partial fingerprint "in 
what is possibly blood," according to a court record filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 During a lengthy court hearing Wednesday, the prosecution offered the white 
truck as evidence that Famalaro is too dangerous to be released from jail on 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattley said in an interview Wednesday that when he came to work at the 
Phoenix auto dealership in April, he set out to find Famalaro after learning 
that he had a truck belonging to the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was loaned the truck one Saturday in late January when he went to the 
dealership and complained that the truck he bought there was giving him 
trouble. Famalaro said he had taken his disabled vehicle to a Prescott 
Chevrolet dealership and had been given poor service, Sattley said. "He 
persuaded (an employee) to loan another truck to him until his could be fixed," 
Sattley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime in February, Sattley said, the truck purchased for Famalaro by his 
parents was repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 The paperwork detailing the terms of the loan to Famalaro was lost, however, 
and when Famalaro did not return the truck, Phoenix police refused to take the 
case, Sattley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealership hired a private investigator to try to recover the Chevrolet 
truck, and Sattley even went to Famalaro's parents' home on Mothers' Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Famalaro, Sattley remembered vividly, insisted he leave and stop 
harassing them. 
</P>
<P>
 During a telephone call to the house, she also vigorously defended her son, 
attacked Sattley for calling and insisted her son had a perfect right to the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sattley did make telephone contact with Famalaro, he also responded 
angrily, claiming that an attorney had advised him he was entitled to the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Famalaro family has refused to be interviewed since John Famalaro's arrest 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 When Famalaro was arrested last week, police found a key to the truck in his 
possession. Investigators later found the truck parked in a Prescott grocery 
store parking lot, without license plates and with the vehicle identification 
number covered by a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck had never been licensed with the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division 
because it was brand new. The truck did not have a bullet hole when Famalaro 
drove it off the lot, Sattley added. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Famalaro was arrested, Sattley said, the Phoenix police filed a 
theft complaint for the Chevrolet against the murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattley's run-in with Famalaro began as a dispute over a truck, "and now, six 
months later, we have a sensational murder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ironic thing about all this is that I was from Huntington Beach and when 
this happened to (Huber), I went looking for this girl," Sattley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained that he and some friends from a Newport Beach gym, who knew 
Huber, rode their bicycles along the Santa Ana River channel in search of her. 
He also had seen the billboards, banners and flyers about her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they announced that they had identified the body and it was this Denise 
Huber missing from California, my heart just sank," Sattley said.

 About 10 on a recent weeknight, a husky young man wearing a black miniskirt, 
high heels and heavy makeup was waiting to cross Santa Monica Boulevard at 
Formosa Avenue in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The man wheeled around and caught a glimpse of Deputy Dennis Salazar, who had 
emerged from a Sheriff's Department patrol car in a nearby restaurant parking 
lot. Salazar motioned him over. The man bowed his head and slowly approached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just want to ask you a few questions," Salazar said. The man nodded. He gave 
his name as Jessica, said he was 19 years old and that he had recently moved to 
Los Angeles from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar asked him if he was working as a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, uh-uh," he replied. After catching Salazar's skeptical look, he shifted 
his weight from heel to heel and corrected himself. "Well, I have in the past. 
But not tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a typical encounter between police and a transvestite on the east end 
of West Hollywood, where angry residents say prostitution has spun out of 
control. Almost every night, up to two or three dozen young men dressed in 
fishnet stockings and stiletto pumps gather in the neighborhood around Santa 
Monica Boulevard and La Brea Avenue, where their nightly promenade often snarls 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down a stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard between Fairfax and La Brea 
avenues, self-described drag queens such as Jessica share turf with shirtless 
young men who hustle on corners and at bus stops. Meanwhile, four blocks to the 
north, female prostitutes walking Sunset Boulevard do a bustling trade with 
motorists who stop alongside streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has been a haven for prostitution for years, according to police. In 
1991, the city designated the area a prostitution abatement zone, providing 
deputies with additional authority to arrest repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeowners and tenants are growing increasingly weary of the problem. They 
complain of finding used condoms and syringes in their driveways and 
discovering prostitutes and johns having sex in bushes and alleys. Citing fears 
about the impact on families and businesses, as well as the possible spread of 
AIDS, east side residents have spurred West Hollywood officials to attack this 
aspect of the sex industry more aggressively than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens' group recently led a march to "take back the streets" from 
prostitutes and drug dealers. The Sheriff's Department is conducting sting 
operations aimed at cracking down on repeat offenders. This month, the city is 
convening a multi-agency task force to examine the issue and deliver practical 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a quality of life issue here. A lot of residents are uncomfortable 
bringing (guests) to their homes," said Nancy Greenstein, West Hollywood public 
safety coordinator. "In terms of the business community, prostitution 
discourages the mainstream customer. People just don't feel safe, even though 
they may in fact be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 But the war on prostitution has become controversial in West Hollywood, a 
historically liberal enclave and the spiritual center of the Los Angeles area's 
gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the city's anti-vice efforts say that any measures designed to curb 
prostitution are doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 And at least one government official has suggested, over the outraged 
objections of homeowners, that the east side be turned into an adult 
entertainment zone in which prostitution would be licensed and regulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The only consensus so far is that finding a solution will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that prostitutes congregate on the east side of West Hollywood 
because of the city's reputation as a gay mecca and the neighborhood's 
relatively depressed economic status. 
</P>
<P>
 "The east side of the city has been a standard place for prostitution for both 
men and women for years," said Jim Gordon, a West Hollywood psychotherapist who 
has studied the prostitution problem. "The visibility now is more because of 
the transvestite parades. It's hard to get that image changed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though West Hollywood has been at the forefront of a lot of social 
issues, this isn't one the city is prepared to tackle," said Ruth Williams, a 
community activist who has lived in the area since 1950. "It's just gotten so 
out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Williams says, she has frequently found used condoms on the 
streets and sidewalks outside her home. She has complained to the police about 
prostitutes and johns committing drug crimes and thefts in the neighborhood. 
But the final straw for her came last year, when a neighbor had two cars stolen 
and a garage set on fire, presumably by street hustlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son said, 'I think it's time to move.' But I said, 'No, it's time to 
fight,' " Williams said. "Where can you go in this city where you don't have 
some problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 Williams founded the Alliance of Citizens for the East Side, a grass-roots 
group dedicated to cleaning up the neighborhood. Earlier this month, several 
dozen members and neighbors, escorted by sheriff's deputies, marched down Santa 
Monica Boulevard to protest prostitution and other vice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a homeowner on the east side. You wouldn't want this kind of 
(prostitution and drug dealing) going on outside your house, would you?" said 
group member Bill Senigram, explaining his decision to march. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said: "I want (the rest of West Hollywood) never to refer to us as 
'the blighted east end' again." 
</P>
<P>
 But experts agree that merely arresting prostitutes will hardly address the 
tangle of social issues underlying the problem, including poverty, drug abuse 
and broken families. 
</P>
<P>
 Local social service workers say that prostitutes typically are in their teens 
or early 20s. The drag queens are often Latino, according to police. Some of 
them suffer from a classic borderline identity disorder, Gordon said. The 
hustlers typically come from out of state, drawn to Southern California by the 
mild climate and the promise of Hollywood glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Wittman, a youth director for Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social 
Services, which dispenses condoms and offers counseling several nights a week 
from a truck near Santa Monica and La Brea, said young people end up on the 
street for a variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "One common pathway is that parents find out they're gay, and for religious or 
other reasons the kid got kicked out of the house," Wittman said. "Other kids 
are running wild because their parents are running wild. A number of kids 
actually live at home. These kids go (to) the dance clubs (along Santa Monica) 
and for them the street is just an extension of that social environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once (prostitutes) get on the street, it's kind of a 'carny' mentality," he 
added. "They build up this myth that 'everyone else is the sucker and we're 
putting one over on them. It's us out here having a wonderful time versus 
people dumb enough to give us money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But this fatalism may lead to carelessness about sex, which experts say could 
foster the spread of AIDS. Police and social workers say that a number of 
hustlers and female prostitutes -- but fewer drag queens -- are intravenous 
drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "High risk, high risk, high risk," said Veronica Matos, assistant director for 
health services at the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center in Hollywood, 
summing up the sex practices of most prostitutes. "Unfortunately, these folks 
might have information they need (for safe sex), but in putting it into 
practice, there's a huge void. They're not practicing safe sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos said her clinic, one of the largest sites in the state offering 
anonymous HIV testing, keeps no statistics on the occupations of those tested. 
But about 8% of the 1,000 clients the clinic serves each month test positive 
for the virus that causes AIDS. Matos said this is the highest rate of HIV 
infection of any clinic in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittman reported that 3 of his 30 clients on the street, or 10%, are 
HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitutes are at increased risk for other sexually transmitted diseases as 
well. A 1991 RAND Corp. study of 638 prostitutes in Los Angeles County, 
including the Sunset Strip area, found that although only 2.5% tested positive 
for HIV, 33% tested positive for the hepatitis B antibody and 34% tested 
positive for past or current syphilis infection. Experts say that some sexually 
transmitted diseases may compromise the immune system and help the spread of 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 James, a tired-looking 27-year-old man with tousled blond hair who was sitting 
on a stoop near Santa Monica Boulevard and Genesee Avenue, admitted he had 
hustled off and on for the past 13 years. He said he began turning tricks 
because "I was out on the street and I needed to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked the results of his HIV test, he responded: "I'm not sure. I've 
never had a test." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle, a 22-year-old woman walking in a tight blue mini-dress near Sunset 
Boulevard and Havenhurst Drive, said she began working the streets several 
months ago after quitting a low-paying job as a switchboard operator. She said 
she now averages about $800 a night from six or seven customers; the money is 
being saved for her college education. She said she gets tested regularly for 
HIV, so far with negative results. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started having sex (with customers), I sometimes did it without" 
protection, she said with a rueful smile. "Sometimes we think we're 
invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given the number of threats posed to street prostitutes, the possibility of 
jail time -- often for a few months or less -- seems a relatively small risk. 
Williams, the West Hollywood community activist, advocates tougher laws and 
more vigilant enforcement. She also suggested aggressive measures aimed at 
prostitutes' customers, including printing suspected johns' names on billboards 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But some argue that such a hard-nosed approach is guaranteed to fail. 
Michaeljohn Horne, head of the West Hollywood Human Services Commission, which 
advises the city on grants to various social service organizations, said that 
"the problem is not going to go away" no matter how many arrests are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the city should lobby the state to legalize prostitution," he said. 
"My intention has been to create an adult entertainment zone akin to what's 
done (with similar districts) in Amsterdam. Prostitutes would be tested and 
regulated. The city would make some money off licenses and we could make sure 
(prostitutes) are healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Horne's proposal, occasionally circulated at City Council meetings and 
elsewhere, has raised the anger of east side residents. "What he basically 
wants is a red-light district," Williams said. "But what happens to the 
families here? Personally, I think his idea is the most ridiculous thing I've 
ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
 But considering the amount of activity on the streets at night, one could 
argue that West Hollywood already has a virtual red-light district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are in violation (of the law), we'll take them to jail," Salazar said 
during one of his night patrols along Santa Monica. "But it's like a garden. 
You keep cutting the weeds, and they keep growing back." 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda, a 19-year-old prostitute who was wearing white shorts with 
see-through panels and a military-style jacket, reported that she had been 
"beaten up (and) had knives pulled on me -- but the money makes up for the 
occupational hazards," she said with a conspiratorial smile. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if she was afraid of her life on the streets, she shook her head 
and glanced around Sunset Boulevard as midnight traffic whizzed by. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. "No. There's too many of us out here."

OUT AND ABOUT / COLOR ME MINE: PAINT-IT-YOURSELF POTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, it would have been difficult to have walked into a store to 
paint, say, a vase with delicate floral designs or a funky pasta bowl. Now, 
it's possible to walk into a bright, open studio, paint nearly anything your 
heart desires and have it sitting on your mantle by the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 At Color Me Mine, customers come from far and near to paint functional and 
decorative pottery. Pieces such as vases, mugs, bowls, candlesticks, platters 
and picture frames can be decorated with 100 types of paints, stencils, decals 
and glazes. Neither the pottery nor the paint contains lead, and both are safe 
for dishwashers and microwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for the pottery range from $5 to $50. It costs $6 per hour to paint at 
the studio, which provides paints, supplies, instruction, access to the store's 
books and firing of the piece. Pieces are fired in an on-site kiln at 2,200 
degrees for nine hours and are available for pickup the following evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always try to do things with my children that they love and I love," said 
Cristina Ferrare, a West Los Angeles resident who was painting with her 
5-year-old daughter on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the store comes from Robin Monroe, a former casting director, and 
her husband, Josh Culver, who worked for a local limousine company. When the 
couple couldn't find a feeding bowl to fit their parrot's cage, they made one 
themselves and painted it. Then came the idea to set up a studio where people 
could come and paint almost anything they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a flukey idea," Robin Monroe said. "It was one of those accidents 
that changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
 For those concerned about their lack of creative talent, the owners are more 
than happy to offer a few suggestions. They advise tracing designs or reading 
some of the store's instructional books to get the hang of things. After 
painting a few strokes, they say, let the creativity begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very social (experience)," Monroe said. "People have a lot of fun. . . 
. They find (the painting) therapeutic and relaxing, which keeps the atmosphere 
mellow." 
</P>
<P>
 Color Me Mine has two Westside locations: 633 N. La Brea Blvd., Los Angeles, 
and 1109 Montana Ave., Santa Monica. Hours are from noon to 9 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Reservations are requested. For the Los Angeles location, call 
(213) 965-0900; Santa Monica: (310) 393-0069.

FUNDING: COMMUNITY; CONTROL OF AMENITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three cheers to the people of Brentwood for taking the library issue in their 
own hands and creating a civic asset (July 17, cover story). It is truly 
refreshing to see a community join together to improve itself, particularly in 
the current political climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities should take heed. Now that the professional politicians have 
consolidated control of public spending at the state and federal levels, new 
means of local funding are required to create local amenities. Communities, 
however, must carefully choose funding sources that can be protected from 
expropriation by vote-hungry politicians. Historically, the only safe sources 
are grants and user fees. Even targeted bond issues have a way of being 
diverted in our political economy (what did happen to that highway money?) 
</P>
<P>
 If they want libraries, residents of Malibu and Marina del Rey must first face 
the fact that their tax money has gone down the big government rat hole. Only 
then will they take the necessary steps to maintain and improve their libraries 
and other local facilities. On the other hand, localities not willing to 
support such public amenities should not be compelled to, as proposed in state 
Sen. David A. Roberti's bill. Each community should decide what it is willing 
to pay for and do so. The alternative is further loss of local control and 
higher taxes.

POLICE: TAKING AIM AT AUDIT URGING REDUCTION IN OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An open letter to the mayor and City Council of Beverly Hills: Dear Ladies and 
Gentlemen: RE: Beverly Hills Police Department  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local newspapers have reported that a recent management consultant/audit 
recommended a reduction of 12 police patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 While other recommendations may have merit, this one does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding our most excellent Police Department, there must be: 
</P>
<P>
 1. No reduction in the number of police officers. Not a reduction of 12; not a 
reduction of 1. 
</P>
<P>
 2. No action which would reduce the ability of the police officers to do their 
jobs effectively (and) nothing which would reduce motivation, compensation, 
quality of equipment, efficiency of systems, safety measures, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestion: Don't spend the time even thinking about these particular 
"cost-saving" measures. There are other city issues which deserve your 
attention.

IT'S NO TONEY AWARD; ONLY A FEW BRAVE SOULS STEP INTO THE RING TO BECOME 
SPARRING PARTNERS FOR IBF SUPER-MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION JAMES TONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wanted: Sparring partners for prized fighter. Needed five days a week for one 
to three hours a day. Previous experience necessary. Must provide own health 
and life insurance. Contact the Outlaw Boxing Gym in Hollywood. James (Lights 
Out) Toney, the International Boxing Federation super-middleweight champion, 
needs sparring partners to prepare for his July 29 fight in Las Vegas against 
veteran (Prince) Charles Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an opportunity for a young boxer to pick up some experience and a veteran 
to earn quick money, according to Toney's manager, Jackie Kallen. The pay -- 
$50 to $100 a day -- isn't bad for about two hours' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for qualified boxers," Kallen said. "We're not looking for 
someone to get beat up." 
</P>
<P>
 So why is there such a shortage of volunteers to work out with a 25-year-old 
family man? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too many people want to get paid $60 a day to get hit by a truck," said 
George O'Mara, one of Toney's two regular sparring partners at the Outlaw Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, the father of a 17-month-old daughter, is a confident, likable guy. His 
boxing credentials are impressive: 43 wins, no losses, two draws and 28 
knockouts. And Toney has beaten some of the best in the business, including 
Michael Nunn in 1991 to win the International Boxing Federation middleweight 
title; Mike McCallum in a '92 middleweight title defense, and Iran Barkley for 
the '93 IBF super-middleweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 What separates Toney from other boxers is the way he wins: He punishes 
opponents who don't show respect for him in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put Barkley in the hospital for two days," Toney said. "I broke his ribs, 
his cheekbone, his earlobe. He deserve to get hurt for talking so much junk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to put Prince William in the hospital, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, often called boxing's best "pound-for-pound" fighter, carries the same 
work ethic from the gym to the arena. He believes his workouts are as good as 
his fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who goof off during sparring, goof off in fights," Toney said. "I look 
for tough guys who can dish it out and take it. It's my job to pound them. I 
expect them to fight back and give 100% effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The Outlaw Gym, owned by actor-fighter Mickey Rourke, attracts white-collar 
health enthusiasts who prefer pounding a heavy bag than jumping around in an 
aerobics classes. Tisha Campbell, co-star of Fox TV's "Martin," is among the 
yuppie boxers. Larry Donald, World Boxing Council Continental Americas 
heavyweight champion, will use the gym to prepare for his Aug. 13 fight against 
Andrew Golota at Olympic Auditorium. IBF middleweight champion John David 
Jackson also works out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We attract (everyone from) TV actors to the secretary down the street," gym 
manager Freddie Roach said about the facility near Wilcox and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach, a former 10-year pro, has helped locate sparring partners for Toney, 
who has used the gym to prepare for his last three fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "He goes through them quickly," said Roach, who has contacted fighters from 
Broadway to Hoover Street Gym looking for sparring partners. "Their earn their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite wearing protective headgear and swinging 18-ounce gloves, Toney's 
sparring partners take a beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way James trains, you don't want to come in out of shape or you will be 
on the canvas," said Vinson Durham who became a sparring partner after losing 
to Toney in a 10-round bout May 18. "I try to keep my head moving and my jab 
going. If I give him a chance to tee off, it's good night." 
</P>
<P>
 Before fighting Tim Littles during the March 5 reopening of the Olympic 
Auditorium, Toney went through five sparring partners in a week. Toney then 
knocked out Littles in the fourth round to retain his IBF super-middleweight 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had guys with broken noses and broken ribs," Roach said. "We had fighters 
leave after one day with a note saying, 'Please forward my one-day's pay.' " 
</P>
<P>
 O'Mara, 38, the Northwest cruiserweight champion, became enlisted as a 
sparring partner after coming to the Outlaw to work out. A fighter since 1979, 
O'Mara (14-12) has also appeared in "Rocky III" and "Lethal Weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Mara said he began boxing because "they weren't hiring at NASA." 
</P>
<P>
 While Durham, 32, helps Toney develop his speed, O'Mara has been a human 
punching bag for Toney. 
</P>
<P>
 "George is a heavier guy who takes a licking and still keeps ticking," Toney 
said. "I've thrown everything from the kitchen sink to a dog bowl. Everything. 
The man will not go down."

NOTEBOOK / SEAN WATERS; BEVERLY HILLS' BUFFUM TO WALK-ON AT NORTH CAROLINA 
STATE

<P>
 Luke Buffum of Beverly Hills High has turned down basketball scholarship 
offers to pursue a childhood dream. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7 center has decided to continue his career as a walk-on at North 
Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to play in the (Atlantic Coast Conference) and the 
opportunity arose so I'm going to roll the dice and try it," Buffum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffum, The Times' 1993 Westside Player of the Year, had scholarship offers 
from Northern Arizona and Eastern Washington. Army and Navy also offered to 
appoint Buffum to their academies and Holy Cross offered financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffum lived in North Carolina from fifth grade through the first part of 
ninth grade before moving to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew a lot as a basketball player in North Carolina," Buffum said. 
"Everyone wants to play for North Carolina, Duke, (North Carolina) State or 
Wake Forest. It's every kid's dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffum led the Normans with averages of 22 points and 8 1/2 rebounds. He was 
selected to The Times' Westside team for the second consecutive season and was 
named to the Southern Section Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State Coach Les Robinson told Buffum he had a chance to earn a 
scholarship if he played well during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a definite situation," Buffum said. "But he told me, 'We think you 
can help us out.' " 
</P>

 It just happens that the Mariner coach is Leo Klemm, Adrian's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Klemm, a 6-foot-5 senior forward, has been impressive at summer league games, 
displaying a good outside shot and the ability to play tough inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Klemm is not limited to playing basketball. A two-way starting lineman on the 
football team, Klemm has drawn attention from Colorado, Kansas, Kansas State, 
Cal, UCLA, Washington and Washington State. Klemm is likely to play defensive 
end in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "The footwork he has learned in basketball makes him pretty tough" in 
football, Leo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several of his players have gone on to play at four-year colleges, 
Leo will be experiencing the recruiting scene for the first time as a father. 
Does it matter if his son gets a football scholarship instead of basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fine," Leo said. "Whatever works out for him. I'm trying to be 
patient about it. But like I told my past players, you still have to prove 
yourself on the court or the field."

 Westchester Coach Ed Azzam may play down the importance of summer league 
games, but his team's victory in the Fairfax tournament Sunday was certainly a 
morale boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets rallied from a 20-point deficit in the third quarter and beat 
Compton Dominguez, 78-75, in overtime. Jason Hart had 17 points to lead the 
Comets, who lost to Dominguez in the Watts Summer Games and Artesia tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Walker, The Times' 1994 Westside boys' basketball Player of the Year, 
was voted the tournament's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Sanders, the Comets' other standout guard, injured his left foot in the 
championship game and has not played at the Nike Slam-N-Jam National 
Invitational Tournament this week. He is expected to be out two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bruised the top of my foot," Sanders said. "I think I came down on 
someone's foot. It feels really tender." 
</P>
<P>
 In the third place game, Fairfax beat Artesia, 53-52. Point guard Duane Davis 
scored 21 points to lead the Lions. Davis was selected one of the top 15 
players in the recent West Coast All-Star Camp at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the area's top returning basketball players, Lamar Tillman of 
Palisades, will return to action Friday after recovering from a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman injured his left knee June 18 against Rancho Cucamonga during the 
Watts Summer Games. The 6-4 senior forward tore the anterior cruciate ligament 
while blocking a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman averaged 15 points and eight rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades will play Inglewood in the final of the Culver City Summer League at 
5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>

 Correction: In the July 14 Westside edition, the photograph of the Westchester 
basketball player on his heels making a pass was point guard Jason Hart.

SHE SAID, HE SAID: A LITTLE GIVE AT THE OFFICE

<P>
 I f you're a working girl or a guy, you know what it feels like to reach in 
the closet day after day for the same old dressed-for-success silhouette: 
Monday through Friday it's a tailored suit, crisp shirt, serious tie/jewelry. 
But wait! Certain members of the corporate world are changing their tune, 
allowing -- encouraging -- employees to dress down on Fridays so they'll feel 
more up the rest of the week.  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I think casual Fridays are the answer to a lot of fashion prayers: They 
allow women, especially, to drop their sartorial guard, be more relaxed in a 
predominantly male environment. After years of playing down their frills on 
behalf of the Feminist Movement, women on Friday are free to step into a 
flowing sun dress and sandals, even a pair of Levi's and boots. But of course 
they have to maintain their professional dignity. From what I hear, a smart 
employee keeps his or her eye on what the company president wears on Friday and 
dresses down accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: And that's kind of a shame, isn't it? Sort of defeats the purpose of the 
whole exercise. A casual day, I figure, is supposed to promote a more relaxed, 
convivial, stress-free atmosphere in a usually sterile environment. But how can 
you unclench when you're always looking over your shoulder to make sure the 
boss is at least as grubby as you are? 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the poor wage slaves the night before, cold sweat squirting out as 
they stand frozen in terror in front of their wardrobe, paralyzed with the 
thought that no matter what they choose, they're either going to make the boss 
look like a cheesy slob in his frayed Banana Republic bush shorts or an 
insufferable prig who starches and irons a crease into his Levi's. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I'll never forget the day I decided to dress down, way down -- showed up 
at work in black jeans and a top instead of my predictable black business suit. 
People looked at me like I'd lost my mind (or at least by black business suit). 
I checked the mirror and realized I looked like an entirely different person -- 
more relaxed, more open, more human . 
</P>
<P>
 But I was happy to step back into my armor the following day. After all, this 
was the way I was supposed to look in the business world -- polished, perfectly 
groomed, able to handle it. Right? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Weeeeeelll . . . I think you got the stares because you were dressing out 
of character. I get the same looks when I show up for work in a business suit. 
There's a pretty checkered atmosphere in this office, sartorially speaking. In 
the newsroom, some guys wear ties, but you never see anyone wearing a jacket 
(sport coats almost exclusively) indoors. Both women and men are pretty casual 
all the time, unless they have to go out to cover an event that requires more 
formal dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Around here, it's everybody's individual call. And I think that's 
great. The work gets done, and nobody has to worry about whether they're 
violating some unspoken dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: A co-worker said she likes to dress up because it shows respect for her 
job, makes her feel great about her work. If she dressed down on a regular 
basis, she would begin to feel like she was in a dead-end job, she said. I buy 
that. Dressing like a professional goes a long way toward making you feel like 
a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm all for relaxing the dress code on certain days (according to an article 
in the Hartford Courant, about two-thirds of U.S. companies have relaxed their 
dress codes in the past five years), but there should be boundaries. No 
cutoffs, crop-tops, that sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Depends on what sort of business we're talking about, I think. If it's a 
shop that has a fair amount of direct contact with the public -- a law office, 
say, or a restaurant -- the employees should dress in a way that inspires 
confidence. If a maitre d' greets me in baggy shorts and an MTV T-shirt, I'm 
going to head straight for Burger King, where they dress with more panache. And 
what sort of impression would your lawyer make if he tried to clear you of 
those tax evasion charges while wearing jeans and a flannel work shirt? 
</P>
<P>
 There are gray areas. My dentist always seems to be wearing khakis and polo 
shirts -- not medical whites -- and I think the guy's a gem. And my accountant 
at work usually looks like he's getting ready to take a stroll on the beach, 
but he's saved my, uh, assets more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the boss scowls at anything kinkier than blue pin-stripes, then it's 
blue pin-stripes or the unemployment line. Sad to say. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: My favorite casual office look: black jeans, white T-shirt, black blazer 
and flats. It's a conservative, semi-professional look that feels fabulous. You 
can't beat a black blazer for versatility. My least favorite office look for 
women: bold print dresses that are so full they can't decide whether they're 
muumuus or caftans. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: My favorite casual office look: my robe. (I have an office at home.) It's 
a rumpled, go-to-hell look that feels lived-in. And you can't beat a cotton 
robe for absorbency. Also, the monogram is very impressive to potential 
clients. It's the perfect business suit, and it doubles as my official couch 
potato uniform.

 What illustrates Americana nostalgia better than Osh Kosh B'Gosh and Lassie? 
The ageless collie celebrates its 50th anniversary with the release of a new 
film, and the apparel company famous for its bib overalls commemorates the 
event with a line of children's coordinates ($13.50 to $31) featuring Lassie's 
image. "It's a perfect match for all the right reasons," notes spokeswoman 
Cindy Herman. "Lassie is a tradition, like Osh Kosh B'Gosh. We share the same 
heritage and values." On the Cuff 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic-inspired clothes gave way to wrists wrapped with cuff bracelets or 
multiple bangles that translated into a cuff effect. The look continues for 
fall with sterling Wonder Woman-in-cyberspace cuffs, so fitting with fashion's 
fixation on silver. "Cuffs are becoming an individual statement," says Diana 
Shiel of the Silver Information Center in New York. She notes many jewelry 
designers are creating wide wrist wear in chunky, ornate styles that are 
quilted, shiny and antiquated. "They are really made to be a signature piece 
for a woman who doesn't want to wear any other accessories, except for maybe 
earrings," says Shiel, who adds that a cuff wider than three inches generally 
looks best on a long, thin arm. Petite woman should consider one 2 1/2 inches 
or smaller. A Tough Touch 
</P>
<P>
 Although fashion pundits insist fabric sneakers are the way to go in the 
natural '90s, the trouble with tennies is their short life. So Vans -- famous 
for its canvas shoes -- has introduced a line constructed of hemp for the whole 
family. This raw material not only fits the trend toward linen-like weaves, 
it's also known as one of the most durable fabrics in the world, notes Sari 
Rasula, vice president of design and production development for the 
Orange-based company. Its strength and organic origin also score points with 
environmentally conscious consumers, she adds. The earthy palette of olive, 
ecru, brown and blue fits right in. Skateboarding dudes and their dads can get 
into the Straight Edge high and low models (pictured; $45 to $50); women, young 
and old, can try on the Authentic ($40). ROSE APODACA JONES

BEHIND THE SCENES: TYLER CHOICE: STRONG WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Models in 86 stylistically distinct outfits wowed guests at the Ritz-Carlton 
in Dana Point Friday. Even the simplest gown drew ahs for its cut and fit. 
</P>
<P>
 But what thrilled most of the 200 people in attendance was being able to 
approach designer Richard Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
 And approachable he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian-born Tyler received compliments with a humility that belies his 
international status, not to mention the "New Fashion Talent" award the Council 
of Fashion Designers of America recently bestowed him. 
</P>
<P>
 And he graciously rejected the suggestion that he move his Los Angeles-based 
operations to Milan or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler and his partner/wife, Lisa Trafficante, have, after all, been busily 
building an empire on both U.S. coasts. In New York, where he and his wife fly 
every other week, he promotes his signature collection and designs for Anne 
Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Tyler's fall '94 signature designs feature his relentless 
attention to perfectly constructed clothing. There were plenty of jackets, 
cigarette-slim pants (with zippers hidden on the inside seam) and skirts that 
showed off plenty of leg from the knee up; knee-high riding boots were the 
footwear of choice. Among the more notable details were sleeves buttoned at the 
shoulder, but leaving one halfway undone to expose a rich contrast lining, and 
charmeuse slip dresses shaped with geometric bias cut pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Edwardian dandy, Tyler played with many other influences, 
including Confederate hats and other Civil War inspired themes, Jean Harlow and 
Marlene Dietrich, the divas of Helmut Newton's '70s photographs, and the Orient 
Express meets British regality. All were set, of course, to a charged rock 'n' 
roll soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler hesitated to name a particular theme for his fall collection, which was 
colored in rich olive, chocolate, plum, mocha, cranberry and charcoal. "It's 
about mixing favorite pieces and feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was hosted by Nordstrom. ROSE APODACA JONES

BEHIND THE SCENES: INSPIRATION FROM OUT OF INDIA FITS CHILDREN TO A TEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children learned how to decorate a T-shirt in the style of India at the 
Fullerton Museum Center on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructor Aimee Kraus displayed different batik fabrics and showed how to dip 
a paper towel into food dye to create a psychedelic design.She also explained 
to the 29 children attending the workshop the meaning behind some Indian 
symbols, such as the tree of life, and the origin of the ancient paisley print 
that imitates either a mango or peacock feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 As sitar music played in the background, the children used fabric paint 
markers to decorate T-shirts with Indian-inspired designs. The center offers 
hands-on art workshops for children on Super Tuesdays during the summer. The 
cost is $5. Reservations are required. (714) 738-6545

ANN CONWAY: CHOC ANOTHER ONE UP FOR THE KIDS, THANKS TO SCHWARZENEGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Between a local preview of his new flick, "True Lies," and the auction he con- 
ducted at Planet Hollywood last week, Arnold Schwarzenegger visited Children's 
Hospital of Orange County, passing out watches, hats, T-shirts and good cheer 
to ill children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept Arnold busy last Wednesday," said Frank DiBella, president and CEO of 
Planet Hollywood in Santa Ana. "First, he arrived by helicopter in the Westin 
hotel parking lot. Then he went to Edwards Cinema across from Planet Hollywood 
for a benefit for the Inner City Games Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he went to CHOC for about two hours and visited the children. Then it 
was over to Planet Hollywood, where he conducted an auction for the Inner City 
Games cause." 
</P>
<P>
 The children loved their visit with the "Terminator," DiBella said. "One 
little 4-year-old boy stood up and told Arnold he'd seen all of his movies and 
named them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzenegger was touched. And so was DiBella. "It was my first visit to 
CHOC," DiBella said. "I wish everyone could go there and see what the hospital 
is doing for these sick kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are going through so much . . . and so are their parents, but the 
hospital keeps things as normal as possible for them. Arnold couldn't believe 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Planet Hollywood became involved with CHOC last year when the hospital staged 
its annual CHOC Walk. "When the walkers passed by our area, we provided them 
with refreshments," DiBella said. "And we plan to get involved with CHOC Walk 
again this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Arnold was also among guests at the Planet Hollywood benefit for the Inner 
City Games Foundation, a Los Angeles charity that provides sports activities 
for children at risk to join gangs. "He had a great time -- really helped us 
out," DiBella said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people dined on mini-pizzas, turkey and Snickers' pie at the 
foundation benefit before they watched Schwarzenegger auction off such goodies 
as a hog-ride on his Harley. (Joseph Cavallo of Laguna Hills paid $6,500 for 
the chance.) 
</P>
<P>
 This week, CHOC CEO Thomas Jones said Schwarzenegger's visit provided his 
young patients with a real morale boost. "Arnold displayed sincere compassion 
and interest in the children," Jones said. "Rather than discuss himself or his 
movies, he was focused on asking the children questions about themselves and 
how they were feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "One 7-year-old girl was having a very difficult day. Hours before, she had 
received a new I.V. in her foot. Arnold knelt down beside her wheelchair and 
spent several minutes coaxing a smile out of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The positive emotional charge our kids got from Arnold's visit has lasted 
well into this week. The kids are still talking about it."

O.C. POP BEAT; TONI CHILDS: CAPTAIN OF HER OWN 'BOAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Toni Childs, making music her own way can mean trekking to Africa or India 
in search of sounds and moods that might inspire her. 
</P>
<P>
 It also can mean taking evasive action to shield her ears from widely hailed 
music that's more readily encountered: the songs of Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the anxiety of influence, pop-music division. Gabriel, the respected 
English rocker, is largely responsible for introducing rhythmic currents from 
Africa and Asia into pop music on albums dating back to the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs has worked similar rhythmic turf since her recording debut in 1988. 
Although the Los Angeles-based singer admires Gabriel so much that she wrote a 
song about him for her new album, "The Woman's Boat," she has avoided listening 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go out of my way not to hear his music," Childs said in a recent phone 
interview from a tour stop in Minneapolis. That tour also stopped in Hollywood 
on Tuesday (Review, F2) and brings her to the Coach House on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter and I are too much in the same area. When you're doing your own thing, 
you can't go to someone else's well. I've had to go deliberately out of my way, 
because everywhere I turned (during the making of her latest album), he was in 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The song about Gabriel, "I Met a Man," took shape in August, 1992. Gabriel had 
invited Childs to come to Real World Recording Week, an annual event in England 
in which artists signed to his world beat-oriented Real World label gather to 
record at his studio. At the same time, they play concerts for the Gabriel-led 
organization WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance). 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a chance to work together for the first time," said Childs, who became 
involved in a collaborative songwriting session with Gabriel and Papa Wemba, a 
singer from Zaire. She later wrote "I Met a Man," a gently swaying, yearning 
song about aspiration that makes no specific mention of Gabriel, but includes 
him as a backup singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a song about Peter, watching him and his life. I admire the man, what 
he's doing with the money he's making and the attention he's getting," Childs 
said, referring to Gabriel's work for human-rights causes and his efforts to 
help musicians from around the world find a forum in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the song is about him, it made sense" to have Gabriel sing background 
vocals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs was born in Orange, Calif., and grew up in a succession of towns in the 
Midwest and Southwest. She arrived on the Los Angeles rock scene in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, she moved to London, where she started a band with guitarist 
David Rhodes, a member of Peter Gabriel's band. Returning to Los Angeles in the 
mid-'80s, she formed a musical (and, for a time, romantic) partnership with 
David Ricketts, formerly of the duo David + David. 
</P>
<P>
 Her signatures on the affirmative "Union," the more troubled "House of Hope" 
and now "The Woman's Boat" have been lush, gauzy textures, world-beat rhythms 
and a large, dramatic voice that often seems half-strangled with feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs broke with Ricketts after her second album and moved from A&M Records 
to Geffen, which readily agreed to her idea of recording part of her third 
album in Nepal and India. The monthlong trip at the end of 1992 was a search 
for new playing partners and new inspiration, akin to the journey she had taken 
to Africa while working on her first album. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, Childs wrote "Womb," a song sung from the perspective of a child 
basking comfortably inside its mother's belly, with a dim but apprehensive 
awareness of the world into which it will be ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs said that writing the song gave her the idea of turning the album into 
a birth-to-death song-cycle. "The Woman's Boat" is largely concerned with 
questions surrounding birth, the nurturing of new life, and, finally, coming to 
terms with a parent's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs says it can be read as a literal account of her ideas on women's 
mothering role, but she also intends metaphoric meanings that apply to men as 
well. The songs, she said, can be taken as a comment not only on how children 
are born and equipped for survival, but also on how ideas or works of art are 
brought into being. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole record seems to be affecting women very deeply, especially women 
who are pregnant," Childs said. "A lot have asked me, 'Have you had a baby or 
are you pregnant?' They could relate to it so strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a child, but that's what I think about," she said. "The supreme 
sacrifice, we're told, is a man dying on a cross. To me, the supreme sacrifice 
is parenting. That's what's real in our lives, it's what really happens: giving 
up your life for another being's life, whether it's (a child) or an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 At 37, Childs said, she is still putting off giving birth in the literal 
sense. "Not right now in my life. I'm not ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides acting as her own manager, Childs said, she has been devoting "every 
spare, free moment" to shepherding a charitable organization called Dream A 
Dolphin. Its aim is to promote a therapeutic process in which children who are 
emotionally troubled, physically handicapped, learning disabled or seriously 
ill swim in pools with dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs said she encountered dolphin therapy four years ago in Hawaii, when she 
saw its effects on a boy with cancer. Childs started her foundation two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Its immediate aim is to develop educational programs that therapists can use 
with children and their families in the months leading up to the climactic 
swim. Dream A Dolphin has a five-year plan to establish a center for dolphin 
therapy on donated beachfront property on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Childs said dolphin therapy now takes place at seven sites in Florida, using 
animals born in captivity. She says the swim has proven to be "a watershed 
experience" that can spark progress in troubled or disabled children and change 
their parents' attitudes as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learn to see where that child can go, instead of focusing on what is not 
happening," Childs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring a major hit -- something that thus far has eluded her -- would 
presumably put Childs in a better financial position to push Dream A Dolphin 
closer to its goals. But she says she would never let her musical career be 
affected by the money requirements of her foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do that," she said. "I've never had the ability (to consciously write 
commercial music). I'll continue to do things the way I always do." 
</P>

 ON A DARK NIGHT YOU CAN SEE FOREVER: Barbra Streisand has shown the way to fix 
The Pond of Anaheim's only flaw as a concert venue. Namely, she has insisted 
that while she is singing, the house be kept dark. 
</P>
<P>
 While most people I've talked to don't seem to care that the luxury boxes 
ringing the arena typically stay lit during concerts, I think it's a serious 
lapse in taste and a mark of disrespect to a performer. The darker the house 
is, the more focused, intense and potentially thrilling a concert experience 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Babs, that famous perfectionist, obviously agrees: It has been strictly lights 
out for her shows at The Pond. Why not do it right for other artists as well?

 NEW OLD SOUNDS: Dramarama may be finished, but soon there will be two newly 
available Dramarama recordings for the band's legion of Southern California 
fans to remember it by. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton-based eggBERT Records, run by Dramarama buddy Greg Dwinnell, has set 
a Sept. 6 release date for "Looking Through," by the Bent Backed Tulips -- an 
alter-ego Dramarama assumed for a late-'80s album originally issued only in 
Europe on the French label New Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwinnell says the album first came into being when songwriter John Easdale 
proposed a double-album to the band's label, Chameleon, but was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama released "Stuck in Wonderamaland" in 1989 as a single album, and 
bootlegged 11 other tracks to New Rose for overseas release under a pseudonym 
taken from the Beatles' song "Glass Onion." The eggBERT version will include 
the 11 original tracks, plus nine others from the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the way from eggBERT, in late September, is "Senseless Fun," a 19-song 
Dramarama compilation that will include unreleased studio rarities, live covers 
of songs by David Bowie, Alice Cooper, T-Rex and the Who, and three new songs 
that Dramarama recorded last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Easdale said recently that a show Dramarama played earlier this month at the 
Stone Pony in its home state of New Jersey could turn out to be its last but 
that the members want to mull things over a while longer before deciding 
whether they should formally disband. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a deal now, and they seem to be going in different 
directions," said Dwinnell. "But I've seen this happen four or five times 
before, so I'm not as quick to call it quits as some others." 
</P>
<P>
 One Dramarama member who already has moved on to other things is guitarist 
Mark (Mr. E) Englert, who is playing in a new band called Hatful of Rain. The 
band, which also includes two Portland-based musicians, singer John Lowery and 
bassist Fred Nied, makes its Orange County debut with a free show Sunday at 6 
p.m. at Tower Records in Costa Mesa. Sharing the bill is the local power-pop 
band Atomic Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Englert says he began playing with the two Oregonians last year because he 
wanted a songwriting outlet that Dramarama didn't provide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Englert isn't calling Dramarama's apparent split final. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hiatus period, for everyone to go off and find their own thing, 
whatever that might be," he said Tuesday from his home in Los Angeles. "I think 
everyone is going for a period of cooling down." 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama is one of the acts on "Melody Fair," a tribute to the (early, 
pre-disco) Bee Gees recently issued by eggBERT. Easdale, the group's singer and 
main songwriter, will headline a free concert in conjunction with the album, 
Aug. 6 from 2 to 4 p.m. at Tower Alternative at the Lab, 2930 Bristol St., 
Costa Mesa. Also performing are fellow Bee Gees tribute-payers Baby Lemonade, 
the Jigsaw Seen, Kristian Hoffman and Barry Holdship. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for eggBERT is a Hollies tribute album, scheduled for January, that 
Dwinnell says will include performances by Sugar, the Posies, Material Issue 
and Steve Wynn, among others.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CONCERNS AIRED OVER RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and environmentalists are concerned about the city's use of a 
controversial facility in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area for a 
debris-recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Public Works on July 7 decided to allow five public works 
employees to operate a debris-recycling program out of an office at a nearly 
complete septic waste collection facility adjacent to the Tillman Water 
Reclamation Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and conservationists, who believe the park should be preserved for 
recreational purposes, had assailed the impending opening of the dump without 
an environmental study, which has belatedly gotten under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the city has decided to use the politically sensitive facility as a 
center from which to dispatch 80 temporary workers to earthquake-debris pickup 
sites. At the pickup sites, the workers will sort out recyclable wood, 
concrete, metal, dirt and bricks for reuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten vans will be parked at night at the facility, which is scheduled to be 
used for the recycling program until January. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Harris, a public relations consultant for the Public Works Department, 
said she polled a dozen residents and environmentalists to get their views on 
its proposed use for the recycling program. Half said they were opposed and 
half accepted the use with reservations, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors' main concern was that the city appeared to be setting a precedent 
that might ultimately lead to approval of the septic waste collection facility, 
reported Harris, who maintains that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's decision-makers from public works sees them as entirely different 
issues," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, and Van Nuys resident Bob 
Garner said they told Harris they were opposed to the recycling program going 
into the dump's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "That basin was chartered as a flood-control basin and the U.S. Congress 
defined it as a recreational use," Silver said. "Then that sewage plant was 
brought in through the back door. Now this unsavory precedent allows the basin 
to be used for solid-waste management. Where will all this end?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They just went ahead with it because they don't care, they don't listen," 
Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Swift told Harris the use was acceptable, but only for the specified 
six-month period. Swift, a co-founder of the Coalition to Save Sepulveda Basin, 
said the public works department should have done more to publicize the 
proposed use, and should have held a public workshop on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a precedent that this sets, once the foot is in the door, for a land use 
that is not compatible with what (the basin) was designed for," she said. KAY 
HWANGBO

DISNEY PLAYOFF REJECTED; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: GLITZY PRESENTATION TOUTING ORANGE 
COUNTY AS A PERMANENT HOST TO GAMEDOESN'T SWAY NCAA PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite heavy lobbying by the Walt Disney Co. and a host of high-power 
backers, the NCAA has vetoed a proposal aimed at making Orange County the 
permanent site of a Division I-A championship football game, it was disclosed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA has quelled further discussion for now of a Division I-A final in 
Orange County or anywhere else, said Jack Lindquist, the retired Disneyland 
president who heads efforts to create the bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 The game would have featured the two top-ranked teams in a nationally 
televised showdown every January at Anaheim Stadium. Now, the soonest that such 
a game could be staged would be 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Lindquist said his group will create a Disney Classic centered 
around another sport, possibly soccer or basketball, so that the group will be 
well-positioned against competing venues in case the NCAA reconsiders the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have an event, and we can demonstrate that Orange County can really 
put on a show like this and bring it off better than anywhere else," Lindquist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney organized a sophisticated push for the "Disney Classic," rounding up 
support from leaders in the arts and business. 
</P>
<P>
 A video produced in conjunction with ABC Sports, which wanted to televise the 
game, featured Disney Chairman Michael Eisner making a pitch to college 
presidents. In addition, The Times' marketing department produced a special, 
full-color newspaper circular that was sent to the colleges outlining plans for 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC and The Times were joined as co-sponsors by prominent Orange County 
companies such as engineering giant Fluor Corp., and developers Irvine Co. and 
C.J. Segerstrom & Sons. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the event more palatable to the majority of universities that are not 
major football powers, Disney proposed a week or more of events showcasing 
artists, musicians and scholars from all of the schools. Each of the 104 
Division I-A schools would also be guaranteed at least $75,000 in proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've offered a platform for Division I universities to talk about their 
whole stories. The game is an important part of that, but not the whole story," 
said Steve Clark, a Tustin-based themed entertainment consultant and former 
Disney executive working with Lindquist. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the game that attracted the NCAA's attention. An NCAA committee 
chaired by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young considered the issue last month in 
Kansas City, but never resolved the issue that has been a matter of controversy 
for decades. "It may take a little time, or a lot," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Division I-A football, unlike any other college or professional sports, 
decides its champion through polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The television and attendance revenue alone from championship games is 
staggering. The bowls collectively earned $36 million from TV rights and $88 
million in gross receipts last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet colleges are clearly divided on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney proposal was aimed at bridging the gap between Division I-A powers 
and lesser teams. Yet even with the extraordinary organizing effort and a 
package that gave a little to everybody, the Disney-backed proposal didn't fly 
when an NCAA committee of athletic directors met last month in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that the Disney Classic executives learned their ideas would not 
be considered at the NCAA convention, which meets in January, said Troy 
Lindquist, son of Jack and the group's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to the current fallback position of going ahead with the Disney 
Classic in another form, and holding out hope that it could make Orange County 
a leading contender to have the matter reconsidered by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities include a championship soccer game at Cal State Fullerton's new 
stadium, or a national college basketball game at The Pond of Anaheim, home to 
the Mighty Ducks. The arena already will be home to the John Wooden Classic, 
which will pit Kentucky against UCLA and Kansas against Massachusetts on Dec. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lindquist said the college arts and scholastic events would still be held 
in conjunction with the championship game. But the scaled-backed athletic event 
would not generate as much money, so the budget would have to be pared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly would not have the TV blockbuster we did," he said. "ABC is 
going to have to look over the sports package we bring them and determine what 
it's worth."

BERRYHILL, A FREQUENT CASTOFF, STICKS AROUND; BASEBALL: A FORMER TWO-SPORT STAR 
AT LAGUNA BEACH NOW WITH THE RED SOX, HE'S THE PLAYER NO TEAM WANTS BUT CAN'T 
DO WITHOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Boston Red Sox catcher Damon Berryhill had it easy once. There was a time when 
he was a baseball phenom. A No. 1 draft pick. A can't-miss-kid. 
</P>
<P>
 That guy no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
 In his place is the castoff. The journeyman. The guy no one really wanted but 
can't seem to do without. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seem to have to prove myself every year," said Berryhill, who is 30. "I 
have to out-perform the next guy. There hasn't been a club say, 'You're our No. 
1 catcher. Here's a three-year deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Here's your hat, there's the door, has usually been the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill, a graduate of Laguna Beach High School, was the Chicago Cubs' top 
draft pick in January, 1984. He played in the postseason with the Atlanta 
Braves and was briefly a World Series hero in 1992. Yet both organizations gave 
up on him. 
</P>
<P>
 But his bags may be in Boston for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill has out-performed the competition again. He was the team's fourth 
catcher during spring training, but he was the survivor in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere Damon has gone, he's won the job," Red Sox Coach John Wathan said. 
"You have to be impressed with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill, it seems, has a lot of admirers these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clemens can't live -- or pitch -- without him. Berryhill became Clemens' 
personal caddie almost immediately, catching every time the Red Sox ace threw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damon and I really click together," Clemens said. "He's always calm and 
collected. You never sense panic in him. I'd love to have him here for a number 
of years." 
</P>
<P>
 What Roger wants, Roger usually gets from the Red Sox. Berryhill, though, has 
done enough to earn the job without the lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 True, his .251 batting average seems pulp in the year of the juiced ball. But 
he is hitting .302 with runners in scoring position and 12 of his 28 runs 
batted in have either tied games or put the Red Sox ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit .327 in May, which pretty much secured his spot as as the No. 1 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, Berryhill's throwing has never been the same since he tore his 
rotator cuff in 1989. He has thrown out only a little more than 30% of base 
stealers this season. Yet, Sunday he gunned down Rickey Henderson, baseball's 
all-time base stealer, in a key situation. Berryhill threw out three would-be 
base stealers Tuesday against the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damon's out here early every day," Manager Butch Hobson said. "He's 
constantly working. His personality is great for a team. You can't help but 
like him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox liked him so much that catcher David Valle was dealt to the 
Milwaukee Brewers for outfielder Tom Brunansky on June 19. The Red Sox had 
forked over $1.2 million to Valle during the off-season, certain that he would 
be their catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill had merited only a minor league contract after being released by the 
Braves, but then the Red Sox got a closer look at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damon was a nonroster player when spring training began, but when it was over 
there was no doubt he belonged on the team," Wathan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Berryhill: "It always seems like I'm on teams that like another catcher 
and they're going to play that guy. Then I end up with the job." 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't always been that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill was a two-sport star at Laguna Beach. Of course, it's a school known 
for sports that need sunscreen, not a backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists won only one game his senior year. Berryhill, though, was a 
four-year starter with the Artists, not that anyone noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I played in front of one scout in four years and he was there 
watching a player from another team," Berryhill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention came in a rush. After two solid seasons at Orange Coast College, 
the Cubs made him their No. 1 pick. Four years later, he fulfilled that promise 
and was in their starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were good. He was even named to one all-rookie team in 1988. Then 
things went bad. He had surgery after his shoulder injury in 1989 and missed 
most of the following season. By the time he was 100% healthy, the Cubs weren't 
100% behind him, or so it seemed to Berryhill. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me about 50 at-bats (in 1991), then gave up on me," Berryhill said. 
"It was almost like missing another whole season. They had obviously decided to 
go in another way." 
</P>
<P>
 And Berryhill's direction was south. He had asked to be traded throughout the 
season and the Cubs finally obliged him with six games left, shipping him to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 He had one at-bat for the Braves and struck out. Not a great base on which to 
rebuild a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy just to be there," Berryhill said. "I just figured I would prove 
that I could still play." 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-RBI game during spring training removed any doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a guy in a trade, you always hope he's going to help the team," 
said Red Sox outfielder Otis Nixon, who played with Berryhill in Atlanta. 
"Damon had some real big games for us. There was a two-month stretch last 
season where he hit everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill's numbers weren't eye-popping. He hit .228 in 1992 and .245 last 
season. Yet, he always seemed to be around in key situations. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the Braves' regular catcher on Sept. 19, 1992, when Greg Olson broke 
his ankle. Berryhill got four hits that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he won three games in the final inning with home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever Damon was in a clutch situation, he seemed to come through," Nixon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Never more so than in Game 1 of the 1992 World Series. Berryhill hit a 
three-run homer off Jack Morris in the sixth, as the Braves beat the Toronto 
Blue Jays, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel myself touch the ground until I reached third base," Berryhill 
said afterward. "When you see that ball leave the park -- for that moment, you 
are on top of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 It was his biggest moment. And it was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill had only one other hit during the Series. He struck out 11 times and 
had a .091 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst moment came in Game 4. He took it upon himself to bunt with runners 
on first and third and none out in the eighth. He popped up and the Braves 
failed to score. They lost, 2-1, and Berryhill was criticized by Manager Bobby 
Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to get one run in and put another runner in scoring 
position," Berryhill said. "If I get the ball down, it's a great play. But I 
popped up, so I'm the goat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see guys who have no business being heroes in the World Series. Guys who 
get hot at the right time and get their knocks. It just happens. You also see 
guys who shouldn't be goats. What the hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill also homered in the National League championship series last season. 
But the Philadelphia Phillies went to the World Series. The Braves went home 
and started tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves decided that 23-year-old Javier Lopez had to be in the lineup. 
Berryhill and Olson became expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, Berryhill signed the minor league contract with the Red Sox, 365 
days after the Braves gave him a one-year, $905,000 deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want to keep me around to be the backup," Berryhill said. "The 
bottom line was they didn't want to pay me." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a monetary decision that paid off for the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Berryhill had a good spring training but had tough competition. Besides Valle, 
the Red Sox had Bob Melvin, who had a guaranteed contract. They also traded for 
Rich Rowland in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was odd man out," Berryhill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't sure Damon would make the team, right down to the last day of 
spring training," Hobson said. "But he just fit in with the club. He's good for 
our young players . . . and our veterans. Our young pitchers like throwing to 
him. All our pitchers like throwing to him. He makes my job easier because I 
don't have to go to the mound as often. He sees something, he'll go out there 
and correct it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In short . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to keep him," Hobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A story Berryhill knows well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Atlanta, they always called me the 'backup catcher,' " he said. "I caught 
101 games one season and 115 the next. If they wanted to call me a backup, 
that's fine. I'm not going to complain. I'm still a major league baseball 
player and that's what it's all about."

TOWNSEND IS LEAVING WITH GOOD MEMORIES; RAIDERS: DEFENSIVE LINEMAN HOPES TO 
RESTART HIS CAREER WITH ANOTHER TEAM NOW THAT HE HAS BEEN RELEASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Townsend was thinking about Lilly. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after his release from the Raiders after 11 years, two Pro Bowls 
and one Super Bowl, the defensive lineman was thinking about a woman in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know why she was in a wheelchair, he didn't know her age, although 
he figures she was in her 60s, and he didn't know her last name. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did know that she was one of his biggest fans, that she was always 
waiting for him at the Coliseum with a word of encouragement or a gift for his 
birthday or some other occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will always have a special place in my heart for her and a lot of fans like 
her," Townsend said. "Those fans were great. And I hope they will still have 
feelings for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, 32, was released Tuesday after efforts to trade him failed. 
</P>
<P>
 He was to be paid $1.5 million this season and $1.6 million next season. With 
aching knees and a history of weight problems, Townsend was a luxury the 
Raiders could no longer afford in the day of the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 It also didn't help Townsend that defensive lineman Scott Davis was back after 
two years of retirement or that another defensive lineman, Jerry Ball, had been 
signed in the off-season, or that Anthony Smith has steadily gained playing 
time at Townsend's expense as Smith has grown into one of the NFL's most 
effective pass rushers.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Raiders had offered to bring Townsend back at a salary of $500,000 
for this season, but he balked. 
</P>
<P>
 And other teams did not show much interest in a trade, realizing the Raiders, 
near the salary-cap limit of $34.6 million, were going to be forced to release 
Townsend in order to sign No. 1 draft pick Rob Fredrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend is determined to play somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 He is negotiating with the Philadelphia Eagles. The Denver Broncos and Arizona 
Cardinals have reportedly dropped out of the bidding after expressing interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had thought I would play another two to three years," he said. "But now 
this makes me want to prove myself. Now I want to play three to four years. 
I'll just have to start from scratch with a new team." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend would like to have started his search earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they had given me a little bit more of an opportunity to find a new 
team sooner if they were going to do it (release him) anyway," Townsend said. 
"But I'm not bitter. I wore those colors for a long time. I want to reflect on 
the good times, not hold bitter feelings over what went down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that this team gave me an opportunity in '83 and I'm thankful for 
that. I'm grateful for the time I had and now it's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 In his heyday, Townsend impressed teammates and opponents alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some games where he couldn't be blocked," Raider linebacker 
Winston Moss said. "I would look at the film and I thought there wasn't anybody 
who could block this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 When you play 11 years and record 107.5 regular-season sacks, most in AFC 
history, there is much to replay in the VCR of your mind. But Townsend didn't 
hesitate when asked for the sweetest moment of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was that sack of (John) Elway in that 1985 game," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game against the Broncos at Denver's Mile High Stadium, a game the 
Raiders needed to clinch the AFC West title. With the score tied at 14-14 in 
overtime, Townsend broke through to sack Elway, the Denver quarterback, causing 
a fumble the Raiders recovered. The Raiders went on to kick the game-winning 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It figured Townsend would name a moment involving the Broncos. He always 
seemed to have his biggest days against Denver, his most menacing moments 
against Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, he returned an interception 86 yards for a touchdown against the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 And even last season, with his playing time reduced drastically, Townsend rose 
up and had one day that brought back memories of his past -- a three-sack day 
against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Townsend would be just as happy to join the Broncos, or at least get 
out of the AFC West so that he wouldn't have to face Elway so much anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chasing that guy," Townsend said, "makes you old." 
</P>
<P>
 But Townsend says he doesn't feel old.  
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the change I need," he said.

DOME'S DAMAGE RAISES QUESTIONS; BASEBALL: REMAINDER OF MARINERS' HOME STAND IS 
CALLED OFF AFTER TILES FALL FROM CEILING OF KINGDOME. SERIES MOVED TO BOSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When four 15-pound acoustic tiles dropped 180 feet from the Kingdome ceiling 
into choice seats behind home plate, some Seattle Mariners wondered if the 
current stadium renovation would include a retractable roof. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the mishap several hours before Tuesday night's game 
against the Baltimore Orioles that marked the first time a sporting event at 
the Kingdome has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred before the stadium's doors were opened for the fans, and 
players were warming up on the field away from the debris. The game was 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 What could have been a disaster 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was instead a warning to Kingdome officials that all was not safe in 
the 18-year-old structure where the Mariners and the NFL's Seattle Seahawks 
play home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdome officials Wednesday called off the rest of the Mariners' home stand 
-- a doubleheader against the Orioles on Wednesday and a four-game weekend 
series against the Red Sox that was rescheduled for Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the schedule change does not help the team," said Dave Aust, a 
Mariner spokesman. "But first and foremost is fan safety." 
</P>
<P>
 A team of forensic engineers inspected the dome Wednesday to try to determine 
whether the problem was localized.  
</P>
<P>
 There was speculation that a $6-million project to strip and reseal the roof 
of the domed stadium, under way since the spring, led to the ceiling failure, 
possibly by allowing rainwater to seep through newly exposed cracks and soak 
the tiles underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from the engineers will not be ready for several days, according to 
Kingdome spokeswoman Carol Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
 The next event scheduled for the stadium is a professional soccer game on July 
30. The Mariners are due back Aug. 2, and the Seahawks have scheduled an 
exhibition game Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the first time a faulty stadium has forced a home team to play on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the Montreal Expos played their final 13 home games on the road after 
a 55-ton concrete beam fell 20 feet from the outside of Olympic Stadium onto a 
walkway. As a result, the Expos played their last 26 games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Syracuse men's basketball team canceled one exhibition game 
and moved another after the Carrier Dome had to have its roof deflated because 
of pressure by snow and ice. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the roof of the Hartford Civic Center collapsed about six hours after 
5,000 fans watched the Connecticut men's basketball team play a game. As a 
result, the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Assn. moved to Springfield, 
Mass., until Feb. 6, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, the roof of the Spectrum blew off during a storm, forcing the 
Philadelphia Flyers to play the final month of its NHL season on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingdome ceiling, spanning about seven acres, is made up of 80,000 wood 
fiber tiles, each one about three feet by four feet and held in place by metal 
frames. Keaton said several tiles near those that fell had been bolted to the 
ceiling this year. They appeared warped and stained and "we didn't like the 
looks of them," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners' 20-year lease with King County, which owns the Kingdome, runs 
through the end of the 1996 season, but team officials have been unhappy with 
the facility for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a stadium that will be competitive in the league," Mariner spokesman 
Tim Hevly said. "The place leaks, it's wet, now tiles are falling out. . . . 
This (incident) is more or less what we've been talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of the Mariners being officially rained out of their indoor stadium 
was not lost on officials, especially as the weather forecast for Seattle 
throughout the week has been perfect for baseball -- clear and hot. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Kingdome, Keaton said, "it looks like it's going to be a long, wet 
week."

JIM MURRAY: RETTON GIVES BACK TO SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 100-year history of the modern Olympics, it's surprising how many -- or 
rather how few -- athletes left a lasting mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, each has his or her claim to fame. But, in general, the list is short. Jim 
Thorpe in 1912, when the King of Sweden, no less, pronounced him the greatest 
athlete in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Owens in 1936, when he gave the lie to Hitler's "Master Race" by showing 
that it wasn't even master of the long jump pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Beamon broke the existing Olympic record by nearly three feet in Mexico 
City in 1968 and the existing world record by nearly two feet. To appreciate 
this, you have to understand the Olympics are not usually a competition in 
which even its records are broken. It's more a time that you make sure you get 
a medal, not a record. 
</P>
<P>
 Other athletes stood above the crowd in their time, to be sure. But, probably, 
no one had an Olympics that belonged more uniquely to them than Mary Lou Retton 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strange Olympics. The Russians weren't here. The Games' future hung 
in the balance. It was a do-or-die Olympics. The gloomies were waiting with the 
wreaths -- and they weren't laurel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an Olympics that belonged in its way to Carl Lewis, who won four gold 
medals. But he contented himself in the long jump with a 28-foot victory and no 
more, passing up a chance at Beamon's 16-year-old mark to save himself for 
other competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for a lot of reasons, the '84 Olympics belonged to an athlete so tiny she 
could have come to the Games in someone's pocket. A few less inches and she 
would be invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 But you would have to say inch for inch, Mary Lou Retton was probably the 
greatest athlete in her Olympics. Other Olympic greats had long legs, long 
arms, great strides or powerful torsos. They looked like Greek statues. Mary 
Lou Retton looked like something out of a baby carriage. Or a doll house. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou captivated a country. She had a smile that could light a dark cellar 
and she was seldom without it. She had the blackest eyes and the whitest teeth 
anyone had ever seen. The eyes looked like bottomless pools and they danced 
with merriment and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't even overwhelm her competition. She was the best all-around gymnast 
-- she won the all-around with two 10s in key parts -- but she won the silver 
in the vault and the bronze in the uneven parallel bars and two team 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the public adored her. She was everyone's kid sister. She was bubbly, 
as cheerful as a puppy with a rubber ball. She looked like she was having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 And she was a great athlete. She was only 4 feet 9, weighed somewhere between 
90 and 100 pounds and got her shoes in the infants' department, but never has 
so much energy been packed in so small a package. When someone came to Pauley 
Pavilion once and asked which one was Mary Lou, he was told, "She'll be the one 
with sparks coming off her." 
</P>
<P>
 She was raised in the hills of West Virginia, not ordinarily considered a 
hotbed of gymnastics. She was a hyperactive child, and when the family steered 
her into dance lessons to work off that excess energy, she left a trail of 
broken lamps, chair backs and crockery in her high-kicking exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad went down in the mines for a living, but he had been an athlete himself, 
good enough to play the other guard to Jerry West on the West Virginia varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4-9, basketball was not an option but gymnastics was. Retton found that out 
when, at the age of 9, she watched Nadia Comaneci on television at the Montreal 
Olympics, where she became the first woman to score perfect 10s in Olympic 
history. Retton knew she had found her athletic niche. 
</P>
<P>
 She stole the '84 Olympics. She became the first American woman to win a gold 
medal in gymnastics but, more important, she came off in the public mind as a 
combination of Shirley Temple and Mary Pickford. America's New Sweetheart. She 
won five medals in all, more than any athlete in the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 She never lost her appeal. Only a year ago, nine years after her triumph, she 
was voted best-loved American athlete in a wire-service survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame is fleeting in all sports. But ballplayers can last into their 40s. 
Golfers can play as long as they can walk. Olympic gymnasts are over the hill 
at 16. The body needs an elasticity that comes only with childhood. Gymnasts go 
directly from the highchair to the uneven parallel bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Lou Retton has not retired with her clippings and medals in a glass 
case. At 26, she still looks as if she could get a 10 in the floor exercises. 
Diminutive, athletic, animated, she will look 16 when she is 40. Her schedule 
makes Hillary Rodham Clinton's look humdrum. She has been host at Comedy Night 
at the Improv, a frequent performer in Hollywood ("Baywatch," "Naked Gun," 
"Dream On"), a coast-to-coast motivational speaker. And she still performs 
gymnastics. She is either on an airplane or a balance beam. 
</P>
<P>
 She is impatient with the notion that for girl gymnasts, pressure comes too 
soon, too intense. "You can handle pressure better at 14 than 40," she insists. 
"You get used to it -- you start at 7 getting used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Olympics won't forget Mary Lou Retton, she won't forget the Olympics. 
This month, Retton has instituted the "Mary Lou Retton" awards that she is 
setting up with her own money ($5,000). It is geared to help young hopefuls, 
the male and female athlete at the Olympic Festival who show the most promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in Fairmont, West Virginia, I know more than most the financial 
hardship of trying to get ready for the Olympics," she said. "I appreciate what 
my family went through. The Olympics were good to me, I want to be good to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 She already has been good for them. She doesn't mind being a role model. That 
may be a bigger achievement than any 10 she made in the vault or floor 
exercises..

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; DEAL'S VALUE LIMITED EARLY

<P>
 Rob Fredrickson, the Raiders' No. 1 draft choice, signed a lucrative long-term 
contract, but the deal is limited in its immediate value by the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson will receive $4.875 million over five years, an average of 
$975,000 a season.But he will get nearly $2.5 million in the final two years of 
the contract. And that money is not guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was agreed upon Tuesday, after a nine-day holdout. 
</P>

<P>
 Offensive tackle Greg Skrepenak suffered a sprained ankle Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a cause for more concern than usual because it's the same ankle he 
broke in the preseason last year, causing him to sit out the entire season.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate," Coach Art Shell said, "but those things happen. Someone 
stepped on his foot, but he didn't hear or feel anything pop." 
</P>
<P>
 Skrepenak hopes to be back to work quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the ankle) has been taking a beating with the two-a-days (workouts)," he 
said, "but, until now, it's been feeling really good." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Raider who came up limping Wednesday was receiver Alexander Wright, 
who suffered a pulled calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler has been taking it easy in workouts because of 
off-season surgery to remove bone chips from his right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders figure to use Hostetler sparingly in at least the early part of 
the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, they want to shield him as much as possible for as long as 
possible from the punishment he took last year, when he constantly struggled to 
his feet following one crushing blow after another. 
</P>
<P>
 For another thing, the Raiders want to take a long look at second-year man 
Billy Joe Hobert to see if he indeed can be their quarterback of the future.

NCAA VETOES PROPOSAL FOR 'DISNEY CLASSIC' FINAL; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: GAME WOULD 
HAVE MATCHED NATION'S TOP TWO TEAMS IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AT ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite heavy lobbying by the Walt Disney Co. and a host of high-powered 
backers, the NCAA has vetoed a proposal aimed at making Orange County the 
permanent site of a Division I-A championship football game, it was disclosed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA has quelled further discussion for now of a Division I-A final in 
Orange County or anywhere else, said Jack Lindquist, the retired Disneyland 
president who heads efforts to create the bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 The game would have pitted the two top-ranked teams in a nationally televised 
showdown every January at Anaheim Stadium. Now, the soonest that such a game 
could be staged would be 1998, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Lindquist said his group will create a Disney Classic centered 
around another sport, possibly soccer or basketball, so that the group will be 
well-positioned against competing venues in case the NCAA reconsiders the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney organized a sophisticated push for the "Disney Classic," rounding up 
support from leaders in the arts and business. 
</P>
<P>
 A video produced in conjunction with ABC Sports, which wanted to televise the 
game, featured Disney Chairman Michael Eisner making a pitch to college 
presidents. In addition, The Times' marketing department produced a special, 
full-color newspaper circular that was sent to the colleges outlining plans for 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the event more palatable to the majority of universities that are not 
major football powers, Disney proposed a week or more of events showcasing 
artists, musicians and scholars from all of the schools. Each of the 104 
Division I-A schools would also be guaranteed at least $75,000 in proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the game that attracted the NCAA's attention. An NCAA committee 
chaired by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young considered the issue last month in 
Kansas City, but never resolved the issue that has been a matter of controversy 
for decades. "It may take a little time, or a lot," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindquist said the college arts and scholastic events would still be held. But 
the scaled-backed athletic event would not generate as much money, so the 
budget would have to be pared.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; LINE DRIVE BREAKS RIGHT WRIST OF 
CLARK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A third-inning line drive off the bat of the Texas Rangers' Gary Redus broke 
the right wrist of right-hander Mark Clark, the Cleveland Indians' winningest 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrist will be in a cast for the next four to six weeks.The Indians did not 
estimate when Clark (11-3) might return. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It looked more like a game in Philadelphia than one in Moosic, Pa., home of 
the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre triple-A affiliate of the Phillies. Right-hander Curt 
Schilling, the most valuable player in the National League playoffs last 
season, worked six strong innings, giving up one run in a rehabilitation 
assignment. Behind him were center fielder Lenny Dykstra and third baseman Dave 
Hollins, both hitless in rehabilitation starts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Gary Gaetti was activated from the 15-day disabled list by the 
Kansas City Royals. . . . Enrique Calero, 22, filed a $15-million lawsuit 
against the Houston Astros and major league baseball, alleging he was cheated 
of his amateur status when he was lured into signing a professional contract 
and then released.

OWEN AND JACKSON SWINGING IN TANDEM; BASEBALL: GOING THREE FOR FOUR, WITH HOMER 
FOR BO AND DOUBLE FOR SPIKE, MARK RARE BIG NIGHT FOR BOTH ANGELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not often that Angel third baseman Spike Owen and outfielder Bo Jackson 
open the morning paper to find a three-for-four night next to their names in 
the box score. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, they will. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was three for four with a home run and Owen added three hits, two runs 
batted in and two runs scored as the Angels beat the Boston Red Sox, 8-4, 
Wednesday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen has started only 52 of 96 games this season, but he is becoming a regular 
at third base now that Damion Easley has been moved to second. He's 15 for 37 
with 10 RBIs since July 9, missing two games because of a bruised heel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe a lot to (hitting coach) Rod Carew," Owen said. "He helped me a lot 
early, when I wasn't playing a lot. He was stressing getting in a lot of work 
in batting practice and getting good at-bats when I was in. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the other person is (Angel Manager Marcel) Lachemann. When he took over 
as manager (in May) he could have stuck me in the eighth spot. But when I 
started swinging well, he stuck me in the leadoff spot and then moved me to the 
second spot, where I'm more comfortable. There's a feeling of confidence there, 
that he knows I can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 It came as somewhat of a surprise to Lachemann, who said, "I didn't know 
(Owen) was that good of a ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen had base hits in the first and second innings, scoring in the first when 
Chili Davis grounded into a double play, and drove in two runs with his single 
to left in the second. He doubled to left in the fifth and scored on Davis' fly 
to center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Going three for four is somewhat of a new concept for Jackson, who will never 
be mistaken for a singles hitter. His three-hit game against the Red Sox 
matched his season-high on May 16 at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Jackson can still let loose with an occasional big swing, as he did in 
the seventh inning when he hit Chris Howard's first pitch over the left-field 
fence for his 10th homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also has cut down on the number of bad swings, where he lunged at 
outside pitches, a problem that has plagued him most of the season. As a 
result, he's substituting base hits for strikeouts -- as he did Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 He has raised his average from .203 to .279 in the last 36 games, hitting 
safely in 20 of them. He's hitting just over .300 in that stretch with six home 
runs and 22 RBIs. 
</P>

 Saturday night, his pinch-hit home run off Baltimore's Lee Smith tied the 
score at 3-3 in the ninth, setting up a 4-3 Angel victory. It was his first 
game-tying or go-ahead RBI since April 17 against Toronto.

 "Bo has had a pretty good idea of what he wants to do when he goes up to the 
plate," Lachemann said. "He has been doing a hell of a job for us."

 Wayne Lukas, trainer of Preakness and Belmont winner Tabasco Cat, was the 
leading buyer for the first time at Keeneland's July Selected Yearling Sale.He 
bought 14 horses for $4,125,000 during the two-day sale that ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're enjoying a good spring, obviously, and getting into the sales ring has 
been important to our program," he said. "We had a couple of years we didn't 
get in as actively, and this is certainly going to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas' top purchase was $775,000 for a Pleasant Colony colt. Many of his 
purchases were for Californian Bob Lewis. Lukas trains 20 of Lewis' horses. The 
top price at the sale was $1.05 million for a Mr. Prospector filly out of 
Winning Colors.

HE'S KING OF THE HILL AT THIS TOURNAMENT; RACQUETBALL: TITAN GRADUATE HAWKES, 
12-TIME SINGLES CHAMPION AT OUTDOOR NATIONALS, IS A FORMER PRO ON INDOOR 
CIRCUIT WHO ALWAYS RETURNS HERE TO TEST COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Hawkes played the indoor pro racquetball circuit off and on for five 
years. But he never was able to make the kind of living he wanted in the sport, 
and he gave it up in 1992 for the shirt-and-tie world of being a loan officer 
for a mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
 The money he hoped to make simply wasn't there. During his time on the tour, 
he won one tournament, worth $5,000. He was second in another and collected 
$3,500. He did well in numerous others, but he didn't see the kind of financial 
future he wanted, even though he was ranked as high as No. 7 at one point. 
During that time, he also worked as a club pro at a racquetball facility in 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy what I'm doing now, but if I could make a good living wearing shorts 
and a tank top, I'd still be doing it," said Hawkes, who will be 31 in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkes attended Cal State Fullerton between the times he spent playing the pro 
tour and teaching the game, and graduated with a degree in mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 The one return he makes to top-level tournament racquetball now is at the 
Outdoor Nationals each year. The event normally is in Southern California, 
which makes it easy for Hawkes to show up and collect the first-place trophy in 
singles and be on his merry way. This year's tournament will be held Saturday 
and Sunday at the outdoor courts at Golden West College, and Hawkes again is 
favored. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, Hawkes keeps coming back for the outdoor nationals 
just to see if someone will emerge to give him a decent game. That hasn't 
happened often in recent years, particularly since the touring pros of the 
indoor game haven't been entering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the indoor pros used to come, but they started getting beat by the 
outdoor players, and they stopped showing up," Hawkes said. Most of the top 
outdoor players are from either Southern California or Florida. The other parts 
of the nation concentrate on the indoor version of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as big a tournament now as it once was," he said. "I think it's 
because there aren't as many juniors coming into the game now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkes has won in singles 12 of the last 14 years, and he and his partner, 
Craig Lane, have won in doubles in the last three tournaments. He won the 
singles title the first time when he was only 17 and a senior at Marina High. 
He won the championship the next three years. He was upset in the quarterfinals 
the following year, but then came back to win the next four years in a row. He 
didn't play the next year because of another commitment, then came back to win 
four more consecutive championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkes believes his level of play probably has gone downhill slightly in the 
last couple years because he hasn't been playing regularly. But he doubts that 
it's off enough for anyone to beat him this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I play only once every few months unless I'm getting ready for a 
tournament like this one," he said. "I practice hard for a month for this, but 
even after one day of practice now my shoulder bothers me. But I continue to do 
other sports, too. I enjoy cycling, weightlifting, golf. I do a little of 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The big difference between the outdoor and indoor court is that the outdoor 
court has only half-walls on the side and no back wall or ceiling. The outdoor 
court also is slightly bigger. Hawkes believes the outdoor game is more 
physically demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 His doubles partner says that's one reason Hawkes excels outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian is usually the best conditioned player out there," Lane said. "He also 
is very quick. And he has a really strong forehand, and because of his 
quickness, he can run around his backhand. That makes him stronger outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his racquetball skills, Hawkes is known for his unusual eating 
habits. At one point, when he was in his 20s, he says he was consuming more 
than 6,000 calories a day, well above the normal levels. He said he was trying 
to strengthen himself and build more muscle. But his raging metabolism 
continues to keep the weight off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always eaten a lot without gaining much weight," he said. "Then, when I 
was playing so much racquetball and training, I did it to keep from losing 
weight. I had to eat to keep my energy up." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Hawkes was mainly into carbohydrates. Now he's on a diet heavy 
on protein: fish, turkey, chicken, tuna and dairy products, but red meat only 
rarely. 
</P>
<P>
 While he never made big money playing racquetball professionally, Hawkes did 
have a surprise windfall when he landed a spot on a television commercial for 
Mennen Speed Stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, they were looking for an actor who could play racquetball," Hawkes 
said. "I guess they didn't find one, and a couple of people mentioned my name. 
I ended up getting the commercial, and it's turned out to be a good one.  
</P>
<P>
 "They started showing it in March of 1993, and it's still running now and 
then. I'll be sitting there watching TV and all of a sudden it will come on." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkes says he still is getting residuals from the commercial, and now has 
received about $30,000. "Actually, I worked for only two days and I've been 
getting paid for it for more than a year," he said. "I've made more money from 
the commercial than I ever did in one year playing racquetball." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkes says he has no plans to totally retire from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll keep playing outdoors as long as I can run around out there," he said, 
smiling.

SHE'S NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE; THE BEST PLAYER ON HER BOYS' TEAM, RUGGIERO GAINS 
ALL-STAR RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With long blond hair, expressive blue eyes and thick dark lashes, Angela 
Ruggiero of Simi Valley looks every bit a prom queen. She speaks softly and 
giggles often in the manner of an easygoing California teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Ruggiero changes into her hockey gear a demeanor change follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Her nickname? "The Terminator." 
</P>
<P>
 There's something about skating on ice in pads and shin guards that transforms 
Ruggiero, 14, who will be a ninth-grader at Valley View Junior High in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The girlish stuff disappears. By necessity. According to Ruggiero, the boys 
she competes against resent having her around, and their rough play reflects 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 No problem, says Ruggiero, who is 5-foot-8 and 155 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned to deal with that a long time ago. She has been pushed around, 
laughed at and teased by boys since she started playing the game at the age of 
7. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first she faced lots of nasty comments from boys," said Ruggiero's father, 
Bill. "They've used every name in the book. She used to cry and say, 'Dad, look 
what that boy called me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now she's the only girl in California playing AA hockey, the state's highest 
amateur level. The top level in the nation is AAA but California currently has 
no AAA teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most boys don't say much anymore," Ruggiero said. "But they still get mad 
when I check them. Their teammates laugh at them and say, 'Ha ha, you got 
knocked down by a girl.' I just don't take it personally anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruggiero became interested in hockey seven years ago when her father enrolled 
her younger brother, Billy, in a local clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the siblings led their Pasadena-based youth team to the state 
age-group championship in Redwood City. Billy, 13, is a goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela, a defender, was recently selected to represent California Aug. 7-11 in 
a national girls' tournament in Hartford, Conn. Forty of the state's top girls 
were invited to try out for the team last month in Lake Arrowhead and 20 were 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Horton of Thousand Oaks and Anne Riley-Katz of Valencia also made the 
team. Horton, 15, is a defender and Riley-Katz, 17, is a forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there haven't been enough players to form a league of their own, 
California never had an all-star girls' hockey team, according to Bob Varo of 
USA Hockey, the national governing body for amateur hockey in the United 
States.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those girls are pretty good players and they can hold their own," 
Varo said of the new California team.  
</P>
<P>
 "And this is not don't-hit-me-type hockey. There will be full checking." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruggiero is the team's best player, according to Coach Todd Sharinn. Look for 
her name on the 1998 U.S. Olympic team roster, he said, when women's ice hockey 
will make its debut as a medal sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharinn grew up playing hockey in New York City, where the sport is as popular 
as pickup basketball is in California. He competed at Boston University and 
played at the semipro level. He has coached boys for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angela is a tremendous player," Sharinn said. "She is this state's No. 1 
hopeful for the next Olympic team. She's big and strong and one of the only 
players on this team that I can say, literally, can skate with the boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruggiero spends about 25 hours weekly training for hockey. She runs for 45 
minutes every morning, shoots 500 pucks daily in her garage then travels with 
her father and brother to rinks throughout the Southland for matches. 
</P>
<P>
 She also plays basketball at Valley View, runs track and cross country and is 
an honor student. On Saturdays she awakens at 3:30 a.m. to make a 5:15 
ice-hockey practice in Pasadena. Occasionally, she does the same on Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I don't eat junk food either," Ruggiero said smiling. "Obviously, I can't 
do much on weekends because I'm always playing hockey. But I don't feel like 
I'm missing out on anything. I love hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 The work has paid off. In April she excelled at a tryout camp in Anaheim where 
she earned an invitation to the national women's 17-and-under camp in Lake 
Placid this month.  
</P>
<P>
 But when USA Hockey officials discovered Ruggiero's age, they canceled her 
invitation. Players must be 15, and Ruggiero's birthday isn't until January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say she's in the top 5% in the country of every player her age, that's 
boys or girls," said Scott Plumer, who coaches at the Pasadena Ice Skating 
Center. "Physically she's probably one of the top three toughest players I've 
ever coached and I've coached at a pretty high level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angela is an in-your-face kind of player. She's also very intelligent and she 
reads plays well." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ruggiero, who works at a Simi Valley glass shop, predicts the family will 
move to a hockey hotbed such as Minnesota in the next few years so his daughter 
can develop with top-notch players. 
</P>
<P>
 She's all for it. The harder the competition, the better. In fact, she 
considers the state's lack of female players a kind of blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like playing against the boys because they're tougher and they play 
harder," Ruggiero said. "It really pushes me to do better and I really like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably safe to say that beauty contests won't be part of Ruggiero's 
future. She'll be busy pounding opponents on the ice. Playing It Cool

SAMUELSON, A SHINING EXAMPLE, OPTS FOR ORIENT; VOLLEYBALL: BALD, BRASH AND 
INTENSE, THE VETERAN PLAYER IS TAKING HIS ACT TO JAPAN AFTER 'PHILOSOPHICAL 
DIFFERENCES' HELP TRIGGER DECISION TO RETIRE FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL SQUAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Look out, Japan, Bob Samuelson is on his way. Samuelson, a veteran opposite 
hitter and middle blocker, will play for the Osaka club of the Japanese 
professional volleyball league next season after retiring from the U.S. 
national squad last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The intense Samuelson, famed for his baldness and boldness, won a bronze medal 
with the U.S. team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. But the former Pierce 
College and Cal State Northridge standout, who will turn 28 on July 30, said 
that various factors prompted him to quit the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. team is very demanding on your body," said Samuelson, who underwent 
four operations in five years with the program, including arthroscopic surgery 
in February to remove torn cartilage from his left knee. "It was getting hard 
physically to play at that pace. . . . An opportunity to play in Japan 
developed. It's a shorter season and more money, so it was kind of a no-brainer 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuelson added that philosophical differences with the U.S. coaching staff 
also triggered his decision to leave the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess some of my problems with the (U.S.) coaches were they were trying to 
tone down my act and turn me into a person I'm not," Samuelson said. "I want to 
be me and play volleyball in my style. I felt kind of handcuffed because of my 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. Coach Fred Sturm said that all he wanted was for Samuelson to 
use his emotions constructively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has been a misunderstanding in points I've made to Bob," said 
Sturm, who has coached the team since 1991. "What I've asked and what he has 
heard are two different things. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The question I always asked (Samuelson) was, 'Are you in control of your 
emotions or are your emotions in control of you?' I think he heard me saying, 
'Don't be emotional.' But I didn't want that either. It's disappointing that he 
is leaving the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Fortune, a veteran outside hitter on the U.S. team, said he also will 
miss Samuelson. His spirited play helped make the team successful, Fortune 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Bob brought to the team was that energy and presence that got the crowd 
rallying behind us," Fortune said. "That's what the U.S. team needed a lot of 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuelson can pump up a crowd like few other players. Easily recognized 
because of his 6-foot-5-inch frame and bald head caused by a rare condition 
which causes the hair on the body and scalp to fall off, Samuelson's outlandish 
behavior on and off the court is legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese, for instance, will remember Samuelson not only for his outburst 
against their team at the Barcelona Olympics, a display that eventually cost 
the United States the match, but for one of his most outrageous escapades -- a 
dash through Tokyo streets in his underwear after losing a bet to a friend. He 
gave bystanders a good look at the tattoo on his right ankle of a skull and 
crossbones. The skull features a blue Mohawk haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 That time, however, Samuelson at least kept on some of his clothes. Other 
memorable stunts engineered with the cooperation of U.S. national team players 
included scaling a French volcano and a cliff-jumping excursion in Finland. 
Both were done in the buff. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of what Samuelson tabbed "Team Unity Through Nudity." 
</P>
<P>
 But his well-chronicled antics during matches, during which his motor mouth 
often provoked referees and opponents alike, cost the Americans a victory over 
Japan in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan leading in games, 2-1, and 14-13 in the fourth game, Samuelson 
received a yellow card for unsportsmanlike conduct for arguing a call with the 
referee. It was his second yellow card of the match, which under International 
Volleyball Federation rules calls for disqualification. The infraction also 
includes a one-point penalty, which would have given the match to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the referee invoked neither the disqualification nor the point 
penalty and the U.S. team ultimately won the game and the match.  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the Japanese appealed to the IVF and won a reversal. The United 
States went on to finish in third place behind Brazil and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the people who protested feverishly against Samuelson at 
Barcelona was Seiji Oko, the Japanese coach who now heads the Osaka club. 
Samuelson, however, doesn't anticipate any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked him as a coach," said Samuelson, who will leave his La 
Jolla home for Osaka in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 With a bag full of underwear, no doubt, in case he loses any more bets.

COMMENTARY; SWEET SMELL OF RANGER VICTORY TURNS INTO ODOR FROM KEENAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Keenan will get what is coming to him eventually, because his kind of 
grasping hustler always does. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan hated working for Neil Smith, New York Ranger president, and so came up 
with this outrageous scam to make a score somewhere else. And when the court 
cases and the arbitrations are over, Keenan will end up with the St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 And Coach Keenan will end up working for one of the lousy guys in his 
business: General Manager Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Bettman, who will be the best sports commissioner of all before he is 
through, will decide this one. He will decide it the only way he can: Keenan is 
the one in default of a contract here, not the Rangers. But Keenan goes to St. 
Louis anyway, because you cannot send him back to the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Rangers will end up compensated by the Blues with players and maybe 
even some money. You cannot blame the Rangers if they use the money to have 
Keenan's office fumigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman has seen the Rangers embarrassed within a month of one of the most 
dramatic and appealing and emotional nights in the history of the NHL. He has 
seen the league, riding an unprecedented wave of popularity and spectacular 
publicity, embarrassed by Keenan, who really has told the Rangers and the Blues 
and the world that he is in charge of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Bettman should still hear the echoes of Game 7, he will have to 
listen to Keenan instead. 
</P>
<P>
 And when this is all over, the Rangers will win. Bettman cannot have coaches 
or players declaring themselves free agents. Bettman will find that, if there 
was a breach by the Rangers in making a late bonus payment, it was an 
immaterial one. He will find what everybody already knows: that Keenan is a 
fraud, incapable of telling the truth about his motives or intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman will be left to settle one more issue, the one of tampering. That is 
another investigation, involving Keenan, the Detroit Red Wings and the Blues. 
That one could end up costing Keenan some money, or a suspension, either of 
which would be wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Keenan is obsessed with two things before he ever gets to winning hockey 
games," one of his former NHL bosses said. "He is obsessed with Mike Keenan, 
and he is obsessed with money." 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan will get out of New York, of course. But he was not forced out by 
anyone or anything. The idea that Smith had the juice to force out the coach of 
the first Ranger team to win the Stanley Cup since 1940 is preposterous. It is 
just another lie, in the form of amateur spin-doctoring from Keenan and his 
agent. Smith had a better chance to pick up Madison Square Garden and move it 
four blocks than he did to move Keenan if Keenan did not want to go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a question about all these power plays that were supposed to be going 
on behind the scenes: power plays with whom? Once Madison Square Garden 
President Bob Gutkowski told Keenan and Smith to shut up and work it out, where 
else was Smith going with this? Over Gutkowski's head? That means Sumner 
Redstone of Viacom. That would be some conversation to listen in on, believe 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith: Mr. Redstone, I'm Neil Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone: Who? 
</P>
<P>
 Smith: The president of your hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone: Of course you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith: I want you to fire our coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone: The squirrelly fellow who gave us such a nice evening with the big 
Cup and so forth? 
</P>
<P>
 Smith: That one. I'm sorry, I can't work with him any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone: Try harder, son. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not a chance in this world that Smith was going to get his coach, 
even if he wanted to. Gutkowski wasn't going to let it happen. Maybe Smith 
didn't like it, but he accepted it. Keenan already was looking around, despite 
all denials to the contrary. He already was moving toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't work with Bobby Clarke in Philadelphia, and he couldn't work with 
Bob Pulford in Chicago and he couldn't work with Smith. Now he is general 
manager in St. Louis, and will find a way to sabotage himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan is one of those people who will always sabotage himself. I love reading 
and hearing about what a brilliant play this was on Keenan's part. Because it 
was so much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a terrific coach in the short run. We also thought he had turned into 
Captain Queeg halfway through the series against the New Jersey Devils when he 
started pulling his goalie and his stars and conducting bizarre off-the-record 
news conferences. Then Mark Messier saved him and everybody else, and the 
Rangers were able to beat the Vancouver Canucks by one goal in the seventh 
game. It does not mean Keenan is Al Arbour. 
</P>
<P>
 One month after his greatest triumph, he has been marked lousy. No one 
believes him. No one believes this prattle about how miserable his life was at 
the Garden. They paid him a ton of money there, even if it was a day late 
occasionally. When he wanted all those new players before the playoffs began, 
he got them. 
</P>
<P>
 He took those players and delivered the Stanley Cup. He already was looking 
around, even if he wouldn't admit that; even if he won't admit that now. This 
has nothing to do with his family, and it has nothing to do with a bonus. And 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
 So Keenan will lose in front of Bettman but end up in St. Louis anyway. The 
Blues will pay with players, maybe even star players. Keenan will pay with his 
good name, if he hasn't already sold it.

ANYTHING BUT BASIC; BLACK HAIR RANGES ENOUGH IN TEXTURES AND DEGREE OF CURL TO 
MAKE IT A CHALLENGE FOR EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED STYLISTS 
</P>

 At the "Hair Olympics '94" world hairstyling competition in London in April, 
American national champion Barry Fletcher was barred by the U.S. hairdressing 
team from entering the contest with his favorite model. The reason: She is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher, who is also black, was told that if he used a black model in the 
international competition he was sure to lose, not because of the model's race 
but because of her hair texture. Fletcher used the white model assigned to him 
and lost. He said later that the switch hurt his performance. While a black 
client's hair might pose a challenge to some hair stylists, in hands such as 
Fletcher's "it can look stylish; it can look vogue, it can be competitive," 
says Jackie Smith, the model with whom Fletcher won the U.S. championship. 
</P>
<P>
 For blacks in Orange County, finding a stylist who knows how to make the most 
of their hair isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it hard to find a good stylist here? Yes with a capital 'Y,' " says Pamela 
Coffey, owner of Images, a boutique specializing in African American gifts and 
clothes in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of stylists claim to do black hair, but finding someone who can do a 
really good job is tough. Most of them are in L.A.," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Black people) need a lot more care given to our hair" to keep it from being 
damaged, says Lenore Smith, owner of Hair by Lenore in Tustin, a salon that 
caters to blacks. "(Black people have) 10 to 20 different hair textures. Some 
of us even have three hair textures on one head." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where about 40,000 people are black, stylists estimate that 
there are about 10 salons that cater to them, most of them opening in the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many black clients prefer to go to a black stylist who they feel will 
understand their hair better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had too many problems with our hair being burned out or falling out," 
Smith says. "A lot of beauty school teachers don't know how to do black hair." 
</P>
<P>
 As do many black stylists, Smith learned how to work with black clients' hair 
by cutting hair in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Center Stage Hair Company in La Palma, a stylist who goes by the name 
Tree ("that's how people know me") has clients of all ethnic backgrounds, 
including a large following of black women. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an artist and a scientist," says customer Jennie Spencer Green of San 
Juan Capistrano, sitting in a chair while Tree applies a chemical relaxer to 
the curl in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks "have a variety of hair textures, so the stylists have to be a cut 
above," she says. "Tree might work with five different textures in three 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Black clients' hair ranges from very fine to very coarse, with varying degrees 
of curl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always tight; it's not always straight," Tree says. "People who have 
straight hair want curly hair, and people who have curly hair want straight 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
 If the hair has kinky curls and the client wants it straightened, a stylist 
must know how to work with the relaxers that take curl out of the hair much the 
way a permanent will add waves, Tree says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make sure you don't break the hair," says Tree, gently combing 
the waves out of Spencer Green's hair. "The hair has a tendency to be more 
delicate." 
</P>
<P>
 The hair can be fragile because the relaxers and curling irons tend to dry it 
out, so proper conditioning is critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hotter elements (such as blow dryers and curling irons) have a tendency 
to rob the hair of its shine, so you need products that add sheen and 
moisture," Tree says. "If the average black woman were to let her hair go, it 
would frizz up." 
</P>
<P>
 He encourages clients to treat their hair regularly with moisturizing 
conditioners and not to wash and dry their hair every day. Most of Tree's 
clients wash their hair once a week, then head to a salon to for styling. A 
styling session costs about $25 to $30 because of the extra steps involved (a 
haircut costs more). 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more work because the hair is not as flexible. It doesn't 
necessarily blow in the wind," Tree says. "You have to condition, blow it dry, 
curl it with an iron. You're rearranging the hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Stylists must also be proficient with curling irons, which can bestow 
straighter, silkier hair or give it a gentle wave. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Moor, a stylist for Headlines Hair Studio in Lake Forest, wields hot 
pressing irons on a client's hair to straighten and add curl. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know the dynamics of hair, you can work with any kind of hair. To me, 
it's like art; it's just a different medium," he says.

ANYTHING GOES WITH GREEN; THINK GOLF. NOW BANISH ALL IMAGES OF TAM-O'-SHANTERS 
AND POLYESTER. TODAY'S PLAYERS HAVE LOST TOUCH WITH THEIR INNER HARLEQUIN. 
REALLY.

<P>
 I laid down my golf clubs 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I threw them down and kicked them while my golfing buddies, Frank 
Rudloff and Byron Graham, laughed mercilessly. 
</P>
<P>
 I had lost 13 of my father's new Top Flights that muggy summer day at the 
Frankfort (Ky.) Country Club. About half were swallowed by the muddy pond off 
the ninth hole. The others were sacrificed to the primeval underbrush of the 
rough. I had burrowed through brambles looking for the balls, and my forearms 
later tingled with an intimation of poison ivy. It would take my weekly 
earnings from mowing Mrs. Rogers' hilly and rock-spiked half-acre to replace 
the balls. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, I never played again. I joined a garage band called U Jive Turkey 
and became anti-competitive. Still, I look back on those days with a perverse 
fondness. The frustration has faded, and my impressions are mostly sensual: the 
smell of freshly mowed grass; Maryann, the golf pro's daughter, on a mission 
for her father to sweet talk us boys into shoveling gravel on the back nine for 
$1.50 an hour; 7-Ups and cheeseburgers from the grill. 
</P>
<P>
 And who could forget Frank? A model of ungainly dishevelment in the rest of 
his fashion life, he somehow struck upon what was then a credible ensemble for 
the golf course: green and blue plaid pants (polyester, of course), powder-blue 
Izod shirt, canary yellow cap with fuzzy ball. He had an extra spring in his 
step on the days when, whether by permission or stealth, he wore his dad's 
kilted imitation-alligator cleats. (Like the older men, he would tuck his ball 
markers into the kilts' furrows.) He also had argyle socks, and on blustery 
days, a rumply but fashionable pullover Windbreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank wore these things with such a regal air that no one seemed to notice 
that his slice was as bad as mine. (We kept Frank's regal air in check with 
therapeutic shoves into mudholes.) I had a similar outfit, all of it 
hand-me-downs, but somehow I always felt like an impostor. 
</P>
<P>
 That feeling resurfaced recently when I got a call from my friend Ben, who 
said he'd laid the groundwork for me to ghostwrite the autobiography 
(self-published) of his great uncle Ty, which Ben insisted was short for 
Tycoon. All I had to do was make a decent impression and close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drop what you're doing and get out to the driving range," Ben said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to do this over golf." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, if I were going to make a good impression, it wouldn't be on the 
basis of athletic prowess. I decided to claim a lower-back ailment after 
tee-off, then spend the rest of the round as the designated driver, muttering 
things like "beautiful" and "really fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of wardrobe, therefore, became all important. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred to me that golf's sartorial code has long hung on a rack of garish 
bad taste. Just consider that when people acknowledged our 1970s golf clothes, 
they used spiffy, or sometimes snazzy . At the time, spiffy seemed like a 
compliment, but I know now that it's a word applied to clothing worn by the 
better classes of rodeo clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, golfwear has sometimes served as one of the better examples of 
what happens when women throw up their hands and leave men to their own 
devices. The ancestral instinct to flaunt colorful male plumage takes over, and 
guys end up looking like goofballs. (Women's golfwear always seemed resolutely 
frumpy, but devoid of the heroic outlandishness of men's.) 
</P>
<P>
 How else to account for those halcyon days of Sansabelt slacks in 
non-biodegradable fabrics that clung to flesh like oil paint. That's to say 
nothing of the tooth-gnashing grid patterns that would give a city planner a 
migraine. And who but men could rally behind a garment that proclaimed the beer 
belly, gloriously rippling beneath its elastic sheath, as a zone of erogenous 
promise? And hats! Nylon floppies for that truant sailor look. Blue plaid 
tam-o'-shanters with crab apple-size fuzzy balls wagging atop. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it didn't start out that way. In the 19th Century, golf was an affair 
of tweeds, starched collars and overcoats. Later, knickers, pullover sweaters 
and argyle socks came to the fore. The plus-fours, as the short pants were 
known, gave way between the World Wars to equally subdued pleated slacks and 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 And today's players seem to dress in a manner unbecoming to the spirit of 
golf. Having lost touch with the inner harlequin, their attire is alarmingly 
respectable. (As if chasing that white ball with a $200 metal stick were a 
perfectly reasonable thing to do.) Deep-pocketed khakis. Cotton-knit shirts 
with asymmetrical designs. Jaunty hats. Saddle shoes with spikes. I bought them 
all, and with a sense of loss. Say what you will about the buffoonish apparel 
of days' past, it was at least a courageous embrace of the grand and wondrous 
absurdity that is golf. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it didn't matter. Uncle Ty faxed from the Bahamas to say he'd have 
to reschedule. 
</P>
<P>
 We're still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred to me that golf's sartorial code has long hung on a rack garish 
bad taste. Just consider that when people acknowledged our 1970s golf clothes, 
they used spiffy, or sometimes snazzy . At the time, spiffy seemed like a

CHRISTOPHER BUCKLEY TAKES HIS OWN SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As anti-smoking terrorists slap nicotine patches on every square inch of 
tobacco spokesman Nick Naylor's body, it dawns on him that "a massive, probably 
lethal amount of nicotine is at that moment being delivered, through his skin, 
into his bloodstream." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that there is any scientific proof that nicotine is bad for you," he 
reminds himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon, a wired and nearly dead Naylor is staggering through a Washington 
park, where he is rescued by police and ultimately transformed into the 
antihero of "Thank You for Smoking," a dead-on parody of the cigarette 
industry, Congress and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of tale that could spring only from the mind of Christopher 
Buckley, former air conditioner repairman for Ella Fitzgerald, would-be corpse 
salesman at Lenin's tomb and drug-addled interview subject on "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley, 41, educated by monks and married to an ex-CIA staffer, is also the 
son of conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr. He shares with his 
father the trademark Brahmin accent, keen intellect and, in the words of one 
writer, "eyes that pop wide open in moments of inexplicable startlement, as if 
some unseen source had dumped hot tea in his lap." 
</P>
<P>
 But he doesn't do the weird, lizard-tongue thing his dad is famous for -- and 
his mission in life seems considerably less political. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just write what comes along," he explains during a recent book-tour visit 
to Los Angeles. "I don't have a detailed master plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Shipped off to a boarding school run by Benedictine monks at age 13, Buckley 
used to sneak into the woods to smoke cigarettes and imagine himself aboard one 
of the freighters steaming out of nearby Providence, R.I. After high school, he 
ran away to work as a deckhand on a Norwegian liner sailing to "all the 
fleshpots of the Far East" (a similar trip after college was the basis for his 
first book, "Steaming to Bamboola") and had an obscenity -- later removed -- 
tattooed on his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 His rebellious-son phase also included an LSD trip in which he stopped home 
for a sweater, tripped over a coaxial cable snaked across the foyer and "looked 
up into the face -- the very interesting face -- of Mike Wallace." A crew from 
"60 Minutes" was taping a segment on Buckley's father and Christopher was 
reluctantly drafted for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bizarre encounter, he recalls: "All those lights. And Mike's face. It 
looked a little like Picasso's middle period." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he eventually followed his father's footsteps to Yale, where he 
began writing for a campus publication and attracted the attention of legendary 
editor Clay Felker of New York magazine. Felker sent Buckley to Caesar's Palace 
to try to interview Frank Sinatra. Buckley couldn't get near Ol' Blue Eyes, but 
he did corner Ella Fitzgerald, who warmed to his questions after Buckley agreed 
to fix the broken air conditioner in her hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, he worked at Esquire magazine, ascending to managing editor at 24. Then, 
in 1981, George Bush hired Buckley as a vice-presidential speech writer -- 
after making him promise not to publish any kiss-and-tell memoirs. Buckley kept 
that vow, but he did write a spoof of such books, "The White House Mess," which 
made the New York Times bestseller list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who works in the White House for more than five minutes writes a 
book about it," he says. "And the theme is always 'It wasn't my fault' and 'It 
would have been much worse if I hadn't been there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Buckley also met and married the daughter of Bush national 
security adviser Donald P. Gregg. She worked for the CIA at the time but now 
labors in the couple's million-dollar D.C. estate raising their two young 
children. In other words, says Buckley, "she's still dealing with terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 Son of William F., meanwhile, is now the editor of Forbes FYI, a quarterly 
leisure supplement to Forbes magazine. It was there that he concocted and 
published a hoax about cash-starved Russian officials auctioning off Lenin's 
glass-encased corpse -- and exulted when ABC News unwittingly broadcast the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Buckley is basking in the serendipitous timing of "Thank You for 
Smoking," which hit stores shortly after U.S. cigarette barons testified to 
Congress that their product hasn't been proved harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Gibson has optioned the movie rights; favorable book reviews are piling 
up, and the publisher recently sprang for an author party at the Washington 
Ritz-Carlton featuring so many smoke machines that firetrucks showed up, plus a 
Marlboro-shaped ice sculpture, smoked meats, leggy cigarette girls with gas 
masks and a band that played "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes," "Light My Fire" and 
"Puff, the Magic Dragon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley started the novel two years ago, after watching "one too many tobacco 
spokesmen on McNeil-Lehrer saying there's no link between smoking and disease. 
. . . I thought, 'What an interesting job that must be. Get up in the morning, 
brush your teeth and go sell death for a living.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He researched the book by hanging out with spokespeople from the tobacco, 
liquor and rifle lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiction, they become the Mod Squad (an acronym for Merchants of Death), 
consisting of cigarette PR man Naylor, liquor lobbyist Polly Bailey and gun 
spokesman Bobby Jay Bliss, a 220-pound, born-again, backwoods Southerner who, 
after the shootings at Kent State, "hitchhiked all the way into Meridian 
(Miss.) in order to sign up for the National Guard (so) that he, too, could 
shoot college students." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mod Squad meets weekly to discuss its losing battle against neo-Puritanism 
and, on occasion, to commiserate with spokesmen from other politically 
incorrect lobbies, such as "the Society for the Humane Treatment of Calves, 
representing the veal industry . . . (and) the Land Enrichment Foundation, 
formerly the Coalition for the Responsible Disposal of Radioactive Waste." 
</P>
<P>
 The book's plot centers around the kidnaping of Naylor but takes hilarious 
detours through the halls of Congress, the Larry King show and California -- 
"Reichland of the Health Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
 It also offers a brilliant scene in which tobacco marketers, trying to make 
the best of a law requiring skull-and-crossbones emblems on every pack of 
cigarettes, come up with a computer rendering of Mister Rogers' smiling skull. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say hello to your new friend, 'Mr. Death's Neighborhood,' " one ad man 
intones. "The focus groups loved it. Nonsmokers actually wanted to buy this 
pack. I took it home and tried it out on my kids. And they loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another intriguing twist is that many of the novel's characters are based on 
real-life celebrities and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood agent Jeff Megall, for example, who works out of a Creative Artists 
Agency-like mirrored building that cooks pedestrians with reflected sun rays, 
seems to be a spoof of Michael Ovitz. Bucktoothed Sen. Ortolan K. Finisterre, a 
"brown-noser who owed his political career to some nut who'd blown up his 
president-uncle 30 years ago at Disney World," is arguably Massachusetts Rep. 
Joseph Kennedy II. And Lady Bent, a former British prime minister with 
"mongoose eyes and a helmet of hair that looked as if it could deflect incoming 
nuclear missiles," could be Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley, of course, "categorically denies" any resemblance to real persons, 
living or dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean everything in the book is fictional, he says. The claim 
that lung cancer was virtually unknown in the United States before tobacco 
companies supplied World War I doughboys with cigarettes is true, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the story of Rodrigo de Jerez, a shipmate of Christopher Columbus who 
watched Native Americans "drink smoke" through pipes, brought tobacco back to 
Europe and was jailed by the Spanish Inquisition for promoting such a "devilish 
habit." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Jerez) was the first tobacco spokesman," Naylor's boss tells him. "You think 
you have it bad having to deal with the Federal Trade Commission? How would you 
like to have to state your case before the Spanish Inquisition?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Buckley presents Naylor as a sympathetic character, but in real 
life, he professes little love for tobacco flacks: "I gave up smoking the hard 
way, watching a friend of mine die of lung cancer. . . . I was with him the 
last three days (of his life). The desire left me." 
</P>
<P>
 What is Buckley's next target? He won't say. "A new idea is like carbonated 
liquid in a bottle," he explains. "You just sort of shake it until the cork 
pops, then you write and write." Discuss it too soon, the theory goes, and the 
idea turns flat. 
</P>

 Besides, Buckley says, there are more pressing matters at hand. Daughter 
Caitlin, 6, has started asking questions about religion: If God is everywhere, 
is he in bubble gum? she wonders. And Buckley, a longtime Catholic who recently 
crossed over to "the agnostic camp," isn't sure how to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather she knew something of Moses and Jesus than of Barney and 
Lambchop," he wrote in a recent newspaper essay. But it's also important to 
"remain true to your convictions. If you lie, (kids) pick up on it and never 
trust you again." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, when Caitlin asked what happens after death, "I looked her right 
in the eye and said, 'You go straight to heaven.' " A Sampler of Buckley's

 On marketing cigarettes overseas: "Agglomerated Tobacco . . . was moving into 
the former Eastern Bloc in a big way, introducing a brand whose name translated 
as 'Throat-Scraper.' The Eastern Euros, who'd been brought up on cigarettes 
that tasted like burning nuclear waste, were old-fashioned about their smokes: 
they demanded more, not less tar. To them, lung cancer was proof of quality."

 On foreign-born taxi drivers: "They only drive at two speeds, dangerously fast 
and really dangerously fast."

 On Congress: "How proud the founders would have been of the senators before 
him: over 2,000 bounced checks between them, a seducer of underage Senate 
pages, three DUIs, one income-tax evader, a wife beater whose only defense was 
that she'd beat him up first, and a case of plagiarism, from, of all sources, a 
campaign speech of Benito Mussolini."

 On the press: "He called the (newspaper) on his car phone to complain . . . 
(and) was put through to a recording. 'You have reached the Washington Sun's 
ombudsman desk. If you feel you have been inaccurately quoted, press one. If 
you spoke to a reporter off the record but were identified in the article, 
press two. If you spoke on deep background but were identified, press three. If 
you were quoted accurately but feel that the reporter missed the larger point, 
press four.' " 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 On the White House's fascination with celebrities: "There was a lot of traffic 
back and forth between D.C. and L.A. these days. He recognized Barbra 
Streisand's issues person, whom he'd read had flown in to brief the National 
Security Council on Barbra's position on the developing Syrian situation. 
Richard Dreyfuss' issues person was also on board, having given a presentation 
to the cabinet on Richard's feelings about health reform."

 On fat-cat lawyers: "His only passion, aside from billable hours, was said to 
be wine, which he didn't drink but only collected." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On giving to the homeless: "Being a lapsed Catholic, he would never be 
entirely sure, despite his certainty that it was a crock, that one of these 
wretches wasn't the mufti Christ checking to see who was being charitable 
toward the least of his creatures, and who wasn't and was therefore going to 
have such a hot time in the eternal hereafter as to make a Washington summer 
seem Antarctic by comparison."

 On the cause of evil in the world: "Ninety-nine percent of everything that is 
done in the world, good and bad, is done to pay a mortgage. The world would be 
a much better place if everyone rented."

FIRST PERSON: CHAOS AND QUIET -- THE SIREN SONGS OF FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mule deer, the squirrels, the pine beetles and the pines were all dead. 
Sitting among their black remains, I had never experienced such silence. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew something of silence, even at 20, having lived my life to that point in 
a lumber town between the Blue and Wallowa Mountains of Eastern Oregon, where, 
when the chain saws stopped and the Boise-Cascade loggers came down from the 
hills, quiet was almost all there was. 
</P>
<P>
 Resting that night in the foot-deep ash of the McKay Creek forest fire, ax and 
hard hat resting on my chest, I realized it was the silence as much as the roar 
that lured firefighters into the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen went in early this month and never came out, outpaced by a firestorm 
near Glenwood Springs, Colo. Nine of those 14 were from Prineville, Ore., a 
lumber town of 5,700 near where I fought my one and only blaze, and just over 
the hill from La Grande, where I first learned of forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 In many of the small towns of the Northwest, the central dramas of summer play 
out around forest fires. The talk is of weather, wood-moisture, the terrific 
conflagration of '77 or '64. Foresters make ominous predictions and the local 
papers write one-year anniversary stories on the previous summer's blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 In places like Prineville and La Grande, kids get the taste at a young age, an 
ashy mouthful of excitement when a fire comes near town. And when they see the 
soot-covered, sweat-soaked firefighters, they begin dreaming of fighting the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened to me when I was 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The world exploded, the sky went brown and the sun became a dim red dime you 
could stare right at. 
</P>
<P>
 Lights flashed, phones went dead, people ran instead of walked. Men stopped 
working at the mill and dropped their studies at the college and rushed to the 
fight. Friends lost their houses anyway. My older brother and I ran up and down 
our street, trying to contact the planes screaming overhead with the 
walkie-talkies we'd gotten the Christmas before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bomber, come in," we shouted. "Bomber pilot, do you read me?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the first day, Mom drove us to the high school football field, 
now filled with trucks and tents and disposable sleeping bags, and along with 
dozens of other onlookers, we watched what were the most important men we had 
ever seen, besides our father. The firefighters were giant men to us, with so 
much depending on them. And they were men with such faith in their immortality 
we could read it on their blackened faces. 
</P>
<P>
 We went home and donned boots and bandannas and asked Dad, "Could we please 
help fight the fire?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, of course, was no, and we were left to dream of fiery heroics and 
coming home filthy but with an excuse no mother could question. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fierce memories of that fire and the Forest Service helicopters 
that for years heralded high drama when they landed in the field by my house, I 
went on to less heroic, less poetic pursuits, fighting only the McKay Creek 
Fire of 1987. The entire state seemed to catch that year, and while forestry 
officials needed help, I needed tuition money. I was issued an ax and a fire 
shelter and made it into the canyon of McKay Creek in time for the last gasps 
of the beaten blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of my friends, though, and one of my brothers, remembered the fires and 
the men who fought them in their childhoods better than I, and at 16 or 17 
rushed headlong into the burning woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting forest fires is a young person's game, Norman Maclean writes in 
"Young Men and Fire," his story of the 12 smokejumpers who died in Montana's 
Mann Gulch blaze of 1949. The physical demands of the job require youth. The 
saddest irony, Maclean says, is it's the young who haven't "learned to count 
the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who fight forest fires have a difficult time explaining why they do it. 
Most are well-muscled young men and women who spend much of their time in the 
woods even when the woods are not burning. They save their fat, overtime-laden 
paychecks and spend their winters skiing or ice-climbing or studying forestry 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
 When they try to explain the powerful draw, firefighters speak of powerful 
themes -- wind, nature, a force so awesome it can create its own lightning 
storm. A "good" fire season, they'll tell you with a straight face, is one with 
plenty of fires. 
</P>
<P>
 In rare moments of personal candor -- far from the flames and plied with beer 
-- they might speak of the silence, and of the time they truly believed they 
would suffocate and burn in the woods, paid back by the flames they had fought 
so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Some get out after that. The others go back, leaping from planes, rappelling 
from helicopters, humping 80-pound packs into infernos. 
</P>
<P>
 During the nearly 20 years I spent in forest fire country, there had never 
been 14 lives lost at once in the woods, and I try now to imagine the silence 
in the charred forests around Glenwood Springs and the dry forests around 
Prineville. 
</P>
<P>
 The only condolence is that the silence won't last. Summer after summer, in 
dozens of timber towns across the Northwest, the blare of sirens and roar of 
airplanes and an impossibly low rumbling in the distance will alert everyone -- 
a forest fire is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Work will stop. The sky will turn dark. And 8-year-olds with walkie-talkies 
will run into the streets, look up to the glowing mountains and dream of going 
to fight the fire.

COSMETIC CHANGES; COLLECTIBLE COMPACTS ARE AFFORDABLE -- BUT APPRECIATING. 
DORIE WHEATCROFT OF CROFTON ANTIQUES IN COSTA MESA REFLECTS ON THE EVOLUTION OF 
VINTAGE VANITIES AND THEIR PREVIOUS OWNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 When Dorie Wheatcroft picks up one of her vintage compacts by its "tango" 
chain and puts it around her finger, she's transported to the Roaring '20s, 
when compacts were the "bees' knees" and the well-dressed flapper had one for 
every ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to imagine who owned the compact before me," says collector Wheatcroft, 
who owns Crofton Antiques in Costa Mesa with her husband, Norman. "Did she take 
it on a transatlantic cruise ship in the '20s or perhaps dance the tango with 
it in one of the '30s nightclubs? Each one has a special mystique to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days of this century, compacts were more versatile than they are 
today. Often called "vanities," they contained not only powder and a mirror, 
they also had compartments for rouge, lipstick, perfume, eye makeup and even 
money. They could be hung on a finger or wrist while dancing the night away and 
were meant to be seen, not just shoved into an evening bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began collecting about seven years ago when a friend got me started," 
Wheatcroft says. "She really created a monster. I'm very compulsive about 
buying them and I have around 300." 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't sell from her collection. The two dozen compacts for sale in her 
store duplicate ones she already owns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The value of compacts depends on the materials used and their rarity. I have 
some made from 24-karat gold and sterling silver," she says. "The advantages to 
collecting compacts are that they are small and can fit easily into suitcases 
if you buy them when you travel and they aren't exorbitantly priced. Some can 
be found for as little as $10." 
</P>
<P>
 But their value is rising. 
</P>
<P>
 The most current Schroeder's Antique Price Guide shows that one silver mesh 
vanity with a sapphire thumb piece and fringe sold for $400. Others have sold 
for thousands. Value is affected by condition, provenance, design and 
workmanship, much of which would be too expensive to duplicate today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Powder was one of the first cosmetics to be developed. It was made in ancient 
times by pulverizing flowers and fragrant leaves. Before there were compacts to 
hold powder, people used Asian ointment jars, Egyptian kohl pots, Etruscan 
cosmetic containers or French and English coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 But before World War I, makeup was frowned upon in the United States. A proper 
diet, fresh air and exercise were all women needed for beauty, said the 
experts. The Dorothy Gray cosmetic firm introduced a face "patter" to pat the 
skin and cause the skin to naturally turn pink. Pinching of cheeks was also 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War I, attitudes changed when women saw heavily made-up actresses 
appear in motion pictures. This began the golden age of the compact. 
</P>
<P>
 In illustrations in Vogue and other fashion magazines, a compact was 
prominent. Often a model was depicted staring into her color-coordinated vanity 
as she freshened her makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 There were compacts to fit the budgets of women working in factories as well 
as wealthy society types. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmetic houses such as Elizabeth Arden and Helena Rubenstein created ones in 
varieties of materials, colors and shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers of affordable compacts included Volupte, Elgin American, 
Yardley, Evans, Whiting-Davis and Coty. They were made of gilded brass, petit 
point, tapestry, ormolu (gilded bronze), vermeil, plastic, enamels and 
cloisonne. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry companies such as Tiffany, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels produced 
expensive ones using gold and precious and semiprecious stones. 
</P>
<P>
 There were compacts in the shapes of hearts, hands, telephone dials and tiny 
purses. Some commemorated World's Fairs or had scenes of lovers painted on the 
front. Others had music boxes that played when opened or watches to tell the 
correct time. 
</P>
<P>
 They were hidden in bracelets or cane handles, or could be attached to the 
inside of luxury cars and a woman's garters. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern cosmetic companies still offer various compacts. New ones for the fall 
are expected from Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, Estee Lauder, Clinique and others. 
Yves St. Laurent brings out a new heart-shaped compact every year with a 
different stone on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Ivana Trump was photographed for Vanity Fair holding a Yves St. Laurent 
compact, they became a very collectible item," said Tamara Steffen, color 
specialist for Yves St. Laurent at Bullock's, South Coast Plaza. Costing $140, 
they are refillable and have matching lipstick cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yves St. Laurent also has a non-refillable gold-plated model ($33.50).

 Rescuing the occasional sock monkey is not the grandest of heroic acts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Susana Miller has also taken in abandoned sock cats, dogs, reindeer and 
one sock anomaly she calls "the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Hollywood resident started her foster home 25 years ago after she 
discovered a $15 wooden toy chest on wheels -- a miniature version of a circus 
cage -- in a Northern California thrift shop. She set about filling it with the 
little creatures that aunties and grannies made in the 1950s and '60s by 
stuffing men's thermal socks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each sock toy has its own personality," Miller says, "with their little eyes, 
their little noses and even the way they're dressed. Some are boys and some are 
girls." She treats them like pets and swears they play at night when she's 
asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-described "avant thrift collector" also has a soft spot for less 
mischievous objects: everything from discarded oil paintings and furniture to 
candlesticks and salt and pepper shakers. A waitress by night at Spago, she 
finds time to hunt at least twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says she favors the larger shops because of their enormous selection. 
"They have huge rooms full of furniture, bins filled with toys, hundreds of 
framed oil paintings. . . . Plus, the prices are right -- cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, intent on replacing her $75 Victorian sofa from Goodwill with an 
even better $100 Art Deco model from the Salvation Army, Miller hung out a "For 
Sale" sign. The sofa, among other thrift-shop items, netted a $200 profit.

 Costume designers get to help create the TV and movie characters who trigger 
trends. Catering to Hollywood has its moments, they say, but doing a clothing 
line for real people -- now that's a challenge. Susan Becker 
</P>
<P>
 Probably best known as a designer for Madonna, Susan Becker has had a long run 
in the fantasy world of glamour and exotica. Now she is establishing herself in 
the real world with a collection of dresses and separates sold exclusively at 
the boutique Maxfield in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ready-to-wear business has been a welcome aside, she says, to working with 
individual celebrities and costuming films ("Baby Boom," "Father of the Bride," 
"I Love Trouble"). 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to designing for individuals, there is more freedom to 
experiment," says Becker, who started her career as a stylist for print 
photographers. "But to really influence fashion would interest me greatly." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers snapped up her summer collection of soft, feminine dresses cut on the 
bias. The fall line, available next month with prices starting at $350 for a 
single garment, is centered around silk satin separates: capri pants, skirts, 
dresses and cocktail gowns -- in pink, blue and navy, lined with China silk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Becker hopes to expand her venues, adding more boutiques and 
possibly even department stores. Her plan is to create something of lasting 
significance: 
</P>
<P>
 "In my film work, as in my designs, I try to stay classic and not do anything 
that will go out of style. I deal with what feels good and with what lasts." 
Jerry Skeels 
</P>
<P>
 The soaps "The Young and the Restless" and "The Bold and the Beautiful," among 
many other shows, have featured glamorous special-occasion dresses and suits by 
Jerry Skeels. 
</P>
<P>
 He and partner Randy McLaughlin have an L.A. retail store, Jeran Design, that 
caters to women who prefer classic fashions to one-night stands. Prices range 
from $500 for a suit in a Swiss cotton to $12,650 for a hand-beaded gown. The 
clothing, manufactured on-site, is also sold in better boutiques in Boston and 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Exquisite fit, sexy side and front slits, and other shape-enhancing nuances 
characterize the Jeran look. Certainly they'll apply in Skeels' latest venture, 
the upcoming TV series "One West Waikiki," starring Cheryl Ladd. (In a dramatic 
departure, though, Skeels also recently did costumes for ManPower Australia, a 
troupe of muscle-flaunting male dancers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Designers such as Donna Karan may greatly influence the fashion world, he 
says, but television also leaves a considerable imprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love doing TV. To me, that is the easiest way to make an impact." Cindy 
O'Donoghue 
</P>
<P>
 London native Cindy O'Donoghue worked as a seamstress for several British 
designers ("nobody famous," she says) before moving to Los Angeles to work with 
such rockers as Billy Idol, Joan Jett and the Bangles. She also did the 
costumes for the 1985 "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome," starring Tina Turner and 
Mel Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 18-month-old Los Angeles store, called Joywear, features O'Donoghue's 
designs as well as those of others, including Manolo and Bella Freud. The 
Joywear label is also available at Fred Segal and in Japan. Her most recent 
spring/summer collection is composed of stretch satins and chiffons meant for 
layering, to create a kind of mosaic. Newer designs feature rayon blends in 
fit-and-flare silhouettes. Price -- from $60 for a dress to $140 for a coat -- 
is something the designer watches closely because she knows shoppers do. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're working on a costume, your budget often fits into what (the 
producers) want. The challenge in retail is to produce something that looks 
expensive and still sells at a fair price." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of her crossover peers, O'Donoghue finds retail work less 
profitable than costuming. Still, she prefers designing for the larger 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it takes more talent to work in retail. You are not dealing in 
characters, you are dealing with consumers. The bottom line for me, though, is 
that I just want to be known as a good designer," she says. Nolan Miller 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan Miller's glamorous gowns, svelte suits and dramatic hats for the 
long-running TV series "Dynasty" symbolized the excess of the '80s. His gift 
for using cut and color blocking to make the show's characters appear slender 
and chic was the draw for many viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Miller continues to create one-of-a-kind designs for a celebrity 
clientele, as well as a couture collection available through his eponymous 
Beverly Hills boutique. His ready-to-wear -- and a few couture items -- hangs 
in such department stores as Saks Fifth Avenue, where suit prices range from 
$400 to $800. 
</P>
<P>
 A costume designer for 30 years, Miller thinks of his retail business as the 
"day job" that allows him to "fly around with movie stars and make pretty 
dresses." 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers working in film, he says, partly because of ready-to-wear's budget 
constrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a dress on a rack next to 20 others, and your dress is $100 
more than the others," he says, "that difference is something a real woman is 
really going to stop and think about." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also loves the challenge of creating a visually exciting character who 
can stand up fashionably even in reruns. "You do have to try to guard against 
things looking too dated when you're doing a show," he says. "But if you're 
doing a (ready-to-wear) line, you do the sample and move onto the next thing."

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: EXPECT NOTHING BUT THE HIPPEST FROM THESE MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "Models Inc." (Fox, Wednesdays at 9 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Hillary Michaels (Linda Gray) is de facto den mother and owner of 
Models Inc., a Los Angeles agency that represents a gaggle of pretty young 
things in this spinoff of "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Denise Wingate (for the first five episodes only), who 
also does "Melrose Place."Her previous series include "Middle Ages" and 
"Shannon's Deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: The latest fads, with spit and polish. That means blue jeans have 
been supplanted by such casual wear as slip dresses with baby T-shirts, 
hip-huggers, biker boots, apron dresses, ankle-grazing skirts, cropped tops and 
poor-boy sweaters. Unfortunately, the flawlessly hip attire and grooming make 
the characters seem fake and distant. You want to hate them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: A minimum of spray, mousse and gel. Hair is natural and breezy, as if the 
wind machine were always blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: Gray wears smashing business suits, but the bangs in her face bring her 
down, beckoning memories of Sue Ellen Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
 We Could Live Without: Strained trendiness, as in the Madonna-esque pigtails 
on Julie Dante (Kylie Travis) -- weren't those last year's rage? -- and the 
plucked and penciled eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: "I go out a lot at night. I love to people-watch, at a bar called 
Jones, where you see the most beautiful, roguish people, and at the Lava 
Lounge. I go to fashion shows Downtown. Everybody's got a copy of Arthur 
Elgort's 'Model's Manual.' And I go to Centerfold on Fairfax and buy $100 worth 
of foreign fashion magazines." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Hillary's suits are by Richard Tyler, Christian Francis Roth, Karl 
Lagerfeld, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein. Models' clothes, in a variety of 
labels, are frequently purchased at such Beverly Center stores as Bullock's, 
Ice and Traffic Studio. Shoes by Charles David. BETTY GOODWIN

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO WANT THEIR MTV NOW

 What comes after Generation X? Generation $$$. And showing the youthful 
consumers the way is Cindy Crawford. This week the style goddess signed an 
exclusive deal to be the spokesmodel for shopping programming on MTV, VH-1 and 
NICK at NITE. "Hopefully, this will be a cool thing to watch," she told the 
Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 We know one pre-pubescent princess who will be there. As it is now, our 
11-year-old -- on the brink of MTV's 12-to-34-year-old audience -- drools over 
teeth-brightener infomercials. She's a master of the eye-rolling, 
mouth-pouting, what-have-you-bought-for-me-lately look, and hardly needs 
Crawford's goading to feel deprived. MTV Networks' six-month test of shopping 
programming is scheduled to begin later this summer. Lock up your daughters.

 Catching a Few Zs: It was a high-class cruise fest this week at the Paris 
winter haute couture shows. How else to explain front-row appearances of the 
Artist Formerly Known As Prince, actors Hugh Grant and Sylvester ("It's not my 
baby") Stallone and singer Bryan Adams? Sure, they might have had a craving for 
a $15,000, one-of-a-kind gown. The urge strikes us now and again. But lest we 
appear too hard on these hunks consider that AFKAP nodded off, not once, but 
twice, reports Women's Wear Daily, in the middle of the Gianni Versace show.

 Deconstruction Squared: Early in the summer, blood-splattered models frolicked 
with guns for a controversial fashion pictorial in England's trendy magazine 
the Face. Now, the next step in violence wear has arrived: bullet-ridden 
clothing. New Hampshire artist Frank Allgeyer's Drive-By Fashions. He shoots 
holes into clothing to his customers' specifications. They can choose handgun 
holes, rifle holes or machine gun holes. The price: $35 for trousers and 
jackets, $15 for T-shirts, certificates of authenticity included. "This is in 
no way meant to promote violence, the gang lifestyle or macho militarism," 
Allgeyer told the Associated Press. "It's just a fashion statement. If you try 
to read anything into it, you're just dead wrong."

 Hot Links: "Cuff links are like women's clothes -- gaudy in good times, 
Spartan in bad." Eugene Klompus should know. He owns the world's largest 
collection of cuff links -- 27,000 pairs, not to mention the singles. The 
founder and president of the National Cuff Link Society, which convenes in 
Chicago on Aug. 20-21, has been a link-ophile since childhood. "It's like 'get 
a life,' huh? But people who wear cuff links are very discriminating." 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors narrow their prey to specific sub-genres. Take the fellow who buys 
links made only in Newark, N.J. Other favorites are cameos, fleur-de-lis, 
antique or those with a sporting theme. Of course, the cuff-link-wearing man 
requires plenty of French-cuffed shirts. Klompus recommends the menswear 
department at Nordstrom. The society's members communicate through a newsletter 
called -- what else? -- the Link. For information, call (708) 632-0561.

 Brighter, Cooler Laundry: An Orange County publication that debuted this week 
calls itself "style-driven." We have our doubts. Sure, it's got "stimulating 
photography, untamed fiction and off-the-wall humor" (an alternative magazine 
perequisite). But we're afraid the brains behind Java have a lot to learn about 
the geography of style. Included in their distribution points are "nightclubs, 
bars, coffeehouses, art galleries, hair salons and hip laundromats." Yeah, 
there's nothing hipper than reading Habermas in the flickering glare of 
fluorescent lights while your dirty underwear churns round and round. 
</P>
<P>
 Feast From the East: Antique fabrics meet modern design at Sunday's Japanese 
Festival Fashion Show and benefit luncheon at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. The 
show, which is part of Nisei Week, will spotlight clothing from Issey Miyake's 
Plantation line, Kanojo and Tadashi. Five designers whose work event chairman 
Shigeko Kajiya described as "very modern" have come from Okinawa for the show. 
Miyake, however, will remain at home in Paris. "He's very, very famous," Kajiya 
said. "I would have had to charge too much for the tickets." (Tickets are $45 
and may be ordered by calling (213) 972-5508.)

BOOK REVIEW / POLITICS; RIGHT'S TAKE ON BLACK 'BLAME' IS WRONG; RACE AND 
CULTURE: A WORLD VIEW BY THOMAS SOWELL ; BASIC BOOKS $25, 316 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom has it that the Los Angeles riots exposed the great gulf 
between Simi Valley and South-Central -- between white and black in American 
culture. Less well-known is that the unrest revealed an ocean of disagreement 
within the African American community itself.  
</P>
<P>
 On its left shore stood such leaders as Khallid Abdul Muhammad, who hailed the 
"Boston Tea Party" that he said followed the Rodney King verdict; on its right, 
leaders such as economist Walter E. Williams criticized the police for not 
being "out there with shoot-to-kill orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Sowell's new book is sure to only raise that ocean's tides. A senior 
research fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and arguably the most 
prominent African American conservative after Clarence Thomas, Sowell writes in 
the circumlocutory style of the dispassionate academic. His aim, he assures us, 
is not to judge disenfranchised Americans but to show how "a group's own 
culture (is the) primary determinant of its economic and social fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that Sowell has an inflammatory mission is clear. You don't have to be 
a cryptographer, for instance, to realize he is implicitly criticizing Native 
and African Americans with sentences like this: "Fertility rates, alcohol 
consumption, performance and behavior in school, suicide rates, and output per 
man hour . . . (are) just some of the indicators of behavioral differences 
among racial and ethnic groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Sowell's indictment-by-implication neatly gets him off the hook from having to 
back up his arguments with empirical evidence. But on the occasions when he 
does directly assert that a racial group is disenfranchised because of a 
weakness in its culture, he trots out statistics without revealing the story 
behind them.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, to support his assertion that "there is reason to doubt whether 
various groups apply themselves equally to abstract thought," he cites a study 
wherein "observers" found that "West African boys 'obviously became bored' with 
abstract questions." 
</P>
<P>
 He fails, however, to tell us the nature of these questions or the way in 
which the "observers" defined abstract . Had the test measured sensitivity to 
genuinely African forms of abstraction -- e.g. to the distinct polyrhythmic 
counterpoint of sub-Saharan music -- then one suspects the boys would have been 
considerably less "bored." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Sowell cites a study by Robert M. Yerkes in which "American Negro 
soldiers tested during World War I tended to 'lapse into inattention and almost 
into sleep' during abstract tests." What Sowell doesn't reveal is that scholars 
have long dismissed as grossly racist Yerkes' test -- which branded blacks with 
an "average age of 10" and led Army researchers to evaluate African American 
intelligence partly on the basis of skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sowell's deceptive use of questionable statistics, one can't dispute 
his central point: that some cultures have greater difficulty than others 
adapting to Western notions of progress and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sowell vividly illustrates many of the barriers to this adaptation. He shows 
us how Africa's isolating geography (it has few navigable rivers and accessible 
harbors) and lack of any common language deprived it of the trade in goods and 
ideas that invigorated Europe. Sowell's sympathy for cultures that fail to 
"progress," however, is sorely limited, for like the slave-born educator Booker 
T. Washington, he believes that no barrier is insurmountable.  
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of cultures, he emphasizes, have overcome geography ("Japan has 
prospered economically, despite being nearly destitute of natural resources, 
while many Third World nations languished in poverty on fertile land"), 
prejudice (despite their persecution during the Ottoman empire, Christians and 
Jews nevertheless "predominated in the commerce and industry of that empire") 
and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 He celebrates Mexican-Americans for not succumbing to poverty, pointing out 
that while they receive even less prenatal care than blacks, who have one of 
the nation's highest infant mortality rates, their infant mortality rates are 
no higher than those of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, however, is where the glibness in Sowell's tendency to "blame" a single 
culture while ignoring its surrounding environment becomes most clear, for 
blacks and Latinos have experienced very dissimilar environments.  
</P>
<P>
 As public health scholars have shown, Latinos have done well at child care 
because, as voluntary immigrants, they have been able to maintain the intimate 
family support structures of their native land.  
</P>
<P>
 Most blacks, in contrast, historically have had little choice but to abandon 
their family ties -- from the 17th Century, when they were forced to adapt to 
the slave trade, to the 1940s, when they were given the opportunity to leave 
Southern plantation homes for real jobs in the North. 
</P>
<P>
 So while Sowell excoriates African Americans for their failure to adapt to 
Western notions of "progress," their family ties, at least, may have unfurled 
precisely because they adapted all too well.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: ELEGANCE AND A DASH OF EXISTENTIALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 The Scene: Tuesday's benefit premiere of Columbia Pictures' Release of Castle 
Rock Entertainment's "North" at the Motion Picture Academy. An elaborate party 
followed at a lot at Wilshire and Doheny. The film tells the story of a boy fed 
up with his parents who goes looking for replacements. On the subject of good 
parenting, star Julia Louis-Dreyfus said: "I try to stay home as often as 
possible, which is why I'm making this mistake by being here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: There is a truly deep well of affection in the entertainment 
community for director Rob Reiner and Castle Rock. But the overwhelming 
consensus was that this film should have been dropped in a well. "I was 
surprised everyone kept their butts in the seats for the whole movie," one 
guest said. "I think it was a tribute to Rob that they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Reiner; stars Elijah Wood and Louis-Dreyfus; co-stars Jon 
Lovitz and Robert Costanzo; writer Alan Zweibel; plus 1,500 guests, including 
Tom Hanks, Rita Walters, Garry Shandling, Rita Rudner, Charlton Heston, Ron 
Meyer, Mike Ovitz, Richard Green, David Colden, Elliott Gould, Kevin Pollak, 
David Paymer and Castle Rock's Martin Shafer, Andrew Scheinman and Glenn 
Padnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Wasn't: There wasn't exactly an overflow of execs from the film studio. 
"It's like Columbia didn't have the money for gas to come," one guest said. "I 
heard Sony was in trouble; I didn't think it was that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Did She Look Like Fawn Hall?: Beverly Hills regulations are such that 
neighbors must be petitioned for approval to use the empty lot for a party. 
"One woman was very concerned that it might be a movie about Oliver North," 
said event coordinator Bettina O'Mara. "I don't think she would have signed if 
it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: The lot was elaborately decorated to reflect the film's locales. 
Alaska had igloos, Paris an Eiffel Tower and Hawaii a volcano. Each setting had 
a different menu. "It's an existential buffet," an agent said. "You see people 
walk by with food you want, but you can't find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Said Lovitz, "The truth is, the first premiere I ever went to I was 
very excited -- walking up the red carpet, the camera crews asking questions, 
the cameras flashing. Then on the way out, the same photographers were stepping 
on me to get to somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Money matters: Between private donations and a contribution from Castle Rock, 
more than $25,000 was donated to the National Resources Defense Council.

SOUTHLAND SUMMER IS A CIRCUS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lions and tigers and clowns, oh my! You think your commute is bad: Jon Weiss 
compares his job to someone being parked on a freeway and getting "hit from 
behind by another car going 65 miles per hour." Weiss is a cannonballer with 
the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus."Even though you are ready for 
the impact . . . it's still quite a jolt." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss joins other thrilling, sometimes frightening but always entertaining 
acts in the world-renowned circus, which has stops in Long Beach, Los Angeles 
and Anaheim. Russian gymnasts, the flying Vargas and Alvarez families trapeze 
acts, and lions, elephants and clowns will also perform. The circus's first 
stop is Long Beach Arena, 300 E. Ocean Blvd. The "Greatest Show on Earth" heads 
for the L.A. Sports Arena on Wednesday and the Anaheim Pond on Aug. 4. Show 
times vary. $9.50-$14.50. (310) 436-3661. 
</P>
<P>
 For a more traditional circus under a big top, California's own Circus Vargas 
is making the rounds of Southern California. Today through July 27, the circus 
is in Hollywood, at Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue. Shows are each 
evening, 5 and 8 p.m.; there's a third show at 12:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
The show moves to Lynwood from July 28 to Aug. 3. Tickets, $8.50-$18.50; 
children under 12, $4-$14.50. (310) 898-2079. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

CITY HALL JOURNAL: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; MAYOR LEAVES POST FOR HEALTH REASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawaiian Gardens Mayor Robert J. Prida resigned last week from his position as 
head of the City Council, apparently for health reasons, but will remain on the 
five-member board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after Prida announced his resignation at a special meeting July 14, 
the council voted 3 to 2 to appoint Councilwoman Kathleen Navejas to replace 
him.The Hawaiian Gardens mayor is appointed from within the council each year 
by a majority vote of members. 
</P>
<P>
 Prida's voice broke as he read a brief prepared statement, saying that his 
doctor advised him to step down to reduce stress. Prida said his doctor had 
told him to stay on the council because of the "positive job I am doing for the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to answer any questions after the meeting. "You heard my statement, 
and that's all I have to say about it," Prida said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prida, a custodian for the ABC Unified School District, was elected to a 
four-year council term in 1992 and appointed mayor in April. As mayor, he 
chaired the City Council meetings and served as the city representative on 
county and state committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Navejas, a veteran council member, served as mayor from April, 1992, to April, 
1994. She was also mayor from 1987 through 1989, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert G. Canada will take over Navejas' position as mayor pro-tem, 
the council decided. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PARAMOUNT; NEW BUDGET GIVES CITY EMPLOYEES PAY RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City employees will receive their first pay raises in three years under a 
$25.2-million budget recently adopted by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 spending plan guarantees salary increases between 3% and 10% for 
all 104 full-time employees except department heads.Part-time salaries will 
increase by 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget reductions led to the cancellation of a free daily bus trip for 
residents to Seal Beach and the layoff of a gang-prevention counselor. 
Paramount also replaced its Saturday shuttle service that transported seniors 
to out-of-town medical appointments with a less-expensive taxi-voucher system. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend $6.5 million on public safety, up 5% from last year to 
cover higher Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales tax revenue grew $598,000 this year to $4.7 million, which helped 
balance the budget, said Richard Leahy, deputy city manager. The new taxes were 
generated mostly from a new shopping center anchored by the area's first 
Wal-Mart store at 14501 Lakewood Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget is 25% less than last year's $33-million allocation. The difference 
is attributable to $8 million in federal and state bond money that Paramount 
received to build an automobile underpass below the train tracks on Alondra 
Boulevard, Leahy said. JOHN CANALIS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; CITY PROPOSES HIKE ON WATER FEES, BUS FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has proposed hefty increases in water fees and monthly bus 
fares to help balance a tentative $49-million budget that is scheduled for a 
vote Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The average monthly water bill for a family of four would jump as much as 75%, 
from $26.57 to $46.50.If the council decides to spread the increases over two 
years, the water bill in the first year would go up 63%, to an average of 
$43.34. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said increases are needed to allow the water department to operate 
in the black. Without the increases, revenues would cover only about half of 
the department's $4-million budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Various factors contributed to the deficit. Officials noted that the price of 
purchased water has nearly doubled since 1991, and numerous broken water meters 
have reduced the amount of collected revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also pointed out that local water fees have not increased in seven 
years and that the rates are currently the lowest among 25 cities in Southeast 
Los Angeles County. The increases will put Lynwood in the top quarter of those 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also plans to cut bus subsidies by 50%, from $150,000 to $75,000, 
resulting in increased fares for bus passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for students would jump from $4 to $12 for those in public schools and 
from $4 to $17 for students in college or vocational schools. Regular passes 
would increase from $31 to $35, and rates would jump from $4 to $7 for senior 
citizens and people with disabilities. JOHN D. WAGNER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; PORT TO SPEND HALF OF BUDGET FOR EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port of Long Beach will spend more than half of its 1994-95 budget to 
build truck overpasses, increase rail access, enlarge a terminal and buy land. 
</P>
<P>
 The $417-million spending plan, approved by the City Council and the Board of 
Harbor Commissioners, allocates $236.5 million for port expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials agreed to spend $60 million on overpasses that will run above 
railways so trains and trucks will not have to stop for one another when 
delivering or removing cargo from the port's seven docks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dockside rail access to the International Transportation Services Terminal 
will be expanded at a cost of $45 million to better accommodate trains. JOHN 
CANALIS

NEW COUNCIL OFF ON A ROSY HONEYMOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A euphoric Long Beach City Council, with four fresh faces and an abundance of 
newfound goodwill, pushed knotty urban problems aside Tuesday and emphasized 
the city's hopes and strengths in a daylong celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Let crime, blight, an anemic city budget and political rivalries surface again 
next week, council members suggested. This day -- on which three new council 
members and a new mayor were sworn in -- was for rosy affirmations of unity and 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to put behind us, once and for all, all negativism and doubts 
about our future," new Mayor Beverly O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taking the oath of office for the first time were council members Jenny 
Oropeza, Mike Donelon and Jerry Shultz. Councilmen Douglas S. Drummond and Les 
Robbins took the oath as reelected incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was clearly O'Neill's day. Dressed in a black suit with a checkered 
scarf around her neck, the ebullient new mayor hugged her colleagues, exchanged 
jokes with constituents and, at every opportunity, lauded Long Beach, her 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill assumes the $86,659-a-year job -- which gives her the authority to run 
council meetings, make appointments to commissions but not to vote on council 
issues -- in the wake of alarming fiscal and social problems in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were born here," she said of herself and her husband, Bill. "But we chose 
to live here. I think we live in one of the great cities of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, the city has experienced large-scale layoffs by its big 
employers, the loss of the Long Beach Naval Station, a doubling of violent 
crime and increasing blight in many of the city's poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we can be sure of is more change," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the city's central location, thriving port and seaside climate, she 
said, the prospects are good for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's events included a reception in front of City Hall and, late in the 
afternoon, a program of jazz, operetta and speeches in the downtown Promenade. 
They also included the regularly scheduled weekly council meeting, with O'Neill 
presiding for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 As its first act, the new council elected Drummond as vice mayor, with Donelon 
joining four self-styled conservatives on the council to edge out Doris 
Topsy-Elvord, the council's only African American, by a 5-4 vote. The largely 
ceremonial position of vice mayor is filled every two years.  
</P>
<P>
 Some observers were watching the vote closely as a possible omen of things to 
come, with the prospect of Drummond and four supporters (Donelon, Shultz, 
Robbins and Jeffrey A. Kellogg) uniting to push though a conservative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon, who describes himself as a moderate independent, insisted afterward, 
however, that his vote for Drummond was based largely on friendship, not 
ideological compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug and I have worked together for many years," said Donelon, who has been 
the president of the California Heights Neighborhood Assn. "He was the first 
one out of the chute in support of my council race. I also like Doris 
(Topsy-Elvord)."

COMPTON COLLEGE PUT ON PROBATION; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS CLAIM INSTITUTION NEEDS 
TIGHTER FISCAL CONTROL AND MORE ADMINISTRATIVE STABILITY BEFORE IT CAN RECEIVE 
ACCREDITATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Education officials have placed Compton Community College on probation, 
jeopardizing the troubled institution's accreditation and its chances for 
public funding.  
</P>
<P>
 College administrators were notified recently by the Western Assn. of Schools 
and Colleges in Northern California that the institution lacked fiscal controls 
and needed more administrative stability before it could be accredited again.  
</P>
<P>
 The findings were made during a series of visits to the campus by association 
representatives last year and will delay the college's accreditation renewal 
until the problems are resolved, said John Peterson, the association's 
executive director.  
</P>
<P>
 College administrators have until January -- when the accreditation commission 
meets again -- to show improvement, he said. An interim report outlining how 
college administrators plan to resolve the problems is due next month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, accreditation team members reported that the college had 
not yet instituted the fiscal procedures recommended by the association last 
year. Recommendations included imposing tighter controls on the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in public funds the college receives each year.  
</P>
<P>
 A "climate of antagonism and factionalism" was also found on the campus, 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The college still has very serious problems, especially the relationship 
between the governing board and (President Byron Skinner)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the board voted unanimously last year to hire Skinner, the 
relationship between him and some board members has been fractious, campus 
sources said. Many believe Skinner has not acted quickly enough in making 
hiring decisions, said one instructor who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said, however, the disagreements between him and some board members is 
not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of strain and we have had some difficult times, but we 
are starting to reach an accord," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said the accreditation team was satisfied with the quality of 
instruction on the campus. "They have wonderful students and a great faculty," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The western association evaluates and accredits more than 150 two-year 
colleges in California and Hawaii. Member colleges are evaluated every six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time Compton College has been put on probation since it was 
accredited in 1952, Peterson said. Compton was one of four campuses put on 
notice this year, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The action culminates nearly two years of administrative and financial 
scandals that began with a 1992 Department of Education report 1992 that 
uncovered questionable expenditures of public funds at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 The report led to an audit showing college officials had misspent nearly 
$500,000 in grants intended for low-income students, had hired relatives to 
work at inflated salaries and did not use sound accounting methods to keep 
track of the funds. Several key administrators were dismissed or demoted after 
the audit was released. Former President Warren A. Washington was removed from 
his job and is now an instructor on campus.  
</P>
<P>
 College officials expressed dismay over the probation, which Peterson said 
could threaten future funding from the state and federal government. Public 
funds provide nearly 80% of the college's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The association issues an annual report to funding agencies, listing which 
colleges have been placed on probation, Peterson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Skinner, who took over in November, said he is working with board members to 
solve the problems. He has hired two vice presidents, one to direct academic 
affairs and the other for business affairs. Both are expected to arrive in 
August, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Board member Kent Swift said he is sure the college's accreditation would be 
renewed in January, but said he was concerned that the probation status might 
affect future funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, college officials are negotiating with federal education officials 
who are asking for at least a partial repayment of the $500,000 they believe 
was misspent at the college from 1989 to 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said he has assigned an administrator to re-examine the 1992 audit 
that confirmed many of the Education Department's allegations that funds were 
misused.

ALL IN THE FAMILY; CROSSING BORDERS AND GENERATIONS, CASTILLOS WORK TO KEEP 
BOND ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 One of Long Beach's oldest Mexican American families gathered for the 32nd 
year at a Long Beach park Saturday to celebrate what they share -- and what 
they don't.  
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Castillo family members filled rows of picnic tables as long and 
wide as a Boeing 747 . Toddlers and children spilled onto the grass, where they 
shrieked and played and chattered, nearly always in English. Some of the 
younger Castillos speak no Spanish; others, like Maura Castillo's section of 
the family, were born in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Maura Zamarripa Castillo, 29, a Cal State Long Beach graduate and daughter of 
a bracero , or field worker, visits her family in central Mexico annually and 
says she would only marry a Mexican. But her cousin, Long Beach social worker 
Olivia Castillo Pohl, 44, has never been beyond Baja and married an Irishman. 
"I don't think I even ever dated one Mexican," Pohl said. "It's not that I 
didn't like them. But the blonds were always cuter."  
</P>
<P>
 But even if their tastes in sweethearts differ, Pohl said, the Castillos share 
a fierce sense of pride in who they are. "To Mexicans," she said, "the family 
is No. 1."  
</P>
<P>
 For many of the older family members, the annual trek to the family reunion is 
the end of a long, hard journey that took them from poverty to a place where 
their children are college graduates with professions, Mexican restaurants and 
middle-class lives.  
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Castillo, at 78 the oldest of the Long Beach clan that now has nearly 500 
members, reigned as patriarch Saturday. The youngest was 1 month old, a 
fifth-generation American of a family whose roots originate at the end of a 
dirt road in the hardscrabble ranches outside the Mexican city of San Luis 
Potosi. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Castillo's father was one of nine brothers and sisters who left Mexico in 
1915 during the revolution, when Pancho Villa stole the family's most precious 
possession -- their horses -- Lupe Castillo said. They went to Texas, where 
they heard tales of abundant land, crops and work in the fertile fields of 
Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 They arrived in Long Beach and discovered farm work would not feed the family, 
so the brothers took jobs laying the city's sewer system. One of the brothers 
bought a bungalow on East 14th Street and raised a family there. The house 
still stands, but it is no longer in the Castillo family; Jose Castillo traded 
it long ago for land in Durango, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Long Beach, family members now live in Texas, Arizona, Southeast Los 
Angeles, Orange County and scattered about the farms and ranches near San Luis 
Potosi. The last of the original nine brothers and sisters died three years 
ago, said Norma Fernandez, who was elected as Castillo family president last 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 The granddaughter of one of the original nine, Fernandez, 45, was chosen to 
run the family at last year's dinner-dance, the other annual family function.  
</P>
<P>
 As president, Fernandez orchestrates the family's many operations, from 
picnics, parties and collecting dues ($40 a family), to softball games, 
fund-raisers and charity drives to provide food, clothes, roads and medical 
supplies to San Luis Potosi.  
</P>
<P>
 The Lakewood Castillos are the most recently arrived from Mexico, and the most 
connected to it. They constituted a small, Spanish-speaking pocket at the 
picnic, surrounded by English speakers and a growing number of blond Castillos. 
Alejandrino Castillo, 45, had just returned from delivering an ambulance to El 
Rincon, near San Luis Potosi, donated to the community by the American 
Castillos and members of Club San Luis Potosi, formed to help the family back 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 Alejandrino Castillo returns frequently with donations; his dream is to 
finance the paving of the road that leads to the farming town where about 50 or 
60 of his Mexican relatives still live. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Alejandrino Castillo's immediate family live in Lakewood, and a few 
more arrive from Mexico every year, he said. "When the children grow up to 
become teen-agers, the parents let them come and stay with the family here," he 
said. "They usually end up living here. That's why the family here is so big." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they live in the United States, a part of their soul remains in 
Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His niece, Maura Castillo, agreed. "I was born in a little town an hour and a 
half from the paved road," she said. "There was no water, electricity or 
toilets. My mom and dad worked in the fields. My dad knew that would be our 
life if we stayed. That's why we came. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us had to leave Mexico not out of choice but out of necessity -- for 
a better life, for a future for the children," she said. "My father had a 
third-grade education. Here, the children had the opportunity to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Maura Castillo's father supported his six children as a 
migrant farm worker. Today, Maura is a sales executive with a health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big reason why we get together like this," she said, "is to keep what is 
Mexican. That is the tradition we bring from Mexico. To teach the children our 
culture. The true heart inside me stays Mexican," she said. "That is never 
going to change."

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; SCHOOL BUDGET REDUCES STAFF, INCREASES BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state administrator appointed to run the Compton Unified School District 
has approved a budget for next school year that cuts funds for paying employees 
but increases spending for books and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrator Jerome Harris also passed a five-year plan for the troubled 
district to repay nearly $20 million in state loans. The plan includes reducing 
staff by attrition or possibly by layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget increases spending for supplies by 1.5%, from $6.7 million 
to $6.8 million. The funds include $400,000 for new books. Funds for teacher 
salaries will decrease from $53.1 million to $51.4 million.

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK; PLANS FOR HINDU TEMPLE APPROVED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two years after it first rejected plans by a Hindu congregation to 
build a temple, the City Council this week approved a vastly redesigned place 
of worship. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.2-million temple will be built at the corner of Pioneer Boulevard and 
Ferina Avenue, and will look much like a Spanish mission, complete with curved 
archways and red tiles.The original design, turned down in 1992, included 
elaborate Hindu carvings and other elements of a classic Hindu temple, said 
Natoo Patel, a congregation spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to make a lot of concessions, but we wanted to show that we could be 
good neighbors," Patel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation bought the property in 1991 for $630,000. A dilapidated 
building on the site will be demolished to make room for the two-story temple, 
Patel said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA; SCHOOL BOARD ORDERED TO HOLD AN ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a month after the Norwalk-La Mirada school board appointed a new member, 
the district has been ordered to hold an election Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member David H. Cosper's appointment was terminated last week 
after the Los Angeles County registrar's office determined that 719 valid 
signatures are on petitions calling for an election.Only 694 were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosper, 43, replaced former school board member Jesse M. Luera, who was 
elected to the Norwalk City Council in April. Cosper had been in office for 
little more than a month when he stepped down.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he would not relinquish his seat without a fight. On Monday he was the 
first person to file his candidacy for the school board. Candidates have until 
Aug. 12 to file election documents.

HOPING TO SHINE AT SHRINE; APPEARANCE IN ALL-STAR GAME BRINGS SENSE OF ELATION 
TO WHITING, BUT TEAMMATE MAGEE FEELS MOSTLY ANGER AFTER MURDER OF NEPHEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As a ball boy, Brandon Whiting watched Leonard Russell of the New England 
Patriots, Mark Carrier of the Chicago Bears and Charles Miller of the 
Indianapolis Colts make their way through the Long Beach Poly High football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night at Citrus College, the 6-foot-2, 265-pound Whiting will 
follow the footsteps of past Poly standouts when he plays in the 43rd annual 
Shrine All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a dream of playing in it all my life, and I've seen it play a big 
part of a lot of players' careers," said Whiting of the Shrine game, which 
serves as a fund-raiser for the Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children and 
features 64 of the best recently graduated high school players from California. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting, a defensive lineman who will attend Cal, will be joined on the South 
team by Poly teammate Danjuan Magee, who decided to play despite the murder 
last week of his 9-month-old nephew, Laron Harris Jr. The UCLA-bound linebacker 
has dedicated the Shrine game to his nephew and his cousin, Laron Harris Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel angry," said the 6-2, 250-pound Magee. "It's a crazy world 
and life can be taken anywhere to anybody in your family. It's been a gut 
check." 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting and Magee were the cornerstones of a Poly defense that led the 
Jackrabbits (10-2) to their second consecutive Moore League title and 
quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division I playoffs last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year starters were named Moore League co-defensive players of the 
year and selected to the Southern Section Division I first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee, who was also chosen to the All-Southern Section team, consisting of 
players from all 11 divisions, led Poly with 100 tackles. He also had seven 
deflections and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting, whose father Thomas is Poly co-coach, had 50 tackles and four sacks 
despite missing a game because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter what position we played," Magee said. "As long as we were on 
the field together, we got the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting and Magee have been roommates in the weeklong South training camp at 
Cal Poly Pomona. But the ties between the players run deeper than their four 
seasons of football at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were also classmates at Mark Twain elementary school. Magee left to 
attend a private school after the fourth grade, but neither player recalls 
meeting until the first day of freshman football practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know certain people he knows and he knows people I know, but we don't 
remember each other," Magee said. "I definitely remember (Whiting) during the 
summer before our freshman season. I was about the third-biggest dude, but he 
was the biggest dude." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the focus was on both players as college recruiters came 
calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee attracted the attention of Arizona, Cal, Colorado, USC and Washington 
but opted for the Bruins to stay close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting, who had a 3.8 grade-point average and scored more than 1,200 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test, was recruited by more than a dozen universities, 
including Colorado, Nebraska, UCLA, Washington and Washington State before 
narrowing his choices to Stanford and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, it was fun getting all the attention," Whiting said. "But when they 
called more than once a week, it kind of got in the way of homework and social 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Whiting, his father, who has coached at Poly since 1981, was 
acquainted with the recruiting process and helped ease the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally knew most of the recruiters, and they had called me about other 
players in the past," the elder Whiting said. "We would talk for about 30 
minutes and then they'd ask, 'By the way, is Brandon home?' I'd say yes and 
then they would talk to him for another 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Whiting won't be under the watchful eye of his father at Berkeley, but he 
won't be far from family. His grandmother and several cousins live nearby in 
Whiting's birthplace of Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get homesick, I can always visit," Whiting said. "I wanted to stay on 
the West Coast; I didn't want to go too far." 
</P>
<P>
 But the limits for Whiting, a ball boy turned football player, have yet to be 
reached.

 Foster care -- A story in Wednesday's editions of The Times about Los Angeles 
County's settlement of a child abuse lawsuit did not fully describe two awards 
in similar cases involving the county. A 1989 case resulted in a $7-million 
award, but insurance covering the foster parents accused of abuse in that case 
paid all but $1 million.In 1990, a judge reversed a $5.5-million award against 
the county and other defendants. The county eventually settled the case for a 
far lower amount that remains confidential as part of the settlement. In the 
settlement at issue in Wednesday's story, the county agreed to pay $1.95 
million to two children abused while they were foster children, and to a 
half-sister who witnessed their mistreatment.
