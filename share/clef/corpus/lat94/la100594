 Talk about ancient history: Sports fans are familiar with the so-called Sports 
Illustrated Jinx, which holds that personalities featured in the magazine 
invariably suffer setbacks afterward. A similar curse seems to have struck UCLA 
Historian, a school newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover boy of the Spring, 1993, issue was L.A. Kings President Bruce McNall, 
who was listed as "Distinguished UCLA Graduate." The now-bankrupt McNall, who 
may owe creditors as much as $300 million, has agreed to plead guilty to four 
counts stemming from a federal investigation into his banking practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the newsletter, McNall quips that if the History Department had had a 
stronger emphasis on ancient Rome when he was there, "I might have persevered 
(in the doctoral program) and now be an assistant professor or an unemployed 
Ph.D." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McNall ain't all: Two other luminaries saluted by UCLA Historian in the Fall, 
1993, issue have also had problems, though of a lesser nature. Mike Medavoy (BA 
1963) resigned as chairman of TriStar Pictures, reportedly under pressure from 
the studio's parent company, Sony Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 And UCLA football coach Terry Donahue (BA 1966), his team hampered by 
injuries, has lost three of five games this season. And his name was spelled 
Donohue in the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schools for scandal: We mentioned that several grads from West L.A.'s Hamilton 
High are involved in high-profile cases, including Robert L. Shapiro, O.J. 
Simpson's attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 David Tokofsky, a teacher at Marshall High in Los Feliz, points out that his 
school also has some alumni in the legal limelight, including Superior Court 
Judge Lance A. Ito. There's also attorney Mike Nasatir, who is representing 
actress Paula Barbieri, a friend of Simpson's. And there's one well-known 
businesswoman who attended but did not graduate from Marshall -- Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Drama of the year: Consider the elements -- a celebrity is accused of 
murdering a lover during a jealous range in an exclusive section of L.A. Then 
the suspect makes a dramatic surrender before the media as camera crews record 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 We're referring to "Sunset Boulevard," of course. The Billy Wilder movie about 
washed-up silent screen star Norma Desmond reappeared on the stage last 
December as an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. 
</P>
<P>
 It's somewhat surprising that, in the current climate, no one has thought of 
concocting a sequel to the movie: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunset Boulevard: The Trial." 
</P>
<P>
 We bet they'd never hang a conviction on Norma. After all, as we recall, the 
shooting in "Sunset Boulevard" had no witnesses. miscelLAny Four years ago, men 
in frontier garb staged a mock holdup of an Agoura Hills bank to promote a Pony 
Express Days event. An alarmed onlooker phoned L.A. County sheriff's deputies, 
who dispatched four patrol cars. "I don't know why someone would be so stupid 
to think it was a real robbery. . . ," one of the organizers said. "There were 
a bunch of people in antique costumes with antique guns and a whole lot of 
photographers all around taking pictures."

SALE OF WITNESS, JUROR STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know about you, but I sure feel much better now that Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown and state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) have made it illegal 
for witnesses to accept money from the media for their knowledge in regard to a 
pending case (Sept. 27). You know what would happen don't you -- give the 
little people a dollar, and they would proceed to sell their mother, brother, 
sister, cousin, etc. I think the very idea behind the measure (now law) is 
insulting. The truth is the truth, no matter how it is said, how it is arrived 
at, or when it is said, or if there is money paid for the sharing of that 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the courthouse (except the witnesses) are paid to search for the 
truth. All are well paid; some are paid so much it leaves the realm of 
believability, yet no one questions the morality of their motives. Why do this 
to witnesses? Why is the standard different for them? Does the veracity of an 
individual need legislation to be kept intact? 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason is that the public in aggregation is not very cohesive. It is 
easy to pass law in this area because integrity is something the "little 
people" will not argue against; however, we do have the ability to judge an 
argument on its merits rather than its dollar value. Thank you very much!

part of our legal system. Obstructionism has become an art form. A system 
designed to efficiently seek the truth has become a theater where the desire 
for truth has been subordinated to winning at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal community should hang its heads in shame. Instead of serving 
society, they have become an organization of self-service. As long as the money 
stream continues to flow, attorneys will do everything in their power to hide 
the truth. Greed and hubris have replaced service and edification. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way that anyone could justify the absurd legal gymnastics taking 
place in our courtrooms. At its best, it is parody. At its worst, it is fraud. 
The simplest of minds can see that a once-proud profession has become a 
brotherhood of self-service. 
</P>
<P>
 If the public doesn't curtail this insanity, we will not long be an ordered 
society. Society has to take some of the responsibility. It has allowed a few 
elitists to debase the "common law."

ICON OF AN IDEALIZED PAST; HARRIET NELSON'S DEATH IS A REMINDER OF MODERN 
FAMILY PLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," the popular old television show, 
portrayed the ideal family of the 1950s. The death this week of the highly 
respected Harriet Nelson provides a sad reminder of the fading of the 
traditional two-parent family. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the show, as its late co-star herself often emphasized, was intended 
as entertainment, not as a documentary on American family life. But her death 
reminds us anew that the two-parent family is close to becoming the exception 
rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a majority of American children, only 50.8%, now live in a nuclear 
family -- and that figure is expected to fall further unless some dramatic and 
fundamental change can be achieved. Unwed mothers get much of the blame in 
political rhetoric and bear most of the stigma. Divorce, however, is also a 
major contributor. William J. Bennett, a writer, a conservative and a former 
federal drug czar, recently pointed out the lack of stigma attached to wealthy, 
older men leaving their first wives and children for a younger wife. Bennett, 
speaking last month to a convention of the religious right, argued that the 
damage of divorce is worse than the damage that some Christian fundamentalists 
have attributed to homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Marital breakups (the majority of U.S. marriages don't last) sometimes are 
benign; some are actually in the best interest of the children. However, many 
divorces push families into poverty. And though children raised by single 
parents often excel, statistically they are more likely to drop out of school, 
have trouble finding work and to become single parents themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, Harriet Nelson's parents separated. The "good old days" weren't 
good for everyone. But 40 years ago most children lived with both parents, like 
in "Ozzie and Harriet." Times, alas, are changing.

MEDICAL WATCH; LIVING LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reginald and Margaret Green of Bodega Bay, Calif., set out on a vacation to 
Italy with their 7-year-old son, Nicholas, and 4-year-old daughter, Eleanor. 
Only three of them will return alive.Nicholas was fatally wounded by a gunshot 
to the head during a robbery attempt against the family on an Italian highway. 
</P>
<P>
 In their grief, the Greens have left the Italian people an unusual legacy. 
Nicholas' heart is now pumping in the body of a Roman boy; his liver is in a 
Sicilian woman; one kidney is in a girl from Puglia, and the other in a 
Sicilian boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Organ donations are rare in Italy. The country has one of the lowest organ 
donation rates in Europe -- six donations per year for every 1 million 
inhabitants. "In Italy, half of those who could agree to donate organs don't -- 
with predictable consequences for those waiting to be saved," said Carlo 
Marcelletti, a transplant surgeon in Rome. He added that the Greens are an 
example Italians should follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greens, who through their lifesaving decision embraced people unknown to 
them, offer a lesson in selfless giving. Amid heartbreaking loss they bore no 
bitterness; in a time of family darkness they manifested a spirit of caring and 
sharing. "I would have liked him to live a long time," said his mother. "Now I 
wish the same thing for his heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Green's life was senselessly extinguished. But through parts from his 
body four other lives have been extended. Nicholas, at the end of his brief 
years, stands as a symbol of the need for organ donations throughout the world.

WISE CLIMB-DOWN, BAD VETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is small comfort to know that although Gov. Pete Wilson has refused to bar 
California police departments from selling firearms they confiscate from 
criminals, the U.S. State Department did rethink its foolish plan to allow 
importation of Russian pistols. We close off one source of guns yet permit them 
back onto the streets from another. This is madness. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the Clinton Administration floated a proposal to let Russia export 
to the United States a large number of semiautomatic pistols. Russia would be 
allowed to peddle its guns here and in exchange would slow or stop its sales of 
warplanes, tanks, submarines, missiles and other military weaponry to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the states of the former Soviet Union were heavily restricted 
in selling guns to American importers; last year, a mere 18,000 firearms were 
imported from these nations -- "mere" in comparison to the 7.6 million that 
otherwise might have been imported. "Mere" in comparison to the 212 million 
firearms already in the hands of American civilians. This reckless idea, 
thankfully, died of its own weight.  
</P>
<P>
 But what of the cash-strapped police and sheriff's departments that sell 
confiscated guns to the public rather than destroy them? These programs live 
on. The practice has been widely criticized, rightly so at a time when many 
communities are trying to reduce the number of weapons through buyback 
programs. (The latest such effort is an imaginative though ripe-for-satirizing 
program that exchanges guns for psychotherapy; a group of Contra Costa 
psychologists is offering three hours of free therapy to anyone who turns in a 
firearm.) 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's rationale for his veto is flawed. The bill would not have kept 
criminals from stealing guns, he said. Of course it wouldn't. But because they 
steal guns from lawful owners, fewer guns in circulation would mean fewer to 
steal. Conversely, as the number of armed criminals grows, law enforcement 
agencies become ever more pinched for cash. This vicious -- and deadly -- cycle 
has to be stopped. A bad call, governor.

BREAST CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the editor of Mother Jones magazine, and the author of the breast cancer 
article in Mother Jones that your media critic, David Shaw, criticized on Sept. 
13, we would like to correct a few of his misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw contends that there is no breast cancer epidemic. His subhead announces 
that "the facts suggest that early diagnosis and a larger population are behind 
the increase." Such a statement demonstrates that Shaw has only a slight 
acquaintance with the research on breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger-population argument is ridiculous. Disease statistics are always 
expressed in terms of cases (or deaths) per 100,000 population, specifically to 
prevent population growth from distorting the numbers. The breast cancer rate 
has increased approximately 26% since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the impact of early detection, the largest and most methodologically 
rigorous study contradicts Shaw. That study, by Emily White Ph.D., concluded 
that mammography explained most of the observed increase in breast cancer for 
women over 45, but only half the increase in younger women. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the increase in the breast cancer rate? There is no smoking gun. But a 
thorough reading of the epidemiological literature turns up a possibility that 
looks at least like a loaded gun -- pollution by things like dioxin and 
organochlorine pesticides that have effects similar to estrogen, a hormone 
well-known to stimulate the growth of breast tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw is quick to cite one study, released last spring, showing no association 
between pesticide exposure and breast cancer risk. But the co-authors of that 
study point out several reasons why dismissing a link is premature. One is that 
compared with earlier studies, which did suggest a link, theirs included an 
unusually large proportion of Asian women, who are known to have a relatively 
low breast cancer risk. Remove the Asian women from the subject pool, and the 
data shows an association between pesticide exposure and breast cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Shaw neglected to mention another study released around the same 
time that showed a clear association between breast cancer risk and the 
distance women live from chemical plants on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The message of the Mother Jones article was that a potentially productive line 
of research has, to date, been given short shrift. As a magazine that goes out 
to activists, Mother Jones often alerts opinion leaders to issues that the 
mainstream media have either ignored, or in the case of Shaw's article, 
trivialized.

WILSON AND BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the commentaries, "Bringing California's Schools Into the 21st 
Century," by Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown, Sept. 21: What Wilson did not 
describe is how his budgets for public education have affected both our schools 
and local government. For three years, Wilson has decreed that there is no 
inflation.With actual inflation running between 2.5% and 3%, the effect after 
those three years has been a cut of over 8.25% in per-student spending. When 
Wilson became governor, California already ranked in the bottom third of the 
states in per-student expenditures. That situation has become worse. Only one 
other state has a worse class-size problem. 
</P>
<P>
 To compound the fiscal straitjacket he forced onto our schools, Wilson has not 
even been honest in providing those limited funds for education. Although the 
voters, Legislature and courts have all determined that funding our public 
schools is a state responsibility, Wilson has repeatedly funded the schools by 
diverting local property taxes rather than eliminating loopholes in state 
taxes. The result has been closed libraries and fire stations along with 
several counties on the edge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID E. ROSS

<P>
 * I see where Brown wishes to mandate yet another emergency stopgap 
educational program to add to the ever-growing list of similar taxpayer 
boondoggles. "JobReady" proposes to teach reading and math skills to high 
school students in preparation for the job market. Isn't that what the schools 
are teaching already? 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, JobReady is on an individual "choice" basis. Does this mean that 
a student need not choose? And if a student's choice is negative does this mean 
that he/she will remain in a non-reading, non-math full-time school 
environment?

CRASH LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I thought there was some provision against frivolous lawsuits, but after 
reading "Parents of Suspected Vandals Who Died in Crash Sue State" (Sept. 24), 
I must be mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that the parents of these graffiti vandals should be allowed to sue 
the state for $80 million is disgusting and wrong.Thank God, Christopher 
Hiddleson, a Department of Transportation lawyer handling the state's defense 
said, "That just doesn't seem right." 
</P>
<P>
 In yet another example of people refusing to accept responsibility for the 
actions of themselves or their families, these leeches, goaded on by a 
contingency fee-seeking attorney, attempt to remove money from the wallets of 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Use our taxes for legitimate causes -- education, transportation, public 
safety -- but do not waste a dollar of our hard-earned money dignifying 
ridiculous, deceitful and frivolous lawsuits. Also, let all costs associated 
with dismissing these frivolities be borne by the plaintiff's lawyer.

DECENT WAGES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH; GOVERNMENT MUST HELP MINORITY BUSINESSES, 
WHICH TEND TO BE IN RETAIL AND SERVICE RATHER THAN MANUFACTURING.

 Mayor Richard Riordan knows what it takes to keep small business in Los 
Angeles; witness his recent success in persuading a Venice ceramics firm not to 
leave the city. But stopping the exit of business must go beyond such personal 
appeals to a long-term economic strategy. This is a formidable task, since 
between 1991 and 1993, Los Angeles County lost more than 100,000 jobs and the 
L.A. unemployment rate hovers at 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategizing for quality job growth is rarely tackled by Republicans, who view 
government as the nemesis of private business, creating bureaucratic mazes that 
prevent entrepreneurs from risking capital. Also, it's easier to attack the 
bureaucracy than to develop collaborative strategies to enhance the mutual 
interests of businesses and workers. Yet without moving forward on this latter 
point, any job growth will not result in stabilizing the community. Los Angeles 
must have job growth accompanied by a steady increase in real wages so that 
everyone benefits from the mayor's business plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan does have the leadership skills that will allow him to move beyond 
partisan politics to create jobs. Indeed, much of Riordan's success comes from 
his ability to take ideas from both parties and mold a consensus that disarms 
critics because of its balanced view. This strength could easily allow him to 
develop a game plan for job growth that goes beyond streamlining government, a 
mantra that may win elections but provides little hope for most Angelenos, who 
depend on wage income. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to stimulate quality job growth is to use the tax system to reward 
entrepreneurs who provide those jobs. Riordan could work with the governor to 
support such a plan. A good model would be the one proposed by Kathleen Brown's 
campaign, the job tax credit for business. This innovative program would 
provide companies with tax incentives for each new job that pays $17,600 to 
$60,000 a year; it would reward businesses that commit to quality jobs for 
Californians. Another Brown proposal that bears consideration is her 
"California First" recommendation, which provides established California 
companies with a competitive edge over other bidders for public projects.  
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also must develop quality jobs in the inner city. The future economic 
stability of the city is linked to stimulating small business to stay rather 
than move to the suburbs. Here Riordan must focus on further developing 
opportunities for both existing and new minority entrepreneurs. Much of the 
growth within the minority-business sector is in retail and services, 
reflecting the national trend. A profile of Latino businesses from the recent 
census indicates that more than half are in retail and service sectors. Latino 
businesses in Los Angeles County provide about a half a billion dollars in 
annual payroll.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many of the tax strategies that have been developed do not 
benefit the majority of Latino entrepreneurs, as the emphasis has been to 
provide tax breaks for manufacturing rather than service and retail. This needs 
to change. Here again, Brown has proposed providing direct tax relief to 
minority entrepreneurs, something that Riordan should consider. Brown's 
California Start-Up Business Tax Moratorium allows a new business to pay no 
taxes on income generated during its first year, with a gradual four-year 
phase-in to complete tax liability. This policy rewards entrepreneurs for the 
high risk they take during their first years and moves in the right direction 
in not targeting manufacturing.  
</P>
<P>
 Riordan understands small-business needs, but now he must address the needs of 
those workers who have suffered the brunt of California's recession. He must 
also develop a focused plan for minority entrepreneurs, as they will be key to 
the revitalization of the Los Angeles economy. In an era when it is politically 
popular to degrade immigrants and ignore the working poor, Riordan must select 
strategies that benefit all Angelenos. The city's economic growth will be 
rooted not in corporate America, but in small businesses and workers.

AN ELEGY FOR NICHOLAS, THE ROBIN HOOD OF BODEGA BAY; A SPIRITED 7-YEAR-OLD 
LOSES HIS LIFE AND YET LIVES ON IN BODY AND IN SPIRIT. FOR HIS AUNT, IT 
REDEFINES 'SENSELSSS TRAGEDY'.

<P>
 Halfway around the world, the valiant heart of young Nicholas Green beats in 
the chest of a 14-year-old Roman boy, but our Nicholas lives in the many hearts 
he touched during his 7 short years of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The first child of my sister Maggie, my first nephew, the first grandchild, 
beloved cousin and playmate of my daughter. Kathryn observed her 6th birthday 
this week inconsolable after the news of the death of her Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of a child is every parent's worst nightmare. I write this for my 
sister and her husband Reg, and for my daughter and my son so they won't forget 
Nicholas when the memories grow dim and the freckled face in the photos seems 
unfamiliar. We will all grow old, but Nicholas will forever be 7. 
</P>
<P>
 I can hear his voice even now, echoing through my mind as he shouts commands 
to his little sister Eleanor and his cousin. "El! I need my soldiers in their 
barracks . . . Kathryn, I'm Robin Hood and you are Maid Marian, and El is too." 
Everything Nicholas did was infused with conviction and resolve. He organized 
and oversaw the games of childhood with authority, sweeping the others along in 
his powerful wake. Even my Kathryn, ever strong and defiant, would willingly 
play Maid Marian to his Robin Hood and follow his grandiose schemes building 
castles in the sand.  
</P>
<P>
 Telling Kathryn that her beloved older cousin's life was stolen by bad men 
thousands of miles away was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. She 
sobbed, body shaking, gut-wrenching sobs. Tears poured down her cheeks in 
torrents as her father held her on his lap. As she cried, I wondered how much 
she would remember of Nicholas as the years passed, and I mourned that my 
2-year-old son Zachary would have no memories at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last summer, we traveled to Bodega Bay to spend time with Reg and Maggie 
while Kathryn and Zachary enjoyed the company of their cousins Nicholas and 
Eleanor. Those memories are seared in my consciousness now.  
</P>
<P>
 When I asked Kathryn what she remembered of that trip just three months ago, 
she replied, "Playing Robin Hood and building sand castles and dancing to the 
music at night." I hope she never forgets those things. We have photographs 
taken at the beach and during a train ride at Sonoma; we don't have pictures of 
Robin Hood and dancing. That is what Kathryn needs to remember, and I want to 
help her. She will always be able to see the pictures in the photo album, but 
the pictures in her mind may fade. When the name Nicholas is mentioned, I don't 
want the first thing she remembers to be that he died at the hands of bandits. 
I want her to remember him as her hero, her Robin Hood, her dance partner, her 
cousin, her friend. For myself, the necessary detachment I've felt at the 
endless parade of death is at an end. Watching television commentators mouth 
empty phrases about some "senseless tragedy" only inspires a hollow rage. For 
the second time in a year, the people of Sonoma County have watched helplessly 
as the shadow of evil fell on their children, killed without rhyme or reason. 
First, Polly Klaas snatched from her own bedroom in Petaluma, and now Nicholas 
Green of Bodega Bay, gunned down as he slept. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad, savage drama played out on that lonely highway in the southern part 
of Italy is not so very distant from the violent death visited on so many 
children in our own cities. The loss of a child is never acceptable or 
sensible. This talk of "senseless tragedy" somehow permits the daily carnage to 
serve as fodder for the insatiable appetites of our blood lust. The death of 
Nicholas has brought this point home to me in a manner as powerful as it was 
unexpected. Although I was cognizant on some intellectual level, in my gut I 
now realize that every sheet-draped body on the evening news represents flesh 
and blood human beings who leave behind grieving mothers, fathers, children, 
aunts, uncles and cousins who ache at the loss of that life.  
</P>
<P>
 In his death, Nicholas was a hero. Maggie and Reg made it possible for his 
passing, like his life, to have meaning. Besides the boy who received his 
heart, a 19-year-old Sicilian woman has new life with his liver. His kidneys 
now purify the blood of a 14-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy. Three 
additional recipients will benefit from his pancreas and his beautiful eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Italy have responded to this terrible tragedy and the ensuing 
generosity of the family with an incredible outpouring of genuine emotion. The 
gifts Nicholas bestowed in death have rightly evoked the gratitude of many. But 
I would trade all their thanks and all their relief to have my nephew back so 
that he could he continue being Robin Hood and dance partner, brother and son 
and grandson, cousin and friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Godspeed, Nicholas. We will miss you.

PASS A GIFT-BAN LAW WITH BITE; ETHICS: LAX RULES CONTRIBUTED TO MIKE ESPY'S 
DOWNFALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN BYCEL, Benjamin Bycel is executive director of the Los Angeles City 
Ethics Commission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did some silly technicality bring down Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy? 
</P>
<P>
 No, the rules that he ran afoul of are plain and simple. If you work for the 
executive branch of government, you can't take gifts from those you regulate. 
Espy took gifts from the food industry, and while there is no proof that he 
took the trips and sports tickets in exchange for more lenient treatment for 
that industry, he clearly violated the gift law. 
</P>
<P>
 How could one of the bright stars of this Administration, someone as 
politically astute as Espy, fail to obey the law? 
</P>
<P>
 Washington insiders offer numerous explanations for Espy's actions. 
Unfortunately, all of them sound similar to a teen-ager's explanation of why he 
got in trouble. Espy's first line of defense was that stories about alleged 
wrongdoing were being spread by Republicans and others who did not want change 
in the Agriculture Department. This is often heard in households across America 
as the "bad guys in school set me up" routine. 
</P>
<P>
 When this explanation didn't work and Espy paid back $7,600 of questionable 
gifts and expenses, he turned to another frequently heard explanation by 
acknowledging that he had been "careless with some of the details of (his) 
personal life." This is better known as the "it's no big deal, the teacher is 
just picky about details" excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Or if that one didn't fly, there is always "my friends let me down." C. Manly 
Molpus, president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America and a friend of Espy, 
suggested that he should have been steered away from the unethical acts by his 
staff. Maybe they did and he just didn't listen. Either way, a feeble excuse.  
</P>
<P>
 But the most provocative explanation was given by one former congressman: "It 
seems as though he behaved as though he was still a member (of Congress)." In 
teen-age lingo, this would be "Hey, what I did was OK at my old school; what's 
the problem at the new one?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is exactly the problem. The rules regulating the behavior of members of 
Congress concerning gifts and other financial favors from lobbyists are weak 
and not effectively enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current House rules, Espy, in his first year in Congress, accepted 
$23,500 for 19 speeches and 22 expense-paid trips. Presumably some of those who 
paid for Espy's talks and travel had business before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But finally some change in the cozy relationship between Congress and special 
interests is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the House voted to reform the lobby-disclosure laws and to 
significantly limit the gifts and other financial favors members and their 
staffs may receive. That would end the popular golf and hunting trips and much 
of the wining and dining that legislators enjoy at lobbyists' expense. Some 
loopholes remain, but as Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the 
public-interest lobby, said, "It's a major achievement in the fight to end the 
practice of special interests paying for the lifestyles of members of 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The last legislative roadblock should be cleared this week when the Senate 
votes on the bill. President Clinton is expected to sign the law, but it will 
be meaningless unless it is effectively interpreted and seriously enforced. 
While a new office in the White House will have some responsibility for 
enforcing the law, the congressional ethics committees have principal 
responsibility for enforcing the new gift ban provisions. Unfortunately, they 
do not have a strong track record when it comes to being tough on their own 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, if they had, bright, energetic young leaders like Mike Espy would have 
taken the rules of his new office more seriously.

THEATER REVIEW; 'TENT SHOW': SPEAKING OF VICE AND MEN; JUSTIN TANNER'S LATEST 
WORK EMPLOYS HIS FAMILIAR SKILLS -- THE DIALOGUE OVERLAPS AND FLOWS LIKE A 
DREAM -- AND THE ENGAGING DRAMAS ARE EXACERBATED BY THE CHARACTERS' DRUG 
DEPENDENCIES.

 "The Tent Show," the new play by the boy wonder of L.A. theater, is Justin 
Tanner's take on "Deliverance." It's about men: Men on a camping trip, men 
pretending to bond, men dragging the rat race of corporate life right into the 
wilderness, where they all agree it doesn't belong. While no one is asked to 
squeal like a pig, they nervously assure each other that "it's a good thing 
we're all secure about being guys." The play is alternating in repertory at the 
Cast Theatre with eight other works by Tanner, the complete canon. For anyone 
who cares about fresh voices on the stage, this festival is not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tent Show" is a bit of a departure for the playwright -- it's set away 
from the low-rent apartments where the women toke and watch "I Love Lucy" in 
"Pot Mom," where a grease-stained Barbie comes home from the graveyard shift at 
the doughnut shop and bickers with Ken in "Still Life With Vacuum Salesman," 
and where a naive girl encounters the roommate from hell in "Bitter Women." As 
always, the dialogue overlaps and flows like a dream, and the heated dramas are 
hilarious, engaging, familiar and yet absolutely original. And, as is often the 
case, those dramas are exacerbated by the characters' recreational drug 
dependencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with "The Tent Show" is that men don't seem to interest the 
playwright as much as women do. At least, they don't seem to contain the 
endless possibilities for surprise and redemption that make Tanner's female 
characters so delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well. "The Tent Show" is still the work of a gifted playwright doing what 
he does best -- mischievously letting people reveal their real selves while 
building elaborate constructs of how they would like to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 The guys on the camping trip are Doug (Tony Maggio), who owns the nice tent 
and who would like to be lord of the manor both there and at L.A. Title, the 
company where the men work. He doesn't want anyone touching his new Land Rover 
or wasting the batteries on the TV, phone or "lantern" he's brought along. But 
he consents to share the tent with Jeff (Mark Ruffalo), his nearest equal, even 
though Jeff is in trouble at work. Nothing big, just embezzling to support a 
coke habit. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two guys will have to sleep outside. Unforgivably, Walter (Jon 
Palmer) has allowed his righteous spirituality to intrude on guy fun. Charged 
with supplying food and drink, Walter, a proselytizer for a self-realization 
seminar called "Truth Quest," has chosen to bring soybean hot dogs and 
nonalcoholic beer. To Jeff, this constitutes a "horrendous, (expletive) 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 And Billy (Jon Amirkhan), well, Billy is just hopeless. A mere mailroom 
employee, Billy has been invited only because several other guys dropped out of 
the trip, after some kind of firing bloodbath at the company. Doug orders him 
about like a servant, specifying what Billy may and may not touch in the tent. 
Even the ostensibly enlightened Walter treats Billy with contempt, saying 
things like "Peon or not, you're part of the whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Billy is a bit slow. His attempts to express a rhapsodic connection 
to nature engender about as much respect as his salary. "I love seeing animals, 
you know, in person," goes one of his odes. As Billy, Amirkhan is a master at 
letting his face fill up with hope and then fall tragically with each fresh 
rebuff from his supposed betters. But his bounce-back ratio is quick, and he's 
always ready to feel the pain of a new insult. 
</P>
<P>
 Bounce-back ratios are high in Tanner, as are unexpected shifts in the power 
structure. The rivalries and divisions intensify with the arrival of a stray 
camper named Julie (Laurel Green), who seems interested in Billy until he 
utters the words mail room . Green, the only actor who appears in all nine 
Tanner plays, here offers a slightly harder variation of the utterly 
transparent, silky voiced phony she usually plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Tanner's direction, the rest of the men never sentimentalize 
fundamentally unlikable characters. Amazingly, they're all fascinating without 
being either likable or unusual in any way. As Bernadette, the tough-talking 
secretary who gets a big charge out of all the office intrigue, especially if 
her boss is getting screwed, Thea Constantine is almost as funny as she is in 
"Bitter Women," and that's saying quite a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting to see Tanner work with characters who care about the rat 
race and get caught in it. I would guess he sides more with Billy, who one of 
the men accurately likens to the fool on the cliff. When offered advice on 
improving his career, Billy says he doesn't want to climb, he just wants to 
hang. But one gets the sense that, whether he wants to or not, Tanner is about 
to do some major climbing.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; REZNOR'S THRILLING BATTLEFIELD OF THE MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the great things about a Nine Inch Nails concert is that almost 
everyone in the audience will take a deep breath at some point -- out of either 
exasperation or sheer excitement. Trent Reznor, the band's leader, will settle 
for no less. 
</P>
<P>
 The easily offended may not have made it past the opening act on Monday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre before wondering just what they had gotten themselves 
into. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the novelty value of naming itself after a dead screen siren and 
one of the most notorious men of the century, Marilyn Manson is pretty much 
your old-fashioned, crude 'n' rude rock entry. Its T-shirts proclaim "Kill God 
. . . Kill Your Mom and Dad . . . Kill Yourself," and the group's lead singer 
walked around during one song with a fake penis dangling from his shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who dismissed Marilyn as silly kid stuff, however, may have 
squirmed during the next act -- the Jim Rose Circus. This rock version of an 
old carnival sideshow was part of the 1992 Lollapalooza tour, and was then 
fascinating on a "How far will they go?" level. But on second and third 
viewing, the routines are tedious, even when a man swings a concrete block from 
a chain attached to his nipples. 
</P>
<P>
 All this foreplay may be Reznor's idea of pushing the boundaries of his young 
audience's experience, but it offers little warning of the intoxicating scope 
of his own talent. He is the most exciting blend of musicality, vision and 
theatrical instincts to hit the pop scene since Prince more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before making an appearance Monday (the first of four nights at 
Universal), Reznor set the stage by having strobe lights flash behind the thin 
curtain, like the nighttime explosions you see in war movies and newsreels. 
</P>
<P>
 The image worked because the themes of Reznor's tenacious, guitar- and 
synthesizer-driven music focus on a battlefield of the mind, employing angry, 
violent lyrics to address issues of insecurity, self-destruction and doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a black T-shirt and cut-offs, Reznor didn't just deliver the songs, he 
attacked them, knocking over equipment and even members of his four-piece band 
in a sometimes frightening effort to drain every lingering trace of emotion out 
of himself and the music. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to show that he doesn't need the spotlight to bring the songs to life, 
Reznor and the band played two songs while standing behind a screen, on which 
scenes of death and despair were shown. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the dark, sometimes startling edges, Reznor's finely crafted songs are 
neither a celebration of nihilism nor aimless expressions of youthful Angst . 
Even the strongest among us cry out for something or someone to believe in 
during an age in which many have lost faith in everything from religion to the 
family. Whether leaping into the pit in front of the stage or howling the words 
with an intensity that was closer to screaming than merely singing, Reznor is a 
wonderfully intuitive performer who seems to be searching for new ways to touch 
the audience every minute he is on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails' performance at Woodstock '94 was as spectacular as any of the 
legendary sets at the original Woodstock, and Monday's performance confirmed 
that it was no fluke. For all the antics of the opening acts, Reznor was the 
one at the Amphitheatre who ultimately did take your breath away -- and he did 
it simply with talent. 
</P>

 * Nine Inch Nails appears Thursday and Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre, 
100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m. $29. (818) 980-9421.

 'Lost' Masterpieces Found: After years of government-enforced silence, 
Russia's State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg has acknowledged that it has 
been holding a major trove of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist 
paintings that have not been seen since the end of World War II, the New York 
Times reported Tuesday. The paintings, which were taken from German private 
collections by Soviet military authorities at the war's close and were widely 
believed to have been lost, include more than 70 works by such renowned artists 
as Degas, Cezanne, Toulouse-Lautrec, Monet, Renoir and Van Gogh. The paintings, 
which for decades remained a strictly guarded state secret, will be exhibited 
at the Hermitage in March, with a comprehensive catalogue published at the same 
time in English by Harry N. Abrams. Although the Hermitage has not yet 
identified many of the paintings, the show is said to include a Degas 
masterpiece, "Place de la Concorde," which is constantly reproduced in books 
with the annotation "Missing. Believed destroyed," and Van Gogh's "The White 
House at Night," which the artist finished six weeks before his death in 1890. 
The Hermitage's director, Mikhail Pyotrovsky, told the New York Times that the 
museum had not yet addressed the question of returning the paintings to Germany 
and said that the issue was "a legal question to be debated in court."

 Major Endowment: Dance historian and former Balanchine dancer Nancy Reynolds 
has established a $1.75-million endowment for the New York-based George 
Balanchine Foundation, with a stipulation that the funds be used to research 
and document the famed choreographer's achievements through methods including 
multimedia CD-ROM presentations. Reynolds, who was named the foundation's 
director of research, will also lead an effort to retrieve Balanchine's lost 
ballets, possibly for public performance, and has specified that additional 
funds be used to compile a video archive of noted Balanchine dancers talking 
about their great roles, thus passing on their firsthand knowledge of the 
choreographer's ideas. Balanchine died in 1983 at age 79. POP/ROCK

 Stones Tour Breaks Record: The Rolling Stones' current "Voodoo Lounge" North 
American tour on Tuesday became the highest-grossing concert tour ever, 
surpassing the $103.5-million record set earlier this year by fellow rockers 
Pink Floyd. That gives the Stones two of the three highest-grossing tours ever 
-- the band's 1989 "Steel Wheels" tour grossed $98 million. There was no word 
Tuesday on what the dollar figure meant in terms of the number of seats sold. 
The highest priced seats on the current 60-date, 43-city Stones tour cost $50, 
while they went for a top price of $30 in '89. Pink Floyd's tickets sold for up 
to $75. The "Voodoo Lounge" show will stop at the Rose Bowl Oct. 19 and 21 and 
conclude Dec. 18 in Vancouver, Canada. TELEVISION

THEATER REVIEWS; 'MOTHER, DAUGHTER' SUFFERS AT COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Black comedy is a hard proposition to pull off. The genre relies upon 
alienation, dread and the ever-present threat of violent death to make its most 
salient -- and humorous -- points. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, black comedy is a cautionary fairy tale for adults about the very 
human wolves lurking in the modern-day urban wilderness. Whether abstract or 
didactic, good black comedy has plenty of laughs to leaven its lacerating 
social satire. 
</P>
<P>
 At its worst, black comedy, with its heightened reality and farcical 
overtones, is an excuse for poor characterization and sloppy plot structure. 
Barra Grant's "A Mother, a Daughter and a Gun" at the Court is such a black 
comedy, a disappointingly unfunny play about the twisted dynamic between a 
daughter and her mother. The play contains frequent and ear-splitting gunfire 
as sporadic as its plot, in which an assortment of eccentrics perform 
increasingly random acts in furtherance of some nameless objective, which 
remains, at evening's end, the playwright's mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the production, including Grant herself, and director Jenny 
Sullivan, have impressive track records. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one of the few operatives to escape the general mayhem unscathed is 
Don Llewellyn, whose ingenious sets, despite some opening-night glitches in the 
scene shifts, received richly deserved applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the seasoned cast, Sarah Ann Morris and Richard Zavaglia manage to 
transcend their material. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; PUPPETS LITTLE HELP FOR 'ARABIAN NIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Shahrazad & the Arabian Nights," one character dismisses the classic story 
collection as "a Western book that corrupts people's minds," and then quickly 
adds, "I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such ambivalence is the key to this spinoff by the Kanaaqeel Theater Company 
in Santa Monica of "The 1001 Nights" -- it is more deconstruction than 
adaptation of the famous text. 
</P>
<P>
 Creators Ismael Kanater and Tamadhur Al-Aqeel obviously admire the tales' 
strong sense of enchantment, which they try to enhance with masks, dance and 
shadow puppets. Yet, distrusting the book's integrity as a Middle Eastern 
artifact, perhaps rightly, they recast the narrative as a complicated 
tale-within-a-tale with an awkward political moral. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a muddled evening at Powerhouse Theatre of too much telling and 
not enough showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanater, who also directed, plays a prisoner who tries to avoid torture by 
telling stories to his sadistic captor (Jamie Hanes). The prisoner's plight 
mirrors that of Shahrazad (Al-Aqeel), the crafty princess who deferred her own 
execution by spinning tales for an evil king. 
</P>
<P>
 The company uses shadow puppets to act out two of these tales, a fable about a 
hunchback and a bawdy story about a porter and three girls. Puppets can be a 
fascinating mode of presentation, but in this case the novelty quickly wears 
off. The puppeteers (Linda Campanella Jauron and Lynn Jeffries) fumble visibly 
behind a white scrim, each botched quick-change complicating the viewer's 
suspension of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here, the original stories are almost beside the point. More important is 
the notion of the storyteller as politically oppressed artiste , a point 
hammered home in the long-winded prison scenes that bog down the play's second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach would be easier to take if the show made a richer connection 
between politics and art -- or chose tales with political undertones. But, as 
it is, the link between repression and art feels forced and artificial, 
especially when the play ends with a rather curious appeal on behalf of the 
"storytellers" of Bosnia, Rwanda, Northern Ireland and other world hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shahrazad" would have done well to borrow a cue from its legendary namesake: 
To enthrall your audience, tell a good story. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Shahrazad & the Arabian Nights," Powerhouse Theatre, 3116 2nd St., Santa 
Monica. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sunday, 2:30 p.m. Ends Oct. 30. (213)

TV REVIEW; 'GATO' ADAPTS WELL TO THE SMALL SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manuel Penella Moreno's "El Gato Montes" (The Wildcat), taped during a live 
performance in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion by Los Angeles Music Center Opera, 
works in some ways even better on the small screen than it did in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide and shallow sets, imported from the Teatro Lirico Nacional la 
Zarzuela in Madrid, tended to make the dramatic action and confrontations look 
diffuse in real life. Here, however, they are remarkably concentrated by Gary 
Halvorson's close-ups and tight framing shots, although it does take a while 
for his nervous camera work to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest worry -- how the bullfight sequences originally projected onto an 
onstage scrim would look on the small screen -- proves unwarranted. The 
projections work just fine, even if they do allow a too-early glimpse of the 
torero hero Rafael (Placido Domingo) getting ready to pull down the red curtain 
that signals his death by a bull's goring. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Domingo emerges a hotblooded, intense and even conflicted character, 
and his voice blossoms with bright ardor. 
</P>
<P>
 As Solea, the woman caught in the love triangle between Rafael and Juanillo 
(the "wildcat"), Veronica Villarroel projects anguish with nuance and clarity, 
while her big, dark, sometimes rough-edged, soprano soars. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Justino Diaz, despite obvious vocal wear and tear, evokes sympathy as 
Juanillo during his final vigil over Solea's body. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the familiar cast enacts their responsibilities strongly. 
Emilio Sagi directs knowingly. Miguel Roa conducts with authority, and the 
Music Center Opera Orchestra responds boldly. 
</P>
<P>
 The structural problems in the work remain problematic, however. The first act 
is disproportionately long. None of the three main characters survive the 
opera, and two of them are dead before the final scene. Rafael gets only a 
short outburst when he dies. Solea dies of grief during the intermission 
without even the dignity of a parting aria. Juanillo's death, at least, comes 
at a dramatic moment. But resolution of the tangled emotional conflicts remains 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 * "El Gato Montes" screens as part of the "Great Performances" series at 9 
tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28. The performance will be simulcast on KUSC-FM 
(91.5).

 MEDFLY EMERGENCY: As the count climbed for the number of Medflies found in 
Camarillo, Ventura County authorities declared a state of emergency and farmers 
braced for a quarantine (B1). . . . The county is still recovering from its 
last emergency, declared after the Jan. 17 earthquake. . . . Farmers weren't 
widely affected by that disaster. "We've been lucky up to this point," Deputy 
Agriculture Commissioner David Buettner said. "Our luck just finally ran out." 
</P>
<P>
 THICK SKIN: He's not taking it personally, but Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) has been slighted twice recently by Democrats. . . . First, a letter 
from Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown to the congressman about the Ojai 
weather radar tower began: "Dear Congresswoman." Then Gallegly got a letter 
from the White House about the GATT agreement -- but it was unsigned. . . . 
"There's no question that there's a lot of confusion in the White House these 
days," Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
 MAMMOTH TV: Coming to a small screen near you, thousands of years in the 
making -- it's the Channel Islands very own pygmy mammoth. . . . The skeletal 
remains of the Ice Age creature with the oxymoronic name were unearthed after 
being buried for up to 75,000 years on Santa Rosa Island. The mammoth's 
excavation will be recounted tonight in a KCET documentary at 7:30 p.m. "It'll 
take people right to the site," said Carol Spears, spokeswoman for Channel 
Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 SWEPT AWAY: The last time that Oxnard was hit with one was around 1812. . . . 
So after a warning from state officials that a tsunami -- triggered by a deadly 
earthquake in Japan -- could be headed their way (B1), officials activated the 
city's Emergency Operations Center. . . . Department heads huddled to come up 
with a readiness plan, including evacuations and shelters. Luckily, the threat 
petered out. . . . It was a new drill for Police Chief Harold Hurtt, formerly 
of Arizona. "We didn't have too many of these in Phoenix," he said.

MORNING BRIEFING: RULE MAKES IT THROUGH BERTKA PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the proposed NBA rule changes, which are being voted on today and 
Thursday at the Board of Governors' meeting in New York, is that illegal 
screens will be called more closely by officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a rule Laker assistant coach Bill Bertka has been lobbying for, 
completely unofficially, since 1971 when he was on Bill Sharman's staff. On 
numerous occasions every game, Bertka yells, "Moving pick!" to the officials as 
he sits on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 He is unsure how many times he has shouted his trademark phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've stopped counting," Bertka said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one thing of which Bertka is certain, though. The new rule should be 
called the Bertka rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess if you holler long enough, somebody hears you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What NBA team has won at least 37 games in a season a record 20 
times? 
</P>
<P>
 That old Oregon trail: If USC loses to Oregon State on Saturday in Corvallis, 
it will be the first time since 1957 that the Trojans have lost to both Oregon 
schools in the same season. USC was 1-9 in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad field position: As it turns out, the longest drive involving either the 
Falcons or the Rams happened before their 8-5 snoozer Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' bus driver got lost on his way to Anaheim Stadium and a 10-minute 
trip took an hour and 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, that'll work: Cracking down on violence, the NBA plans to change the 
fine for technical fouls from $100 for the first and $150 for the second to 
$500 for each one. Do you think the players can afford it? The average NBA 
salary is only $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnstiles: For what it's worth, 23,701 watched Bishop Amat defeat 
Bakersfield in a high school football game Saturday at Bakersfield College. The 
Ram-Falcon game Sunday afternoon at Anaheim Stadium drew 34,599. 
</P>
<P>
 Still kicking: Under the headline "Soccer in U.S. Appears Headed For Great 
Year," a newspaper story began: "American soccer . . . is heading for its 
greatest season in history, according to an announcement by the U.S. Soccer 
Assn." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper was "Stars & Stripes." The date was Dec. 4, 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 They owned him: If Rick Dempsey eventually becomes a major league manager, 
don't look for him to hire Jim Gantner as his base-running coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Every member of Dempsey's family with professional baseball experience has 
thrown out Gantner: Dempsey, brother Pat, son John and nephew Greg Zaun. John 
and Greg caught the former Brewer second baseman trying to steal while Gantner 
was on a minor league rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: From Dallas Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer after Cleveland Gary signed 
with the Miami Dolphins instead of the Cowboys: "It's no different than 
recruiting. Somebody outbid us, I guess." THOMAS BONK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For too many years, there has been a mass exodus of Southern California high 
school basketball stars to universities across the country. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now take a look at the top three rushers in the weekly NCAA football 
statistics. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's Rashaan Salaam, from Country Day School in La Jolla, is No. 1. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Napoleon Kaufman, from Lompoc High, is No. 2. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska's Lawrence Phillips, from Baldwin Park High, is No. 3. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Salaam was such a force at Country Day, averaging 13 yards a carry his senior 
year, that he made most prep All-American teams although the small private 
school plays eight-man football. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman scored 86 touchdowns during his career at Lompoc, second on the 
California all-time list to Russell White's 94 at Encino Crespi. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Phillips rushed for 1,752 yards his senior year at Baldwin Park and was rated 
the ninth-best high school player in the West by a national recruiting analyst. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Salaam, a junior, was so unhappy after his freshman year at Colorado that he 
almost decided to transfer to Cal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He is averaging 181.7 yards rushing a game, Kaufman 167.5 yards, and Phillips 
157 yards. The entire USC team is averaging 118 yards and UCLA 139 yards. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 USC hasn't lost to Oregon State since the Beavers handed O.J. Simpson and 
company their only defeat of the 1967 season, 3-0, at Corvallis. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Trojans will be trying to rebound from their first loss to 
Oregon at the Coliseum since 1971. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The old, antiquated Coliseum scoreboard at least posted total first downs.The 
new, antiquated one doesn't. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 ESPN has the best game on the tube Saturday, Florida State at Miami at 4:30 
p.m. . . .

<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Madden believes Philadelphia's week off was a big help to the Eagles 
before their victory over San Francisco. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two other teams coming off byes, Arizona and Dallas, also won, but the New 
York Giants lost. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers miss Warren Moon more than they do Buddy Ryan. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You have to wonder how long San Francisco 49er quarterback Steve Young, a 
scrambler working behind a patchwork offensive line, can avoid a serious 
injury. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest accomplishments by a local high school team in years was 
La Puente Bishop Amat's 34-3 triumph over Bakersfield on Saturday. The Lancers 
showed uncommon poise during their runaway victory on the road before 23,701. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Tommy Maddox and a young Gail Goodrich. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Bettman is the best thing that ever happened to John Ziegler. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Chadwin, a frequent contributor to L.A. Weekly, has written a book, 
"Rocking the Pond: The First Season of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim," published 
by Polestar Press Ltd. of Vancouver. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly the entire Mighty Duck team will participate in the club's first golf 
tournament, a benefit for Disney GOALS on Monday at the Tustin Ranch Golf Club. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Has there ever been a less significant six-player trade than the one made 
Monday by the Kings and the Toronto Maple Leafs? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The local NHL season was supposed to open tonight, the Detroit Red Wings 
playing the Kings at the Forum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is no truth to the rumor that Ken Burns' next epic will be "Hockey." . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon is featured on the cover of the "Official NBA Guide" and 
Patrick Ewing on the cover of the "Official NBA Register." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman is still big at the box office. One month from his fight 
against Michael Moorer at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, all $600 ringside seats 
have been sold and nearly all $50 tickets in the peanut gallery are gone. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Ruelas brothers don't like to fight on the same card, but Rafael and 
Gabriel will defend their titles on a show in January at either the Grand 
Olympic or MGM Grand. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Why do ring announcers wear tuxedos? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sam Rubin, owner of John Henry, has donated memorabilia from the legendary 
race horse's career to Santa Anita. It will be on display in the John Henry 
Race & Sports Room, part of the track's new Baldwin Club that opens today. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 When Dal Maxvill was fired by the St. Louis Cardinals, Fred Claire, who 
replaced Al Campanis in April of 1987, became the general manager with the 
longest tenure in the National League. . . .  
</P>

 Brian Cooper of Glendora mailed me his tickets to the Dodgers' "Fan 
Appreciation Day," which was scheduled for last Sunday, and wrote, "I do not

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; FREDRICKSON WINS A STARTING SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Rob Fredrickson arrived in Oxnard for training camp in July, he had 
already lost some time and his position. But he never lost sight of his goal -- 
the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson, the team's No. 1 draft choice out of Michigan State, reported 
nine days late because of contract negotiations. An outside linebacker in 
college, Fredrickson was being asked to move to the middle to back up 
second-year man Greg Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Fredrickson said with a laugh, "When I got to Oxnard, I set a goal 
of wanting to know what the hell I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't take long. Four games into the season, Fredrickson has realized 
his original goal, moving into the starting lineup where he feels most 
comfortable -- on the outside. The 6-foot-4, 240-pounder will take over for 
Aaron Wallace on the left side. Wallace will be used on the defensive line in 
pass-rushing situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come a long ways since I got here," said Fredrickson, who is thrilled to 
not only be starting, but doing so at his old position. "I've always played 
outside. I think it comes more natural to me, the reads and everything. It was 
always a strain for me to adjust to the inside." 
</P>
<P>
 How does he envision his new role? 
</P>
<P>
 "Provided I don't screw up?" he said with a smile. "I always thought I was the 
caliber of player to start. I always thought I was worthy of the No. 1 pick the 
Raiders made. Now I just have to go out to prove it, prove it to everyone and 
prove it to myself."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson has earned his new spot, but the move shouldn't be viewed as a 
demotion for Wallace. Just the opposite. The best pass rusher among the 
linebackers, he is being moved up to provide more power to a defensive line 
that has proved embarrassingly ineffective at times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have only nine sacks in four games, with nobody collecting more 
than two. Anthony Smith, who had 36 sacks over the previous three years as a 
situational player, has only one in his first four games as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 The line has been disrupted by the two-week absence of Scott Davis and hurt by 
injuries to Jerry Ball and Willie Broughton. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MARTIN RETURNS AT QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams signed quarterback Jamie Martin and will release a player -- most 
likely a wide receiver because of the overload at the position -- today to 
officially make room for him on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, an undrafted quarterback from Weber State who was on the Ram roster a 
year ago as a third-team player, was released after the exhibition season to 
make room for Tommy Maddox.He will be the team's No. 3 quarterback against 
Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller, expected to start against the Packers, threw a number of 
well-aimed and strong 20-yard passes Tuesday with trainer Jim Anderson 
watching. Miller is trying to regain arm strength after suffering a shoulder 
injury against the 49ers two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were off Tuesday, but given Maddox's limited practice opportunities 
one might have expected the team to take advantage of the free day to provide 
him extra work to prepare him as Miller's backup. It didn't happen, however.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier, a leading contender for the Heisman 
Trophy, might be lost for the season after the discovery Tuesday of a new blood 
clot in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hospitalized and Coach Tom Osborne said the 20-year-old junior 
quarterback apparently will stay on blood thinners for three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which means the rest of the season is in jeopardy and doubt for him," Osborne 
told a Lincoln, Neb., television station. "I doubt if he will play any more 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier spent four days in the hospital last month while a clot near his right 
knee was dissolved by enzymes and blood-thinners. The school's medical staff 
said surgery is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clot was discovered when Frazier underwent tests at Bryan Memorial 
Hospital on Tuesday. Frazier had received approval to return to practice this 
week, but that was delayed after he said his leg was still sore.

 Ohio State place-kicker Mike Malfatt pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of 
misdemeanor theft for stealing $445 worth of merchandise from a discount store 
in August. He was given a suspended six-month sentence and placed on probation 
for one year. The athlete also must perform 80 hours of community service and 
pay a $250 fine and court costs.

 After three years on NBC, the Heisman Trophy show is switching to ESPN, which

<P>
 Free agent running back Cleveland Gary, a former Ram No. 1 draft pick released 
by the team in late August and then sidelined by appendicitis, rejected an 
offer from the Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday and signed with the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary was set to sign a one-year deal worth a league-minimum $162,000 plus 
incentives with Dallas, but Miami made a better offer late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary caught a midnight flight to Miami, met with Dolphin officials Tuesday and 
signed a one-year contract that pays $200,000 in base salary with incentives 
that could increase it to more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins wanted Gary as a replacement for tailback Terry Kirby, who is out 
for the year because of a serious knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary returns to Miami, where he was an All-American in 1988 with the Miami 
Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami waived running back Aaron Craver to make room for Gary.

 Pro Bowl safety LeRoy Butler of the Green Bay Packers said he will lobby the 
coaching staff and medical personnel this week to let him play Sunday against 
the Rams even though he is not fully recovered from the illness that left him 
hospitalized for eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just anxious to get out there and get some things done," Butler said. 
"This year we haven't had any fun. There's no dancing, no talking. It's just an 
ordinary team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers fell to 2-3 Sunday when Matt Bahr's wobbling, 33-yard field goal 
with four seconds left gave New England a 17-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get some spark here and I think as soon as I get back, I'll 
provide that," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Ron Wolf said the team's medical staff will evaluate Butler 
this week and make a recommendation. He said there was no way Butler would play 
if doctors felt there was a risk of injury. * 
</P>
<P>
 New York Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason, recovering from a sprained ankle, is 
listed as questionable for the upcoming home game against Indianapolis. Backup 
Jack Trudeau was 28 of 46 for 288 yards, threw two interceptions and a 
touchdown and was sacked twice in a 27-7 loss to the Cleveland Browns last 
week.

 California (2-2) has turned its season around after losses to Western Athletic

 Ryan Longwell punted, and San Jose State's Dee Grayer blocked the ball. Matt 
Clizbe, playing on the outside, grabbed the ball on one bounce and, while 
everyone wondered what to do, ran 62 yards to give Cal a 28-0 lead in the first 
half of a game it won, 55-0. 
</P>
<P>
 According to college rules, a ball can be advanced by the punting team if it 
is recovered behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Coach Keith Gilbertson wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called an official over and asked," he said. "I said, 'pretend I don't know 
a thing about football. We just had a blocked punt and scored a touchdown. Tell 
me how we did that.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I know you don't know anything about football. I've seen your team 
play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The official might have seen Cal's game against Hawaii, in which the Rainbows 
scored twice after blocking Cal punts.

 Former UCLA defensive back Tommy Bennett was sentenced to 300 hours of 
community service and given three years probation in Superior Court of West Los 
Angeles after pleading no-contest to charges of making a false financial 
statement and grand theft. His case now goes to the office of the Dean of 
Students for campus action before going to the athletic department to consider 
reinstatement in the football program.

 Linebacker Jeff Ruckman said he will probably ask UCLA coaches to redshirt 
him. Ruckman, a sophomore who played extensively as a fullback as a freshman, 
injured his back in a preseason scrimmage and has been undergoing therapy 
since. He apparently felt a new pain Tuesday while working out on his own. JIM

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; SECONDARY LAPSES COSTLY IN DEFEAT 
</P>

<P>
 In addition to dropped passes (six) and a premature departure from its running 
game Saturday, there were some lapses in USC's young defensive backfield in 
Saturday's 22-7 loss to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan defensive coordinator Don Lindsey pointed to two big Oregon plays, a 
49-yard touchdown run by Dino Philyaw and a 71-yard Tony Graziani-to-Josh 
Wilcox pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the 71-yard play, the guy catches the ball seven yards beyond the line of 
scrimmage," Lindsey said. We didn't cover him properly at the snap, then two 
guys missed tackles on the receiver 20 yards downfield. On the 49-yard run for 
the touchdown, we missed a tackle just past the line of scrimmage. And our 
pursuit angles were very poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our secondary players are young, and young kids make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 USC started a senior, junior, sophomore and freshman in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, referring to the poor coverage on the 71-yard pass play, said he'd 
stress better secondary communication before the snap this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I can't fault our defense for in the Oregon game is effort," he 
said. "They really played hard. We just have to work harder at eliminating 
mistakes. We knew when the season started this was a young group, but it hasn't 
developed as quickly as we'd hoped." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Robinson said junior tailback Leonard Green, sidelined since training camp 
with a hamstring pull, might play Saturday at Oregon State. And freshman guard 
Phalen Pounds' arthroscopic knee repair last week will keep him out longer than 
expected. It was hoped Pounds would miss perhaps two games, but now he is not 
expected back until late in the season. . . . Oregon State Coach Jerry 
Pettibone, on USC's loss to Oregon: "They didn't play anywhere close to the 
kind of game they're capable of playing." EARL GUSTKEY

PACIFIC 10 FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; TOP DEFENSES STEAL THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget about all those quarterbacks the pro scouts are supposedly drooling 
over. The game in Pacific 10 Conference football this season is defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The new catch phrase to describe college players, who are potential pros, 
especially quarterbacks, is Sunday player, good enough for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, two quarterbacks lauded as Sunday players have gone 
down to shocking defeats because of defenses they were unable to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 First, UCLA's heralded Wayne Cook was overwhelmed by Washington State's 
defense. Although it was not an unknown quantity, nobody expected the Cougars 
to shut down Cook and the Bruins so thoroughly that they couldn't score.  
</P>
<P>
 But there was absolutely no indication that an Oregon team that had given up 
104 points in four games against opposition that included Hawaii and Portland 
State, could hold USC and Rob Johnson to one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although due praise was given to sophomore Tony Graziani, who played a fine 
game in his college debut as the replacement for another top quarterback, Danny 
O'Neil, it was the Ducks' defense that accounted for the major upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Johnson went out with a sprained ankle, it appeared that the Ducks' 
combination of blitzes and tenacious pass defenders had him completely 
befuddled. He was sacked seven times, threw an interception, and gained only 
237 yards with 20 completions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Graziani passed for 287 yards, the Trojan defense wasn't that bad, 
yielding only one touchdown. It's that Oregon's defense was superb. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Ducks blitzed often and had pressure on the passer, they were 
able to contain Shawn Walters and the running game that blistered Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters rambled 27 yards on the game's first play but gained only 51 more 
yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losses to Hawaii and Utah, the Ducks are in the Rose Bowl chase. 
</P>
<P>
 They will send their newfound defense into Pullman on Saturday, to take on 
Washington State. The Cougars finally gave up a touchdown at Tennessee and were 
knocked out of the unbeaten ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But with players such as DeWayne Patterson, Chad Eaton and Ron Childs charging 
at him, Graziani might not be as cool as he seemed against the Trojans. After 
all, the Trojans are last in defense, the Cougars first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really get a chance to enjoy our victory," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks 
said. "We had to start thinking about the Cougars. Arizona gets the publicity, 
but it's the Cougars who lead in all the defensive categories. This will really 
be a test for Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cougars have struggled on offense, but their defense can score. It has 
accounted for 38 of the Cougars' 64 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "And don't forget, one surprise reverse for 62 yards is the only touchdown 
scored on Washington State all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't move the ball on the ground, we're in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who have a favorable schedule that has them playing Oregon, 
Arizona and Washington at home, aren't taking the Ducks lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just finished watching the Ducks chew up USC," Washington State Coach Mike 
Price said. "It was amazing. That old fox Rich really had his kids ready to 
play. They wanted that game. We better be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, the winner of this game is 2-0." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback who has jumped well ahead of the rest in the West is Steve 
Stenstrom of Stanford. The senior from El Toro turns in one outstanding 
performance after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Notre Dame won handily, Stenstrom made a real game of it for a half. 
He controlled the ball for 22 of the first 30 minutes with his passing, but 
Notre Dame led, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish, never worried about the run, went after Stenstrom as if there were 
a bounty on him and still couldn't contain him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although defenders were harassing him from every angle, he appeared to have a 
touchdown on the first drive on a short pass to wide-open Justin Armour. But in 
an unusual call, it was ruled that a Stanford receiver -- not the pass catcher 
-- was guilty of offensive interference because he bumped a defender while 
running his pass route. The replay showed that defender wasn't even close to 
Armour. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next drive, Brian Manning dropped a sure touchdown pass and later 
dropped another pass on the five. Three touchdowns might have made it tough for 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the dropped balls, and the all-out blitz, Stenstrom completed 37 
of 59 for 360 yards and two touchdowns. He has passed for 1,260 yards in four 
games and, despite heavy pressure has thrown only two interceptions. With 45 
yards against Arizona State this week, he will break the Pac-10 record for 
yards passing. It is 9,393 by Erik Wilhelm of Oregon State in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona is still unbeaten, ranked sixth in the nation and is the favorite in 
the Rose Bowl race. But Coach Dick Tomey is not happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go to get where we want to be," he said. "We are 
not playing as hard as I want. The guys are working hard, though, and we may be 
getting there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats will play host to unbeaten Colorado State (5-0), Saturday. Tomey 
figures the game should get his team ready for the tough league schedule to 
follow.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: GEESE HAD BENEFITED FROM BREEDING GAINS -- UNTIL 
NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ducks and geese have benefited from improved breeding conditions, but they 
might also feel the sting of what seems a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of outstanding duck production in recent years, the California 
Department of Fish and Game has persuaded the federal government to relax 
strict measures designed to protect waterfowl in their drought-related decline 
a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The DFG sought, and got, slight increases in bag limits and hunts for geese 
for the first time in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have experienced two good years of duck production in prairie duck 
breeding areas and many waterfowl species have increased substantially," said 
Terry Mansfield, chief of DFG wildlife management. "It is appropriate to 
cautiously relax regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 California's waterfowl seasons are divided among five regions. The statewide 
bag limit has increased from four birds daily, eight in possession, to five 
birds daily and 10 in possession. The exception is the Colorado River Zone, 
where limits remain the same but where hunters will have 10 extra days to shoot 
and will be allowed to kill white-fronted geese for the first time since 1988. 
Throughout California, hunters will be able to shoot Canada geese -- with a 
limit of one -- for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the DFG isn't entirely satisfied. It had hoped for even higher limits 
and longer hunts, based on what it calls "sound biological reasoning" and 
called the federally imposed regulations "very conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck season opens Friday in the Colorado River Zone and Saturday in the 
Northern Zone, but most openers -- including in the Southern Zone, which 
includes Southern California -- begins Oct. 22. Most goose seasons open on or 
after Oct. 22.  
</P>
<P>
 Booklets detailing the number of each species allowed in each limit in each 
zone are expected to be available Oct. 10. 
</P>

<P>
 It's fall and it has been raining, but the ocean is still warm and the tuna 
are beginning to bite with consistency.  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's overnight fleet, operating south of the border, is reporting 
counts of yellowfin tuna into the thousands regularly for the first time all 
year, and even L.A. Harbor landings are getting into the act, catching tuna in 
U.S. waters 80 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers aboard the First String out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing bagged 116 
during a two-day trip that ended Monday and the Islander out of 22nd St. 
reported similar success. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Kern River Fish Hatchery, which had been scheduled for closure by the 
state, is getting a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Senator Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) said an agreement has been reached with the DFG 
-- which said it was closing the hatchery for economic reasons -- to keep it 
operational. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic benefit to the community and the rest of Kern County in keeping 
this hatchery open far outweighs the savings to the state," Maddy said.  
</P>
<P>
 The DFG's announcement to close the hatchery, providing a savings of $115,000 
a year, resulted in a public outcry among Kern County residents. They said they 
would suffer an economic blow because the decline in local fisheries would lead 
to a loss in tourism and fisheries-related revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was an agreement that will reportedly maintain current stocking 
levels of 95,000 pounds of fish a year and the development of a plan to reduce 
DFG staff and utilize volunteers at the hatchery. 
</P>

 The big marlin, the blacks and blues, continue to make waves off Cabo San 
Lucas. The largest of the week: a 580-pound black caught by Cabo resident Mike 
Godfried. A 430-pound blue was caught as well, and there were many catches in 
the 200-300-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Larry Edwards of Lemon Grove's Cortez Yacht Charters, the U.S. 
representative of the Gaviota Fleet, many of the fish are now being taken on 
the Pacific side of the Baja Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said that Malibu's Jim Rapf, owner of the yacht Rapfsody, called from 
the cape to report losing an estimated 600-pound blue marlin that ate a dorado 
he was fighting on 20-pound test. A fisherman on Rapf's boat reportedly fought 
the marlin for three hours before the line broke.

 For the first time, the Marina del Rey Halibut Derby -- one of two local 
annual halibut tournaments -- will be conducted in the fall rather than spring. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event, which benefits Boy Scouts of America and other youth groups 
and conservation projects, will be held Saturday and Sunday in Santa Monica 
Bay. Fishing begins at 5 a.m. Saturday and ends at 5 p.m. Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is open to private boaters, but Marina del Rey Sportfishing's 
Betty O and Redondo's Sea Spray will cater to non-boat owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is $35 for the derby and $60 for the derby and banquet. Details: (310) 
822-7090.

 A large black bear is reportedly doing fine after falling into a well late 
last week in a small town in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to one official, freeing the bear "was like pulling a cork out 
of a champagne bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 The bear, estimated at 350 pounds, was pulled from the 30-foot well by a 
tow-truck equipped with winch and harness. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a DFG news release, the bear "immediately shrugged off his rescue 
harness, pushed over a wire fence and lumbered off into the woods."  
</P>
<P>
 Mona Hardson, owner of the property in Weaverville, called wildlife officials 
after hearing "clicking sounds" in her out-of-service well, which she plans to 
fill.

FISHING REPORT: BIG CATFISH COULD NET $100 PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They aren't pretty, they are neither sleek nor swift and they spend most of 
their time wallowing in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 But the catfish that will be put into Irvine and Corona lakes this week will 
still be the most popular fish around.  
</P>
<P>
 Both lakes will receive their normal weekly catfish plants, but seven of the 
fish at Irvine and three at Corona will weigh more than 50 pounds apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish will be tagged and if caught, recorded and released, the angler will 
receive a "conservation" award of $100.

VALLEY HIT BY TIDAL WAVE OF GOALS IN VENTURA'S 20-10 WSC VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's Western State Conference water polo opener against Ventura, 
Valley Coach Bill Krauss accurately predicted the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should kill us," he said."They are really loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (12-0), ranked fifth in the state, routed Valley, 20-10, giving its 
reserves plenty of pool time. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandre Martins, Pedro de Lima and Ethan Nondholm each had three goals for 
the Pirates. De Lima, who moved to Ventura from Brazil in 1993, was the state's 
top scorer as a freshman and again leads the state with 68 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Martins, a freshman and former Brazilian club teammate of de Lima's, ranks 
fourth in the state with 51 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that everyone played and shared the scoring today," Ventura 
Coach Larry Baratte said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was also good to play different people in different settings." 
</P>
<P>
 Valley stayed close for only a quarter before the Ventura scoring machine 
broke open a 4-3 game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates went on a 5-1 run in the second quarter, with Martins and de Lima 
each scoring two goals and Andy Bruininga also beating Valley goalie Serjik 
Armiryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley's Mark Stempniak, a freshman from Glendale High, had a career-high six 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Armiryan made 15 saves for Valley (0-12).

<P>
 SPORT: Tennis 
</P>
<P>
 YEAR: Sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Stunova, 15, was visiting the United States this summer 
and liked it so much she decided to stay. Stunova, ranked No. 2 among 
16-year-olds in her native Czech Republic, is an exchange student at Rio Mesa 
and has made an impact for the Spartans.She has won 11 sets without a loss. 
"She has a cannon," Rio Mesa Coach Steve Worthington said of Stunova. "I'm just 
amazed how she can generate power." 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: The 5-foot-5 Stunova kept Rio Mesa close in a 10-8 defeat to 
Marmonte League favorite Camarillo by sweeping three sets at No. 1 singles. The

SIDELINES; FOOTBALL EXPRESS AND 'DIESEL' TURN IN PERFORMANCES OF NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The boys in the band at Harvard-Westlake High include a quarterback, a 
linebacker and a former defensive end. As one would imagine, the members of 
"Diesel," an alternative rock 'n' roll quartet, can bang some heads. In more 
ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Mike Seid sings and quarterback Derek Lemkin plays guitar. They 
both scramble from football drills to band practice on weekdays, then search 
for weekend gigs after games. The group also includes UCLA student Danny 
Abdelmalak, a former Harvard lineman, on drums and another Harvard student who 
plays guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a mix of everything," Lemkin said. "Everything from rock 'n' 
roll to Bob Dylan to grunge." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good -- in both endeavors. The Wolverines are 2-1-1 after whipping 
Calabasas last week, 56-26. Lemkin was in tune, passing for 243 yards and four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the band recently played at the Whiskey A Go Go on Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lemkin: "If you know any football players who play bass, let me know." 
</P>
<P>
 Slapped back: Chaminade High has a quarterback who doesn't like his number 
being called. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Racius, who calls signals for the Eagles' football team, was ejected late 
in the fourth quarter of Friday's 16-14 loss to Trabuco Hills for delivering a 
head slap to a defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Racius said he lashed out because the player repeatedly taunted him and 
deliberately tried to injure his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept saying, 'Hey, 12. Hey, 12,' " Racius said. "I kept telling him to 
stay away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it will be Racius staying away -- for one game. Southern Section 
rules stipulate an ejected player must sit out the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family: In his first start at fullback for the Cal State 
Northridge football team, Darren Walton scored on a 71-yard run, caught a 
52-yard scoring pass and gained 81 yards in three carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad outing, and especially timely because Walton spent a good deal of 
time before the game excitedly calling friends and relatives with the news he 
had cracked the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 of them showed at the game, forming Walton's own personal rooting 
section. 
</P>
<P>
 Title run: The Thousand Oaks High boys' cross-country team has a chance to win 
a mythical national championship despite losing, 37-44, to top-ranked Kingwood 
(Tex.) in Saturday's Southwestern University Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-ranked Thousand Oaks came close despite the performances by seniors 
Jeff Fischer and Kevin Marsden, who still are recovering from injuries. Fischer 
and Marsden, third and fifth in last year's state Division I championships, 
finished 10th and ninth, respectively. They were more than 50 seconds behind 
fourth-place Keith O'Doherty, the Lancers' top runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming Fischer and Marsden regain form, the gap between them and O'Doherty 
should close and might be wiped out altogether, giving the Lancers a superb 
1-2-3 punch and a great chance at winning their second consecutive state 
Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, it would be up to The Harrier magazine to determine No. 1. Stats  
</P>
<P>
 Since switching positions two weeks ago, Burroughs quarterback Scott Boldvich 
has completed 22 of 41 passes for 282 yards and four touchdowns, and receiver 
Mike Barrett has seven receptions for 117 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Record pace: After 11 matches, Jill Gallegos has 21 goals for the Cal Lutheran 
women's soccer team. With eight regular-season matches left, Gallegos needs 16 
goals to surpass the school single-season record, set in 1991 by Rachel 
Wackerman. Quotebook  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High football Coach Phil McCune, on preparing this week for Hueneme's 
Ronney Jenkins, who has gained 586 yards in his last two games: "I don't think 
anyone looks forward to facing Ronney Jenkins, but as long as you're facing 
him, you have a chance. If you see his backside, you are in trouble." Honors  
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in three weeks, Northridge safety Joseph Vaughn was 
selected the American West Conference defensive player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Ken Freitas, returning last week after missing two games because 
of a sprained ankle, recorded three sacks against Cal State Chico and was 
selected the Matadors' defensive player of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time winner: Valley College quarterback Jim Arellanes was selected Western 
State Conference offensive player of the week -- for the second time in four 
weeks -- after completing 21 of 40 for 340 yards and two touchdowns in a 36-21 
victory over Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal royalty: Setter Heidi Ferguson, a Royal High senior, was selected most 
valuable player in the Royal tournament last weekend after the Highlanders 
defeated Moorpark, 15-4, in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates Diana Detlof and Susan Torst were named to the all-tournament team, 
along with Shelly Crandall of Simi Valley, Lauren Brownson of Louisville, and 
Angela Ramirez and Amy Thomas of Moorpark. Things to Do  
</P>

 Reader file: Steve Due of Inglewood has a question about the Cal State 
Northridge lineman who is allowed to play football despite being charged with 
two counts of attempted murder: "What caliber of athlete does CSUN recruit, .22 
or .38?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles have postponed the remainder of their reunion tour because of 
guitarist Glenn Frey's gastrointestinal problems. Doug Adrianson says other 
band members became suspicious after Frey passed out the following song list 
for this weekend's Rose Bowl concert: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Life in the Gas Pains" 
</P>

space shuttle Endeavour: "Do you think that mosquito is looking out the window 
and saying, 'I'm way too high now'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Argus Hamilton, on the resignation of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy: 
"Friends say that he is as honest as the day is long. Of course, the days are 
getting shorter now." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills, on Espy saying he will resign on Dec. 31: "Not 
because he is guilty, mind you, but because he just prefers being unemployed 
when those Christmas bills start rolling in." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, on the British Army captain who claims to have had an affair with 
Princess Diana: "Queen Elizabeth replied, 'Oh, really? Which regiment is the 
private in?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on the two-week exhibit of Dr. Jack Kevorkian's oil 
paintings in Michigan: "According to one local critic, Kevorkian's artwork is 
OK, but trying to make a living off them would be career suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on Hugh Rodham, Hillary Clinton's brother and a U.S. 
Senate candidate in Florida: "This would a Washington first. Someone in 
Congress who'd take Bill Clinton's phone calls." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The trial: Hamilton, on the new "O.J. Simpson Exercise Video" from Playboy: 
"You walk three steps one way, then turn around and walk three steps the other 
way. Repeat for 16 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, says Leno, Kato Kaelin, O.J.'s freeloading house guest, has 
come out with his own instructional video: "Brentwood on $5 a Day." 
</P>
<P>
 And comedy writer Willy Wood wonders "whether Judge Lance Ito will grant 
Kaelin's request to be allowed to testify from a hammock."

 Reader Don Wallace of Calabasas says his sheltered grandmother, 75, went to 
Las Vegas on a senior citizens' bus tour a few years ago. She had never drank 
alcohol, but had heard relatives talk of highballs and screwdrivers. As she 
stood next to a friend at a casino table, a waitress asked if she wanted a 
drink and waited for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, my grandmother just stammered: "Oh, just bring me a screwball."

LAUGH LINES; DADS HAVE THEIR OWN RULES FOR THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS ERSKINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a tip, kids. Never address your father as "Yo, dude. . . ." As in "Yo, 
dude, seen the remote control?" Try it sometime. If you listen closely, you 
will almost hear his brain implode. 
</P>
<P>
 No, nothing will get Dad's attention so quickly. For one thing, it messes up 
the fragile family hierarchy that has been in effect for thousands of millions 
of years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of this hierarchy, of course, is Mom. Below that is Dad, or as he 
is known in some circles, the vice-parent. Then comes the family dog. Under 
that comes you kids. Addressing the vice-parent as "Yo, dude," threatens what 
little respect and authority he thinks he wields in the family structure. 
</P>
<P>
 It also ticks him off big-time. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst possible place to pull a "Yo, dude" -- besides national TV -- is on 
a long family car trip. As in "Yo, dude, are we there yet?" Besides upsetting 
that delicate familial balance, it interferes with Dad's reading. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, his reading. 
</P>
<P>
 For it is a little-known fact that even as he zooms along at 75 m.p.h., your 
father is probably reading every little sign, truck decal and bumper sticker he 
can get his eyes on. It keeps him alert. It keeps his mind sharp. Mostly it 
gives him something to look at until the next attractive young woman cruises by 
in a convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, aside from the bathroom, the freeway is probably your father's 
favorite reading place. (If you put a toilet in his car, he might never come 
out.) 
</P>
<P>
 My kids discovered this reading phenomenon on a recent vacation. We were 
playing the usual car trip games -- such as "Name That Road Kill" and "Bite 
Your Brother on the Butt" -- when my youngest looked out the window and 
actually read something on a passing road sign (trust me, I saw his little lips 
move). 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, shouldn't 'Stay off the shoulder' be more emphatic?" he asked, using the 
word emphatic for perhaps the fifth time that very morning. "Shouldn't it say, 
'You must stay off the shoulder,' or even 'Keep your stupid car on the road 
already, you big jerk.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted a long discussion on overuse of the word jerk among children we 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 It also made me realize that everybody reads road signs. Not just bored dads, 
not just bored moms, everybody. If we didn't read road signs, we might have to 
talk to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 And we read them despite the fact they are dull. Really dull. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be so terrible if road signs were fun and entertaining? Besides 
directions, why couldn't they contain important personal information -- like 
sex tips and career advice. In a perfect world, road signs would be written by 
Bob Guccione and Ann Landers. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I, who are often mistaken for Bob and Ann, began to discuss the 
possibilities. What if "Do not pass" became "Do not pass . . . but feel free to 
grope the person in the seat next to you"? Or maybe "Speed zone ahead" becomes 
"Speed zone ahead . . . get naked." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the signs wouldn't need to be just titillating, they could also be 
a public service: "Drive defensively" would become "Drive defensively . . . and 
don't forget your wife's birthday." And the ever-useful "Merge" would say 
"Merge . . . but always wear a condom." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the traffic engineers could drop some personal hygiene tips into their 
signs: "Slow traffic stay right . . . and be sure to change your underwear," or 
"Sharp curve ahead . . . brush after every meal." 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe best of all, road signs could alert us to try new things: "Speed 
checked by radar . . . shower with a postal worker." And "Rail crossing ahead . 
. . slow dance with a Pygmy." 
</P>
<P>
 My kids, of course, didn't seem that enthralled about rewriting the nation's 
road signs. They yawned. They fell asleep. A couple got car sick. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only verbal reaction I got came from a tired 8-year-old in the 
very back: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yo, dude, are we there yet?"

BOOK REVIEW / AUTOBIOGRAPHY; RICH STORIES FROM A GIFTED STORYTELLER; THEO:THE 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THEODORE BIKEL BY THEODORE BIKEL ; HARPERCOLLINS $27.50, 448 
PAGES 
</P>

By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 According to actor and folk singer Theodore Bikel, the Prince of Wales was 
circumcised at birth in a proper Jewish ceremony performed by a physician who 
is also a mohel, an accredited expert in Jewish ritual circumcision. 
</P>
<P>
 "All kings are presumed to be descendants of King David," Bikel observes. 
"Hence the insistence on observing a ritually correct bris ." 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of the prince and mohel is told in "Theo," an engaging memoir by 
Bikel. His circle of acquaintances has been so rich and varied, ranging from 
Ben Gurion to the Queen Mother, from Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn to 
Victor Mature and Zsa Zsa Gabor, from Marcel Marceau to Frank Zappa, that we 
are not really surprised to find that he used to hang out with the London 
surgeon who wielded the scalpel on the royal privates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professionally," Bikel writes of himself in "Theo," "I can count three or 
four separate existences." 
</P>
<P>
 Bikel was born in Austria, but his family managed to escape Nazi-dominated 
Europe and the worst of the Holocaust. They reached Palestine in 1938, and 
Bikel's early training as an actor took place on the stage of Habimah, the 
national theater of the Jewish state, and later at the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Art in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Theo Bikel soon found himself performing opposite Vivien Leigh in 
the London production of "A Streetcar Named Desire" under the direction of 
Laurence Olivier. Soon after, he joined the cast of "The African Queen." Over 
the next half-century, Bikel invented himself over and over again as a 
character actor, a folk singer, an impresario, a union activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't bother to look for sex or scandal in "Theo." Although Bikel allows us to 
understand that his bed was not empty, especially during his London years, he 
is always discreet and gentlemanly on the subject. And, anyway, he's more 
interested in the work lives than the sex lives of actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the real allure of Bikel's autobiography is his convincing account of 
the real art and craft of the actor. For example, Bikel describes with both 
authority and good humor what an actor must do to survive -- situations that 
included the perils of seasickness on a sound stage where the rolling of a ship 
was simulated all too accurately, the frantic improvisations that salvaged a 
road-show performance of "Fiddler on the Roof" in a tent during a rainstorm, 
the truly freaky encounter with the Plaster Casters on the set of Frank Zappa's 
"200 Motels." 
</P>
<P>
 Bikel comes across as a well-trained actor and a well-read man, an urbane and 
civilized performer. His stories are tinged with ironic humor and a profound 
sense of history, as when he describes how refugees from Nazism frequently 
ended up in swastika-bedecked uniforms in assorted Hollywood war movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a cook in the U-boat galley whose accent came straight out of the 
Yiddish theatre on Second Avenue," Bikel writes of "The Enemy Below," a movie 
in which he played a German submarine officer. "We had a Czech navigator and a 
Serb radar officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bikel is bluntly honest about himself and his work. He concedes that his 
facility for foreign accents has resulted in career-long typecasting as "the 
poor man's Peter Ustinov." When Bikel quotes from the reviews of his 
performances, he includes the pans as well as the praise. And he confronts what 
appears to be the key moral dilemma of his life -- Bikel did not return to his 
homeland in 1948 when Israel declared its statehood and fought for its 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few of my contemporaries regarded what I did as a character flaw, if not a 
downright act of desertion," Bikel concedes. "In me there remains a small, 
still voice that asks whether I can ever fully acquit myself in my own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many seasoned actors, Bikel has been forced to content himself with less 
than stellar roles, especially in recent years. But he betrays no bitterness 
when he reminisces about a career that now consists mostly of episodic 
television. Indeed, he is wry and self-effacing when he remarks on what really 
matters in Hollywood nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality and quantity of munchies," he observes of the catering on the set 
of "L.A. Law," "is in direct ratio to the success and popularity of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 If "Theo" lacks the glitz and gossip that one expects to find in a celebrity 
autobiography, Bikel offers something more bountiful and rewarding: an intimate 
memoir by an actor who is passionate on the subject of acting, a generous and 
endearing storyteller, and an eyewitness to history.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: IF CONGRESS HAD CELEBRITY GUEST STARS . . .

 The Scene: Monday's premiere of TriStar's "Only You" at the Motion Picture 
Academy. A reception preceded the screening and a sit-down dinner at the 
Beverly Hilton followed. Because the evening benefited the Washington-based 
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, a pack of "Congressional aide-types," as one guest 
called them, was on hand. "Same kind of party," noted one veteran of D.C. 
schmoozing, "different kind of hangers-on." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr., and 
director Norman Jewison; among the 1,000 guests at the screening (500 at the 
dinner) were Ethel Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo (who's pregnant with twin 
girls), Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, Morgan Freeman, Ken Wahl, 
Bernard Lafferty, Melinda and John Watson, Don Klosterman, Beth Swofford, and 
studio execs Alan Levine, Marc Platt, Stacey Snider and Mark Canton. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Co-star Bonnie Hunt, commenting on the synergy between D.C. and L.A. 
said, "Politicians do well in Hollywood; actors do well in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Audience Review: An ecstatic response. " 'Moonstruck' set in Italy," was a 
typical comment. Director James Brooks said the film had "joy, confidence and 
ease." "Italy is just a wonderful background for romantic stories," Jewison 
said. "Shakespeare must have felt that because he set many of his romantic 
comedies there." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Comeback: As he passed through the conga line of television crews outside 
the theater, Downey was asked, apropos of nothing, if drug testing should be 
mandatory for actors when they sign film contracts. "No, but I think it should 
be for you tonight," he said without missing a beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: More than $100,000 was raised, with most earmarked for RFK-LA, 
a drug and gang intervention program in East L.A.; $30,000 will go to an RFK 
Human Rights Award to imprisoned Chinese pro-democracy activists Wei Jing Sheng 
and Ren Wan Ding. "Our priority," said Memorial executive director Kennedy 
Cuomo, "is to help these two courageous men get out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying Theme: The studio, which had a bad year, just suffered a wave of 
firings. One observer said:"The only question is, are the lucky ones those who 
get out, or those who stay?"

SHOWING WORLD HE STILL HAS CLASSIC TOUCH; JOHN CALE'S MUSICAL EXPLORATIONS HAVE

<P>
 John Cale came to the Coach House on Monday to promote a new double-CD 
compilation of his post-Velvet Underground music. So he played a set with 
hardly any songs from the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 A typically contrary gesture from the 52-year-old musician, whose classical 
grounding and avant-garde sensibilities were instrumental in making the Velvets 
such a wellspring of inspiration for subsequent rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 His own varied body of work has been treasured by a loyal cult that has 
followed his moves from rock psychodrama to orchestrated Dylan Thomas poems, 
from stately, folk-like ballads to ambitious song cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the small gathering at the Coach House didn't generate a very charged 
atmosphere, and the black-clad Cale, looking like a figure snipped from a '20s 
group photo of Dada artists, seemed polite and businesslike as he launched a 
comprehensive overview of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Welshman's thick, distinctive vocal tone still has its innate 
robustness, the gasps and screams his fans enjoy so much sounded a little 
underpowered. His heart didn't really seem in them as he played down his 
demented side, omitting such psycho anthems as "Leaving It Up to You" and 
"Guts" and confining his signature rants to the tail ends of "Fear Is a Man's 
Best Friend," "Cable Hogue" and "Antarctica Starts Here." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he emphasized the haunting, melancholy aspects of his work, tapping 
its undercurrents of intrigue, Angst and nostalgia. "Style It Takes," from his 
1990 reunion with Lou Reed for a musical biography of Andy Warhol, was 
especially poignant. Its wistful evocation of the Velvets' beginnings took on a 
bittersweet tone, as Cale is once again at odds with Reed and alienated from 
that legacy. Not surprisingly, the only non-Cale song in the show wasn't a 
Velvets staple, but Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be nice to hear music of this richness and dimension performed with 
the extended dynamic range a full band might lend it, but Cale's piano provided 
a resourceful and propulsive accompaniment. And his meditative solo on 
"Heartbreak Hotel" transformed for a second time a song that he radically 
reinvented 20 years ago, showing that while his music has been neatly boxed for 
consumption, his creative spirit remains vital.

 John Cale brought an amalgam of rock, musical theater and classical methods to 
the Coach House on Monday night. A classically trained composer and one-time 
member of minimalist La Monte Young's Theater of Eternal Music, he perhaps is 
best known as co-founder of the Velvet Underground, the rock band that traveled 
with Andy Warhol as part of his mid-'60s mixed-media show, the Exploding 
Plastic Inevitable. However, before a moderate audience here, he brought only 
glimmers of an experimental bent. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the show -- all of the first half -- would have fit comfortably into 
standard rock repertory or a Broadway musical a la Andrew Lloyd Webber, 
distinguished only by a sure dramatic sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Cale is no melodist, and his edgy voice has to rely on interesting settings 
and potent lyrics to add conviction to static vocal lines. Fortunately, he 
understands the power of contrast, particularly in songs with piano background 
(he played only piano and guitar in this solo performance). Even in his least 
adventuresome songs, he balanced recitative-like barrenness or rhythmically 
buoyant, repetitive piano accompaniments with powerful chordal breaks that 
employed full keyboard range. 
</P>
<P>
 On its own -- as in his musical setting of the Dylan Thomas poem "Do Not Go 
Gentle Into That Good Night" -- this process tended toward the formulaic, yet 
Cale also could use it to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In such selections as "Fear Is a Man's Best Friend," the New York-based native 
of South Wales set an atmosphere of tightly controlled hostility, and escalated 
-- through a massive piano interlude that quoted classical repertory -- to a 
cathartic, pounding and screaming finish. 
</P>
<P>
 He delivered the Elvis standard "Heartbreak Hotel" as a chanteur, dark and 
almost tuneless, backed by an angular accompaniment that expanded a brief, 
dissonant motive. He turned to tone clusters for a forceful and disdain-ridden 
effect in his first encore, "Paris 1919." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken individually, there is nothing new about the techniques Cale used. 
Contrast is an integral part of all art. Composers often have cited their 
musical forebears. The use of tone clusters and intervals traditionally 
considered dissonant abounds in 20th-Century works, and fine songwriters 
frequently have sought lyrics of high literary quality and emotional content. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the musicians who fit this description today are playing to a few 
other devotees -- mostly trained musicians themselves -- on college campuses 
and in composers' forums. 
</P>
<P>
 Cale is fitting his experimentation into a popularly accepted format. The 
forays are not always successful. Still, he has a tremendous potential 
audience, perhaps more open to the unfamiliar than the average classical 
concert assembly. As the text to his "Style It Takes" notes: "You have the 
money, and I have the art. I've got the style it takes, and you've got the 
people it takes."

COUNTY SEEKS DISASTER RELIEF OVER MEDFLIES; FRUIT: MORE THAN 40 OF THE INSECTS 
HAVE NOW BEEN FOUND. GOV. WILSON IS EXPECTED TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN 
THE REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As inspectors continued to find more Medflies in eastern Camarillo, Ventura 
County officials declared a local emergency Tuesday and appealed to state and 
federal governments for disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to declare a state of emergency in the county as 
early as today, county disaster officials said. Wilson was also asked to 
forward a request to President Clinton for a federal state of emergency, which 
would clear the way for federal disaster assistance as well as state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The local declaration is expected to be ratified next week by the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimated the potential damage to crops, the loss of sales and the 
"ripple effect" on associated industries such as packinghouses at up to $439 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County agriculture officials said the potential estimate is a 
worst-case figure based on the total loss of all Ventura County crops that 
could be hosts to the Mediterranean fruit fly and its voracious larvae. Those 
crops include lemons, oranges, grapefruit, strawberries and tomatoes.  
</P>
<P>
 The find of 10 more wild male Mediterranean fruit flies Monday brought the 
total to 41 fertile males and two mated females. All were found within 200 
meters of the original site on the grounds of St. John's Seminary on Lewis 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we have a tightly clustered find is a very good sign of a tight 
infestation," county Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail said. "The longer 
we go without trapping anything outside a one-mile radius, the better off we 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 An official quarantine -- which could be in effect up to six months -- was 
also expected to be imposed today, encompassing about 81 square miles roughly 
within a 4.5-mile radius around the site of the fly discoveries on the seminary 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed boundaries, which would take into account roads, growers' fields and 
mountain ranges, were drawn up Tuesday by McPhail and state and federal 
officials and sent to Sacramento officials for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the infestation remains localized and can be contained quickly, it 
will be an "expensive but survivable" ordeal, said grower Bob Borrell, whose 
Somis property is within the proposed quarantine boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if it becomes an extensive infestation, a lot of farmers will not survive 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Fresno-based Grape and Tree Fruit League, which represents 
about 350 growers and shippers around the state, has asked Gov. Wilson to 
authorize aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion over Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take some quick action to make sure our trading partners feel 
comfortable" with buying from California growers, said Richard Matoian, 
president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Exotic Fruit Fly Coalition, which includes the Grape and Tree Fruit League 
and about 50 other organizations across the state, has also urged Wilson to 
begin immediate aerial spraying of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman in Wilson's office, however, said no decision on how to eradicate 
the pest has been made, and one may not be made for several days. The decision 
will depend in part on the recommendation from the Cooperative Medfly Project, 
a team of state and federal agriculture officials experienced in dealing with 
infestations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Tuesday in Santa Paula with federal, state and local officials 
and about 300 growers and interested parties, Ventura County Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee said Ventura County residents should support eradication efforts, 
whatever the method. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Ventura County," she said. "I don't 
believe we will have the hysteria here that has occurred in other counties." 
She later called aerial spraying of malathion mixed with fly bait more of an 
inconvenience than a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's agriculture industry was worth $875 million last year, McPhail 
said, with about $216 million coming from lemons, $50 million from avocados, 
$45 million from Valencia oranges and $110 million from strawberries. Those 
crops all are considered by Japan to be Medfly hosts, though U.S. officials say 
the pests do not burrow into lemons and strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, which bought about $72-million worth of top-quality lemons from Ventura 
County last year, will not accept fruit from a quarantine area. And local 
growers and officials have feared Japan would cut off sales from the entire 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 But agriculture officials in other Southern California counties with Medfly 
quarantines said only produce from quarantine areas was banned in Japan, not 
produce from entire counties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Koda Jun, a Japanese consul official in Los Angeles, confirmed that Japan 
typically bans only produce from quarantined areas, but no decision had yet 
been made specifically on Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 A Japanese embargo not only means lost sales to Japan but that local produce 
will flood the domestic market and drag down prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all supply and demand," lemon grower Link Leavens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Sunkist, the largest citrus cooperative in the country, said 
other nations that account for smaller portions of the county's markets -- 
including Korea, Australia and New Zealand -- have not accepted produce from 
within a 30- to 50-mile radius of a quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is still questionable whether other citrus-growing states such as 
Florida, Arizona and Texas will accept produce from the quarantine area, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the quarantine in place, federal, state and local agriculture 
officials have restricted shipments of fruit from the infested area. But 
imposition of the quarantine will set into effect a protocol for treatment of 
host fruits within the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The affected growers were expected to meet with McPhail Thursday or Friday to 
sign compliance agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreements, the growers promise to either treat any host produce 
according to the protocol or to not ship it from the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 But if their produce is not considered a host for the Medfly, or if they are 
sending it directly to processing to be juiced or canned, they can ship outside 
the quarantine area without treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, growers within the quarantine area must sell, consume or destroy 
their produce within the quarantine boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Protocol requires growers within the first half-mile radius of the find to put 
their crops into cold storage or fumigate them. From one-half mile to the 
outside radius of the quarantine, growers must treat with malathion, which will 
probably be applied by crop dusters to individual crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors, who had already sprayed the ground with malathion in the infested 
area, probably will have to reapply it after Tuesday's rainfall, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grower John Lamb, whose 365 acres of citrus, avocados and row crops are within 
the proposed quarantine boundaries, said the infestation cannot help but have a 
negative effect on the value of his crops. 
</P>
<P>
 But he adopted a philosophic attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father always said that if he ever won the lottery, he would just farm 
until all the money was gone." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners or growers who find what they suspect to be Medflies or Medfly 
larvae are urged to call the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Medfly hot line 
at 1-800-491-1899. Interested parties seeking information on the Medfly can 
call the Ventura County Fruitfly Action Cooperative Task Force at 642-1811.

RAIN LASHES COUNTY IN SEASON'S FIRST STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first storm of the season unleashed heavy rains Tuesday across Ventura 
County, drenching tinder-dry brushland, making roads slick and contributing to 
a fatal traffic accident near Ojai. Meanwhile, a threatened tsunami fizzled out 
before reaching county beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 1/2 inches of rain fell in the mountains north of Ojai by late 
afternoon, while Thousand Oaks got 0.35 of an inch and 0.43 of an inch fell in 
Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service forecasters in Oxnard predicted a 30% chance of 
showers and brief gusty winds this morning, with skies clearing this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall amounts varied widely because rain clouds moved in bands across the 
county, said Jerrett McFarland, a spokesman in the county's Flood Control 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The easternmost area of Ventura received 0.63 of an inch by 5 p.m. Tuesday, 
for instance, while rainfall at the county's Government Center six miles west 
measured just 0.28 of an inch, McFarland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The storm concentrates on little areas and just sits there and drenches that 
area for a while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A soggy morning drive contributed to at least a dozen fender-benders on 
streets and freeways from Oak Park to Ventura, and a fatal accident on 
California 33 about seven miles north of Ojai, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A car driven by an unidentified woman in her mid-30s, slid off a rain-slicked 
road and plunged 200 feet down an embankment, authorities said. The woman was 
ejected from the car during the accident. She was flown by helicopter to 
Ventura County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. Her identity was 
not released Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain caused no road closures or significant flooding anywhere in the 
county, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But officials closed the Thousand Oaks Library for today because of extensive 
water damage caused by the rain. Water leaked through the library's roof and 
ceiling, which were heavily damaged in the January earthquake and are still 
undergoing repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an earthquake of at least 7.9 magnitude off the coast of Japan 
prompted officials at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center to issue a tsunami 
alert for the entire Pacific coast. 
</P>
<P>
 For a short time Tuesday, public safety officials in Port Hueneme, Oxnard and 
Ventura were making emergency plans in case the giant sea wave reached those 
coastal cities. Oxnard activated its emergency operation center and police in 
Port Hueneme and Ventura were asked to work late in case the tsunami hit, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's helicopter flew low over beaches at Hollywood-by-the-Sea and 
Silver Strand, warning stray walkers about the tsunami. Sheriff's Deputy A.C. 
Quintero said one Hollywood Beach resident was so alarmed that she began 
packing items in her house. 
</P>
<P>
 "She packed up all her pictures and said she was ready to head for Los 
Angeles," Quintero said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other coastal residents took the warning in stride. Louis Spagnuolo of 
Hollywood-by-the-Sea said he has heard several warnings about "big waves" over 
the past nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing ever really happens," Spagnuolo said. As a result, he said, "people 
today are not even paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday afternoon, the warning was downgraded based on observations of the 
wave as it traveled across the Pacific Ocean, said Sue Pitts, a spokeswomen for 
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The tsunami measured just 
one foot high when it hit the Hawaiian Islands, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would not even know when it hits, it's that tiny," Pitts said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the tsunami threat dissipated, officials were bracing for more 
heavy rain Tuesday night. Precipitation this time of year is unusual because 
October and November normally are marked by tinder-dry east winds, said John 
Weikel, a county hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is beneficial rain," Weikel said. "It is soaking into the ground and 
alleviating the fire danger," he said, referring to wildfires that devastated 
parts of the county last year.

 "I'd much prefer to have it overcast and windy than to have hot, dry winds and 
fires." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Fire Chief James E. Sewell said the rain will help dampen trees 
and brush dried out during the summer. But he said it would be premature to 
cancel the fire-watch season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of water to change the moisture content of trees and shrubs," 
he said. "It has to get up into the leaves and the bark." 
</P>
<P>
 The rains could allow farmers to skip an irrigation cycle or two, said Rex 
Laird, director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. But it also could force 
strawberry growers to spray fungicide if the weather turns warm and humid in 
the next few days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rains followed by hot and sticky weather just makes the fungus go wild on 
strawberries," Laird said.

PLAN TARGETS USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY FUNDS; GOVERNMENT: GROUP HOPES TO GATHER 
ENOUGH SIGNATURES FOR A MEASURE TO FORCE COUNTY TO PUT ALL PROPOSITION 172 
REVENUES INTO EXPANDED PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One year after voters approved a measure providing millions of dollars for 
public safety, Ventura County law enforcement advocates will be back at the 
polls in November pushing a proposal that binds how leaders spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Election Day blitz, volunteers hope to gain the more than 18,700 
signatures they need for an initiative forcing the County Board of Supervisors 
to put all of its Proposition 172 tax revenues into expanded public safety 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to have any trouble doing this," said Otto Stoll, 
who heads Citizens for a Safe Ventura County. "I think the guy on the street 
will go for this, because it's another way of telling politicians that you've 
got to do what the voters tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll's group, working with prosecutors, sheriff's deputies and firefighters, 
plans to unveil its initiative at a press conference next week and submit it to 
election officials later that day. 
</P>
<P>
 If the group receives the needed signatures at polling places on Election Day, 
the supervisors will be forced to add the measure to the next countywide 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 With the next election more than a year off, Stoll said supporters would seek 
a special election or urge the supervisors simply to adopt the initiative as 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, county voters overwhelmingly approved the statewide Proposition 172, 
which provides a half-cent sales tax for public safety. Supervisors initially 
pledged to spend all the money to improve criminal justice programs, not simply 
maintain current services. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the face of severe budget cuts, the board took some of the money out of 
the Sheriff's Department and district attorney budgets and used it, instead, 
for related programs. The coroner's office, for instance, received nearly $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors defended their decision, saying the sheriff first suggested 
merging the coroner's office into his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we're talking about control or we're talking about money," 
Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. "My understanding is we put all of the money 
into public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors angered some residents earlier with a decision to exclude the Fire 
Department from any of the special revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The new initiative would specify what county programs would be eligible for 
the Proposition 172 money, which amounted to $28 million in this budget year, 
Stoll said. The measure would include firefighters under the public safety 
umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would also set a formula for how much county money should go into 
criminal justice budgets as a base. After that, the county could spend the 
Proposition 172 money for enhancing services. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials argue that any effort to tie their hands would cripple their 
ability to balance the budget. The Proposition 172 money was initially 
conceived as a replacement for property tax revenue the state took away from 
the counties a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the original initiative prevents the county from using the funding 
to replace money lost to the state. In fact, many communities have simply used 
the sales tax to replace, rather than augment, county spending for law 
enforcement, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've kept the faith with 172," Supervisor Susan Lacey said. "We 
don't know what kinds of funds are going to be spent or how state spending will 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 But law enforcement boosters point to promises that supervisors made before 
and after Proposition 172 was approved. The board pledged to use all the money 
for enhancements, and in March followed through with a $24-million commitment 
to expanding criminal justice agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time budget deliberations began in July, supervisors faced 
unexpected cuts from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, board members took about $1.2 million from the $24-million 
commitment for other programs. Also, they never designated a use for an extra 
$4 million in Proposition 172 revenue that came in at the end of the July. 
</P>
<P>
 That money went, instead, to maintain current services in the Sheriff's 
Department, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have called us and said what the Board of Supervisors did was 
wrong," said Ken Maffei, who heads the Ventura County Professional Firefighters 
Assn. "The public was really angry that the board violated their trust."

INSECT BREEDERS SAY WIDESPREAD SPRAYING MAY THREATEN FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Widespread aerial spraying of the chemical malathion could devastate Ventura 
County's insectary industry, which prospers by selling farmers harmless bugs 
that eat other crop-threatening pests, company managers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who make their living fighting insects with insects say limited 
ground-level spraying, or localized aerial spraying, of malathion to kill 
Mediterranean fruit flies poses no immediate threat to their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of local insect-breeding farms said they support the latest attack 
plans against the county's Medfly infestation. So far, agricultural officials 
have limited the Medfly war to spraying malathion within a 4.5-mile radius of 
where 43 Medflies were found near Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point the emphasis should be on eradication," said John Freeman, 
manager of Sespe Creek Insectary, a Fillmore-based company that breeds 
parasitic wasps for sale to area citrus growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small infestation and control measures should be taken," Freeman said. 
"Everybody's got to play it by ear." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Ventura County farmers rely on natural beneficial insects such as wasps 
or beetles to eat other insects that threaten the area's thousands of acres of 
lemon, orange and avocado groves. 
</P>
<P>
 But any extended exposure to malathion, the pesticide approved to help control 
the Medfly, could jeopardize the biological pest-control industry because it 
would kill the beneficial bugs as well as the bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Integrated pest-management programs use a variety of insects and small amounts 
of pesticides to control crop-eating predators. The effort dates back to the 
1920s, when farmers concerned about exposing their fruit to unhealthy chemicals 
first introduced the beneficial bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Insectary managers said they have not discovered any insect that would prey on 
Medflies and effectively control them. And without such a biological solution, 
the managers agree there is little alternative to malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spraying is going to have some effect on the (biological) program, but it's 
not going to stop it," said Libby Ouellette, a supervisor at the Oxnard Pest 
Control Assn., a cooperative insectary of about 60 growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to pay attention to when they're spraying and maybe not 
release that day" in that area, said Ouellette, who breeds a type of beetle 
that eats mealybugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Ouellette and several other managers of Ventura County's seven insectaries 
are concerned that if the limited aerial or ground spraying does not work, more 
serious steps might be taken to kill the Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Corona, a Riverside County city that experienced a similar Medfly 
infestation a year ago, business dropped 10% or more at an insectary where 
aerial spraying was done for nine months, an insectary manager there said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't able to release our (insects) because the spray killed them," said 
Joe Barcinas, general manager of Foothill Agricultural Research, a Corona-based 
company that sells parasitic wasps and other predators to hundreds of 
California farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to wait until the residue was gone," he said. "It also affected us 
because in some orchards we sustained a lot of pest problems because of the 
malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's agricultural community has prided itself in using biological 
controls and using pesticides only as a last resort, said Phil Phillips, a farm 
adviser with the University of California cooperative extension in Ventura. 
"But when it comes to an exotic pest like the Mediterranean fruit fly," he 
said, "we have to reassess or re-prioritize." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the protocol set up by the Cooperative Medfly Project in 
conjunction with state and federal agricultural officials, the prescribed 
amount of malathion is 2.8 ounces mixed with nine ounces of corn syrup per 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malathion is a non-selective pesticide, so it will kill the beneficial 
insects it contacts as well as the target species," Phillips said. "If there is 
a plus here at all for malathion, it's that we're using small amounts." 
</P>
<P>
 County Agriculture Commissioner Earl MacPhail said the small amounts of 
malathion to be used in ground spraying would probably not have any adverse 
impact on local insectaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "As little malathion we'll be using per acre, I don't feel that the 
(biological pest-control) program will be affected," he said.

WINDOW SERVICE FOR VOTER REGISTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many drive-through operators, Thomas McCoy tries to keep his customers 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike fast-food purveyors, McCoy isn't offering up a quick cheeseburger, 
fries and a shake. He's offering voter registration -- and it's free for the 
asking. 
</P>
<P>
 A local bank has given McCoy the keys to a vacant drive-through teller's 
building at Pickwick Drive and Arneill Road in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do things differently in California," McCoy said. "We're not bound up by 
tradition. If it's a good idea, we put it into effect. I think that's what 
we've seen happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy, who will take a seat in January as a member of the Ventura County 
Republican Central Committee, said potential voters from all political 
affiliations are welcome to register at the bank's drive-through. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care whether they're Democrats or Republicans or anything in 
between," he said. "They all can come here and register quickly and efficiently 
without getting a speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Since operations began Sept. 26, about 200 voters have registered for the Nov. 
8 election out of the little building. Voter registration ends Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 345,346 people registered to vote countywide, said Bruce Bradley, 
Ventura County's chief elections official. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley called the Camarillo project a unique approach to increasing voter 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Sonoma County, they have a similar drive-through registration system, but 
other than that, this is the only other one like it," he said. "I think it's a 
catchy idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Courtney, manager of the Wells Fargo branch that owns the teller 
building, said the bank never used the annex. When McCoy approached her about 
the voter registration project, the bank didn't hesitate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about you, but I use drive-up everything in my life," Courtney 
said. "We saw this as a way to support the community and to increase access for 
people who are seeking to register to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other local companies agreed to keep the volunteer registrars fed and 
in good stock of paper, pens and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Stephen M. Brewster said no one has asked for a meal so far, but 
some have attempted financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had people try to cash a check," Brewster said. "We tell them they're 
welcome to register to vote here, but for money, they'll have go to the bank." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Brewster -- one of several dozen volunteers who staff the 
drive-through -- dispatched a voter registration form and a pen through a 
mechanical banker's drawer for Alfred Bianco, a 54-year-old Camarillo resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Bianco, who is changing addresses, said he liked the convenience of the 
drive-through program -- even if his first form got stuck in the mechanical 
drawer and he had to fill out another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this a great idea," Bianco said. "This makes registering easy. I 
think we would have bigger voter turnouts if we had more places like this." 
</P>
<P>
 For Donna Cox, also of Camarillo, the drive-through was in keeping with the 
state's laid-back culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so California," said Cox, 29. "And it sure beats standing in line at 
the post office." 
</P>
<P>
 The teller building will remain open for voter registration from 9:15 a.m. to 
7:15 p.m. daily through Tuesday, Brewster said.

<P>
 A search for a Thousand Oaks girl who never returned from a Sunday hike was 
called off early Tuesday after sheriff's deputies decided she might be a 
runaway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The search that began Monday night for Lannea Diederichs, 15, in Wildwood Park 
in Thousand Oaks turned up no evidence of foul play and was called off about 2 
a.m. Tuesday, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. David Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diederichs' father told deputies that his daughter, who had gone hiking in the 
1,700-acre park Sunday, has run away from home before, and had subsequently 
attended at least one concert by the Grateful Dead rock group. 
</P>
<P>
 The search involved a helicopter and 15 volunteers of the east county search 
and rescue team. GREG RIPPEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WOMAN REAPPOINTED TO JOBS AGENCY POST

 She once recruited new employees for the burgeoning aerospace and defense 
industries. Now, Jacquelyn Richardson hopes to place some of those displaced 
defense workers in new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, a Simi Valley education and personnel consultant, was recently 
reappointed head of the Job Training Policy Council of Ventura County, a 
nonprofit corporation that handles $14 million in job training money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a lot of layoffs, and there are more to come," Richardson said. 
"I'm committed to using our federal funds wisely to help former defense and 
aerospace employees transition to other types of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who has headed the agency for two years, was nominated by her 
colleagues for a second two-year term. The appointment was then confirmed by 
the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have begun playing a larger role in the jobs programs in the 
past year, after state legislators passed a law holding county governments 
liable for any misuse of federal funds by the employment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is liability; therefore, they're just taking more of an interest," said 
Aram Saroyan, spokesman for the jobs agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the U. S. Labor Department found that the Ventura County agency 
had misspent $500,000 in the 1980s. The case involved a former director who was 
drawing salaries from two federal agencies and awarding contracts to a private 
firm that he headed, the Labor Department said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS; LEO THE LION RETURNS IN RECYCLED 
FORM

<P>
 The famed Jungleland lion will roar to life again in Thousand Oaks this month 
-- but in a much clunkier incarnation. While the original Leo was sleek and 
ferocious -- and starred in many a Hollywood film -- this new version will be 
shiny and rough, and made entirely from recycled aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Recyc-Leo, as the sculpture has been dubbed, will be assembled every weekend 
until the grand opening of the Civic Arts Plaza. When finished, the 
ecologically correct lion will shimmer in the courtyard outside the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers can bring aluminum cans to pin on the sculpture every Thursday and 
Friday between noon and 6 p.m., and every Saturday between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m., 
through Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptor Walt Ingle estimates that it will take 10,000 cans to cover the 
23-foot-tall lion. Leo's empty belly will serve as a recycling bin during the 
grand opening weekend, as visitors toss cans in the wide-open mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be plug-ugly," said Planning Commissioner Forrest Frields, who 
is organizing Recyc-Leo. "It's going to have all sorts of different colors, the 
shapes will be somewhat irregular. But it's a nice project, and a very fitting 
one." STEPHANIE SIMON

 Over the objections of one of its members, the Thousand Oaks City Council on 
Tuesday voted to exclude the Planning Commission from reviewing projects that 
the city is building. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 to amend a city ordinance, thus clarifying an 
existing policy.Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski cast the dissenting vote, and 
Councilwoman Elois Zeanah was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 In voicing her opposition, Zukowski argued that the city should adhere to the 
same project review process as private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman also urged the council not to approve 
the amendment, saying it would only add to the perception that there is a 
double standard when it comes to city projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Alex Fiore and Councilman Frank Schillo said that development 
standards are best determined by the City Council because it is solely 
responsible for establishing the city's budget as well as its long-term goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see nothing wrong with the council having the final decision on city 
facilities," Fiore said, adding that this would speed up the review process and 
help keep projects on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The council did agree, however, to include the Planning Commission on study 
sessions involving future city projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday night's meeting, planning commissioners Marilyn Carpenter and 
Linda Parks said that no project should be exempt from scrutiny by the 
commission. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : MOORPARK; TEACHERS, DISTRICT TO BEGIN CONTRACT 
TALKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to end a bitter contract dispute, the Moorpark Unified School Districts 
and the local teachers union are beginning a marathon series of negotiations 
tonight that could last all week. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in Moorpark formed picket lines on the first day of school, at the 
first school board meeting of the academic year and at parent-teachers nights 
demanding a new contract. They have worked without a contract for the last two 
years, and have not had a raise since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year negotiations broke down after the union, the Moorpark Educators 
Assn., rejected an offer by the district promising a three-year contract that 
included a 1% annual pay raise. The union wanted a 4% yearly raise for 
teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 But now, after district analysts discovered a potential deficit nearing $1 
million for this fiscal year, even the 1% raise is no longer being offered by 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board's latest offer, made in mid-September, includes no pay raise. 
And while board members have all said they believe teachers deserve more money, 
many have also stated publicly that there is no money available for a raise.  
</P>
<P>
 The two sides will sit down in a closed-door session at 7 tonight and plan to 
meet all day Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Richard Gillis would not comment on the district's reneging on 
its previous offer. He would only say the union was eager to begin negotiations 
with the district. School board members were equally cautious about commenting 
on the negotiations, saying that they also are looking forward to drawing up a 
new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we'll be able to work something out," school board member Tom Baldwin 
said. "I hope when we go through the budget together during the negotiations, 
we can find some money for teachers. I know there can't be a whole lot there, 
but I hope we can find something." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS; 3 WITNESSES TELL HOW TEEN BRANDISHED 
GUN 
</P>

<P>
 Three teen-agers testified Tuesday against a 17-year-old Thousand Oaks youth 
accused of accidentally shooting and killing his girlfriend, saying the youth 
had been brandishing the weapon for as long as a month before the deadly 
shooting July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Morales, 18, said the defendant had pointed the gun at his head the 
day before the death of 16-year-old Jacqueline Reay, who was shot in the eye at 
close range. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled the gun out and he pointed it at my head" for about 30 seconds, 
Morales said in juvenile court testimony. "Then he said, 'What would you do if 
I pulled the trigger?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I said, 'Don't.' Then I heard him pull the trigger." The gun was empty, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn asked Morales, one of half a dozen 
prosecution witnesses Tuesday, if he were frightened when the gun was pointed 
at him. "When I heard that trigger click, that's when I got scared," Morales 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses recalled similar stories about the defendant. The defense is 
expected to begin putting on its case today. The defendant is charged with one 
count of murder, one count of brandishing a firearm and three counts of 
assault. He has admitted to one count of brandishing a firearm and two counts 
of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in court Tuesday, the defendant seemed on the verge of tears as 
Glynn read aloud the autopsy report describing Reay's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, several witnesses acknowledged that the defendant and 
Reay considered themselves a couple and often could be seen hugging and 
kissing. Defense attorney Victor Furio suggested that such testimony shows the 
defendant had no ill-will toward Reay. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors agreed that the shooting was accidental, but have said the 
defendant should have known the deadly consequences of pointing a loaded gun at 
people. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; LAWN BOWLERS GIVE $10,000 MORE TO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Oxnard lawn bowling group has donated $10,000 to the city for a clubhouse 
and other renovations at Wilson Park, raising its total contribution to about 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday accepted the donation from the Oxnard-Joslyn Lawn 
Bowls Club, which plays at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is expected to cost about $80,000, said Oxnard Recreation 
Supervisor Laura Klein Mosqueda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's allowed the city to have a building they never would have had," Mosqueda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to lawn bowlers, the clubhouse will be used by other seniors' 
groups and senior volunteers, Mosqueda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from the Marcellus L. Joslyn Lawn Bowl Foundation, which funds 
lawn bowling clubs throughout Southern California. The foundation has been 
contributing to the Oxnard club since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a new club, and no way would we have had that kind of money without 
that," said Marie Ecton, one of about 50 club members. 
</P>
<P>
 A cross between cricket and bowling, lawn bowling is played in lanes drawn on 
a green, typically 120 square feet. Players try to get the balls, called bowls, 
as close as possible to a white target, or jack, the size of a cue ball. MIGUEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; U.S. OFFICIALS WON'T PAY FOR SLIDE 
CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal authorities are refusing to pay for clearing a landslide that has 
blocked South Mountain Road near Santa Paula since Sept. 8, leaving Ventura 
County to scramble for the cash before the autumn rains soak the debris, county 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Britt, head of the county transportation department, said his agency 
lacks the money to remove the tons of earth that now force residents east of 
the slide to make a 30-minute detour, through Fillmore, to reach Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to beat the rainy season," said Britt, who has speculated that 
budget constraints and the coming rains could possibly delay reopening the road 
until spring. "If the soil gets saturated, it would slow us down." 
</P>
<P>
 In its preliminary decision, the Federal Highway Administration denied the 
county's appeal for federal aid because the slide occurred so long after the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, FHWA engineer Scott McHenry said. 
</P>
<P>
 County geologist Jim Fisher linked the Sept. 8 slide to an aftershock of the 
January quake. The 3.1 magnitude aftershock near San Fernando brought the mass 
of debris tumbling onto South Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But McHenry said federal assistance is offered only for damage related to the 
quake itself or to its immediate aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt, who estimated it could cost up to $200,000 to reopen South Mountain 
Road, said the county now might appeal for funding from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency or the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 McHenry, however, said he doubted the road would qualify for FEMA assistance 
because it is not a city street or a minor rural route. 
</P>
<P>
 As rain fell throughout the county Tuesday, Britt said county officials were 
keeping an eye on the tons of rock and debris that continue to cling to the 
cliff above South Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it hasn't gotten the soil up there saturated enough to make it a 
problem," Britt said. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; DISABLED BOY WINS CASE AGAINST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a five-year battle between Ojai schools and the family of a severely 
disabled boy, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday refused a school district 
request to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision lets stand a federal appeals court ruling that the Ojai Unified 
School District must pay the family of 15-year-old Bion Jackson $97,000 in 
legal fees, plus thousands more for the child's educational assessment, special 
training and tuition to a state school for the blind. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Greater Los Angeles Council for the Deaf, which was the 
advocate for the Jackson family, lauded the Supreme Court decision as a victory 
for disabled children whose local schools are unable to meet their educational 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ojai school officials said they will have to take more than $100,000 out 
of financial reserves to comply with the court order. They said the court 
action raises troubling questions about how much school districts must pay for 
special education students. 
</P>
<P>
 An adopted son of Richard and Elizabeth Jackson, Bion was born deaf, blind and 
with a curved spine. He has never learned to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time he was 4 to 11, Bion attended schools run by the Ventura County 
Superintendent of Schools. The Jackson family has argued that county-run 
schools failed to meet the boy's needs, including not teaching him to walk or 
dress himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai school officials, however, said Bion is severely mentally retarded and 
may not be capable of such basic survival skills. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal trial judge in Los Angeles initially sided against the family, but 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled that the school district must 
pay for physical therapy or other training necessary to give the boy enough 
self-sufficiency to attend the California School for the Blind in Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai school officials so far have no estimate of the cost of such training.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MEETING PLANNED TO HELP LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public library advocates in Ventura are urged to attend a meeting today to 
help draft a plan on how the city's two libraries can receive enough funding to 
remain open, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting of the San Buenaventura City Library Board will start at 6 p.m. at 
Wright Library on Day Road, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will discuss ways to funnel more money and volunteers to the 
libraries, said spokeswoman Sally Weimer. The board will also talk about a 
fund-raiser scheduled for Oct. 22, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weimer noted that libraries allow business people to sharpen skills, aid 
students with homework and help the unemployed find jobs through newspapers and 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider volunteering and helping as investing in the future of our 
community," Weimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's public libraries, like many throughout the county, have had staff 
and operational hours cut dramatically over the past two years because of 
reduced funding, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone willing to offer ideas or volunteer time is invited to attend the 
meeting, Weimer said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLAN TO EASE TRAFFIC AT INTERSECTION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to unravel the snarled traffic at one of Ventura's most crowded 
intersections, the City Council has voted unanimously for a Caltrans proposal 
to widen the Seaward Avenue-Ventura Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which involves adding turn lanes and expanding the bridge over 
the freeway, replaces an earlier design that would have placed an on-ramp at 
Peninsula Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members backed away from that option after neighbors voiced opposition 
to the ramp, which they said would significantly increase traffic in their 
community and lower their property values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here tonight to thank you . . . for not turning Peninsula Street into 
a raceway to the freeway," Peninsula Street resident Joyce Trahan said Monday. 
"Who wants to live on the entrance to a freeway?" 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is scheduled to begin work on the $7.7-million project in 1997. The 
improved intersection will include state-of-the-art video surveillance 
equipment that would eventually allow the intersection's traffic to monitor 
itself. A computer connected to the cameras will "see" how many cars are backed 
up at a light and then adjust the traffic signal accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific improvements to the intersection include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retrofitting and widening the bridge over the freeway from five lanes to 
eight lanes; 
</P>
<P>
 * Widening the northbound off-ramp on Harbor Boulevard by adding two extra 
turn lanes; 
</P>
<P>
 * Adding an extra left-turn lane on Harbor Boulevard north of Seaward Avenue; 
and 
</P>
<P>
 * Adding two lanes to northbound Harbor Boulevard, including a right-turn lane 
onto Seaward Avenue. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNTY BLOCKS PLAN TO ANNEX WATERWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard's plan to annex the water area of Channel Islands Harbor has been 
blocked indefinitely by lawyers for Ventura County, who took advantage of a tax 
technicality to prevent a state board from reviewing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Local Agency Formation Commission, which presides over 
jurisdictional disputes, have agreed with County Counsel James L. McBride's 
argument that Oxnard's plan is illegal, LAFCO Executive Director Stanley Eisner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride argued that the LAFCO board, which was set to review the plan this 
month, could not until Oxnard and the county negotiate an agreement to transfer 
property taxes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1983 agreement between Oxnard and the county discusses the division of 
property taxes in annexations but it excludes the harbor, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would have to agree to a tax transfer deal at the waterway and such 
negotiations could take years, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig said he had not been notified of LAFCO's 
decision and said he will contest the county's and LAFCO's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am grateful for the information," Gillig said. "But frankly, I disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1965, Channel Islands Harbor covers more than 300 acres of land and 
water.  
</P>
<P>
 The county leases most of the surrounding land to developers, who have built 
restaurants, condominiums and about 3,600 boat slips.  
</P>
<P>
 Leases and taxes at the marina generate about $2 million for the county each 
year. But the waterway tussle between Oxnard and the county involves less than 
$200,000 in annual property tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard leaders say the Y-shaped waterway should be in their jurisdiction 
because it has benefited for years from city fire and police services, and is 
reachable only by city roads. The Oxnard City Council voted last month to annex 
the waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 But county leaders say the small-craft marina, which cost $1 million to dig 
and $7 million to renovate, should remain in their jurisdiction. MIGUEL

FIBER-OPTIC LAB SHOWS A CLASS PATHWAY TO THE FUTURE; NEWBURY PARK: THE STUDENTS

<P>
 Seventeen-year-old Anthony Gelatt planned to graduate from Newbury Park High 
School next spring and enter the working world without a college diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But now, a month into a new high-tech class, Anthony is considering going to 
college and dreaming of a future in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior's interest in one of the world's fastest-growing industries was 
sparked by an $80,000 donation of high-tech fiber-optic equipment by GTE 
California to Newbury Park High School's new Technology Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to give kids learning opportunities, paths into the future," 
said Frederick Fleming, a senior analyst with GTE who helped develop a manual 
for the class. "This is the growth industry." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to GTE's fiber-optic instruments, the 24 students enrolled in the 
class -- called Applied Technology -- study technical fields such as computer 
animation, robotics and graphic design. 
</P>
<P>
 While other schools in Ventura County offer similar courses that teach 
students how to use high-tech computer systems, Newbury Park High is probably 
the only school in the country teaching telecommunications by using advanced 
fiber-optic equipment, GTE and school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty unique," Fleming said. "I've been out at college classes and 
never seen anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Thousand Oaks-based GTE California are now using fiber-optic 
phone lines instead of old copper wires to carry information. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiber-optic lines are cheaper to maintain and transmit information faster, 
Fleming said. Each fiber strand, as thin a human hair, can carry about 27,000 
voices simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 In class, students learn how to splice fiber-optic cable to link a four-mile 
phone line. Once it's completed, the youngsters can communicate using headsets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly what is being done at a phone company," said teacher Bob 
Hendricks, gesturing toward four identical spools of thin cable attached to two 
large wooden telephone work stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we went through four years of this program," he said, "in the end, they 
would be able to walk out of this and get any job with a phone company laying 
fiber-optic cable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The expensive lab is one example of how schools and businesses are trying to 
upgrade vocational education. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do," Hendricks said, "is get kids excited about the 
technology, see if it sparks an interest somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 For the students in Applied Technology, Hendricks' plan seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike other classes, it's hands-on experience," said Joe Caldevaro, 16, who 
took the elective course last spring when it was first offered. "It's a great 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old junior Randy Miller said the class teaches students about the 
latest advances and prepares them for the job world. "You aren't working with 
Commodores or Ataris any more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe said his favorite part of the class is the new fiber-optic system, 
carefully tucked away in a corner of the lab, once the school's crafts room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really simple," he said. "It seems like Latin at first, but after a 
while it's like tying your shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 The class is organized so that each week students rotate to different modules, 
where they work in pairs on various projects. The class lasts for an hour and a 
half, allowing ample time for lab work. During the first month of class, 
students have worked with several business leaders, mostly from GTE. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators see this interaction as a key to job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expertise is critical, this is directly applicable to a career," said 
Fred Van Leuven, director of secondary education for the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders see schools as an investment in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we get involved is because we are recipients of what comes out of 
both private and public education," said Mike Crawford, president of GTE 
California. "A lot of us have true interest in education. . . . We want to lend 
a helping hand when we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Gelatt sees the GTE equipment as a tremendous gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to put a price tag on this," he said, eyeing the expensive 
instruments. "It's like a Christmas present."

2 TRIBAL GROUPS UNITE TO ADVISE ON RANCH SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Native American groups decided to join forces Tuesday to advise Thousand 
Oaks park officials on the development of a ranch parcel where archeologists 
unearthed evidence of an ancient Chumash cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 90-minute meeting, Native American leaders also said that city 
officials had answered many of their questions about why the city concluded 
last week that bones found on Lang Ranch were not part of a Chumash burial 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Chumash leaders said they hope to work in concert with Conejo Recreation and 
Park District officials from now on to ensure that the eight-acre ranch site is 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get together as a united group and tell the park district where we 
want this to go," said Leo Valenzuela, chairman of the Oakbrook Park Chumash 
Indian Corp. "This meeting clarified what went on up to now. And now we want to 
look forward." 
</P>
<P>
 At the session, called by Councilman Frank Schillo to look into the 
allegations of possible wrongdoing, city and park officials said they made no 
effort to conceal the significance of bones found at the site in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking to everybody, I realized that everyone had a different idea of 
what was out there," Planner Greg Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith told the Chumash leaders that a partial human skull was found. He also 
said that William Clewlow, an archeologist who studied the site four years ago, 
had found other mammal bones and artifacts that indicate a strong likelihood 
that the land is a Chumash burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Chumash leaders said they hoped only grass and trees would 
be placed over the land where the artifacts were unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tex Ward, park district general manager, said he could not guarantee that 
park facilities would not be built on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot that goes into the design of a park site," Ward said. "It's 
too soon at this point to say what will go where." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward told half a dozen Native American representatives that there will be a 
series of community and public meetings before any plans are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Chumash leaders hope to have a unified proposal for the land, 
Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had enough of the divide-and-conquer atmosphere," Valenzuela said. "What 
we need to do is fall back and see what we can accomplish together." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela said he and his supporters would meet with Richard Angulo and other 
members of the California Indian Council to chart plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue raised at the meeting was the allegation that no city or park 
representative had notified the county coroner and the California Native 
American Heritage Commission about the bone find four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Angulo said he called the heritage commission. And Smith reported that Clewlow 
said he should have notified the coroner, but did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he was satisfied with the meeting's outcome. "I think we cleared 
up a number of issues that had been cause for concern," he said.

POSITIVE EXPERIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sunday, Sept. 11, I personally spent some seven hours with Nellie the 
elephant at Oktoberfest.She purred with delight, danced with her trainer and 
showed everyone watching how to eat a watermelon -- whole. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in my life I was able to appreciate the intelligence and 
friendliness of an elephant. While giving rides, Nellie played with her toys, 
including her "lunch box."  
</P>
<P>
 The only remark that the Los Angeles Times could make was to nit-pick about 
the animal, rather than comment on the positive learning experiences 2,000 
people in attendance witnessed.

HELP'S SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to convey our sincere thanks for the recent article featuring 
HELP of Ojai, Inc. As pleased as we are with the story, there are two important 
points that were not addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it is important to know that we are a United Way of Ventura County 
member agency and have been since 1981.The '94-'95 funding, allocated to HELP 
of Ojai through the United Way allocation process, is $20,000. In addition, we 
receive United Way donor-designated gifts. As important as the financial 
support is, we also gain immeasurably from our overall affiliation with United 
Way and the 60-plus other member agencies. All of us in this county are 
fortunate to have such a strong, viable United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, well-covered was the fact that HELP sponsors many senior programs. 
Missing was information regarding the many services HELP provides for the 
non-senior. HELP was intergenerational long before it became "the in thing." 
Non-seniors are assisted in so many ways, for example, with counseling 
services, a food pantry and an after-school recreation program.

POOR CONDITIONS

 My commendations for printing the story about Maria Echaveste's return to 
Ventura County to revisit her roots and finding nothing much has changed ("U.S. 
Official Strengthens Ties to Field Workers," Aug. 27). Have we forgotten Edward 
R. Murrow's searing documentary, "Harvest of Shame"? 
</P>
<P>
 It's unfortunate that Ms. Echaveste, as head of the U.S. Department of Labor's 
Wage and Hours Division, cannot do more to improve the living quarters of 
migrant farm workers in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, my wife and I drove along Port Hueneme Road to tour the USS Port 
Royal, which was open for public tours at the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center, when we crossed the railroad tracks marking the entrance to Oxnard and 
Port Hueneme. I was shocked to see dilapidated homes situated a few feet away 
from the tracks. A dumpster piled high with refuse was in the center of the 
compound. A dirt road led into the dirt-centered compound. The homes were badly 
in need of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 How can Oxnard expose children to such dangerous living conditions? I hope Ms. 
Echaveste has an opportunity to visit this area on her next visit.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: LIBRARIES GIVE US WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE, SERVICES AT 
MINIMAL COST; TAX MONEY FOR THESE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IS WELL SPENT. BOOKS GIVE 
MANY PEOPLE A WINDOW TO OTHER WORLDS, NOT TO MENTION COUNTLESS HOURS OF READING 
PLEASURE.

 A funny thing happened recently when I read about a proposed tax increase. For 
once, I'm all for it, because I believe this may be the only way to save one of 
our county's most valuable resources -- public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 I often wonder, where would I be today without them? I got hooked on books way 
back in the fourth grade. In our school, what separated the big kids from the 
little ones was that fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-graders got to use the school 
library. To me it was like entering the proverbial magic kingdom as I got my 
first look at the big room, its walls lined with eight-foot shelves each 
crammed full of books I was actually allowed to take home and read. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasted no time. That first day I checked out a biography of Louisa May 
Alcott. In subsequent weeks I discovered Albert Payson Terhune's wonderful 
books about dogs, then went on to "Beautiful Joe," "Smokey," "Black Beauty," 
and my all-time childhood favorite, "Silver Chief, Dog of the North." (Years 
later I bought my own copy and read it to our own kids.) 
</P>
<P>
 The first day of vacation, unable to face a summer without books, I trudged 
the 1 1/2 miles uptown, climbed the stairs to the top floor of the three-story 
brick building that housed our town library, and got my first library card. 
Another banquet of books to explore and digest. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week all summer I'd exchange one armload of books for another. I read 
most of "Little Women" perched high up in our back yard peach tree, and when 
Mom wasn't looking I'd dust with one hand and hold a book in the other. At 
night I'd sneak a flashlight upstairs so I could read under the covers; and by 
the time summer was over, I vowed that someday I'd not only read books, I'd 
write them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 I still love libraries. One of the most rewarding jobs I ever tackled was 
serving as PTA library chairman at our neighborhood elementary school, 
especially at the end of the year when I helped select more than 100 books for 
their collection. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been in big libraries full of marble statues, and in little libraries in 
the back room of a small town drugstore. I've even been privileged to do 
research in the prestigious Huntington Library in San Marino, where down in the 
stacks I, along with the other scholars, could exchange the present for the 
past. But it really doesn't matter what library I'm in. Every one of them 
reminds me that, because we have libraries, the past is still there to help us 
understand the future. 
</P>
<P>
 I marvel that today's libraries not only offer books, magazines, and 
newspapers but videotapes, talking books, cultural programs, story hours for 
preschoolers, information on community events, how to find a job, consumer 
advice, even tax forms. All that, along with friendly knowledgeable resource 
people to help find anything anyone might conceivably want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Does any other public service offer as much for so little from the people who 
use the service? I doubt it. Every time I hear of another library forced to cut 
hours, unable to buy new books, even closing its doors, I wonder how many kids 
will make TV their only window on the world if they can no longer check out 
books for free? And how many people like me, unable to finish college for lack 
of money, will find it harder to keep up with the world they live in? Thanks to 
free public libraries, we can all further our knowledge in any direction, the 
only cost is our own time and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Franklin knew what he was doing back in 1731 when he set up what was to 
become the forerunner of free public libraries. The best thing about libraries 
is that they truly provide equal opportunity for everyone, the same materials 
available to one and all. Does any other service offer a better bargain for the 
taxpayer's dollar? Not to my way of thinking.

VIETNAM ASKED TO LET EXPATRIATES CLAIM, BUY LAND; TRADE: VICE PRESIDENT TELLS 
COUNTY GROUP SHE WILL 'CONVEY THE MESSAGE' TO LAWMAKERS. SHE ASKS THAT THEY 
SUPPORT VIETNAM'S QUEST FOR RENEWED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND MOST-FAVORED 
NATION STATUS.

 The trade mission from Orange County met with the Vietnamese vice president 
here Tuesday, and the delegation's leader urged the communist government to 
consider policy reform allowing overseas Vietnamese to claim or buy back 
properties lost when they fled the war-torn country years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham, president of the Westminster-based Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, 
made the proposal during a 90-minute meeting between the delegates and 
Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh in the plush, high-ceiling 
presidential palace here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese overseas would like favorable laws so we can . . . claim our 
properties and belongings" abandoned when 2 million Vietnamese fled their 
native land after the United States pulled out of the Vietnam War in 1975, Pham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Binh, who was the highest ranking official the 24 delegates will meet, said 
only that she would "convey the message" to Vietnamese lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of lost properties is important to Vietnamese residents in Orange 
County, many of whom denounced this first trade mission, which is largely 
sponsored by Vietnamese overseas. Local opponents say renewed trade between the 
United States and Vietnam could stimulate this nation's poor economy and thus 
keep alive a communist government that has a questionable human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the Vietnamese American community have lobbied the U.S. government to 
solve the issue of lost properties before restoring diplomatic ties with Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said Tuesday that he brought up the sensitive political topic even though 
he did not expect government officials here to accept the request. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue is too important to the Vietnamese expatriates not to bring up," 
Pham said. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the Vietnamese Americans on the trip agree that the issue of 
lost properties is important, they do not believe that Vietnamese Americans 
ever will be allowed to reclaim the properties they left. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you abandon a house . . . forget it," said Hieu Phan, an architect from 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham also asked Binh to pay attention to freedom and democracy for the 
citizens of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have learned . . . that if people can develop economically in a free way, 
the country will be better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president requested that her American guests support Vietnam's quest 
for diplomatic recognition and most-favored nation trading status from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the delegates told her they will contact their U.S. elected 
officials on Vietnam's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assure you I will urge my congressmen to speed up the normalization process 
and to give Vietnam MFN status," said Dunson Cheng, chairman of Cathay Bank, a 
Los Angeles firm with a branch in the center of Little Saigon in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Though President Clinton lifted the trade embargo in February, it is difficult 
to protect U.S. interests in Vietnam without formal normalization between Hanoi 
and Washington, a problem businesses face when entering the Vietnamese market. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade delegation on Tuesday also met with a U.S. State Department official 
for a briefing on the current political and economic situation in Vietnam, as 
well as the unresolved issue of unaccounted-for U.S. servicemen. That meeting 
was closed to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the trade mission moves to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, for 
another round of meetings with Vietnamese politicians and business 
professionals. Delegates return to the United States on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation had hoped to meet with Vietnam's President Le Duc Anh during 
their weeklong stay, but it is not possible, said Hoang Cong Thuy of the Viet 
Nam-USA Society, which is coordinating the Americans' visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president has too tight of a schedule," Thuy said. "He is meeting with 
the Chinese delegation."

DANA PARSONS: MOURNING HARRIET -- AND THE MODERN FAMILY OF SITCOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 "Homer, Marge and the kids visit Itchy and Scratchy Land, a violent theme 
park." "A thief infiltrates a neighborhood watch meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 "Al ejects a customer for nursing her baby." 
</P>
<P>
 "A gunshot is heard at school."  
</P>
<P>
 All four of those scenes are taken from this week's TV listings. All four are 
from programs depicting family life in America. 
</P>
<P>
 And you wonder why Harriet Nelson's death was front-page news? 
</P>
<P>
 Long before she died last Sunday at 85, Harriet Nelson had passed into the 
hallowed realm of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that we don't remember much about her as a TV star, in the way we 
remember Lucille Ball or Mary Tyler Moore. No matter that no single scene comes 
to mind when we think of her; no memorable line or signature bit. No matter, 
either, that we hadn't heard much from her in the nearly 30 years since her TV 
show went off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 You could say that Harriet Nelson disappeared. Which is precisely why she was 
front-page news when she died. 
</P>
<P>
 She disappeared and took the traditional American family with her, or so the 
storyline goes. She and Ozzie and Ricky and David left, and we haven't had a 
moment's peace since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nelsons moved out, and the Bunkers and the Bundys moved in. There went the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of us who grew up watching "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," and 
are now middle-aged ourselves, the family sitcoms of the late 1950s and early 
'60s pose a dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it really good for us to watch Ozzie and Jim Anderson and Ward Cleaver 
never get madder than a mild snit? How did that square with our own fathers 
flying off the handle over nothing, lying to our mothers and killing off 
six-packs when things went wrong? If Ozzie came home late, it was because the 
PTA meeting ran long, not because he was shooting pool. Did Ward Cleaver ever 
have to stand in the unemployment line? 
</P>
<P>
 And why couldn't our mothers handle our fathers like Harriet handled Ozzie? 
How could she disarm his mood swings (some mood swings!) and restore harmony to 
the household, while our mothers only seemed capable of inflaming our fathers 
and making matters worse? I don't remember Harriet or Donna Reed ever grappling 
with the complexities of life outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 We were told we were watching families that were just like ours. After a 
while, we were forced to ask ourselves the question: What's wrong with my 
family! 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure, some of us eventually figured out that they were just TV shows. We 
realized that it was fiction, just like a novel or a movie. But when is the 
right age for reality to start setting in? Is it too late by the time you're a 
teen-ager and already convinced you're living in the only screwed-up family in 
America? 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the dilemma comes in. I doubt that many teens in America today 
who watch "Roseanne" or "Married . . . With Children" entertain any thoughts 
that their family is overly weird. If you had to guess, wouldn't you surmise 
that watching TV today would make most kids feel pretty good about their 
parents, if only by comparison to Al Bundy? 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, good ol' Al is the guy at the top of the column who ejected the 
nursing mother in this week's episode. That's reality, but is it entertainment? 
</P>
<P>
 The thief who disrupts the neighborhood watch meeting on "Dave's World." Was 
there ever a crime on Ozzie and Harriet's block? 
</P>
<P>
 The gunshot is heard on "My So-Called Life." The kids at Ricky Nelson's high 
school heard him sing "Hello, Mary Lou," not the sound of gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if they had violent theme parks in the '50s, could you imagine Ozzie 
taking Ricky and David, as lovable Homer Simpson did with his kids? 
</P>
<P>
 Aargh. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the near-perfect TV families of the late '50s probably goofed up lots 
of kids or, at least, set up their parents for failure to meet unreasonable 
standards. Lots of rebellious '60s teen-agers turned on their parents because 
they didn't turn out to be Ozzie and Harriet, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, would you rather have your mom act like Harriet or Peg 
Bundy? 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of her life, it probably seemed odd to Harriet Nelson that she 
became an icon to middle America. She was a singer who married a bandleader. 
You can't get much more show-bizzy than that and, yet, helped by the passage of 
time, she become part of our folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure Dan Quayle misses Harriet Nelson -- and Ozzie too. He must hate "The 
Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
 I miss Harriet too. I miss the whole Nelson family on TV, no matter how much 
they in 1960 didn't resemble any family I knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday maybe I'll figure out just how much reality I really want.

A BREACH OF TRUST; CRIME: POLICE SAY CARETAKER FOR ELDERLY TOOK $100,000 IN 
VALUABLES FROM CLIENTS IN THREE STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A caretaker for the elderly was charged with grand theft Tuesday after police 
seized more than $100,000 in jewelry and other valuables she allegedly stole 
from clients throughout the Southwest using a variety of identities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sondra Joanna Khosla, 48, was arrested Friday after authorities found more 
than 2,000 items -- including jewelry, antiques, credit cards and china -- in 
her Santa Ana motel room and in a rented storage locker in Tustin, Newport 
Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. The charges include a special allegation 
that the suspect used a position of trust to target someone older than 65. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovered goods were believed stolen over three years from Khosla's 
clients in Arizona, Utah and throughout California, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said police were tipped off recently when a 92-year-old Newport Beach 
woman reported that her caretaker, whose name she believed was Sia Siino, had 
stolen a 1926 wedding ring from her finger as she slept. Detectives later 
discovered that at least four other elderly people whom Khosla had cared for in 
Newport Beach and Garden Grove were missing valuables, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac Burt, 91, of Garden Grove said police recovered a 71-year-old dagger from 
Damascus and a .38-caliber handgun that disappeared from his home after the 
woman moved in for four days last month to fill in for his regular attendant, 
who was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's awful. I'd never have her in the house again," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 A manager of the Costa Mesa firm that Burt said had provided the aide said he 
did not remember Khosla and was too busy to check personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Khosla moved from state to state, getting temporary work 
under 11 aliases. She is believed to have lived in Orange County for at least 
three months, Gonis said. A search of the motel room -- her last known address 
-- turned up paperwork indicating that she used false names and fictitious 
academic degrees, he said. One was a medical school diploma, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-by-25-foot storage unit was loaded with household items, and her motel 
room held eight bags and suitcases containing jewelry and antiques, Gonis said. 
Among the items recovered were antique silver items and an $1,800 leather 
jacket bought with a stolen credit card, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors have filed about a dozen cases this year involving 
theft from the elderly by caretakers, said Rosanne Froeberg, a deputy district 
attorney who handles elderly abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens more often than we would like to think," Froeberg said. "You've 
got old people who are quite isolated, and if they need people to come in and 
care for them, they are more vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are asking anyone with information on the case to contact Newport Beach 
Police Department at (800) 550-NBPD.

TEACHER'S LAWSUIT OVER EVOLUTION REJECTED; COURTS: FEDERAL APPELLATE PANEL 
REVERSES RULING THAT CAPISTRANO UNIFIED EDUCATOR SHOULD HAVE HIS DAY IN COURT 
TO ARGUE THAT DISTRICT OFFICIALS' REQUIREMENT LEADS TO THE PROMOTION OF 
ATHEISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Without explanation, a federal appeals court abruptly reversed itself Tuesday 
and ruled that a former Orange County biology teacher cannot sue the Capistrano 
Unified School District for requiring him to teach evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Without being asked to do so by either side, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals nullified its own July 25 ruling that John Peloza should have his day 
in court to argue that district officials were promoting atheism by requiring 
him to teach evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Peloza, 39, a teacher at Capistrano Valley High School, filed a $5-million 
lawsuit against the school district in 1991, charging that his superiors were 
trying to force him to teach evolution as indisputable fact. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials reprimanded the one-time runner-up for teacher of the year 
after parents complained that he proselytized in class. These included the 
parents of a Jewish student who said Peloza told their daughter that people who 
don't believe in Jesus Christ "are going to hell." 
</P>
<P>
 While the dispute split the campus along religious lines, Peloza emerged as 
the hero of fundamentalist Christians who trace many of society's current ills 
to the 1963 decision banning prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Peloza and his supporters were stung by the panel's about-face Tuesday. They 
blamed it on political pressure from the left and immediately vowed to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a travesty," said Peloza, who lives in Dana Point. "The decision was 3-0 
in my favor two months ago and now after obvious political lobbying, it has 
been reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the American Center for Law and Justice in Virginia has taken on 
Peloza's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to let this case just sit," said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel 
for the center, which promotes "pro-liberty, pro-life and pro-family" causes, 
according to its motto. "There is no doubt there will be a petition for a 
rehearing. We'll go all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposing front, the ruling was widely applauded by education officials 
who expressed hope that it would finally lay the matter to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased that this brings some finality to a situation that has 
been out there in limbo for a period of time," said David C. Larsen, the school 
district's attorney in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified Supt. James A. Fleming said: "This was a case where you had 
a teacher who was proselytizing children toward his religious point of view. 
Many of us feel religion is the domain of the family, church or synagogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming added that students in Peloza's biology classes would only be harmed 
by his refusal to teach the state curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have children who will be taking the SAT, hoping to get into Stanford, 
Harvard. . . . " Fleming said. "You can't just have a teacher unilaterally 
saying, 'I don't believe it, I'm not going to teach it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel Tuesday did not address their earlier ruling in Peloza's 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 In their written opinion, the judges called some of his arguments "patently 
frivolous." These included his contention that it is unconstitutional for the 
school district to require him to teach that higher life forms evolved from 
lower ones because that constitutes the teaching of a religion: atheism.  
</P>
<P>
 "The scientific theory that higher forms of life evolved from lower forms is 
not . . . a religious belief," the court stated. "Evolution and evolutionism 
define a biological concept . . . that has nothing to do with whether or not 
there is a divine creator." 
</P>
<P>
 In his suit, Peloza said he was not trying to convert students to his 
religious views but that he objected to the teaching of evolution as the only 
valid scientific theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Since filing the lawsuit, he has been stripped of his duties as a biology 
teacher and now teaches health science and physical education.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DRIVERS SLIP UP IN SEASON'S FIRST RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first rain of the season caught many county residents by the tails of 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The drizzle was blamed for about 40 car accidents reported Tuesday in the 
county, mostly fender-benders, California Highway Patrol Public Affairs Officer 
Joan Rivas said."People are driving as if it's sunny and dry, and they just 
can't do that," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The light showers were expected to continue today with a slight chance of rain 
Thursday, according to WeatherData. Today's temperatures were expected to reach 
a high in the mid-70s and a low in the upper 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 24 hours ended at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, rainfall totaled .25 of an inch 
in Fullerton and Anaheim. Countywide it ranged down to less than .10 of an inch 
and up to a high of 1.26 inches at the foot of Santiago Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivas suggested that motorists pay more attention to their driving and slow 
down during rainfall. If a car spins out of control, he said, the driver should 
get off the gas pedal and steer to the shoulder or center divider of the road 
-- without slamming on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roads are very oily from the first substantial rainfall," said Costa Mesa 
Police Lt. John Fitzpatrick, who counted 10 crashes in the city by early 
Tuesday afternoon. "Not just wet -- there's actually oil that comes up from the 
summertime." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Orange County Water Districts, the rain was more welcome.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's so dry that you'll need a more appreciable amount of rainfall to 
make a difference in the ground water basin and reservoir system," said 
district spokesman Jim Van Haun. "But (Tuesday) was a nice start to the 
season." THAO HUA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; JOB-TRAINING PROGRAM GETS A NEARLY $1-MILLION 
BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's federally funded job-training program has received nearly $1 
million in unanticipated funds that will go to retrain displaced workers, hire 
two staff people to work with new clients and create more job programs in Santa 
Ana high schools, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's regular meeting, the City Council approved the new positions and 
added $112,720 in federal money recently earmarked for displaced workers to the 
city's current budget. 
</P>
<P>
 That funding, combined with nearly $900,000 that carried over from last year's 
budget, means 200 additional clients will be served this coming year, said 
Cindy Nelson, executive director of the city's community development agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite honestly, one of our fastest growing programs in the agency is the 
job-training program, and that growth is really attributed to the Clinton 
Administration," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's department had originally believed that 662 clients would be served 
by the Job Training Partnership Act funds in the 1994-95 fiscal year, but now 
she said 882 people will receive services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big caseload for us," she said. "That's why we went for another two 
positions. We're at maximum capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will hire a full-time "re-employment coordinator" to identify 
displaced workers in need of retraining and match them with Santa Ana 
businesses that are hiring under the city's enterprise zone, Nelson said. That 
position was funded part time last year, but the new Clinton Administration 
funding has nearly tripled the retraining budget, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also hire an intake specialist to work with other clients, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding boost brings the city's 1994-95 Job Training Partnership Act 
allocation to more than $5 million and will enable the city to work closely 
with the school district and the Orange County Community Congregation 
Organization to design job-training programs for youth, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just gone through a whole brainstorming session with OCCCO to try to 
develop ideas for youth in the community, to get them employed," Nelson said. 
"We see this as an opportunity to fund programs to serve the kids we are 
concerned about." LEE ROMNEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; JURY WEIGHS CASE AGAINST THE ANGELS 
</P>

<P>
 Calling a former administrative assistant's work life for the California 
Angels a "living hell" because of sexual harassment and ethnic slurs, an 
attorney asked a jury to award the woman $250,000 in compensatory damages 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the baseball team's defense attorney said the assistant, 54-year-old 
Natalia Sweeney of Orange, has fabricated her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give her money, you are essentially rewarding her for lying to you," 
attorney Neil Andrus told the jury during closing arguments in the 2-week-old 
federal court trial in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney alleged that supervisors and colleagues in the Angels' marketing 
department persecuted her because of her Latina heritage and short stature, at 
one point telling her she had "stepped out of her class" and that she should be 
"cleaning toilets." She also alleged that several supervisors made vulgar 
sexual comments and gestures toward her, including an invitation to masturbate 
with an object on a supervisor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney contends she was fired in November, 1992, after three years of 
employment because she took her complaints to the state Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Sweeney has been referred to as 'Short S---' but she stands very tall in 
her courage in facing up to the California Angels," said her attorney, Michael 
Colmenares. California Angels employees have denied all of the allegations, and 
their attorney contended that Sweeney fabricated the complaints because she was 
unable to accept any criticism on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-man, three-woman jury is expected to begin deliberating on the case 
this morning.SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 9 SITES TO OFFER FREE DEPRESSION SCREENINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Psychiatrists and psychologists will work for free at various locations 
throughout the county Thursday to help people determine whether their chronic 
blues could be clinical depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents can learn about this disorder at day or evening sessions at one of 
nine sites participating in the fourth annual National Depression Screening 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health experts will lecture about the causes, symptoms and treatments 
of depression. Participants then fill out a written survey and meet with a 
professional to discuss treatment options. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 people kill themselves in Orange County each year, according to 
Dennis Greenberger, a psychologist and clinical instructor at UCI's College of 
Medicine. But effective drugs and therapy can alleviate many of the symptoms 
that cause misery. 
</P>
<P>
 People who suffer from the disorder tend to have a negative viewpoint toward 
themselves and the world, Greenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents can attend any of the following sessions:

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CREDIT CARD USE OKD FOR PROPERTY TAXES

<P>
 Residents will be able to pull out the plastic when it comes time to pay the 
tax collector later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to accept Discover credit cards 
for payment of property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 394,000 Discover cardholders in Orange County, representing 
more than half of the county's 764,000 households, according to a county 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope the new policy will be a convenience for taxpayers and help 
them pay bills promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 But some supervisors expressed reservations about approving a program that 
could cause people to incur credit card debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to see this trend, everyone using plastic," said Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton, adding that he hopes the new service is not heavily used. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton and the rest of the board approved the plan, however, saying it would 
benefit county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers who use the credit card service will have to pay transaction fees 
that range from $1 to $5, depending on the size of each tax bill. The fees will 
go to the credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County system will go in effect on Nov. 1. Property taxes are due 
Dec. 12. For more information on the service, call (714) 834-5701. SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; DEPUTY CITY CLERK NAMED TO TOP POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members Tuesday appointed Deputy City Clerk Audrey Culver to 
replace retired City Clerk Anne M. York. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin said the council decided to appoint Culver because 
she is qualified for the job and the move saved the city the expense of a 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had asked the council to hold a special election to replace York or 
to advertise the job so others could apply. City officials, however, said a 
special election could cost the city about $117,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver, 55, has worked in the city clerk's office since 1968. She began as a 
part-time typist clerk. In 1972, she became a full-time typist clerk and was 
promoted to deputy city clerk in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with her new title, Culver now will make $53,000 a year, $15,000 less 
than York made. Catlin said the city probably will not fill the now-vacant 
deputy city clerk's job, and that the city clerk's department is expected to be 
reorganized after the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 York, who retired last week, found herself in the middle of a recall storm 
this spring that succeeded in ousting Catlin and council members Molly 
McClanahan and Don Bankhead from office in the June election. A special 
election will be held this month to replace those officials.  
</P>
<P>
 York retired Sept. 30, saying she had planned to retire earlier but the recall 
controversy kept her in office longer than she expected. 
</P>
<P>
 York was the only city official to defeat the recall drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee had tried to oust York from office because she 
allegedly delayed the recall process by rejecting recall petitions against 
Bankhead, Catlin and McClanahan. She acknowledged rejecting several petitions 
because language on the documents exceeded the 200-word limit set by state law.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; TESTS INDICATE SPILL WAS SEWAGE; BEACH 
STILL CLOSED 
</P>

 County health officials said Tuesday that preliminary test results indicate 
the mysterious liquid that gushed into the ocean at Fisherman's Cove from last 
Thursday through Monday was raw sewage. Further tests are being done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The preliminary results show it is of human sewage origins," said Larry 
Honeybourne, a program chief for the Orange County Health Care Agency's 
environmental health division. "The question is, where is it coming from?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even if diluted by rainfall, Honeybourne said, the water could pose a health 
hazard for swimmers. A three-quarter-mile strip of beach from Aster Street at 
the south end of Heisler Park north to Fairview Street will remain closed 
indefinitely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk is still a big concern to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach-goers had complained that contaminated water warning signs hadn't 
appeared along the beach until Monday although the spill was reported Friday 
night. City Manager Kenneth C. Frank, who estimated that more than 100,000 
gallons spilled, said the delay was a result of a "miscommunication" between a 
city worker and a Laguna Beach County Water Department employee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank said Tuesday he is not convinced that the spill contained sewage 
because one test indicated it could simply have been ground water. Throughout 
the day Tuesday, the city continued testing its sewer lines but had not 
uncovered a break, Frank said. LESLIE EARNEST

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; FAMALARO DENIES GUILT IN HUBER SEX SLAYING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A handyman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to killing and sexually assaulting a 
young Newport Beach woman and stowing her nude, handcuffed body inside a 
running freezer for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Famalaro, 37, did not speak during the brief court hearing in Orange 
County Superior Court in Santa Ana.He showed no emotion when Deputy Public 
Defender Brian Ducker entered a plea of not guilty for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury on Thursday indicted Famalaro on kidnaping and 
murder charges and also added an allegation that he sexually assaulted his 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Lake Forest resident faces the death penalty in the slaying of 
Denise Huber, 23. She disappeared in June, 1991, and her body was found three 
years later in a running freezer at Famalaro's home in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The notoriety of the case has made Famalaro the subject of threats in the 
Orange County Men's Jail, where he is being held in protective custody, without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was arrested in July in Prescott, Ariz.  
</P>
<P>
 Huber was a UC Irvine graduate working as a waitress and department store 
clerk when she vanished on her way home from a rock concert in Inglewood. Her 
car was found with a flat tire on the shoulder of the Corona del Mar Freeway in 
Costa Mesa, less than two miles from where she lived with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Huber was kidnaped and killed in a Laguna Hills storage 
facility where Famalaro was illegally living at the time. An autopsy showed she 
was bludgeoned, possibly by a tool, and sodomized. RENE LYNCH

 Newport Beach and Costa Mesa are at peace today, but in the 1930s the 
neighboring cities took part in a fierce but friendly rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Things came to a head at Newport Harbor High School, which opened in 1930.The 
high school served students from both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the book "Historic Place Names of Orange County," students 
quickly came up with names to describe their rivals' hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach students referred to Costa Mesa as "Goat Hill" -- a reference to 
the vast farmland in the city. Costa Mesa students called Newport Beach 
"Mackerel Flat," a jab at the city's coastal location. Today

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; INPUT AGAIN SOUGHT ON TACO BELL PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate over a proposal to build a 24-hour Taco Bell across West Coast 
Highway from the Balboa Bay Club will resume Thursday night when the Planning 
Commission holds a second public hearing on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. wants to raze a vacant restaurant at 1400 W. 
Coast Highway and build a dine-in, take-out and 24-hour drive-through 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents of the bluff overlooking the proposed site have opposed the 
plan, fearing it will attract crime and generate late-night noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight people spoke against the project at the first public hearing Sept. 8. 
The commission, short two members that night, postponed a vote to give the 
chain's representatives time to meet with residents and Balboa Bay Club 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting did take place but the proposal returns to the commission 
unchanged, senior planner Javier Garcia said. A Taco Bell spokesman could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay club executive Dave Wooten said he reviewed the Taco Bell noise study and 
has no plans to oppose the project on behalf of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 A city traffic study projected the restaurant would draw 1,400 cars a day, 760 
of them specifically for the restaurant and the rest stopping on the way to 
other destinations.  
</P>
<P>
 The permit also may allow the franchise to operate with 10 fewer parking 
spaces than required under city codes and two lighted pole signs instead of the 
one normally allowed for such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing building, erected in 1966, has housed the Grinder, Guido's and 
Melee's -- all full-service restaurants with no drive-through or outdoor 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Also before the commission is another restaurateur's plan to put a crab-shaped 
awning over the front of a harbor-side eatery. Gary Coburn has asked the 
commission to decide whether his proposed awning for Joe's Crab Shack, 2607 W. 
Coast Highway, fits the city's definition of a sign. If it does, he will have 
to seek special permission from the city to install it. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is at 7:30 p.m. in council chambers, 3300 Newport Blvd.

 Police have released a composite sketch of a man who raped a woman Sept. 27 
after luring her to his parked van on the pretense that his infant had stopped 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a 21-year-old Huntington Beach woman, told investigators that the 
attack took place about 6 p.m. in an alley behind a commercial area at Beach 
Boulevard and Terry Drive.She said the man pushed her inside the late model, 
dark-blue van and held a gun to her head while he assaulted her. She was 
subsequently released at the scene, and the man fled south on Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Police describe the man as Latino, 30 to 35 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall 
and weighing 180 pounds. He was further described as having dark hair and a 
stubble of beard. He was wearing a turquoise shirt and gray sweat pants. The 
van was described as full-size, possibly a Dodge, with tinted windows and a 
rear-mounted spare-tire rack with no tire.  
</P>

Branch at (714) 536-5608. MARK I. PINSKY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SHOPPING CART SANCTIONS POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is weighing an ordinance that would levy substantial fines 
against grocery stores when their shopping carts are abandoned around town. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members at Monday's meeting unanimously voted to draft an ordinance 
that would seek fines from $25 to $250 against stores whose shopping carts are 
found outside the stores' premises unless the person with it has prior approval 
to remove the cart from the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we really need to do," said Councilman Peter F. Buffa. "All 
these carts being pushed around are running the neighborhood down." 
</P>
<P>
 City crews have reported an increase in abandoned carts citywide, and the 
crews were having to remove the carts from public right-of-way areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no opposition at a public hearing, the ordinance, based on similar 
ones passed in the cities of San Juan Capistrano and Glendale, would become law 
by the beginning of November. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the draft ordinance, the owners of shopping carts would be required to 
register their carts with the city. If city crews find the carts, then the 
businesses would be fined. Presently, not all shopping carts have serial 
numbers on them. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are unable to say whether the increase in shopping carts 
abandoned around the city is due to grocery stores no longer retrieving them or 
more people taking them off the premises. Removing a cart from a store premises 
without permission is a misdemeanor under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The city might also decide to hire a collection agency to pick up the carts. 
But cities such as San Juan Capistrano and Glendale have found that grocery 
stores usually resort to hiring their own collection companies rather than face 
being fined by the city. TOM RAGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mountain lion watch continues in the Turtle Rock community even though a 
rash of new sightings failed to produce any hard evidence of the big cats in 
the nearby wilderness area of William R. Mason Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But wildlife officials are taking no chances.They will keep the county 
wilderness trail in the regional park closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still haven't had confirmed evidence of any mountain lion sightings in 
that area," said Bruce Buchman, district supervisor for the central district of 
the county's regional park system. "We're not sure whether they're actually 
seeing a mountain lion or a bobcat or a large dog. But until we can confirm 
whether there's a mountain lion there or not, the trail will remain closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchman would not estimate how long the trail will be off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine animal services superintendent Carl Pagano said his agency has received 
six reports within the last few weeks of mountain lions near Turtle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had no situation where an animal has attacked anybody or killed a 
household pet," Pagano said. "We weren't able to conclusively find tracks or 
any evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain lions typically travel into new areas in pursuit of food, according 
to Pagano, who said it is not uncommon for people to confuse the smaller, 
shorter-tailed bobcat with a mountain lion. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who thinks they've sighted a mountain lion in the Turtle Rock area 
should call Irvine Animal Services at (714) 724-7740.RUSS LOAR

 The political action committee of the South Orange County Chambers of Commerce 
has endorsed the four incumbents running for reelection to the boards of the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School and Capistrano Unified School districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents are Dore J. Gilbert and Bobbee Cline in Saddleback Valley, and 
Annette B. Gude and Crystal Kochendorfer in Capistrano Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board endorsements are the first made by the organization in nearly 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gaughan, chair of the group's candidate selection process, said the 
school board incumbents drew the support of business leaders because of their 
concern over challengers, some of whom are accused of holding views supported 
by the religious right. Such challengers have denied the characterization.

ANAHEIM HIKES BED TAX TO AID DISNEYLAND AREA; REVITALIZATION: THE 2% LEVY WOULD

 The City Council gave tentative approval Tuesday to a hotel bed tax increase 
that will help fund a $172.5-million revitalization project around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3-0 to raise the bed tax by 2%, effective July 1, if the 
council gives it final approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim would then have the third-highest hotel bed tax in the nation. Only 
Columbus, Ohio, and Seattle will exceed Anaheim's new rate of 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major first step in the improvement around the Disneyland area," 
Mayor Tom Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob D. Simpson abstained because of business ties with the local 
hotel and motel industry. Councilman Fred Hunter was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, which has increased 63% since 1983, is expected to raise $5 million a 
year. All hotels in Anaheim would have to pay it, since they are expected to 
benefit from the revitalization plan. 
</P>

 Federal, state and regional transportation monies will pay for about 
two-thirds of the so-called Anaheim resort plan -- a beautification program 
involving 550 acres around Disneyland and the Anaheim Convention Center. City 
officials say that bed tax revenues, reserve fees and an upcoming reduction in 
convention center debt payments will generate the remaining one-third of the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials view the face lift as essential to keep Anaheim a magnet for 
tourists and convention center business. The program calls for massive 
landscaping, the burying of overhead cables, widening streets and walkways and 
other work. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted Tuesday to prepare a master plan for renovations of the 
convention center, including cost estimates. City officials tentatively 
estimate the cost at up to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel and convention center officials, concerned that Anaheim is losing 
tourist and convention center dollars to cities like San Francisco, San Diego 
and Las Vegas, applauded the council's decisions Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are no longer the crown jewel of California when it comes to convention 
center business," said Charles W. Ahlers, president of the Area Visitor and 
Convention Bureau. "The convention center is in need of help." 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials warned that if work estimates are higher than $60 
million, some funding from the resort area improvements may be redirected to 
the convention center. The resort area improvements would be still performed, 
but delayed, said city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the resort plan on Sept. 20, culminating seven years of 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The area contributes $7 million to $10 million annually in net revenue to the 
city. Officials estimate that those figures would rise by as much as 60% when 
the refurbishments are done, which could occur by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ambitious program. It is not without risks," Deputy City Manager 
Tom Wood said in a report to the City Council. "But this is even more true of 
doing nothing." Revitalizing Anaheim Nearly $64 million is still needed for a 
$172.5-million urban renewal program around Disneyland. Funds still outstanding 
would go to six programs. Amounts in millions of dollars: Program: Right of way 
Amount needed: $27.7 *

 Program: Landscaping Amount needed: $12.5 *

 Police have arrested a Huntington Beach man who allegedly robbed a liquor 
store Monday afternoon and then hijacked a car after he crashed his truck 
trying to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Warren Vines, 40, was eventually chased down on foot.He is being held 
at County Jail on suspicion of robbery, carjacking, hit-and-run and evading 
arrest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretending to have a gun under his shirt, Vines held up a clerk for an 
undisclosed amount of cash from M & M Liquor Store in the 15000 block of 
Magnolia Street, police Lt. Richard Main said. During his getaway, Vines 
crashed his truck into a car near Bolsa Avenue and Magnolia, disabling the 
truck and slightly injuring Vines and the other driver, Main said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines fled into the neighborhood and seized a Toyota Cressida from a man 
arriving home from work, police said. An officer in a patrol car spotted the 
stolen car and briefly chased it until Vines jumped out and ran near the corner 
of Garden Grove and Beach boulevards, Main said. Vines was captured soon after, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vines is being held on $50,000 bail.

SANTA ANA GANG HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF SECOND PROBE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: GROUP THAT 
CLAIMS TURF ON TWO BLOCKS OF 3RD STREET WAS ALREADY THE FOCUS OF A CONCERTED 
CRACKDOWN BEFORE A SEPT. 7 POLICE SWEEP CRIPPLED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A high-profile police sweep of 3rd Street recently focused a spotlight on the 
troubled neighborhood in an effort to cripple the gang that claims it, but the 
same gang has also been the main target of a separate, ongoing law enforcement 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters briefed the City Council on 
the Street Terrorist Offender Program (STOP) for the first time since its 
January inception, and revealed that the 6th Street gang, which claims two 
blocks of 3rd Street as the core of its turf, has been the operation's main 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been pleasantly surprised with the numbers of arrests that we had 
been able to make in such a short time," said Capt. Dan McCoy, who coordinates 
STOP. "The bottom line is it has been effective." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the status report released Monday night, certain street crimes in 
an area that includes 3rd Street were 54% lower between January and June than 
in the previous six-month period. Of 119 suspects targeted by STOP as gang 
criminals, 55 have been arrested. Nineteen have been successfully prosecuted, 
36 are awaiting trial, and a charge has been dropped against only one suspect, 
McCoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also seized 44 firearms from gang members since January. 
</P>
<P>
 STOP was modeled after Westminster's Tri-Agency Resource Gang Enforcement 
Team, or TARGET, and combines prosecutors, district attorney's investigators, 
probation officers, and federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms officials in 
teams with Santa Ana police officers in a concerted effort to target violent 
gang leaders. A second STOP team was formed in June, and Walters said he 
expected a third team would formed by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on 3rd Street say their neighborhood had been calm for months before 
the dramatic police raid on Sept. 7 dubbed Operation Roundup -- a calm that 
authorities now attribute in part to STOP's activities in the 6th Street gang's 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy said that 40 of the 130 suspects eventually indicted in Operation 
Roundup on drug charges were arrested and jailed under STOP for other street 
crimes before the end of Roundup's five-month undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus has been on violent crime. Roundup was through the narcotics 
avenue. It was another way of getting to these people," McCoy said. "Operation 
Roundup was highly successful. If anything, it makes us very happy in that it 
validated what we were saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those indicted in Operation Roundup were captured on videotape making 
drug sales, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has announced that when those prosecuted under 
Operation Roundup are released from custody, they will be referred to the STOP 
program for vigilant parole supervision, said Lt. William Tegeler, who 
supervised Operation Roundup. 
</P>
<P>
 Tegeler said the two operations complemented one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them were the same targets. We would already have a (drug) buy or two 
from them. STOP would have a robbery case on them, go ahead and indict them and 
get them off the streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy said that two gangs that associate with the 6th Street gang were also 
targeted, and that STOP also adopted four cases outside of those gang targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested by STOP include one 18-year old in custody who McCoy said has 
confessed to 20 gang-related shootings, during which he attacked at least four 
people; 50 street robberies, and 100 auto thefts from Santa Ana neighborhoods. 
He said a 14-year-old targeted by STOP has been linked to a homicide and 
several robberies. He has escaped twice from a juvenile facility and is now at 
large.

 PARENTS' NIGHT OUT: Students at Pio Pico Elementary in Santa Ana generally 
come from a low-income area, but that doesn't mean their parents don't want a 
good education for them. Nearly 200 of those parents graduate themselves 
tonight. They've completed an eight-session training course designed to help 
them prepare their youngsters for college. . . . "Parents at this school are 
amazing," says its principal, Judith Magsaysay. "That represents 85% of our 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 SUPERVISOR PARKS: Two county parks soon to open were renamed today by county 
supervisors -- after two of their own. Bolsa Chica Regional Park in Huntington 
Beach will become "Harriett M. Wieder Regional Park" and Wagon Wheel Regional 
Park in Coto de Caza will become "Gen. Thomas F. Riley Regional Park." . . . 
County staff made the suggestion, and Supervisor William G. Steiner pushed it, 
adding that Riley and Wieder -- both retiring -- played key roles in creating 
the parks that now bear their name. 
</P>
<P>
 PIONEER RILEY: Riley will be honored on his retirement at a Hyatt Regency 
Irvine dinner Thursday night. But there's another Riley being honored too. . . 
. A fund has been established to honor both the general and his wife, Emma 
Jane, who has been a leader in charity work since the Rileys moved here 30 
years ago. She's involved with Catholic charities, led drives to help orphans 
and battered children, and helped support groups at both Chapman University and 
UC Irvine. . . . Says Emma Jane Riley: "I come from a family of pioneers. It 
was expected of us." 
</P>
<P>
 F FOR FAMILY: Santa Ana Police Lt. Felix G. Osuna must have impressed his 260 
fellow cops -- from 48 states and 16 countries -- while recently attending the 
prestigious three-month FBI National Academy Program at Quantico, Va. They 
picked the 21-year veteran, commander of Santa Ana's SWAT team, to speak for 
the class at their graduation. . . . "It was an incredible honor," Osuna says. 
"We're all family now."

DENNIS WOLFBERG; GIFTED STAND-UP COMIC WAS 48 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Wolfberg, who won an American Comedy Award in 1990 as best male 
stand-up comedian and was twice voted America's top male comic, died Monday. He 
was 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfberg died of melanoma at his Culver City home, publicist Lori Jonas 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Wolfberg had given benefit performances for the Wellness 
Community, which aids cancer patients, after a high school friend developed 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfberg was known for his unusual delivery, in which he would squint, then 
bulge out his eyes and puff his cheeks, literally squeezing out words as if he 
were passing kidney stones. Critics have called him "perhaps the most verbally 
adroit comic working today . . . flat-out hilarious" and "one of those rare 
comics who can take the simplest moments of life and turn them into the 
greatest laughs you'll ever have." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that he was flattered when other comics attempted to imitate him, 
Wolfberg said in a 1991 Times interview that his use of his unusual eyes just 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in no way calculated," he said. "I am truly not aware of anything I do 
with my eyes. It's not an affectation, but it seems to work comedically." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Long Island, N.Y., Wolfberg attended Queen's College and taught 
sixth grade in the South Bronx for 12 years. He also received a master's degree 
in clinical psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving into stand-up comedy in the mid-1970s, Wolfberg drew on his teaching 
experience for material. Later, when he married former stand-up comic Jeannie 
McBride at the age of 39 and fathered three sons, he created routines based on 
their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically," he once said, "the crux of my act is my own life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfberg starred in his own half-hour comedy special on HBO in 1990. He also 
appeared in a recurring role as a strange scientist on the television series 
"Quantum Leap" and was a frequent guest on "The Tonight Show," "The Merv 
Griffin Show" and others. He has been profiled by "Entertainment Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that memorial donations be made to Dennis Wolfberg's 
Melanoma Gene Therapy Fund, UCLA Johnson Cancer Center Foundation, 9-667 Louis 
Factor Building, 10833 La Conte, Los Angeles, Calif. 90024-1781.

LINA BASQUETTE; STAR OF SILENT MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lina Basquette, the raven-haired dancer and actress best remembered as the 
leading lady in Cecil B. DeMille's final silent film "The Godless Girl," has 
died. She was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 She died Friday at her home in Wheeling, W.V., from lymphoma, her grandson, 
Michael Hiatt, said Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Basquette, who spent her later years breeding and judging Great Dane 
champion dogs, was born Lena Baskette on April 19, 1907, in San Mateo, Calif. 
An RCA Victor representative spotted her dancing to phonograph records in her 
father's drugstore when she was 7 and hired her to advertise Victrolas at the 
San Francisco World Fair in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by a stage mother, the child star was signed by Universal to make a 
series of silent films titled "Lena Baskette Featurettes." Taught by her 
stepfather, dance instructor Ernest Belcher, she attracted the patronage of 
ballerina Nina Pavlova and was sometimes called "Pavlova Junior." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Basquette respelled her name in 1923, the year she became the principal 
ballerina for the Ziegfeld Follies. When she appeared in Ziegfeld's "Louie the 
14th" a couple of years later, Sam Warner, one of the four co-founding Warner 
Bros., fell in love with her. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the first of her many husbands and they had a daughter, Lita. When 
Warner died suddenly, shortly before Warner Bros.' "The Jazz Singer" injected 
sound into the film industry, Miss Basquette became a 20-year-old widow. She 
lost everything, the estate and custody of her child -- whom she did not see 
for 32 years -- in bitter court battles with the Warner family. 
</P>
<P>
 With many marriages and more storied affairs, Miss Basquette enjoyed recalling 
in her later years how she fended off Adolf Hitler with a sharp knee to the 
groin and an assertion that her grandfather was Jewish. In 1943, a U.S. soldier 
in Los Angeles was sentenced to 20 years in prison for raping her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in nature and I believe most men are wonderful," she said last 
year. "I used to fall in love with very attractive people. And I didn't go for 
one-night stands. I fell in love and when you fell in love in my day, you got 
married, you didn't shack up." 
</P>
<P>
 After "The Godless Girl" in 1929, Miss Basquette's on-screen popularity waned. 
She appeared in several Buck Jones and Hoot Gibson Westerns in the 1930s. Her 
only recent performance was as a grandmother in a 1991 independent film, 
"Paradise Park." 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, she published what was meant as the first installment of her 
memoirs, "Lina: DeMille's Godless Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Basquette was fond of saying that dogs saved her after men almost ruined 
her. From the 1950s through the 1970s, she operated Honey Hollow Kennels in 
Bucks County, Pa., and became the single biggest winner of Great Dane events in 
dog history, primarily with all-time champion "Special K." 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring from breeding dogs in 1983, she worked as a judge for the 
American Kennel Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1989 profile in the New Yorker renewed interest in Miss Basquette's old 
films. She was honored at a standing-room-only screening last year at the 
National Gallery of Art in Washington and made several appearances at the 
Silent Movie in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Basquette is survived by her daughter, Lita Warner Heller; her son, 
Edward Alvin Hayes; her half-sister, actress-dancer Marge Champion, and several 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

DUB TAYLOR; CHARACTER ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dub Taylor, the grizzled character actor who appeared in about 500 Westerns 
and other films over six decades, including this summer's "Maverick," has died. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran actor died Monday night at Westlake Convalescent Hospital, his 
family said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Georgia-born Walter Clarence Taylor II began his career in vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his film debut in the legendary Frank Capra's 1938 classic "You Can't 
Take It With You" and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have just been lucky and I like people," Taylor mused in a 1992 Times 
interview. "I had one of the greatest directors start me off in the business. . 
. . I just loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor clearly enjoyed his work but never took himself or the film industry 
too seriously. "Acting," he once said, "is the most embarrassing business in 
the world. You never know when you're going to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was an avid hunter who frequently traveled to Mexico, Taylor often 
said he would never retire. "I can't retire," he said at age 84. "I got too 
many damn bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Often seen as a heavyset cowboy or hillbilly, Taylor portrayed Cannonball, the 
lovable sidekick of Western hero Bill Elliott in several feature films of the 
1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his other memorable roles were Andy Griffith's father in "No Time for 
Sergeants" in 1968, the father of a gang member in "Bonnie and Clyde" in 1967 
and the crotchety 80-year-old grandfather of John Cougar Mellencamp in "Falling 
From Grace" in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was described as "the glorious Dub Taylor" in a Times review of the 
recent "Maverick," starring Mel Gibson and James Garner and including a gallery 
of Western character actors. 
</P>
<P>
 A widower who lived in Woodland Hills, Taylor is survived by his son, actor 
Buck Taylor; daughter, Faydean Tharp, and several grandchildren.

SIMPSON TEAM GIVEN RIGHT TO POLICE PAPERS; TRIAL: ITO ORDERS VOLUMES OF RECORDS 
AND PHOTOS ON ACTIVITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE TURNED OVER TO THE DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to end a running battle in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito has ordered police and prosecutors to turn over to the 
defense volumes of paperwork detailing police activity at the outset of the 
double murder case, according to court papers released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items to be given to defense lawyers are photographs of the shoes 
that law enforcement workers wore at the murder scene, where bloody shoe prints 
were found. The defense also wants results of any preliminary blood tests done 
on the shoes of investigators and others who were there. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the judge ordered prosecutors to provide reports from Detective 
Mark Fuhrman about a 1985 incident in which Fuhrman went to the Simpson home to 
investigate a domestic disturbance call. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, and is being held without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to be in court today for a proceeding at which Ito will hear 
arguments about which pieces of evidence will be allowed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 At that hearing, Ito, who has exhibited increasing impatience with the news 
media, also will hear defense arguments contending that the judge should 
question police and members of the prosecution team to determine if they are 
the source of news leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaked stories -- some of them false -- prompted Ito on Monday to schedule a 
Nov. 7 hearing that could result in a ban on the Court TV camera that during 
pretrial hearings made live film available to the scores of television news 
operations that are covering the case. 
</P>
<P>
 As media organizations gear up to fight a possible television ban, the Los 
Angeles Daily News filed court papers Tuesday protesting a decision by Ito to 
bar the paper from his courtroom during the Simpson trial. The order apparently 
is in response to the paper's publication of a story based on a blank jury 
questionnaire obtained before the judge officially released the document. 
</P>
<P>
 Court spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett confirmed that Ito has said the San 
Fernando Valley-based newspaper will get no permanent seat in the courtroom 
once seating arrangements for the trial are made and that it will not be on a 
list of news organizations that will share seats on a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kaye, managing editor of the Daily News, would not comment, saying the 
court papers speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In its filing, the Daily News asserts that it lawfully obtained the 
questionnaire, did nothing illegal in the process and is unaware that anyone 
stole the document. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it did not harm Simpson's rights, the paper contends, "there is no 
basis in law or fact for a punitive order barring one reporter from access to 
parts of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli Sager, a media lawyer who has represented The Times on 1st Amendment 
issues, said that if the Daily News is right about how it obtained the 
document, the law is on its side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is true that under the law a news organization cannot be 
punished for receiving information as long as they didn't do anything illegal 
in getting it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, in an interview Monday, said that because he had not publicly released 
the blank questionnaire, he considered the Daily News' possession of it a 
felony theft of a court document. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily News complaint is scheduled to be heard Nov. 7, when Ito also will 
hear arguments about his proposed ban on the Court TV camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's clerk on Tuesday said letters favoring such a ban are pouring into 
Ito's chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, Deirdre Robertson, said the letters were prompted by a piece by 
Mike Royko, the Chicago-based syndicated newspaper columnist, who urged his 
readers to send the judge their thoughts on a camera ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone through about 1,000 (letters) and about 90% are about (the proposed 
ban)," Robertson said. Of those, most favor throwing out the television camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Tuesday, it was disclosed that Ito has scheduled an 
Oct. 14 hearing to determine whether items from Simpson's Ford Bronco should be 
disallowed as evidence on the grounds that once police seized the vehicle, they 
left it unattended at a tow yard, where it was burglarized by an employee of 
the yard and suffered unaccounted-for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle was towed from outside Simpson's home the day after the murders 
after police found what they thought was a blood droplet on a door handle and a 
smear of blood on the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglary of the Bronco occurred two days later and was not reported for 26 
days, according to court papers. As a result of the incident, the employee was 
fired and the tow yard lost its police contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the police handling of the Bronco, Simpson's lawyers contend, Ito 
should not allow into evidence 46 items removed from it in five searches after 
the burglary. The lawyers argue that no one can be sure those items were in the 
vehicle when it was towed from the street outside Simpson's estate. Dear Judge 
Ito: Judge Lance A. Ito has received more than 1,000 letters since newspaper 
columnist Mike Royko called for a citizen rebellion against TV coverage of the 
O.J. Simpson trial. Some excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, please exercise the power you have to cut off all TV coverage of the 
O.J. Simpson case. It really serves no good purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane F. Finley, Oak Brook, Ill. "We are saturated with it -- TV, radio, 
newspaper. How much can we take? P.S.: Our sympathy is with O.J., guilty or 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. and Mrs. Zino Bove, Long Beach "Enough is enough. We are sick of it. 
Please use your authority to do this. Many people would be very grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Pike, Downey "Please exclude TV coverage in the O.J. Simpson trial. I 
feel it is a disgrace to televise such a case or any case for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Kenealy, Chicago 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito's To Do List: 1. Pull the plug on the media. 2. Impose the gag 
order. 3. Sequester jurors for the duration of the trial. 4. Admit any and all 
evidence. 5. Let cameras in only for the verdict."

SUPERVISORS DIG DEEP FOR BUDGET PLAN; SPENDING: OFFICIALS SCRUTINIZE RESERVE 
ACCOUNTS AND RAISE TAX REVENUE ESTIMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what has become an annual ritual, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday shook out all the old purses and checked pockets for the 
spare change -- make that spare millions -- that is badly needed to balance the 
precarious $14.5-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months into the new fiscal year, the time had come for the supervisors 
to finalize the annual spending plan, and as in most years they were facing 
more needs than revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 After rummaging through all the old reserve accounts and special funds, county 
officials turned up a few million dollars, but there was still not enough. So 
the supervisors simply raised their estimates of this year's tax revenues and 
set about spending the newfound money. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed advised the board that its ploy 
was risky and unwise, but the board went ahead and identified about $32 million 
in new revenues and new ways to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 The board first set aside $11.7 million to help law enforcement agencies cope 
with the added expenses of enforcing the new "three strikes and you're out" 
law. Of those funds, the supervisors immediately gave the district attorney 
$4.1 million to hire prosecutors, investigators and clerical help. They also 
gave the district attorney $2 million from another account to help correct 
weaknesses identified in a recent grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the law enforcement reserve funds will be doled out later to 
the Sheriff's Department, probation, public defender's and other departments as 
their needs are quantified. The board agreed, however, that new employees 
should be put on short-term contracts rather than assigned to permanent 
positions because there may not be enough money to keep them on the payroll 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the newfound cash couldn't solve all the board's nagging budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the board found $22.5 million in new funds to save the library system 
from drastic cuts, an ongoing philosophical debate kept the supervisors from 
mustering a majority to actually allocate the money.  
</P>
<P>
 Two board members, Supervisors Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Ed Edelman, said 
they prefer to fund the libraries through a recently adopted tax that would 
raise about $15 million. The two supervisors say the tax, approved by the board 
six weeks ago, is the only way to assure library funding in the future. They 
argued that the county's general revenues should not be paying for libraries 
that only serve limited parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment would affect property owners in the unincorporated county areas 
and 16 independent cities that decided to join the assessment district. The 
annual fee would cost the average homeowner about $28.50. 
</P>
<P>
 When the board narrowly approved the tax in August, Supervisor Gloria Molina 
said she would change her position and vote to rescind it if surplus money 
could be found. Now that the board has come up with the extra funds, Molina 
said Tuesday that she is prepared to vote down the tax at a special hearing set 
for Oct 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not support taxing the taxpayer . . . when we have funds in hand," 
Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a procedural quirk, Molina and her anti-tax allies, Supervisors Mike 
Antonovich and Deane Dana, could not approve spending the newly found $22.5 
million. That procedure takes four votes and neither Burke nor Edelman would 
give ground. 
</P>
<P>
 So although both camps want to aid the libraries, their actions could leave 
the troubled department with no new funds and no taxing authority. The issue 
will come to a showdown at next week's special hearing.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: CASE MAY TURN ON JURY'S GRASP OF DNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a dozen of the written questions handed to potential jurors in the 
O.J. Simpson murder trial inquire about their understanding of blood sampling, 
molecular biology, mathematics and other aspects of science. 
</P>
<P>
 This interest in science by Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito and the 
prosecution and defense, who wrote the questionnaire, points up something we 
all know -- the importance of DNA testing to the outcome of the trial. The 
curiosity about jurors' knowledge of science, and their attitudes toward it, 
also is a reminder that both the prosecution and defense need to explain DNA to 
jurors who may know nothing of science -- and may be hostile toward it. 
</P>
<P>
 For, in the end, the case may well be decided by the jurors' understanding of 
the role of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is found in cells and determines 
how our bodies grow. As C.R. Calladine and Horace A. Drew wrote in 
"Understanding DNA," our bodies "are made from billions of individual cells and 
DNA is the control center of each and every cell," shaping us as if it were 
sending out "memos from the main office of a factory to its workshops." 
</P>
<P>
 DNA varies from person to person and, according to a 1990 study by Congress' 
Office of Technology Assessment, tests "can accurately disclose DNA patterns 
that reflect DNA differences among humans." 
</P>
<P>
 DNA analysts say chances of two people having the same pattern are so remote 
that they express them with outrageous figures, such as 1 in 24 million or even 
1 in 27 trillion. But some judges have insisted that the statistical 
probability is much greater, such as 1 in 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This numbers dispute is crucial to the Simpson case. The prosecution maintains 
that DNA found in blood and hair samples at Nicole Brown Simpson's Brentwood 
townhouse and O.J. Simpson's nearby mansion link him -- and no one else -- to 
her murder and that of her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The questionnaire probed prospective jurors' attitudes on whether the 
prosecution contention is valid: What is your view concerning the reliability 
of DNA analysis to accurately identify a person as the possible source of blood 
or hair found at a crime scene?  
</P>
<P>
 General knowledge of DNA was important. The questionnaire seemed to be trying 
to determine whether jurors would come to the courtroom with preconceived 
notions on the subject. They were asked if they had read any book, articles or 
magazines concerning DNA analysis? Were they aware of other court cases 
involving DNA analysis? 
</P>
<P>
 This was followed by questions probing a knowledge of science in general. 
Among them: Have you ever taken courses in population genetics, statistics or 
molecular biology? Have you had any specialized training in medicine, science 
or biology? How comfortable do you feel dealing with mathematical concepts? 
</P>
<P>
 Other questions delved into personal experiences that might make a juror 
hostile or friendly toward science: Have you or anyone close to you undergone 
an amniocentesis? Were you confident of the results? Have you ever provided a 
urine or blood sample to be analyzed?  
</P>
<P>
 Another group of questions sought to determine attitudes toward "experts," 
whether jurors were skeptical of them or tended to accept what they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In back of those questions was the knowledge by the judge and the attorneys 
that DNA testing is fairly new to crime-solving, and that most jurors know 
nothing of it. In fact, many of the jurors had left school before the basic 
concepts of DNA structure were understood. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time the procedure was used to solve a crime was in the mid-'80s 
when a distinguished British geneticist, Dr. Alec Jeffreys, showed that the DNA 
in a blood sample matched that in semen found in two rape-murder victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, it has been used in a number of criminal cases. Despite its 
growing acceptance, though, both judges and lawyers have been concerned about 
whether jurors can understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of California's leading prosecution DNA experts, Deputy Dist. Atty. George 
W. Clarke of San Diego County, made that point in a recent article in a legal 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
 He quoted a California appellate court opinion in which the justices seemed to 
be admitting that neither they nor jurors could understand the concept of DNA. 
"We cannot reasonably ask the average juror to decide such arcane questions . . 
. when we ourselves have struggled to grasp these concepts," the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judicial system encourages resistance to new scientific techniques," 
Clarke told me. "Judges fear jurors will blind themselves to the rest of the 
evidence. They believe we can't let jurors hear (scientific evidence) because 
they can't critically examine the techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the judges are afraid that the jurors will be conned by the 
experts while the prosecutors, wanting DNA evidence admitted, say jurors are 
smart enough to understand the science. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Kahn, the DNA expert on the Simpson 
prosecution team, knows about the difficulty of selling DNA evidence in a 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she successfully prosecuted Henry Wilds, who eventually was sentenced 
to 49 years in prison for sexual assaults and robberies of two San Fernando 
Valley women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned that it would be too complex, but it was my experience that 
there is a way to present it to a jury as long you understand your audience and 
present it in a way that is understandable," Kahn told me. ". . . It is my 
experience that jurors are very interested in scientific evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 case, Kahn's first witness was a well-known DNA lab official who, 
Kahn said, taught the jury fundamentals. He was followed by a distinguished 
Yale geneticist who continued the teaching process, explaining DNA even more. 
There were many more experts testifying on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the importance of communicating DNA complexities to the jury, the 
defense is sending in two nationally known attorneys, Peter Neufeld and Barry 
Scheck, who are experts in challenging the admissibility of DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 When the DNA lawyers take over, they will be arguing over the heart and soul 
of the Simpson case. And, unlike much of what has been presented to the public 
and in court so far, it will take more than a sound bite to explain.

ROCKING THE BOAT; MUSICIAN FIGHTS FOR DISABLED ACCESS TO MARKETS -- AND THE 
MUSIC INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He came to town eight years ago to be the world's first quadriplegic rock 
star, only to run into a music industry he says is not ready for an idol in a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not many people are ready for Dorik Perman. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the self-styled "Notorious Godfather of the Disabled," leader of a 
Hollywood-based group of militants who call themselves the Coalition of 
Disabled Enforcers. 
</P>
<P>
 His telephone answering machine unapologetically proclaims: "You have reached 
CODE, the Coalition of Disabled Enforcers, when not only are the disabled in 
your face, America, but we don't say 'pretty please' about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Muscular dystrophy has left Perman, 39, with very limited movement of his 
fingers and arms, but he has full movement of his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media always wants to show the disabled as frustrated," he says. "But our 
people are damned mad." 
</P>
<P>
 That anger is fueled daily, he says, whenever he encounters a building without 
a wheelchair-access ramp, a business without a counter low enough to 
accommodate wheelchairs, an able-bodied driver parking in a space for the 
handicapped or a market that locks wheelchair access gates next to its 
turnstiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "By locking those gates inside the store, supermarkets have locked out the 
disabled," Perman says. "I can't put into words how it feels to go to a 
supermarket to buy food, and I'm locked out. This is a hate crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever he finds a locked gate in a market, "I start swearing and become 
hard-core belligerent," he says. "What if it were a 'gay entrance' and it were 
locked? Gays would be burning down the store. What if it said 'women's 
entrance' and it was locked?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Perman took on his neighborhood Bank of America branch at Sunset 
Boulevard and Vine Street, charging that the bank violated building codes when 
it raised the overall height of teller counters. 
</P>
<P>
 He filed a complaint with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, 
which enforces accessibility requirements under state law. City inspectors 
investigated and issued an order Tuesday requiring the bank to lower at least 
one of its teller windows to a height of 28 to 34 inches. A bank spokesman said 
that he had not yet seen the order but that bank officials will sit down with 
city inspectors to determine what adjustments need to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am ecstatic," Perman said Tuesday. "We have gotten the city to respond to 
the fullest extent of the law. I see this as a major victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Perman's harshness has estranged him from mainstream leaders of the disabled 
community of Los Angeles, many of whom consider him irresponsible. Unmoved, 
Perman has a pet saying: "The Godfather is always right." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's principal building inspector, Henry Porter, who prepared the order 
against the bank, does not subscribe to that view. Porter said Perman 
physically threatened him and his supervisor, Ron Shigeta, on Monday, allegedly 
telling both men they had "better watch your backs." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is serious and not something to take lightly," Porter said Tuesday of 
Perman's comment. "We will refer it to the city attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Perman said anything he said that could have been construed as a 
threat was in response to what he originally thought would be the city's 
"non-action" on his complaint against the bank. He said his remarks Monday came 
before he knew that the bank would be required to lower one teller window. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perman, still pursuing the rock 'n' roll dream that brought him here, wears 
his shoulder-length hair in a ponytail and often wears a red cap with its bill 
turned up. He gets around in an electric wheelchair and specially equipped van 
driven by Debra Dae, his nurse and girlfriend for 15 years. Dae, who plays 
guitar and bass, is also the "rock 'n' roll nurse" in his nightclub act. 
</P>
<P>
 Communication between the couple transcends speech and gestures. On an unseen 
signal, Dae, 32, moves to Perman's chair and places a tissue at his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she responds to an unspoken request to prop Perman's left elbow on his 
wheelchair, allowing him to rest his head on his hand. Moments later, she lifts 
Perman's head back to an upright position and returns his arm to his side. 
</P>
<P>
 In Perman's early years in Los Angeles, he and Dae played the Roxy, the 
Whisky, Gazzarri's and Club Lingerie, and picked up good reviews. The walls of 
their Hollywood apartment are festooned with flyers from those club dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other flyers chronicle Perman's history of protest. A 1990 poster announces 
"The Major Label Protest Tour," demonstrations against the absence of disabled 
rock performers. "Picketing will continue until your (record company) rosters 
include at least one disabled minority act and we hear about it," the poster 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The picketing failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Perman has taken to the streets as a highly visible agitator 
demanding respect for the rights of the disabled. In 1992, he attacked Rebuild 
L.A. and the city of Compton for a widely praised Taco Bell restaurant built 
rapidly as a symbol of a new spirit following the riots that year. The 
restaurant, Perman charged, failed to comply with disabled access laws. 
</P>
<P>
 When City Atty. James K. Hahn announced a 1992 crackdown on local businesses 
that fail to accommodate the disabled, Perman dismissed it as a "toe dance for 
the media." He still calls enforcement of access laws "a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, however, Perman was the voice of restraint, criticizing disabled 
activists for picketing the home of a judge who reversed a jury verdict 
awarding $7.5 million to a paralyzed woman raped in a North Hollywood nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go to the courthouse," Perman said. "Don't go to his house and start 
harassing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Perman says he often tires of "being the heavy all the time" in the struggle 
for rights of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dae says the music is all that keeps them from bursting with anger. Either you 
explode, she says, "or you try to play some music to mellow out." 
</P>
<P>
 Their club dates have practically dried up these days, but Perman still writes 
music and scripts. He has also turned his attention to producing a "gangsta 
rap" video starring Dae. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of the mellowing out does not remove one constant: his wheelchair and 
the stereotypes that go with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Being in the chair, he says, is tantamount to being part of a separate ethnic 
or racial minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell people my skin is silver," he says, "because the first thing 
they see is my silver wheelchair."

CITY ETHICS PANEL OKS MARATHON FIRM FINES; SETTLEMENT: MOST MEMBERS EXPRESS 
REGRET THAT ORGANIZATION LEADER WAS NOT FORCED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Ethics Commission on Tuesday reluctantly agreed to settle 
money laundering allegations against the firm that runs the Los Angeles 
Marathon, with a majority of the panel members saying they were disappointed 
that marathon President William Burke was not forced to accept culpability in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The action requires Los Angeles Marathon Inc. to pay a $200,000 fine for 
hiding the fact it was the true source of nearly 100 political contributions 
totaling $51,000 to candidates in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, who has directed the commercial marathon for nine years, last month 
signed a settlement with the Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission stating that his organization had laundered campaign 
donations. But he was not personally cited for money laundering. A former top 
aide, George Beasley, admitted to illegally funneling marathon funds to 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's public hearing, three of five ethics commissioners said they 
strongly suspected that Burke -- husband of Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke -- knew of the money laundering scheme. But they said 
their agency could not produce conclusive evidence of Burke's involvement 
because Beasley accepted full blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have somebody in this scheme who was willing to take all of the 
responsibility," Ethics Commission Chairman Dennis Curtis said. "But I think we 
all understand . . . that there are other footprints and fingerprints all over 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke did not attend the Ethics Commission hearing, but his attorney released 
a statement that said Burke and marathon Vice President Marie Patrick knew 
nothing of the money laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, in part, read: "An employee of the corporation used corporate 
funds to make the contributions without authorization by the principals. 
Nevertheless, the corporation is accepting responsibility for not monitoring 
the situation more closely." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement also said that an outside accounting firm has been hired to 
prevent a repeat of the problems. Attorney Lance Olson declined to respond to 
the comments made by commissioners during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's unanimous vote to accept the settlement ends a three-year 
investigation by the Ethics Commission and the FPPC. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agency is scheduled Thursday to consider a similar settlement in the 
case, which includes another $22,000 in illicit contributions to candidates 
outside of Los Angeles. The state agency is due to receive a $236,000 fine, 
paid over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stipulations, Burke acknowledged that he had personally signed or 
authorized others to sign his name to more than $37,000 in checks that went to 
Beasley or Beasley's company. That money, and other marathon funds, were in 
turn used by Beasley to pay back contributors to eight Los Angeles City Council 
members, former Mayor Tom Bradley, three unsuccessful council candidates, 
Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris and state Controller Gray Davis, according to the 
twin settlements with the city and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 By funneling the contributions through others, the marathon was able to exceed 
city and state limits on campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public established limits on campaign contributions to diffuse the 
distortion of the political process that money can have," said Ethics 
Commissioner Edwin Guthman, a USC journalism professor. "This was a blatant 
attempt to circumvent those limits." 
</P>
<P>
 The contributions to local politicians were made about the time in 1991 when 
the marathon firm was seeking an extension of its contract to put on the race. 
The City Council unanimously approved the new contract through 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Guthman, Curtis and Commissioner Treesa W. Drury expressed incredulity that 
Burke, the majority shareholder in the marathon, would not have known about the 
money laundering operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In intensive questioning of the Ethics Commission staff, Guthman and Curtis 
noted that Burke admitted to personally authorizing the transfer of marathon 
funds to Beasley. 
</P>
<P>
 An Ethics Commission staff report also noted that those who were reimbursed 
for their contributions included Burke's parents as well as other relatives and 
marathon employees. Three contributions were even made in the name of Burke's 
yacht, Star in Motion, according to the report. Those three checks were signed 
by a onetime marathon employee who also was skipper of Burke's boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Guthman asked why Burke wasn't personally forced to accept responsibility, or 
at least to testify under oath. "So many times in public life now people don't 
take responsibility for what they do," Guthman said. "And here we are aiding 
and abetting . . . someone avoiding responsibility, and that troubles me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rebecca Avila, deputy director of the Ethics Commission, said the 
investigators could not prove Burke knew of the laundering operation once his 
longtime confidant, Beasley, accepted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words you had someone who was . . . willing to say he was fully 
responsible," Curtis said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; U.S. GIVES 
$4.66 MILLION FOR PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grant of $4.66 million has been awarded to build 40 units of public 
housing scattered around Los Angeles as replacements for low-income apartments 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake, officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The award to the Housing Authority will be used to build low-rise apartments 
or townhouses designed to blend into neighborhoods, said Don Smith, the Housing 
Authority's executive director.Tenants will not necessarily be people displaced 
by the quake, but the subsidized housing will help ease the shortage of 
affordable apartments made worse by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials announced the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development award 
in front of a seven-unit building under construction on North Tularosa Drive in 
Silver Lake. They said that building's design, which makes it look like a 
small, private condominium complex, is an example of what the agency wants to 
construct elsewhere.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MALIBU; TEEN-AGER 
STABBED TO DEATH BY 6 MEN AT TOPANGA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old boy was fatally stabbed by six men Tuesday morning while 
visiting Topanga State Beach with a friend, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name was not released, died at Santa Monica Hospital at 12:35 
a.m., approximately half an hour after he was attacked, said sheriff's 
spokesman Gabe Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who apparently was visiting from abroad, and a female companion 
were approached by the men, who had driven into the parking lot in two cars 
near Coastline Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 An argument ensued, and the boy began to run down the beach. The suspects 
tackled him and stabbed him several times, Ramirez said. The boy's friend was 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators do not have a description of the vehicles or the killers. Anyone 
with information about the crime is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at 
(213) 890-5500.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNEY; APPEALS COURT 
TO TAKE UP ISSUE OF ANONYMOUS JURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has ordered that a Downey trial be postponed until the 
justices can decide whether an anonymous jury should be used. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief order, the 2nd District Court of Appeal said that the use of 
anonymous juries raises a "novel and important issue of law."The court asked 
that additional written briefs be submitted and scheduled oral arguments for 
Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey case, in which Dennis Jansen is accused of violating a restraining 
order, has been closely watched because it could be the first to resolve 
whether jurors can be anonymous without a compelling reason such as the threat 
of injury or harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in that case, John David Lord, and a Bellflower judge, Philip K. 
Mautino, have drawn attention and legal challenges because they use anonymous 
juries in every criminal case.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LOAN 
PROGRAM OKD TO AID REBUILDING OF CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest effort to rebuild the city's quake-damaged housing stock, the 
Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to create a loan program to help 
condominium owners and associations rebuild units and common areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan program will provide zero-interest loans from a $318-million pool of 
federal and local housing repair funds.City officials expect the program to 
provide loans to the owners of up to 5,000 units.  
</P>
<P>
 The loans will only be offered to individual condo owners and associations 
that have been rejected by other private or government loan programs, including 
the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Associations interested in a loan to repair damage in common areas must get a 
majority of the members to agree to take on the loan and each pay a pro-rated 
share of the monthly payments. Individual owners can apply for separate loans 
without a vote of the entire association. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds must be paid off over 30 years, with the first payment deferred for 
five years. The loan program will provide a maximum of $35,000 per unit.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTSIDE; PROTESTERS 
DISRUPT FORUM ON IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A campaign forum on the so-called "Save Our State" initiative at the Museum of 
Tolerance was briefly disrupted Tuesday night by members of several Los 
Angeles-area community groups who charged that the November ballot measure, 
which would eliminate most government services to illegal immigrants, is 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the podium before the debate, Huntington Park pastor Rody Gorman 
demanded that former INS Regional Director Harold Ezell, who co-authored 
Proposition 187, renounce a recent statement by another leading proponent of 
the measure: "You are the posse, SOS is the rope." 
</P>
<P>
 Panelist Ezell, who was not yet on the stage, did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 As members of the Southern California Organizing Committee, United 
Neighborhoods Organization, Valley Organized in Community Efforts and East 
Valleys Organizations were leaving, Mariano Cisneros Jr., who said he is a UCLA 
law school student, stood. He said that the ballot measure, which calls for 
education and health care administrators to report suspected illegal immigrants 
to federal authorities, "is the Nazis all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell said later that the demonstration "does them harm and us good."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL OKS OWN UNIT FOR 
INTERNAL LAPD COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission ended months of debate Tuesday by 
unanimously approving creation of a unit that will investigate complaints of 
discrimination and harassment within the LAPD's ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission had considered creating the unit at last week's meeting, but 
agreed to postpone the vote after its attorney advised a delay. In the interim, 
two commissioners met with Police Chief Willie L. Williams, who had expressed 
reservations about the proposal because it recommended that the commission, not 
the chief's office, direct any investigations of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, however, Williams said that minor changes in the proposed unit had 
satisfied him. In particular, Williams said he was pleased that commissioners 
agreed to notify his office within 48 hours of any complaint being filed. The 
commission also modified its proposal to add one more sworn officer to the 
unit's 14-member staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the unit will report to the commission, not the department 
itself, a novel approach that is intended to demonstrate the commission's 
commitment to rooting out harassment and discrimination in the ranks. The move 
reflects the commissioners' concern that housing the unit within the LAPD would 
make some victims more reluctant to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the unit still requires City Council approval and funding for its 
projected annual budget of $662,000. Commission Vice President Deirdre Hill 
urged the council to move quickly so that the unit can be established as soon 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who has enthusiastically supported the proposal, 
said she was pleased by the commission vote and vowed to seek funding for the 
unit -- a battle she said will be made easier by the recognition that reducing 
harassment and discrimination complaints will help hold down legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you do this, you're not only going to save lots and lots of money," 
Goldberg said, "you're going to begin to change the culture of the 
institution."

L.A. PRESSES MTA TO USE COSTLY SAFETY MEASURES; SUBWAY: CITY COUNCIL OKS REPORT 
URGING A VARIETY OF PRECAUTIONS BEFORE TUNNELING RESUMES BENEATH HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that is likely to raise the cost of building Los Angeles' first 
subway, the City Council Tuesday told the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
what it wants done to safeguard Hollywood before tunneling resumes on the Metro 
Rail Red Line project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council sent to MTA a private engineer's report that recommends, among 
other things, special efforts to protect the handprints and footprints of such 
stars as Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne in front of Mann's Chinese 
Theatre from the sinkage that cracked the Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the city's recommended safety measures go beyond what the MTA has 
proposed -- most notably the greater use of grouting, a substance that is 
injected in advance of tunneling to strengthen the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials Tuesday refused to respond to questions about construction 
procedures. A spokeswoman would say only that the agency welcomed the city 
review -- the first independent analysis of the problems that halted subway 
construction Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Lehmer, the private engineer hired by the city, said he met with MTA 
officials last weekend and "they indicated they would probably be willing to go 
along with our recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, endorsed by the city engineer and two city departments, recommends 
that the MTA install additional steel shoring in the tunnels, increase 
monitoring for soil problems and redesign the joint used as bracing in the 
tunnel's concrete liner. Wooden wedges, which were used as bracing instead of 
metal struts, fell far short of the strength required to hold soil loads. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also noted that water is still seeping into the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has no direct control over the $5.5-billion Downtown-to-San Fernando 
Valley subway project but wields considerable political clout with the agency. 
City officials have threatened to go to court seeking to block subway 
construction from resuming unless the MTA takes steps to prevent further 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unclear is who will pay for the safety measures, which are certain to 
run into the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In his inch-thick report, Lehmer offered a far more critical assessment of the 
problems than the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "That thing came so close to collapsing," Lehmer said, referring to the 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The city analysis concluded that a series of circumstances, including soil 
conditions, water in the soil and inadequate tunneling procedures -- such as 
the failure to grout properly and crushed wooden wedges used in the tunnel -- 
contributed to the sinkage of up to nine inches on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehmer said he has recommended chemical grouting in front of Mann's Chinese 
Theatre and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel because of the historic nature of the 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously approved the technical report, although Councilman 
Richard Alatorre expressed concern that the city might be opening itself up for 
liability if the safety measures are implemented and problems still occur.

9 COUNCIL MEMBERS USE PUBLIC SERVICE FUNDS FOR STAFF SALARIES; GOVERNMENT: 
ACTIVISTS CRITICIZE THE TRANSFER OF MONEY FROM ALLOTMENTS FOR COMMUNITY GROUPS. 
OFFICIALS DEFEND THEIR ACTIONS, SAYING THEY IMPROVE SERVICE TO CONSTITUENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 During the last three years, members of the Los Angeles City Council have 
diverted nearly $130,000 intended for public service and neighborhood cleanup 
programs to pay for their staffs' salaries, city records show. 
</P>
<P>
 With the entire council's approval, nine members have almost routinely 
transferred money from the $20,000 annual city allotment given to each of the 
15 council members for donation to nonprofit and other community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked. I'm shocked," said Nina Royal, an activist involved in graffiti 
cleanup and neighborhood patrols in Sunland-Tujunga. "If it's allotted for 
community projects, it should not go to staff." 
</P>
<P>
 It is legal and within the council's jurisdiction to spend the funds on 
salaries, but that use clashes with the council's original intent for the 
money: to help community groups fight crime, blight, gangs, graffiti and other 
social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 City records show that between July, 1991, and June, 1994, nine current 
council members transferred a total of $127,454 to their office salary accounts 
from their public service and cleanup accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Ferraro transferred the most, using nearly $43,000 during the 
last three years to pay staff salaries, according to the city records. 
Councilman Joel Wachs diverted the second-highest total, nearly $39,000 during 
the same period, the records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 The public service and cleanup accounts -- which each contain $10,000 annually 
-- are provided in addition to each council office's annual $640,882 budget, 
which pays salaries for the council members and their staffs. Council President 
Ferraro has a $680,367 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members who used the money for salaries instead of donations to 
community groups defend their actions, saying the money they spent on staff 
salaries or training helps their offices better serve their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro said he believes the best use for some of the money was to pay his 
staff so they could better respond to problems raised by constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there are a lot of groups that would like to have the money, but we 
have to decide how best to serve the district," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wachs spokesman said that in previous years Wachs has donated money from the 
accounts to community groups but that this year all the money was used to 
retain staff members who would have otherwise been eliminated by budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of which way we chose to help our district," said Greg Nelson, 
an aide to Wachs, whose district stretches from Sunland-Tujunga to Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 News of how the money was spent sparked criticism from other city officials, 
taxpayer watchdog groups and nonprofit organizations that depend on such 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal, the Sunland-Tujunga activist, suggested that the funds could be used to 
help equip the city's Police Department with new crime-fighting tools, such as 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Councilwoman Laura Chick donated all $20,000 from her two accounts 
to the West Valley Police Activity League, a law enforcement booster 
organization that has donated computers and other equipment to the LAPD's West 
Valley bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick was among six council members who did not divert any money to salary 
accounts during the last three years. The others are Zev Yaroslavsky, Mike 
Hernandez, Hal Bernson, Nate Holden and Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Ferraro and Wachs, the council members who transferred money from the 
accounts over the past three years were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mark Ridley-Thomas: $14,994 
</P>
<P>
 * Rita Walters: $9,828 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Alarcon: $9,197 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruth Galanter: $5,700 
</P>
<P>
 * Jackie Goldberg: $3,175 
</P>
<P>
 * Marvin Braude: $3,000 
</P>
<P>
 * Rudy Svorinich Jr.: $2,000 
</P>
<P>
 The public service and cleanup accounts for nonprofit organizations were 
created by the City Council in 1987 in an attempt to end the squabbling among 
council members over money for pet projects, which broke out every year when 
the budget was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 For similar reasons, the Board of Supervisors decided several years ago to 
give each member about $1 million annually to support groups or causes in his 
or her district. In the past year, Supervisor Mike Antonovich has diverted 
about $50,000 from that account to pay staff salaries.

MAYOR AND COMPANION BUY IDAHO DWELLING; FINANCES: RIORDAN DISCLOSURE FORM ALSO 
REPORTS SELLING OF SEVERAL MAJOR STOCK HOLDINGS.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and companion Nancy Daly have purchased a 
$2.3-million vacation home in Idaho, where the mayor likes to fish, ski and 
ride his mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and Daly formed a business partnership to buy the home, not far from 
the Sun Valley resort, according to a financial disclosure form. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report filed this week with the city Ethics Commission, Riordan also 
reported selling several major stock holdings, including the initial divesting 
of shares in a Pasadena engineering firm that earlier this year prompted 
conflict of interest allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Property records show that the house Riordan and Daly bought in north Ketchum 
has six bedrooms and six bathrooms and sits on two lots that total about 2.5 
acres. The properties were valued at $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Daly bought the home in March. Daly's divorce from Warner Bros. 
chief Robert Daly recently became final, while Riordan has been separated for 
many years from his second wife. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riordan aide said not too much should be read into the joint purchase of the 
home though. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a precursor to anything," said the aide, who asked not to be 
named. "It's a place they can go and enjoy, and a place their kids and 
grandkids can go and enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Daly were on a 17-day cycling vacation in Europe and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In his semiannual disclosure form, Riordan also reported changes since he last 
disclosed more than $70 million in holdings outside of a blind trust that was 
established when he took office. As assets are sold, more of Riordan's wealth 
is shifted into the trust, designed to shield him from conflict-of-interest 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure form confirms Riordan's sale of stock in Tetra Tech Inc., a 
Pasadena-based engineering services company in which he once owned nearly $10 
million in shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock holding became controversial last summer when The Times reported 
that Riordan had voted as a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
board in a way that benefited the company. Riordan said he never knew that the 
vote would benefit Tetra Tech, but he later agreed to divest himself of all of 
his nearly 500,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The report released this week covers the first six months of 1994 and showed a 
sale of a small portion of the stock. The rest was sold after the end of the 
reporting period, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also reported divesting his holdings in several other companies. He 
sold 45,112 shares in Abbey Healthcare, 105,888 shares in American Health Care, 
13,578 shares in OrNda Healthcorp and 45,600 of his nearly 365,000 shares in 
Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also reported $750,000 in income from a real estate investment called 
Chaparral Village; $455,000 from the Riordan, Lewis and Haden partnership, 
$260,000 from his ownership of the Downtown Pantry restaurant and $130,000 from 
his partnership's holding in the Downtown Fine Arts Building.

CHANGING NEIGHBORHOOD CLAIMS LONGTIME RESIDENT; VIOLENCE: EMERY HUGHES, WHO 
IGNORED HIS FAMILY'S PLEAS TO MOVE, APPARENTLY WAS SLAIN IN A FIGHT WITH A 
BURGLAR IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL HOME IN WHICH HE HAD LIVED FOR 40 YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 For years, 82-year-old Emery Hughes' family told him he should move out of the 
increasingly dangerous Florence neighborhood of South-Central Los Angeles where 
he had lived for 40 years. On Sunday night, their worst fears were realized 
when Hughes was stabbed to death during an apparent burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Under gray clouds and light rain, Hughes' children gathered Tuesday morning in 
the front yard of his Miramonte Boulevard home to begin setting his now-empty 
house in order. In remembering their father, they recalled his determination to 
stay in the house where he had raised them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, daughter Zeralda Hughes, who had been living with her father 
in the family home, moved to the Westside, leaving him alone. She and her 
siblings, who had also moved to different areas of Los Angeles, were worried 
about his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very quiet neighborhood when we moved here 40 years ago," Zeralda 
Hughes said. "But now it's changed. People had broken into his toolshed before 
and taken (his) lawn mower. We were afraid because he lived here in this 
neighborhood and he was by himself. But he's very independent." 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to be near his friends and the things that he knew," daughter 
Jennie Thomas said. "He went to the track nearly every day. He played dominoes 
in the park and over at his friends' house." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes was killed Sunday by a man police described as a burglar who entered 
through a window after slashing a screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said she believed her father died while fighting with the killer. She 
said he was the kind of man who would have tried to stop the burglar.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a hod carrier. He used to carry concrete," she said. "And he was still 
going strong, but he lost this fight."  
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the slain man found him about 9:15 p.m. Sunday, Deputy Benita 
Hinojos said. Hughes died three hours later at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives believe that the killer may have stolen the money from Hughes' 
latest Social Security check because they could not find the check or the money 
in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elderly are easy targets for burglaries," Detective Mike Crowley said. 
"But (Hughes' murder) is really senseless." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeralda Hughes said her father was a vibrant man who still "looked like he was 
around 60 years old. He was strong for his age. . . . He had a girlfriend in 
Altadena who he saw three times a week."

MEDICINE / HEAD INJURIES; NEW DRUG MAY HELP LESSEN EFFECTS OF SEVERE TRAUMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new genetically engineered drug could increase the likelihood of surviving 
severe head injury by as much as 20%, researchers said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The new treatment could spell the difference between a job and independent 
living and life in a coma, or even death, for as many as 50,000 Americans each 
year, Dr. J. Paul Muizelaar of Wayne State University in Detroit told the 
Congress of Neurological Surgeons in Chicago on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Muizelaar and his colleagues at 28 other hospitals around the country 
administered either the drug, called PEG-SOD, or a placebo to 463 patients who 
suffered severe head injuries, most of them in automobile accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those given the sham treatment, 46% were able to return to work or live 
independently. Among those receiving the optimum dose of the drug, however, 55% 
were able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Because more than 500,000 Americans are hospitalized with head injuries each 
year, neurologists "have said that even an improvement of a few percentage 
points (in survival) would be clinically important," Muizelaar said. "This is 
even better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the results are very significant," said Dr. Kenneth S. Waxman, a 
neurosurgeon at UC Irvine. "PEG-SOD is . . . the first (such medication) shown 
to actually work in a controlled trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Head injury is the leading cause of death and disability in children and young 
adults in the United States, accounting for 13% of all injuries, according to 
the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Conservative 
estimates suggest that 2 million people suffer a traumatic brain injury each 
year, with 500,000 requiring hospitalization and 75,000 to 100,000 resulting in 
death. More than half of those injuries arise from motor vehicle accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Males are twice as likely as females to suffer head injuries, and most 
survivors are between the ages of 15 and 24. Nationwide, the economic costs of 
head injuries total more than $25 billion per year, according to the stroke 
institute, with the lifetime cost for a single survivor reaching as much as $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A substantial fraction of the deaths and damage arises from so-called 
secondary brain damage, the swelling and pressure that develop in the days 
after the accident. When the flow of oxygen and sugar to the brain is impaired 
by trauma, toxic chemicals called oxygen free radicals are created. The free 
radicals damage tissues directly and also produce swelling that can be 
extremely damaging or fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 The body has a naturally occurring enzyme called superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
that destroys free radicals, but this system is overwhelmed by the trauma. A 
long series of animal experiments by Muizelaar and other researchers has shown 
that SOD produced by genetic engineering techniques can supplement the natural 
SOD activity and minimize damage. Scientists attached the SOD to a polymer 
called polyethylene glycol (PEG) so that it remains in the blood longer, 
thereby extending its therapeutic benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Muizelaar said that the drug's manufacturer, Sterling-Winthrop Inc., will 
probably apply to the Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval upon 
the completion of a second and larger clinical trial that is expected to be 
completed within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA has already placed the drug on the so-called fast track toward 
approval because it is used for a life-threatening disorder for which no 
treatment is currently available. Such approval is likely, Muizelaar 
speculated, because "it appears to me that it works and that it is also very 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The results in the new study are similar to those obtained in a previous study 
on 104 patients used to determine the best dosage levels. Muizelaar said as 
many as 900 more patients are enrolled in the other ongoing study of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the drug in those patients who did not respond may have been 
due to the severity of the damage caused by the trauma, Muizelaar said. He also 
speculated that the response would be better if the drug were given immediately 
after the injury. On average, the drug was administered to patients in the 
study about six hours after their accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sentinel finding . . . because it shows we're on the right track," 
added Dr. Steven L. Giannotta of USC. "Over the last 10 years there have been 
no major accomplishments that have altered the way we care for head injuries. 
This gives impetus to the search for medications that can have even greater 
impact."

MIKE PENNER: NFL STADIUM PLAN HAS QUITE A FEW CRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It made for good television, at any rate. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, 
picking his spot and pumping up the drama, lets it slip during the course of a 
Fox halftime interview that his league is mulling the possibility of building . 
. . somewhere in Southern California . . . a beautiful . . . new . . . 
80,000-seat football stadium that the Rams and Raiders can share on into the 
21st century, thereby staying put and living in harmony, happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar move, Ram Coach Chuck Knox decides he will play Chris Miller at 
quarterback after the Atlanta Falcons have taken their eight points and gone 
home with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting ideas, guys, but when's the last time you had that wristwatch 
looked at? 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue's offer, which is still in the off-the-top-of-my-head stage, comes 
merely eight months after an earthquake rendered the Los Angeles Coliseum 
unplayable, along with the Rams' own seismic announcement that they were 
invoking the escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease and striking out for 
parts unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the first week of October rolls around, $60 million worth of Coliseum 
repairs have just been completed, the Rams have one foot and four toes out the 
door and the light bulb finally flickers in the NFL offices. 
</P>
<P>
 You mean the Rams and Raiders aren't happy where they're at and are seriously 
thinking about leaving the second-largest television market in the country 
professional football-free? 
</P>
<P>
 You think maybe we ought to do something about it? 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw has been contemplating this escape from Anaheim for six years. In 
any race with Tagliabue, that's quite a head start. A Ram-Raider gridplex won't 
be football-ready for another three, four years -- assuming land is found, 
financing is approved, so many niggling little details. But a Ram decision on a 
new forwarding address could come as soon as this month, along with the 
attendant multimillion-dollar payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Instant gratification -- awfully tough to beat on any given Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw says, of course, he will be glad to explore any such "viable 
alternative," but in the meantime, he's keeping busy exploring real estate in 
Missouri and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ownership groups in St. Louis and Baltimore are anxious. They want 
some answers, now. If the Rams say, hold on, let's see what the league can do 
for us, St. Louis and Baltimore will simply wing on over to Florida and start 
pestering the Buccaneers, or any other franchise that smells as if it might be 
"in play." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw says he wants to see a feasibility study on the NFL's Southern California 
project. That should be a doozy, considering that Al Davis and Georgia 
Frontiere are these two potential roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 Site?  
</P>
<P>
 The old Long Beach naval shipyard has been suggested, a convenient central 
location with easy freeway access from both the north and south. 
</P>
<P>
 Two problems, however: 
</P>
<P>
 Too gritty for our fans, Georgia would say. Too blue-collar. 
</P>
<P>
 Too sterile for our fans, Al would say. Too white-bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Name?  
</P>
<P>
 "John Shaw Field" might be what it will take to get the Rams interested, 
provided the general manager's suite comes equipped with one-way mirrored 
bulletproof glass. But Davis would never go for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise is the keyword here. The stadium's name would have to reflect 
common ground between the franchises. Mutual experience. Shared history. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Perry Pavilion? 
</P>
<P>
 Funding?  
</P>
<P>
 Early estimates range from $200 million to $250 million, so, presumably, the 
league is anticipating a windfall on throwback replica jersey sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, the league says it would finance the project through Super Bowl 
licenses, eventually holding every other Super Bowl at Perry Pavilion. Most 
likely, L.A. and Orange counties would go for this, but lobbying could be hard 
in New Orleans, Miami and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Private boxes?  
</P>
<P>
 A nightmare of litigation, this one. Suites would have to be shared, Raider 
fans one week, Ram fans the next. In other words, private suite gets trashed 
one week, lawsuit is filed in Orange County court the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Concessions?  
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, these, too, would have to be shared. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams get the strawberry daiquiri, sushi and valet parking concessions; Raiders 
get the beer, brats and tourniquet kits. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduling?  
</P>
<P>
 Another nightmare. It's one thing for the Giants and the Jets to share a 
stadium in the Meadowlands, quite another for the Rams and the Raiders to shack 
up together. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, angling for every possible advantage, real or imagined, will demand the 
first and last Sunday of every season at home, accuse the Rams of sabotaging 
Raider glory by having Jerome Bettis chew up the grass 35 times a game and talk 
to his lawyers about snaking some of that substantial 49er gate. How come the 
Rams get to play them at home every year and we don't? 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, a few kinks need to be worked out. But Tagliabue vows to press 
onward. He wants this stadium, calling it essential in keeping the NFL "strong 
in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 And, if the commissioner gets his wish, we can all look forward to September, 
1998, when the Raiders host the St. Louis Rams in their sparkling, spanking new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Should be a good crowd for that one.

THIS OWNER SEEKS MORE THAN FISTFUL OF DOLLARS; BASEBALL: THE ORIOLES' ANGELOS 
RIDES ALONE AMONG HIS PEERS AFTER VERBAL SHOOTOUT WITH RAVITCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HYMAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peek into a ballroom at the next meeting of major league baseball owners. Scan 
the crowd of millionaire bankers, cable-television executives and 
pizza-delivery moguls in their wingtips and tailored suits. Then look for Peter 
G. Angelos, Baltimore lawyer and Oriole owner. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the one other owners are working feverishly to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that Angelos joined the exclusive fraternity of baseball owners less 
than a year ago, hardly time enough to have forged close ties with the 
investors who run the 27 other major league teams. But the isolation that 
shrouds him these days has less to do with his tenure than with something else 
about Angelos: 
</P>
<P>
 He makes trouble for the owners and, worse, makes it publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't sign on to be silent, to be acquiescent," Angelos said. "I am no 
schoolboy, and I'm not a Boy Scout who just joined the troop. If I have 
something to say, I'll say it." 
</P>
<P>
 And he hasn't been without success. A union lawyer said Tuesday that it is 
likely talks in the dispute with striking players will resume next week thanks 
partly to a plan Angelos presented Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, 
during a controversial meeting. But the hard feelings, caused by Angelos' 
frequent sniping at management's handling of negotiations, will likely be 
lasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind people voicing opinions, but I don't think the things he has 
said have been helpful," said Bill Giles, president of the Philadelphia 
Phillies, who complains that Angelos' comments give the false impression that 
the owners are ready to retreat from their hard-line bargaining position. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the owners rein in Angelos? 
</P>
<P>
 Giles doesn't seem concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had these problems before with different people," he said. "You just 
live with it. You don't put them on (influential) committees." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the owners' decisions are shaped by baseball's Player Relations 
Committee and Executive Council, powerful groups from which Angelos has been 
excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos rejects suggestions that he has picked a lousy time -- in the midst of 
collective bargaining -- to become the owners' answer to the Lone Ranger. And 
he does this with more than a hint of irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When is the appropriate time to speak one's mind?" he said, his deep voice 
rising. "At the three (owners) meetings they have each year? When they get 
their little PRC together and their little Executive Council together, to the 
exclusion of the Lone Ranger and Tonto and all the rest of the Indians? Who are 
they kidding? 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean when I bought this ballclub for the purpose of having Maryland 
ownership that I signed on to some organization in which what I have to say is 
to be heard one year from now? Oh, no." 
</P>
<P>
 Without a doubt, Angelos has been viewed as management's loose cannon during 
these labor problems, Tuesday's developments notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, shortly before the strike began, he was sharply critical of the 
owners' tactical move to withhold a $7.8-million payment to the players' 
pension plan, warning that the action "sets the stage for further 
recriminations." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Angelos was one of two owners -- with the Cincinnati Reds' Marge 
Schott -- who refused to sign a management declaration announcing the 
cancellation of the World Series. He took issue with a section that blamed the 
players for refusing to negotiate in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Sept. 24, Angelos took what might have been the most defiant step of 
all, meeting with Fehr in Baltimore. Angelos arranged the meeting without 
notifying management negotiators, including acting commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Angelos get into this position? 
</P>
<P>
 It probably was inevitable, given his take-charge personality and his deep 
reservations about management's negotiating team, led by Selig and negotiator 
Richard Ravitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, a veteran labor lawyer, says he likes both men, while making clear 
that he believes the owners' strategists are misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Selig, for example, the Oriole owner said, "He is a very successful 
automobile dealer. What makes him think he has the abilities to do what he is 
attempting to do here is beyond my comprehension." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos began to part company with baseball's negotiators at an owners meeting 
-- one of the first he attended. Ravitch was making a presentation that showed 
mounting losses for baseball owners during the 1994 and 1995 seasons. As 
Angelos recalls, it was a "most impressive presentation" that had him 
thoroughly convinced the owners were right to be pursuing a hard line in their 
talks with the players. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ravitch finished, Angelos asked whether the same speech might be made to 
the players representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 As Angelos recalls, Ravitch replied, " 'We can't do that.' 
</P>
<P>
 "One word led to another, and that's when (Ravitch) said, 'Rational persuasion 
will have no place in these negotiations.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos says he was shocked to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was passing himself off as a negotiator, but if he believes that, he's 
(an) idiot," he said. "If anyone believes you can walk into a meeting and say 
to the other side, 'I need so-and-so because of this particular condition,' and 
get it without proving the condition exists . . . That's so illogical. It 
sounds like the position of a child." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ravitch and Angelos argued, others in the meeting room looked on in stunned 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Giles remembered the exchange coming "like a flash of lightning." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all in a subdued, reasonable conversation. All of a sudden, (Angelos) 
started speaking loudly, saying things that kind of shocked everybody," Giles 
recalled. "He was saying, 'Why don't you do it this way?' -- telling Ravitch 
how to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 Another official likened Angelos' aggressive, close questioning of Ravitch to 
"a cross-examination," no stretch considering the owner's long career as a 
trial lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos seemed amused by that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't stand up," he said. "I never left my chair. If they thought that was 
a cross-examination, they ought to come to a courtroom. I know there is a 
certain way I say things if I am doing them in lawyer's context. But I didn't 
attack the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch declined to speak about the incident, except to say that Angelos "has 
said some inaccurate things about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ravitch: "I represent all 28 owners. I have no personal disagreement 
with Angelos." 
</P>
<P>
 For many owners, the incident was their introduction to Angelos, and quickly 
cast him as an outsider. But Angelos says he has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I sorry for taking on (Ravitch)?" he said, repeating the question. "I'm 
sorry I didn't totally demolish him." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos' reward for such outbursts has been a deafening silence. Although he 
says nine or more owners congratulated him for taking on Ravitch, few are close 
to him now. He also has been shut out of any official role in negotiations with 
the striking players. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has yet to be appointed to any of the committees monitoring the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were stacked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos was passed over when Selig, among others, appointed 12 club executives 
to a group that met several times with union negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Angelos lost again when he was left off an "operations committee" 
that will help the owners plot their moves in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Even getting strike information has been a chore. Selig has regular conference 
calls for about 18 teams, most of whom have representatives on the numerous 
owners' labor committees. The Orioles don't, so Angelos is forced to rely on 
sporadic, informal updates, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In small ways, Angelos has exacted his revenge. When Selig urged him to join a 
group of owners going to Washington to put down a congressional movement to 
revoke baseball's antitrust exemption, Angelos declined, saying he was busy at 
his law office. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too busy, though, to hold his clandestine meeting with Fehr two days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said none of these skirmishes affects his thinking about Angelos. The 
two have "a nice relationship," Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's opinionated, feisty," Selig said. "I happen to like him because I am not 
exactly a shrinking violet myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Angelos' performance at the owners meeting did not irritate Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I know where he stands," Selig said.

NHL OWNERS OFFER PLAYERS REVISED PLAN; HOCKEY: THE TWO SIDES NEGOTIATE FOR 
SEVEN HOURS. NO DETAILS OF NEW PROPOSAL ARE DISCLOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL on Tuesday offered a new proposal to solve an old problem that has 
already delayed the start of the season by two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal revised its previous plan, which would have subsidized 
small-market clubs by imposing a graduated levy on clubs that exceed a payroll 
limit. However, none of the participants in Tuesday's seven-hour negotiating 
meeting would disclose details of the plan or say if it generated new hope of 
producing an agreement by Commissioner Gary Bettman's Oct. 15 deadline for 
preserving the full season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some very tough issues," said Bob Goodenow, executive director of 
the NHL Players Assn. "I'm not going to categorize the day's negotiations in 
any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman, who will meet with the union again today in New York, declined to say 
if the offer was the league's best proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's realistic to respond to that in the course of collective 
bargaining," he said. "We've made a proposal and the players are considering 
it. And if this takes us down the road to making a deal, then that will be 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Players have objected to all salary constraints introduced by the league. They 
rejected the levy on the grounds that clubs would try to keep salaries low in 
order to avoid exceeding the limit and triggering the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has proposed a flat levy on the payrolls and gate receipts of clubs 
with the league's top 16 revenues. The proceeds would go to the 10 
lower-revenue clubs. The league contends that would not produce enough money to 
help weaker clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The league also reversed course and instructed clubs not to pay players who 
were injured during training camp. As previously reported, players will receive 
any signing bonuses in their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides brought new faces to the table Tuesday. Goodenow was joined by Mike 
Gartner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the president of the NHLPA, and Kelly 
Miller of the Washington Capitals, a vice president of the union. Bettman was 
joined by owners John McMullen of the New Jersey Devils, Ron Corey of the 
Montreal Canadiens and Howard Baldwin of the Pittsburgh Penguins, and Harry 
Sinden, the Boston Bruins' president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman repeated his contention that massive economic changes are essential to 
the survival of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just small-market, big-market," he said. "It's large-grossing, 
small-grossing teams. As we have been saying all along, we need a system that 
enables all of our teams to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL said last week that over the last four years, clubs have spent $1.14 
for every $1 of revenue they took in. However, it has been learned that the 
Mighty Ducks ranked among the league's most profitable operations last season 
with a surplus of about $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks -- whose extremely favorable lease at The Pond offsets their low TV 
rights fees -- and San Jose Sharks ranked 1-2 in per-game revenues. The Sharks 
won't reveal details of their finances, but owner Gordon Gund last week scoffed 
at a report that his club had made $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Per-game revenues last season ranged from a high of about $700,000 to a low of 
about $250,000. The Edmonton Oilers, Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers 
were at the bottom of the scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings lost money last season after having made $3 million on their 1993 
run to the Stanley Cup finals. New majority owner Joseph Cohen would not reveal 
last season's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Post said in Tuesday's editions that the NHL reported an 
operating deficit of $32 million for 1992-93, the last year for which complete 
records have been compiled. That season, salaries accounted for 61% of the 
league's gross revenues. In 1989-90, the league reported a $3-million surplus, 
and salaries accounted for 48% of gross revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 An NHL spokesman said he believed the Post's figures to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen said last week that the NHL's total revenue for 1993-94 was $700 
million, of which $440 million went to players. That would mean salaries had 
taken 63% of gross revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining clubs' profits and losses is difficult because accounting 
procedures vary among the 26 clubs. Terms of arena leases also vary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vancouver Canucks, who are a publicly held enterprise and must reveal 
financial data, reported a profit of $600,000 Canadian (about $450,000 U.S.) 
last season. However, that might increase when final numbers are tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks, who get no concession or parking revenues at the Pacific 
Coliseum, took in $10 million during their march to the Cup finals against 
expenses of $7 million. That profit covered their regular-season deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Capitals said they lost $8 million last season, but they did 
not include revenues from luxury suites and parking. Their owner, Abe Pollin, 
also owns the USAir Arena, so the club can claim rent payments to the arena as 
an expense even though the money still goes to Pollin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hartford Whalers claimed losses of $14 million last season and projected 
losses this season of $8 million to $10 million. They play at the Civic Center, 
which was owned by the city until the state of Connecticut took over the lease 
and gave the Whalers easy terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whalers do not get concession revenue, but as part of their agreement to 
stay in the state, profits from the building go back to the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a $20-million payroll last season that was among the league's highest 
-- and despite losing in the first round of the playoffs -- the Pittsburgh 
Penguins made a "slight profit" last season, owner Howard Baldwin has said. 
Baldwin shares ownership of the team with Spectacor, which runs the concessions 
at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Stars were one playoff game's revenues from breaking even last 
season, a Dallas source said. Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Duck center Patrik Carnback has returned home to Sweden but his agent, Neil 
Abbott, said he has advised Carnback to see what happens in labor talks before 
pursuing possible playing opportunities. "The goal is to play here, not in 
Europe," Abbott said. "If the NHL isn't going to play, I'll re-evaluate. Right 
now the idea is to sit back and wait." Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira says 
Carnback would violate his contract by playing abroad. . . . Duck forward Jim 
Thomson said he will continue his shoulder rehabilitation under team 
supervision despite the league's decision that injured players won't be paid 
until games begin. Forward Steven King and defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky are also 
affected by the change in policy.

THE CAN-DO KID; CHARLIE ARANGO BECOMES STARTER AT WIDE RECEIVER DESPITE HAVING 
ONLY ONE HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Arango watched a pass bounce off his left arm for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 He was acutely aware of the problem and decided it was time to eliminate it -- 
forever. When Arango arrived home one day after playing in a junior high 
flag-football game, he took off the rubber prosthesis that covered his 
three-quarter-length arm and never wore it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day he told me, 'Daddy, I don't need it. I feel more comfortable like 
this,' " Hugo Arango, Charlie's father, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Arango had mixed emotions. He had brought his family to Los Angeles from 
Guatemala in 1981 specifically to get an artificial limb for his only child. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charlie saw no need to wear a substitute hand on his left arm, especially 
if the device would hinder his football career. His father reluctantly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is normal," Arango said, pointing to his left arm during a 
practice session. "This is how I was born. I don't feel different." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years have passed since Arango tossed his prosthesis into a closet. And 
he doesn't miss it, now that he is a starting wide receiver for Birmingham 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie's a tough kid," said Paul Prince, the Braves' quarterback. "He dives 
for all the balls. He puts 110% effort into every single route he runs. He 
wants to prove to everyone that he can catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Arango proved long ago that he was a football player, according to Birmingham 
Coach Chick Epstein. The 5-foot-9, 150-pound senior started three games at 
cornerback and half a dozen others at outside linebacker last season, besides 
playing on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Arango feels the same as any other athlete on the field, he cannot 
escape the visible difference that some opponents ungraciously point out. 
</P>
<P>
 In one recent game, he said, "I went in for a punt return and (an opponent) 
said, 'Oh, I got the guy with no hand. . . . I got the one-armer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Being the focal point of stares and rude comments is nothing new for Arango. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just smile because it doesn't hurt me," he said. "I went through it in 
junior high." 
</P>
<P>
 Until he was 10, Arango shied from sports. He had given in to his classmates' 
assumption that he could not play traditional American sports such as 
basketball, baseball and football. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Saturday, Arango had a change of heart. A friend, Elden Henry, 
persuaded him to play in a pick-up football game. Arango's ability to catch 
Elden's passes surprised many, including himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Elden and Charlie began envisioning themselves as Joe Montana and 
Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Elden) used to always say, 'Montana to Rice,' " Arango said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a wide receiver was born. Arango redecorated his bedroom with pictures and 
posters of Rice. Catching passes and running for touchdowns was all Arango 
wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain he was too small to play football as a freshman at Birmingham, Arango 
waited until his sophomore year to try out for the team. He was a wide receiver 
on the Bee team that year, even though skeptical teammates doubted he would be 
able to contribute. He soon proved them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the hardest worker out here," assistant coach Dave Lertzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arango is motivated by the nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is something you could do and you have both hands and I can't do it, 
I'm going to keep trying until I do it," he said. "I won't give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Arango what is impossible for him and he will quickly answer, "climbing a 
rope." But feats beyond that, he said, have yet to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 He bench presses 195 pounds with the help of three spotters and has a daily 
workout routine, including push-ups and biceps curls. He learned to tie his 
shoes when he was 5 and can do it as quickly as a two-handed person. And the 
car he drives has a stick shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Arango, who brings in the play to the huddle, has started in each of the 
Braves' victories over Canoga Park, University and Reseda, and last week's 
17-15 loss to Taft. But his dream of catching a touchdown pass has yet to be 
fulfilled. In fact, he is still waiting for his first catch. But, according to 
his coach, it's only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will catch a touchdown pass, no question about it," Epstein said.

THESE ACORNS DISPERSE; HORSE RACING: TRAINER MCANALLY'S FOUR TALENTED 
2-YEAR-OLDS ARE SENT ALL OVER AS OAK TREE BEGINS AT SANTA ANITA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Virtually all points of the compass will be needed to track trainer Ron 
McAnally's precocious 2-year-olds this weekend. On Target and Comstock Queen 
have gone east. Mr Purple has gone from north to south. And Call Now, probably 
the most talented of the four, is staying on the West Coast to run in the 
$200,000 Oak Leaf Stakes for fillies at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the four juveniles run as McAnally hopes they will -- competitively and 
without injury -- they will have a reunion in a couple of $1-million Breeders' 
Cup races at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5, with On Target and Mr Purple scheduled 
for the Juvenile and Call Now and Comstock Queen expected for the Juvenile 
Fillies. 
</P>
<P>
 In his heyday, Wayne Lukas used to routinely run entries in those two races. 
At Churchill in 1988, Lukas' horses ran 1-2-3 in the Juvenile Fillies and he 
also won the Juvenile that year. McAnally has only dabbled in the 2-year-old 
races. His Breeders' Cup success -- three winners from 14 starters -- has been 
achieved with older horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Phone Chatter won the Juvenile Fillies at Santa Anita after 
capturing the Oak Leaf, which is one of five stakes that will launch the Oak 
Tree Racing Assn.'s 26th season in Arcadia. The 27-day meeting begins today 
with the $75,000 Autumn Days Handicap. Sunday brings the $300,000 Oak Tree 
Invitational and the $200,000 Norfolk Stakes, and on Monday, the Columbus Day 
holiday, the feature is the $100,000 Lady's Secret Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 On Target won the Del Mar Futurity, and the simpler route to the Breeders' Cup 
would have been the Norfolk, but McAnally will run him instead on Saturday at 
Belmont Park in the Champagne, a race that his sire, Forty Niner, won in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purse in New York is $500,000, more than twice what it is here," McAnally 
said. "And the New York race is a Grade I, and the Norfolk is a Grade II. Those 
are the reasons he's running in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 The Norfolk, which lost its status as a Grade I last year, is one of those 
races that taints the credibility of the North American Graded Stakes 
Committee. Previous winners of the Norfolk have included Flying Paster, Roving 
Boy, Chief's Crown, Snow Chief, Capote, Best Pal and Bertrando. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying On Target to New York is Comstock Queen, who will also run 
Saturday, in the $250,000 Frizette at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Purple's preparations for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile have been completed. 
The winner of the Hollywood Juvenile, he was unable to run in the Del Mar 
Futurity because of a clerical oversight by McAnally. Consequently, Mr Purple 
traveled to Chicago for the Arlington-Washington Futurity last month and 
suffered his first loss. Running over a muddy track that he didn't like, Mr 
Purple slammed into the gate at the start and was third, 5 1/4 lengths behind 
the winner, Evansville Slew. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally will also run D'hallevant in the Breeders' Cup Sprint Nov. 5, and is 
waiting to hear from Sidney Craig on Paseana and the Distaff. Craig paid 
supplementary fees totaling $400,000 the last two years as Paseana won the 
Distaff and $520,000 in 1992 and earned $200,000 for finishing second in the 
stake last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Del Mar this summer, he was dead set against (paying another $200,000 
supplementary)" McAnally said. "I'm not real sure how he feels about it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig and his wife, Jenny, also race Exchange, who is eligible for the 
Distaff. The race probably will be the toughest to win on the seven-race 
Breeders' Cup card, with Hollywood Wildcat, last year's winner, and Sky Beauty, 
undefeated this year, also expected to run. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of McAnally's 2-year-olds had the breeding credentials to be good, 
but it was Call Now that caught the Hall of Fame trainer's eye from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think she's at the top of my group," McAnally said. "Besides a lot of 
ability, she's got a perfect disposition and is very easy to train." 
</P>
<P>
 Call Now lost her first race, in July, by a half-length, then beat maidens 
before winning the Del Mar Debutante. She wasn't nominated for the Oak Leaf, so 
on Tuesday, to avoid the embarrassment that came from Mr Purple's being 
excluded from the Del Mar Futurity, McAnally paid the $10,000 supplementary fee 
that will enable the filly to run Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr Purple races for Alex Campbell. Call Now, On Target and Comstock Queen 
belong to Verne Winchell, the 79-year-old owner-breeder whose first important 
winner was the McAnally-trained Donut King in the Champagne in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, another horseman mentioned to Eduardo Inda, McAnally's 
long-time assistant, how lucky Winchell was to have all these good young 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucky?" Inda sniffed. "Lucky? This man's been in the game for more than 40 
years. He's been putting up his money for more than 40 years, breeding and 
running horses. He's had some good breaks and some bad breaks. But this isn't 
lucky. This is staying in the game for all these years, and now getting the 
chance to get something really nice out of it." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Laffit Pincay Jr. chose to ride Exchange in the Lady's Secret on Monday, which 
means that Phone Chatter will have a jockey change. . . . Kent Desormeaux has 
won the last three runnings of the Autumn Days, with Bel's Starlet in 1991 and 
'92, and Toussaud last year. His mount today is Starolamo. . . . The Oak Tree 
meet runs through Nov. 7. Fans will also be able to bet all of the races from 
Bay Meadows. . . . First post will be 12:30 p.m., with earlier starts for 
California Cup day on Oct. 29, and on Nov. 5, when the Breeders' Cup races will 
be simulcast from Churchill Downs.

MIKE DOWNEY: MERE RETURN TO THIS BARN A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine and a half months after his awakening from a coma, Jeff Lukas points to 
the spot where the horse ran him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over here, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 He scuffs the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas looks along the hardpan behind his barn at Santa Anita, where he is back 
at work, training thoroughbreds, for the first time since being trampled by the 
frightened colt Tabasco Cat last Dec. 15. Racing resumes at the track today. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much do you remember?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the accident?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of everything else, his amnesia is gone. Or almost. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking cover under a morning drizzle, Linda Lukas, dandling their infant 
daughter, waits for her husband to finish work. It is no wait at all compared 
to her Christmastime hospital vigil. There she sat by Jeff's bedside, praying 
for the blink of an eye, for the flutter of an eyelash, anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Once his recovery began, his memory returned. Piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he remember your wedding day? How you met?" Linda is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 She shakes her head and says, "He didn't know who I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few weeks, Jeff Lukas, 37, was lucid again. He says, "I knew I was in 
a hospital. I knew I'd been in some kind of accident." 
</P>
<P>
 He fought off pneumonia. He regained his strength after having lost 39 pounds. 
He was well enough to be transferred from the trauma unit of the Huntington 
Medical Center in Pasadena to the Casa Colina Hospital in Pomona, where his 
manual dexterity and mental awareness improved. 
</P>
<P>
 But not overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda says, "It's not like that 'Regarding Henry,' that Harrison Ford movie. 
You don't suffer a serious brain injury and then they say, 'OK, you're fine. 
You can go home now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the Lukases endured. Their son, Brady Wayne Lukas, was the bravest 3 
1/2-year-old boy in the world, making audio tapes and taking them to the 
hospital to set beside his comatose father's ear. Jeff's own dad, Wayne Lukas, 
the prominent trainer, took care of their horses and took calls from former 
Presidents and sportsmen, strangers and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 And the horse? 
</P>
<P>
 In a storybook plot twist if ever there was one, by May he was running in the 
Kentucky Derby, trying gamely, though not winning, as Jeff and Linda Lukas 
watched from home on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Tabasco Cat won the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more weeks later, Jeff Lukas put on the same clothes he had worn on the 
day of the Preakness, returned to the same friend's house, sat in the same 
chair and watched the same TV. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw Tabasco Cat take the Belmont Stakes as well, winning two-thirds of the 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That horse," Jeff Lukas says, in the understatement of his life, "can 
definitely run." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, as it happens, Tabasco Cat will be running at Belmont again in the 
Jockey Club Gold Cup. That same day, Jeff Lukas is expected to run his fine 
filly, Serena's Song, in the Oak Leaf Stakes at Santa Anita. His well-being is 
such that Jeff is totally entrusted again by his father to conduct business as 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wayne Lukas who rushed to his son's side, that morning 10 days before 
Christmas, after hearing a commotion outside his barn. The 2-year-old chestnut 
Tabasco Cat had panicked while being washed. The horse broke free from his 
handlers and went galloping along the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was working over there," Jeff Lukas says, gesturing toward the 
stables, "when the horse got loose. It must have come charging up the road and 
I jumped out in the way, trying to slow him down. I really don't remember a 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He was trampled, and his head hit the gravel. He was unconscious instantly. A 
helicopter air-lifted Lukas from the track in Arcadia to the hospital in 
Pasadena, where his condition was listed as grave. 
</P>
<P>
 When he awoke, he had to be told what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the horse ever stampeded that way before?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never." 
</P>
<P>
 "Had any of your horses?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Never." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas toes the ground, looking around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever intend to try to stop one that way again?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not on your life." 
</P>
<P>
 With a new Oak Tree racing meeting beginning at Santa Anita, he has 
responsibilities galore. Two top juvenile fillies alone, Serena's Song and 
Flanders, are among the best around, and could end up in the Breeders' Cup next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 But much as a trainer brings a horse along gradually, everyone wants to bring 
along Jeff Lukas gradually. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his friends, Shane Crowell, has been helpful in getting the Lukas 
horses fine-tuned. He says, "Jeff's doing great. Just great. His first day 
back, though, he stuck out his hand and said, 'Hi, I'm Jeff. We'll be working 
together.' Now I've known Jeff a long time. I just laughed and said, 'Yeah, 
Jeff. We've been introduced before.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Once a month, Linda takes her husband back to the doctors for an exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say the human brain is like a computer, that a wire can come loose from 
time to time, but it still has great backup systems built in," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas does still have a blind spot here and there. 
</P>

 "Not about anything major," he says. "Every so often someone will mention 
something and it won't immediately ring a bell. But I feel perfectly fine. 
Everything's pretty much back to normal. It was an experience I don't 
recommend, but going through this really makes you count your blessings." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them, having a horse that can run so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 And being around to see him run. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas, at work again, at ease again, shrugs and says, "I guess I couldn't 
slow him down."

GOING FOR THE CYCLE; FOSTER REACHES NEW HEIGHTS ON HIS BIKE IN 49 STATES, BUT 
50TH IS A TALL ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bicycling along the Great Wall of China made Kevin Foster the big wheel he 
always wanted to be. But he soon realized an encore was necessary. Fame is 
fleeting and sponsors demand results. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Wall could be eclipsed only by great heights, Foster figured. So the 
pony-tailed, 34-year-old with the intrepid, child-like spirit of Forrest Gump 
spent the last year biking and hiking to the highest natural points of 49 
states, an endeavor he calls "American Summits." 
</P>
<P>
 Decked out in stars and stripes and calling himself Captain America, Foster 
racked up 30,000 miles on a customized Econoline van. He crisscrossed the 
country chewing Tootsie Pops and Gummy Bears, dodging pesky park rangers in 
search of one peak experience after another. 
</P>
<P>
 From July 3, 1993, to Aug. 22 of this year he cycled to 34 summits and reached 
14 by hiking with his 26-pound, $11,000 bike strapped to his back. As long as 
both reached the top together, victory was claimed. At each summit, Foster and 
the bike were photographed, a bolt of red, white and blue waving in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, a former actor who has never cycled competitively, lives for encores, 
each more ambitious than the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom said to me, 'All you have to do is ask and the worst anybody will do 
is say no.' " he said. "But she never knew I would ask for such outrageous 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster overcame red tape and the Red Army to reach the Great Wall in 1990 
after five years of trying; he braved 120-degree Gobi Desert heat and something 
called "Nine Dragon-Gate Pass" to complete the 1,174-mile trek in 50 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems ranging from a head injury sustained when he was hit by a truck to 
the student protests and massacre outside Tian An Men Square caused Foster to 
postpone the trip four times. When he finally pulled it off, he earned a 
Cyclist of the Year Award from Bicycling magazine. The Great Wall ride was 
itself an encore. Foster holds a Guinness world record set in 1989 for riding 
the entire New York subway system in the shortest time -- 26 hours 21 minutes 8 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic feats or publicity stunts? Foster is an enigma, at once a tenacious 
achiever and tireless self-promoter who has endeared himself to a cycling 
industry sorely in need of a marquee name other than Greg LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's 20-plus sponsors gladly financed the Great Wall ride and American 
Summits tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "People admire him for what he is doing," said Phyllis McCullough, marketing 
director for Klein mountain bicycles. "He's a great adventurer. The Great Wall 
ride gave him credibility. When he says he will do something, he does it." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year Foster plans to cycle across Cuba "in the name of peace and 
goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he says, he will shoot for the moon, a vision formed on a clear night in 
Mongolia outside the Great Wall. "The moon was so huge it seemed I could walk 
over and step aboard," he said. "I'd like to take a bike up there and do 
fantastic wheelies on the Sea of Tranquillity." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster claims a shocking experience at age 8 is responsible for his eccentric 
nature. To be exact, 65,000 volts and 30 amps worth of shock after he grabbed a 
high-tension wire while climbing a tree. He fell 30 feet and spent four years 
in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The electricity erased the first eight years of my life, wiped it clean," he 
said. "I had to relearn everything. I'm Peter Pan. I don't want to slow down. I 
appreciate things others take for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his lunar plan, Foster pitched it to NASA without a second thought. 
"What makes it funny is that it was serious," he said. "They thought I was a 
nut, but I was a nut who had cycled the Great Wall of China. I met with a 
couple of engineers and asked, 'What's it gonna take to get me and my bike on 
the moon?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: $5 billion, three years of training as an astronaut and a 180-pound 
bicycle to compensate for diminished gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 A more realistic goal is reaching the 20,320-foot peak of Mt. McKinley to 
complete American Summits. The mountain is climbed rather routinely, but hikers 
fail to reach the peak routinely as well -- sometimes losing their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven people died climbing Mt. McKinley in 1993, including nine in May, 
according to the National Park Service. About half of the 2,000 or so who try 
the climb annually make it. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley is more unforgiving than the highest peaks Foster has scaled -- Mt. 
Whitney, Mt. Elbert and Mt. Rainier, each of which tops out at a little more 
than 14,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, who blames his divorce last year on his obsession with American 
Summits, will head for the hill of hills sometime next summer. "I'm not saying 
exactly when because I don't want rangers to stop me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe Foster is his own worst enemy. His doubters include 
Wendy Campbell, a free-lance photographer who accompanied him on the first 
eight climbs in July, 1993. They parted after a disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin has no sense for the landscape and he doesn't pay attention," she said. 
"He could get lost in a paper bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell and Willie Treese, a 16-year-old who helped carry supplies, were 
angered when Foster led them to the wrong peak in Utah. "We got to the top and 
I pointed to the next mountain and said, 'I think that one's higher,' " said 
Campbell, who added that they climbed down, then trekked up King's Peak, the 
proper summit at an elevation of 13,528 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster admits to the gaffe, and points out that the integrity of the project 
was preserved by climbing to King's Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster also made a wrong turn descending Humphreys Peak in Arizona, the first 
summit they scaled, and a search-and-rescue team found him huddled under a 
fallen tree at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where my troubles started," said Campbell, who nevertheless has kept 
in contact with Foster and applauds his doggedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who dismiss the American Summits effort as a mountain-sized ego 
boost acknowledge that Foster is focusing attention on a political struggle 
between mountain bikers and hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilderness Act of 1964 stipulates that "no form of mechanical transport" 
be allowed in National wilderness areas, which include several state high 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain bike enthusiasts say the law is outdated. The Sierra Club recently 
met with the International Mountain Bike Assn. and agreed for the first time 
that mountain biking is a legitimate form of trail usage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things Kevin has done have helped (the plight of mountain bike riders)," 
said Bill Strickland, managing editor of Bicycling magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Strickland pointed out Foster's ordeal reaching Brasstown Bald, the high point 
of Georgia. Foster was prohibited by rangers from riding his bike the last 
half-mile, despite the fact the road was paved and buses were transporting 
tourists to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was so embarrassing," Foster said. "I slung an assembled bike over my 
shoulder and was hiking up a paved road, with a bus full of tourists passing 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The walk back down was worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "A thunderstorm hit. I could have been back in two seconds if I'd have hopped 
on the bike, but I had given my word, so I walked down," he said. "I was soaked 
to the skin, and there goes the bus of tourists passing me, bone dry." 
</P>
<P>
 At Mt. Rainier in Washington on Aug. 19, 1993, Foster was less amenable. He 
and two companions were met at the base of the mountain by three rangers, who 
said they had received a fax from the National Park Service barring Foster from 
making the climb with a bicycle -- even strapped to his back. 
</P>
<P>
 A rancorous exchange finally ended with Foster leaving the bike wheels behind. 
"The photos (at the summit) look ridiculous, me sitting on a frame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his difficulties, Foster believes that in seeking each high point he 
has found America. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Kempton, Okla., near the Black Mesa summit, Foster signed autographs for 
the entire town, population 23. "Somebody's aunt was visiting from Arkansas, so 
I actually signed 24," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reaching the summit of Granite Peak, Mont., required scaling a sheer 
500-foot cliff. Foster hired a mountain climbing guide from nearby Jackson 
Hole, Wyo., and made the top moments before a terrifying thunderstorm hit. The 
guide, Steve Walker, pointed out that the bike attracted lightening and quickly 
had Foster rappel down the cliff.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Lord loves and blesses fools and little children, so I am doubly 
blessed," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moments after being photographed on the peak of Mt. Arvon, Mich., reached 
following a perilous drive on logging roads in thick mud, Foster was startled 
by a blue Cadillac whipping into the turnout. "Who else would be crazy enough 
to do this?" Foster thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the car stepped an Elvis Presley impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Captain America meets Elvis on Mt. Arvon!" Foster said. "He was showing his 
girlfriend the high point of Michigan. He said he came up there all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, that's the tour. That's America. That's what makes it." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's definition of patriotism comes down to this: freedom to pursue his 
dreams, however bizarre they may be. 
</P>
<P>
 His dreams are financed by corporate America, and that is key to the 
definition. "What he's doing is amazing, and that's why we sponsor him," said 
Don Davis of Bell Helmets, who provided Foster with his van. "I actually 
thought that somewhere along the line he would get disillusioned and quit, but 
he is kind of obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Home in Kaweah, Ca., where he moved last year after living for several years 
in Ojai, Foster is plotting his next move. He admits that getting rich -- which 
has not yet occurred -- is part of his plan.  
</P>
<P>
 He casually tosses around ideas for expeditions that would make most people's 
knees weak: Cycling Mt. Fuji, or Mt. Kilimanjaro, or the Grand Canyon, or the 
Appalachian Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not a competitive cyclist, yet he is doing things an ordinary person 
wouldn't think of doing," said Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine. "Some 
of his rides are strenuous, but certainly it's not like winning the Tour de 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of what makes what he does appealing. Anybody could do these 
things if they got off the couch and put their mind to it, but only Kevin has 
done them." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster's latest obsession will not end until Mt. McKinley is scaled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a talk with the Lord and said, 'Don't let me do 49 states and hold back 
one,' " Foster said. "I will get McKinley."

OWNERS REQUEST MORE TIME; BASEBALL: WITH NEGOTIATIONS POSSIBLY RESUMING NEXT 
WEEK, MANAGEMENT ASKS UNION TO DELAY FREE AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the possibility that baseball's collective-bargaining talks will resume 
next week, management lawyers have asked the players union to delay start of 
the free-agent filing period until Nov. 30 and for an immediate 45-day freeze 
on contract signings. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig said Tuesday night that he was hopeful the union 
would respond to the request today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would put everything on hold for 45 days, allowing us to concentrate on 
what we need to do most -- negotiate," Selig said. "We obviously think it would 
be constructive." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said he was hopeful the sides would return to the bargaining table next 
week, but nothing is set. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a union lawyer said it is likely the talks will resume -- motivated, 
in part, by a concept that Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos offered to the 
union's executive director, Donald Fehr, during an informal discussion Sept. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Angelos' plan, the union would tax player salaries and add that pool to 
the $70 million that would be funneled to the small market clubs via the 
owners' proposed revenue-sharing formula. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no salary cap, but salary arbitration would be eliminated in 
return for earlier free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fehr, who is addressing the Los Angeles Bar Assn. today: "We're open to 
any and all ideas, but our opposition to a cap hasn't changed. I didn't have an 
extended conversation with Angelos, so it's difficult for me to talk about his 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the request to delay the start of the free-agent filing period and put a 
45-day hold on contract signings (the owners also would pledge not to implement 
their salary-cap proposal during this period), management lawyer Chuck O'Connor 
said: "The idea is to stop the train before it leaves the station. We don't 
want to create two different classes of players who signed under two different 
economic systems." 
</P>
<P>
 With no World Series, the expired provisions of the current bargaining 
agreement call for free-agent filing to begin Oct. 15. More than 190 players 
are eligible, but that total might decrease as club's exercise 1995 options. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been only two contract signings since the strike began Aug. 12, 
both by the Cincinnati Reds for two years. Outfielder Thomas Howard will get 
$1.35 million, and ex-Dodger infielder Lenny Harris will get $1 million.

<P>
 Oriole owner Peter Angelos is determined to add another pro sports franchise 
to his portfolio. He is working to bring the Rams to Baltimore, although he 
would certainly be happy to take the Buccaneers out of Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Baltimore Buccaneers," he said. "I like the sound of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has a standing offer of $200 million for the franchise, although 
Buccaneer officials said they are not considering bids. With that in mind, 
Angelos has focused his attention on the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on it for quite a while now, and I would say our chances 
are very good that we will be successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos went to Los Angeles last month to continue his negotiations with the 
Rams, who have said they will make a decision in the next month or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer accompanied Angelos to the meeting with 
the Rams. He left the session with much less optimism than Angelos.

COHEN PROMOTED TO REGIONAL GENERAL MANAGER OF NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathryn (Kitty) Cohen has been promoted from vice president of finance for 
Prime Ticket to general manager of the regional sports cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who becomes one of the highest-ranking female executives in sports 
television, replaces Roger Werner, who served as president of Prime Ticket for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner left the company in August when the sale of Prime Ticket 
Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) was completed. Werner, who was the president of 
ESPN before coming to Prime Ticket, continues to work for Bill Daniels, the 
former owner of Prime Ticket, as the head of a new programming ventures 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of Cohen's appointment as the new head of Prime Ticket was 
made Tuesday by Ed Frazier, the president of Texas-based Liberty Sports, a 
division of TCI and the new parent company of Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kitty has played an integral role in the network's development and was 
selected after a thorough review of internal and external executives," Frazier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Barron, who was brought in by Liberty as acting general manager after the 
sale of Prime Ticket, will continue to serve as a consultant to Liberty Sports 
in his role as president of TransMedia Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, a 1982 graduate of Colorado State with a degree in business 
administration who is also a certified public accountant, worked for Daniels & 
Associates in Denver before Daniels brought her to Prime Ticket in 1988 as the 
network's finance controller. In 1989, she was promoted to vice president of 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said she doesn't foresee any personnel changes at Prime Ticket. "The 
staff we now have in place is excellent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said there are talks involving expansion of the network's popular news 
show, "Press Box," possibly adding a 7 o'clock edition to the regular 10 
o'clock edition and also farming it out nationally to other Liberty regional 
sports networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Werner: "Kitty was a great chief financial officer and she undoubtedly 
will make an excellent general manager for Prime Ticket."

'WE BLEW IT,' TROJANS' ROBINSON SAYS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COACH ACKNOWLEDGES THAT 
DECISION TO ABANDON RUSHING ATTACK WAS COSTLY IN LOSS TO OREGON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson took a major share of the blame for USC's surprising loss 
to Oregon, saying Tuesday he blew the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at his weekly media luncheon, Robinson said he "probably panicked a 
little bit" in the third quarter of the 22-7 loss, "trying to get points on the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said his quarterback, Rob Johnson, might not play at Oregon State on 
Saturday afternoon. Johnson suffered a sprained ankle against Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 USC fans criticized the Trojans' offense after Saturday's defeat by the 
19-point underdog Ducks. Many wondered why tailback Shawn Walters, who had 
carried 31 times and gained 207 yards the previous week against Baylor, had 
only 17 carries -- and 78 yards -- against Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made an error in getting away from the run," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't do that -- sustain a total commitment to the passing game. I think 
if we'd continued to run we'd have established a rhythm. But we went (totally) 
to the pass and we were ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The coaching staff) looked at the film Sunday, and we said, 'Look, we 
screwed this game up.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We blew it. We had better players than they did. The reality is, we lost to a 
team we probably should have beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked (by the game). We had a good week of practice. We knew Oregon 
was a threat to us. But we misfired the whole game. We had 74 offensive plays 
and maybe 40 of them were good ones. Everything else was penalties, 
misconnections, sacks . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Walters had almost nothing to do for most of the last quarter. He had 13 of 
his 17 carries in the first half, then only two each in the third and fourth 
quarters. After he had gained nine and seven yards in USC's first 
fourth-quarter series, he never got the ball again. The Trojans passed on 12 
consecutive downs to finish the game. Of their last 26 second-half plays -- not 
counting punts -- the Trojans passed 26 times and ran four. 
</P>
<P>
 USC trailed by 16-7 at the half and, 19-7, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson indicated Tuesday that he isn't as worried about his injury as 
Robinson is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine," he said. "Straight ahead, straight back I'm OK. It's just a little 
sore on the outside of the ankle. This type of sprain (high on the ankle) is 
slow to heal, but it feels great today. It improved a lot overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Robinson had said he wouldn't decide on Johnson's availability until 
Saturday. He said he would take a long look at Johnson on Friday at 4 p.m., 
when the Trojans work out at the University of Oregon's Autzen Stadium. Autzen 
has artificial turf, as does Oregon State's Parker Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear to be a severe sprain, but if he's not close to 100%, I 
won't play him, not on artificial turf," Robinson said. "If he's still limping 
Friday or Saturday, he doesn't play." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was injured in the third quarter on the last of his seven sacks, when 
he was tackled while spread-eagled. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I watched the film, I'm lucky my right knee didn't get blown out," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was almost doing the splits when I got hit -- my foot slipped on the turf 
-- and on the film you can see my heel touching my hip (on the tackle). My knee 
was really at a bad angle." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's sacks continue to frustrate Robinson, and it showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to work harder at getting the ball out of there," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pride ourselves in the high-completion percentage (68%) and the low 
interception percentage (Johnson has thrown two in four games, and only 24 in 
his 28-game career), but the glitch in all that are the sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sacks are killing us." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, however, Johnson said only two of the seven sacks were preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should've thrown it away on two of those sacks," he said, indicating he 
couldn't have on the other five.

 The foot-long rockfish, reddish-brown with bulging black eyes, swam up to the 
bubble-blowing intruder and, face to face, shot him what seemed an angry glare. 
</P>
<P>
 The diver flinched and the fish was gone, having darted into the safety of the 
reef. 
</P>
<P>
 David O. Brown, and two associates from the underwater documentary team of the 
Santa Barbara-based Passage Productions, continued their narrated dive, the 
purpose of which was to show off the abundance of life at the foot of an oil 
platform called Hazel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazel, a mile or so off the Santa Barbara coast, is one of four rigs built by 
Chevron in the 1950s that, having lost productivity, must come down. The dozens 
of other rigs off the California coast will someday face a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, unless a group of concerned fishermen have their way. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Anglers of Southern California, supported by scientists and 
biologists and, in theory if not officially, some state agencies, including the 
Department of Fish and Game, is trying to start a rigs-to-reefs program similar 
to that already in place in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no arguing that the structures beneath the platforms are rich in sea 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent dive at Hazel, Brown and his partners, diving from Santa Barbara 
Sea Landing's Condor, beamed a live telecast to the scientists, biologists and 
government officials gathered on deck. Many of them are or will become involved 
in the program -- if indeed it gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bug-eyed rockfish left Brown in its bubbles, he turned his camera to 
the bottom of the sprawling structure, which was covered with brilliant, white 
anemones reaching out and flowing beautifully in the swift, cool currents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about it, and look at it, an anemone is really an upside-down 
jellyfish attached to the bottom," said Brown, a former diver with Jacques 
Cousteau's team. "Their tentacles have stinging cells that actually harpoon 
their prey and reel the prey in where the mouth absorbs it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, wearing gloves, touched one of the anemones and it quickly withdrew its 
tentacles, taking on the appearance of a short, rubbery white tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The divers then worked their way up to about 60 feet. Another type of anemone, 
brilliantly colored in various shades of red, orange and white, flourished on 
the superstructure. Barnacles and rock scallops were thick on the pilings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things tend to pile on top of themselves on any type of a reef, and this is 
of course a reef that we're looking at -- an artificial reef but a reef 
nonetheless," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 He plucked a crab from one of the pilings, released it and it used all eight 
legs to scamper into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea stars, cucumbers, urchins, and a strange species of animal called stinging 
hydroids, which look more like plants, smothered the structure. Brown stuck a 
hand in the middle of the flowing plant-like animals and said, "If I didn't 
have gloves on, I would not want to do this, because I'd get a little rash that 
would last for about 30 minutes or so." 
</P>
<P>
 A large kelp bass, camouflaged almost beyond recognition, spied on Brown and 
remained still until Brown reached out to the fish, which quickly darted out of 
sight. Mussels were piled in bunches on the pilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown plucked a large sea star, or starfish, and its long arm-like tentacles 
probed about for something to grab. The animals feed on mussels and must think 
they are in heaven on these mussel-laden rigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "As reefs, they provide habitat, structure onto which things can attach," 
Brown said of the oil rigs. "A lot of things you see here wouldn't exist, were 
there not some structure for them to grab onto." 
</P>
<P>
 The divers ascended to 31 feet and the visibility improved dramatically. A 
huge school of sardines passed overhead, the small fish moving in unison in the 
currents. The superstructure of the rig was more visible, in the white light of 
a sun-lit sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelp bass, opaleye and yet another species of anemone, the green anemone, 
which actually uses photosynthesis, thrive at that depth. Brown, who along with 
Condor owner Fred Benko is running similar tours of the rigs on Wednesday 
nights through October, said larger game fish such as barracuda and yellowtail, 
and sometimes sharks, frequent the structure as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Love, a research associate at UC Santa Barbara's Marine Research 
Institute, said the rigs are ideal places to fish, but are also important as 
nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rigs will have between 10,000 and 20,000 fish on them, you just can't 
see them all," he said. "There will be adults and juveniles. But as far as 
larval fishes are concerned, if the (rigs) hadn't been here, they wouldn't have 
survived." 
</P>
<P>
 And for the rigs to stay, at least the lower halves, it's going to take 
something just short of a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the oil companies when the rigs went up was that they would 
be completely removed when their usefulness ended. United Anglers, however, 
would like to see them cut off well below the surface -- so as to remove any 
navigational hazards -- and use the upper halves to build and study artificial 
reefs in the Big Sycamore Canyon area, a mostly barren marine reserve near 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Frumkes, chairman of the United Anglers' Marine Resources Protection 
Act Committee, is spearheading the project and has suggested that Chevron 
donate not only the tops of the rigs for this part of the project but any 
savings it might realize by not having to remove the lower portions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the materials rerouted to the reserve and adjacent to the reserve," 
Frumkes said. "We're talking about building seven reefs in the reserve, and 
three outside it that can be fished." 
</P>
<P>
 The lower halves of the oil platforms would remain where they are and be 
augmented with other materials to provide divers and fishermen added 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron, however, has not committed to donating any potential savings to the 
marine reserve project and has other reservations about the rigs-to-reefs 
project. Its abandonment plan has long been drawn and deadlines with the 
companies doing the dismantling have already been set. The four non-productive 
rigs -- Hazel, Heidi, Hope and Hilda -- are scheduled to come down in about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Chevron said, even if it were going to alter its schedule, there are 
other criteria to be met, notably the transfer of title, which would make 
Chevron free of liability and other responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project has to be someone else's, not ours," said Lee Bafalon, senior 
land representative for Chevron. "And we will not go through the environmental 
review or permit process. . . . Someone else would have to be the (permit) 
applicant." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Parker, marine resources supervisor for the DFG, said the department 
might become such an applicant, but has yet to officially take a position on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're supportive of the concept, anyway," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until the state takes an official position, Chevron will proceed as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can really get their act together and get the government to step in 
and ask us or request that we deviate from our schedule, then we'll talk," 
Bafalon said. "But that's going to take some work." 
</P>
<P>
 In United Anglers' favor is its history at getting things done quickly and 
against heavy odds. The group in 1990 spearheaded the drive to pass the 
controversial Proposition 132, which banned the use of gill nets in state 
waters, sponsored legislation to restore the depleted white sea bass fishery in 
California and has coordinated efforts to build grow-out pens from San Diego to 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has helped build artificial reefs and thus has worked extensively with 
the California Coastal Commission, the DFG and other agencies that play roles 
in the cumbersome permitting process. In a meeting several weeks ago, United 
Anglers brought all of these groups together and afterward nobody was saying a 
rigs-to-reefs program was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody was saying it would be easy, either.

CHASING HIS OWN SHADOW; IBARRA MAKES GREAT STRIDES AFTER NEAR-FATAL AUTO 
ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel Ibarra had it all planned out. 
</P>
<P>
 After being No. 2 runner on the Fillmore High cross-country team in 1992 and 
'93, Ibarra was counting on a successful junior track season before becoming 
the Flashes' top performer in cross-country as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans were shattered the night of March 5, however, when Ibarra 
sustained massive head injuries in a car accident that left him in a coma for 
three weeks. Even after he regained consciousness, it took nearly three weeks 
for him to learn to walk, talk and eat again. 
</P>
<P>
 His recovery from near death has been called miraculous by doctors at Ventura 
County Medical Center, but perhaps characteristic of an impatient teen-ager, 
the 17-year-old Ibarra talks nonchalantly of his recuperation and is frustrated 
by his times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have a long way to go," he said. "I still don't feel that good when 
I'm running. I still don't feel strong like I did last year." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing eighth in last year's Southern Section Division IV 
cross-country championships, Ibarra placed 16th -- seventh on his team -- in 
last week's Tri-Valley League meet. His time of 18 minutes 11 seconds over the 
three-mile course is his best of the season, but pales in comparison to his 
1993 performances, when he ran 15:46 over a comparable course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Miguel will eventually get back to where he was, but it might take 
him a year or so," Fillmore Coach Epi Torres said. "Right now, running is not 
that easy for him. He's feeling heavy, he's feeling achy and he's feeling 
tired. But that's to be expected considering everything that he's been 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ibarra has no memory of the first three weeks after he emerged from 
the coma, his family and friends told him that he came to with a nasty 
disposition. He tried to yank out of his stomach a tube that was used to feed 
him during the coma, and even spit at and tried to bite those around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me that I had to be strapped down at times because I was wild and 
because I kept trying to pull the tube out of my stomach," Ibarra said. "But I 
don't remember any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra's first memories are from "around" April 15 when he was washing his 
face in a hospital bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember looking in the mirror and I saw the scars on my face," he said. "I 
was wondering how they got there. I had no idea what had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-car accident occurred on Highway 23, a winding two-lane road that 
connects Highway 126 in Fillmore to the 118 Freeway in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra and Jaime Luna -- his sister Rosa's boyfriend -- were driving south 
toward Moorpark when a car in the north-bound lane crossed the center line 
coming around a curve. When Luna, the driver, swerved, the other car slammed 
into the passenger side of his car where Ibarra was seated. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was so badly mangled that Ibarra had to be cut from the wreckage with 
the so-called jaws of life. He was rushed to Ventura County Medical Center, 
where he underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he survived the operation, Ibarra was not given much chance for 
recovery, according to his mother, Virginia, a native of Irapuato, Guanajuato, 
Mexico. "They said it was a miracle when (he) came out of the coma," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors associated with Ibarra's case say that his distance-running background 
played a part in his recovery. "Running really was the thing that helped me 
come out of the accident alive," Ibarra said. "If I hadn't been in such good 
shape, I don't know if I would have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the hospital in April, Ibarra has continued his rehabilitation 
at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. His mother took it upon 
herself to put some meat back on the bones of her hijito -- little son. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, Virginia's home cooking did too good a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11 Ibarra weighed 160 pounds -- 21 more than before the accident -- 
when he was given clearance to start running again in mid-July. Though his 
weight is down to 149, he figures he will shed several more pounds before the 
end of the season. A drop in race times should coincide with the continued drop 
in weight. Still, Ibarra is frustrated with the pace of his progress despite 
his remarkable recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times when he has said, 'Hey, I was helping to coach these 
guys last year and now they're beating me,' " Torres said. "And I just tell 
him, 'Well Miguel, that's what happens when you stick your head through a 
windshield.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Those might seem like insensitive words, but it typifies the Torres-Ibarra 
relationship in which they often trade good-natured barbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of quiet around people he doesn't know," Torres said. "But if he 
knows you and he likes you, he jokes around a lot. He has a real good sense of 
humor. . . . He jokes about my (thinning hairline) and my chubbiness and I'll 
get on him about other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Underneath Ibarra's wisecracks lies a commitment to running. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought about not coming back," he said. "I knew that I liked running 
and I couldn't be without running. So I knew I had to come back for 
cross-country." 
</P>
<P>
 During the spring, Ibarra will try to improve his personal best of 4:28.67 in 
the 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to run cross-country and track for Ventura College before 
transferring to Cal State Stanislaus.

MUCH-TRAVELED TIM KNIGHT NAMED BASKETBALL COACH AT HIGHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Highland High announced Tuesday it has hired Tim Knight as its basketball 
coach, the latest and most intriguing move in a flurry of Golden League 
coaching changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The itinerant Knight, 50, has run the gamut of coaching experiences, from 
professional basketball in Kuwait to high school ball in Ocala, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 He replaces Tom Mahan at Highland. Mahan was recently hired by Antelope Valley 
to replace Jim Hall, who took the job at Nordhoff last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Knight was set to be an assistant to Quartz Hill's first-year 
coach, Bernard Nichter, who took that job when Steve Hurst retired last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual for a coaching opportunity to arise in September," Knight said. 
"But I saw an opportunity to build a program." 
</P>
<P>
 Knight has not coached basketball for four years, since he moved to the 
Antelope Valley in search of affordable housing and got a job at Littlerock 
High teaching English and coaching the golf team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be fun to get back and do the things I do well -- and try to 
do them even better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was head coach of Kuwait's Qadsia Club in 1982-83 in the nation's highest 
league and won the Kuwait and Arabian Gulf championships. He was a predecessor 
of former UCLA Coach Larry Farmer at Qadsia Club, which received national media 
attention during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight also has worked for the basketball coaching association in Korea, was 
an assistant for U.S. International University and was coach at San Gabriel 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 As a student at Notre Dame, he was football team manager working for Hall of 
Fame Coach Ara Parseghian. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us in the valley to get someone with his credentials is a great thing," 
said Paul Arnold, Highland's vice principal in charge of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland were 15-9 last season, finishing second with a 10-5 league record. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a class act," Mahan said. "He's a real basketball enthusiast. I've seen 
him at clinics the past couple years, sitting in the front row -- and he wasn't 
even in coaching. He just loves the game."

BEAUREGARD RETURNS TO PRACTICE; FOOTBALL: CSUN OFFICIALS MIGHT RULE TODAY ON 
STATUS OF LINEMAN WHO IS ACCUSED IN SHOOTINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge lineman Jonathan Beauregard, accused by police of two 
counts of attempted murder, was back at practice Tuesday, but school officials 
have scheduled a meeting today that could decide his long-term fate with the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, 22, was arrested Aug. 29 on suspicion of shooting his former 
girlfriend and her male acquaintance in San Bernardino, his hometown. He hid 
news of the arrest from his coaches and teammates for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a senior and two-year starter, was given permission to miss 
practice Monday to tend to personal matters, but practiced with the team 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is still conducting an administrative review of the matter, a 
school spokesman said Tuesday. Judy Brame, associate athletic director, said 
Tuesday that she could not confirm whether school representatives had made 
contact with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Bob Burt said he is awaiting direction from school 
administrators. "It's kind of a limbo thing," Burt said. "Until they finish 
this review, he's free to practice if it doesn't cause problems with him and 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meeting regarding Beauregard's status is expected to include Athletic 
Director Bob Hiegert, Burt and Ron Kopita, dean of students. Hiegert was in 
South Carolina on Monday and Tuesday, attending an NCAA meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard is scheduled to be arraigned in San Bernardino on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Tuesday if he was pleased to be back with the team, Beauregard said: 
"Yeah, I am. But I really don't feel like talking right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Beauregard has violated no team rules, Burt said. According to 
the team handbook, players charged in criminal matters are assumed innocent 
until proved otherwise. Violations of team rules, though, are dealt with 
swiftly. For instance, linebacker Billy Dykes was suspended for Saturday 
night's game against Cal State Chico because he missed practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Beauregard) hasn't pleaded guilty and hasn't even been to court," Burt said. 
"This is the way I have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, similar matters are often dealt with expediently. A spokesman 
at UCLA said player suspensions in criminal matters are handled after 
consultation between the athletic director and coach. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA safety Tommy Bennett was sentenced Monday for his involvement on one 
felony count of grand theft and one felony count of filing a false financial 
statement. He has been suspended from the team since his arrest in March, said 
Marc Dellins, a school spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge officials were first tipped to Beauregard's arrest Friday night. He 
started in Saturday night's 47-17 victory over Chico. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Beauregard would play against Sonoma State on Saturday if the 
school fails to take action, Burt said: "How about if we deal with that 
(today)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, who attended practice on the day he was arrested, has started all 
four games for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with twice shooting Von E. Thompson, 26, of Rialto. Then he 
allegedly shot his former girlfriend, Dunyella Darshell Smith, 21, in the hip 
as she tried to flee.  
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who was struck in the arm and chest, was wearing a bullet-proof 
vest. Police said the pair was sitting in Thompson's truck, parked outside a 
bar, when the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents allege that Beauregard twice assaulted Smith in the past, but 
did not describe either incident.

FULLERTON REPLACES RHOADES AS MOORPARK BASEBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark High has hired former Musketeer assistant Scott Fullerton as its 
baseball coach. Fullerton will replace David Rhoades, who accepted an assistant 
coaching position at Pepperdine in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Athletic Director Rich Uphoff said Fullerton is just what he was 
looking for -- a coach cut from the same cloth as Rhoades. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very similar to David Rhoades in that he preaches discipline, 
conditioning and fundamentals," Uphoff said. "He's detail oriented, very 
methodical." 
</P>
<P>
 And equally successful as Rhoades, Uphoff hopes. Rhoades led Moorpark to three 
consecutive league championships and a 69-41-1 record over five seasons. The 
1994 season, in which the Musketeers finished 20-5, was Moorpark's finest under 
Rhoades. It included a 9-5 victory over Simi Valley, then ranked No. 1 in The 
Times' Valley poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very similar," Fullerton said of his comparison to Rhoades. "We try to 
play a classy type of baseball. We don't rag on other teams and we don't buy 
into other teams ragging us. We play high school baseball the way it should be 
played." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, 30, was an assistant under Rhoades in 1991. In 1992 and '93, he 
compiled a 31-3-1 record as coach of the Musketeers' junior varsity, which won 
back-to-back league championships (Tri-Valley League in 1992, Frontier League 
in '93).

PRIME TICKET NAMES NEW GENERAL MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathryn (Kitty) Cohen has been promoted from vice president of finance for 
Prime Ticket to general manager of the regional sports cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who becomes one of the highest-ranking female executives in sports 
television, replaces Roger Werner, who served as president of Prime Ticket for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner left the company in August when the sale of Prime Ticket 
Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kitty has played an integral role in the network's development and was 
selected after a thorough review of internal and external executives," said Ed 
Frazier, president of Texas-based Liberty Sports, a division of TCI and the new 
parent company of Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, a 1982 graduate of Colorado State with a degree in business 
administration who is also a certified public accountant, joined Prime Ticket 
in 1988 as the network's finance controller. In 1989, she was promoted to vice 
president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said she doesn't foresee any personnel changes at Prime Ticket. "The 
staff we now have in place is excellent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said there are talks involving expansion of the network's popular news 
show. LARRY STEWARTCOHEN, KATHRYN (

CRUSADING FOR THE CHILDREN 
</P>

 On Oct. 9, 1992, Debbie Mahoney of Tracy, Calif., read in her local newspaper 
that her former neighbor, an engineer convicted of molesting her 12-year-old 
son, had been released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, such information would not have been reported. But the article 
said that the man, Jonathan Tampico, had requested to be paroled to the state 
of Washington. Unlike California, police in Washington are allowed to disclose 
sex offenders' whereabouts. Mahoney read that neighbors there had forced him 
out and he would likely be returned to somewhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted to alert parents of his new community that Tampico was living 
there, Mahoney said. But "because California has no public disclosure law, I 
was not able to find out" where he would be living. 
</P>
<P>
 So Mahoney formed Safeguarding Our Children-United Mothers (SOC-UM) and began 
lobbying for AB 2500, a bill signed last week by Gov. Pete Wilson that will 
give the public access to sex offenders' records through a 900 telephone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not for vigilantism," Mahoney said. She said Tampico, a man she once 
considered a good friend, told the court that he tried to have a normal 
relationship with her son but could not control himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampico, a former engineer at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, was convicted 
of one count of felony child molestation and served 2 1/2 years of a six-year 
sentence. Police said Tampico was a member of NAMBLA (The North American 
Man-Boy Love Assn.), a group that advocates the rights of adults to have sex 
with children, and participated in a sophisticated international network of 
pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on parole in Alameda County, Tampico did not answer requests placed 
through his parole officer for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with this is (that) their sexual orientation is to have a 
relationship with a child," Mahoney said. "To tell them they have to remain 
celibate without any kind of therapy, without any help at all, is asking a 
whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to give them counseling. At the same time, we've got to teach our 
children what to look for and protect them by public notification. That's the 
only way." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Tampico's name will be listed among 40,000 child molesters in the 
900 number's data bank. The operator would not be allowed to disclose his 
whereabouts, but if anyone were to call and ask about him, they would learn 
about his conviction. The phone number would not have helped Mahoney's son, 
because Tampico had no previous record. Still, Mahoney said it is a "good start 
in protecting our children." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like a law similar to Washington's where the police department is allowed 
to notify the community that someone is in fact moving into their community," 
she said. "That is a true child's bill." LYNN SMITH

FROM DEATH, A CHANCE FOR LIFE; TRANSPLANTS: WILL THE COMPASSION SHOWN BY A 
BOY'S PARENTS LEAD TO MORE ORGAN DONATIONS? EXPERTS HOPE SO.

 The 60 students at Bodega Bay Elementary School talked this week about their 
friend and classmate Nicholas Green, who last year played Robin Hood in the 
school play. Nicholas died Saturday after being shot by robbers while 
vacationing with his parents in southern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers showed his classmates on a globe where Nicholas was when he died. The 
students in the three-room school, about 70 miles north of San Francisco, 
wanted to know why it happened, could it happen here? 
</P>
<P>
 They wrote letters and signed cards to the Greens. They did not ask, however, 
about the family's decision to donate Nicholas' organs so that five people -- 
strangers in another country -- might live with the help of his liver, kidneys, 
pancreas -- his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a topic many people don't talk about, and transplant officials in 
Southern California say there needs to be more discussions so families know 
what to do if tragedy strikes and they are faced with the question of donating 
their loved ones' organs. The Greens made a decision few people in Italy make, 
a decision that potential organ recipients everywhere hope and pray for. 
</P>

 June and Darrell Williams were just finishing dinner in their El Segundo home 
at 5:30 p.m. Friday. Darrell had prepared stuffed peppers, reaping the harvest 
of the first garden he had planted in years. The telephone rang. The heart they 
had waited for had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 p.m., they were at the UCLA Medical Center, which has the largest 
heart-transplant program in the nation, and surgery was performed that night. 
The retired Santa Monica cop had waited two months for a heart -- many people 
wait longer, many die waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 His history of heart problems goes back nearly 30 years. Now 66, he initially 
questioned whether he wanted a new heart. Perhaps it would be put to better use 
by a younger person. Hadn't he already lived a full life? 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1966, when Darrell suffered his first heart attack at 38, June was 
always setting goals. Initially, she hoped he would live to see their daughter 
graduate from high school, then college, then to see her married, have 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was told that he needed a transplant, Darrell had survived 
three heart attacks, two open-heart surgeries. He had three grandchildren now. 
Maybe that was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him it was his decision," June says, "and that I would support 
whatever he decided." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the telephone rang Friday night, he had decided he would go 
through with the transplant. Surgery went well. June has a new goal -- to 
retire in a few years, then travel with Darrell around the country in a motor 
home. Other goals are more simple: to have more gardens, more stuffed peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 She knows nothing about the donor of Darrell's new heart or the donor's 
family, and she doesn't quite know what words express her swirling feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," she says, "they lost a loved one." 
</P>
<P>
 It almost feels wrong to feel joy. But in time, when rejection of the new 
heart is not such a concern, when the donor's family has been given time to 
heal, she knows the words will come. Or maybe there will be another way to show 
her feelings. Both she and Darrell carry donor cards. 
</P>
<P>
 For about the past six years, the nation's pool of donors has remained flat, 
about 15,000 a year, 4,800 of whom actually become donors. The others are ruled 
out because of communicable diseases or for other reasons making them 
unsuitable. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Aug. 31, 5,359 Californians, more than in any other state, were on the 
national transplant waiting list, according to figures compiled by the United 
Network for Organ Sharing. Nationwide, the figure was 35,806. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight to 10 people die each day while waiting for an organ, says Elizabeth 
Flynn, spokeswoman for the Regional Organ Procurement Agency of Southern 
California (ROPA). And every 20 minutes, a new name is added to the national 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn says people who want to be donors should talk about it with their loved 
ones. Consent of the family is needed even with a donor card except under rare 
circumstances, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Rodriguez and her 24-year-old son, Luigi, talked about it a week 
before he was killed in a car crash June 1, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 They were watching "60 Minutes," and there was a segment about the 
right-to-die issue. It triggered a comment by Luigi that surprised his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he had signed his donor card. I said, 'Don't be discussing that 
now.' We were eating banana cream pie, and I slapped him and told him, 'Don't 
be talking like that.' One week later, it was not '60 Minutes,' it was my son." 
</P>
<P>
 When Luigi was brought out of surgery, he showed no brain activity. He was to 
have been married the following Saturday. Cynthia gave her consent to donate 
her son's organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia, of Azusa, now works as a family-services coordinator for ROPA, 
answering questions, providing assistance for families of prospective donors. 
</P>
<P>
 She saw Nicholas Green's father talking on television news during the weekend, 
and she flashed back to the night Luigi died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him saying how it was a chance to make some good come out of all this, 
and that's exactly how I felt."

ACES AT ANY AGE; THESE SENIORS DON'T JUST PLAY TENNIS FOR THEIR HEALTH. HARDLY. 
THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE THRILL OF VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Ed Saunders steps on the tennis court looking like one of those scraggly men 
in the ads for Skid Row missions: His gray beard a bit unkempt, pot belly 
hanging out of his shorts and, on his head, an ear-flap hat. 
</P>
<P>
 At 73, he appears barely alive. Indeed, the issue seems in doubt during 
warm-up -- he doesn't even try to reach any ball that doesn't come directly at 
his racket. A foot to the side, he lets it go. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the game begins, a transformation unfolds. As he's about to serve, he 
switches the racket from his right hand to his left and sends the ball curving 
to the far corner of the service box -- with outside spin, so it skids away 
from the helpless opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen love," says Saunders, a former University of Texas player who a few 
years ago -- before he got his artificial hip -- was undefeated in Southern 
California's "super senior" mixed doubles, where the man is at least 65, the 
woman 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers often patronize senior athletes, saying it's cute that they're still 
doing what they're doing at 65, 75 -- hey, some are out there at 90. But these 
observers miss by a mile the true spirit of these athletes, who smile wryly 
when the younger set speaks again of how what's important is the exercise, 
keeping the blood circulating, all that garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dusk of life, you see, they're liberated from the platitudes. They're 
free to relish the true pleasure of competition -- as the one socially 
acceptable way to humiliate your fellow man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your serve," Saunders says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The fitness craze that hit the United States in the 1970s carried a religious 
fervor to it, including faith there would be medicinal benefits from, say, 
running five miles each morning. If exercise wasn't viewed as the new Fountain 
of Youth, it was pretty darn close. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades later, medical experts still are grappling to figure out the 
benefits of all that sweat. The New England Journal of Medicine reported a 
survey of 10,000 Harvard graduates, suggesting those who took up "moderately 
vigorous sports" in middle age lived 10 months longer than those who were 
sedentary. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, however, was based on questionnaires filled out by the 
participants. Physical tests have produced more modest findings. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of Baltimore physicians began probing "master athletes" in 1958, 
focusing on long-distance runners. Pounding the pavement, they found, doesn't 
necessarily clear the arteries. "Our studies don't indicate any lower evidence 
of cardiac disease," says Dr. Jerome L. Fleg, a member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 What is boosted by the exercise, though, is the participants' "maximal oxygen 
consumption," more commonly known as "aerobic capacity." Whereas it declines 1% 
each year in most seniors, the drop is half that in the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not surprising, of course, that they can keep going better than their 
sedate counterparts; that's what "being in shape" means. But if they can't have 
eternal life, this seems a reasonable consolation prize: the ability to perform 
better, to keep kicking butt. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys compete," Fleg notes. "They're not doing it because they want to 
live an extra two or three years. They want to put more life in their years 
rather than more years in their life." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Kill them. Kill them. Kill them.  
</P>
<P>
 Sven Davidson smiles as he explains his philosophy 40 years after he was 
Sweden's star on the world tennis circuit. Now 66 and living in Arcadia, he for 
years terrorized players far younger -- when his health permitted. He once 
collapsed on the court with a heart attack and was all but pronounced dead. 
Four months later, he was competing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our Greek friends had it down pat 2,500 years ago," he says, then 
quoting the original Greek, "A healthy mind in a healthy body."  
</P>
<P>
 While there are senior leagues in many sports, from track to skiing, tennis is 
particularly intense because players compete not against the clock, but 
directly against each other. You can win not only by elevating your own game, 
but by making your opponent fold. 
</P>
<P>
 At a party during the Audi championships outside Palm Springs, players swapped 
stories about a 70-plus fellow from Northern California who drives a custom 
Cadillac with a stained glass window and who reads the Bible between games, 
looking for a spiritual edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the tension in the senior ranks is generated by relative newcomers to 
the sport, often retired executives who seem driven to prove themselves in a 
new environment, preferably by knocking off a former world-class performer such 
as Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 A prime example was the Palm Springs tournament organizer, Steve Solomon, a 
former college basketball player who took up tennis at 30 while a corporate 
vice president. "I would go out and make a list of people who wouldn't play me 
because I 'wasn't good enough,' " he recalls. "I'd say to myself, 'Next year, 
you're mine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is nationally ranked in the 55-and-over doubles, competing with legends 
such as Pancho Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 A Friday morning match at Solomon's tournament, on the women's side, featured 
a similar newcomer-versus-legend pairing. 
</P>
<P>
 The "novice" was Cathie Hall. In 1950, while bringing up two kids in Santa 
Monica, she watched exhibitions by a famous mother-daughter pair at Roosevelt 
Elementary School. They seemed like figures from some grand, lost era as they 
glided about the court "in their bingles and bangles and beads, and their 
floppy white hats." On one side of the net was May Sutton Bundy, winner of the 
Wimbledon championship way back in 1905. On the other side was her daughter, 
Dorothy (Dodo) Cheney, winner of the Australian Open in 1938. What marvels they 
were! 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades later, Hall took up the game herself, when she moved to Newport 
Beach and her husband suggested they join a club as "something social to do." 
Hall surprised herself with her agility, and when she reached 60, some women at 
the club told her there were legions of grandmas playing a senior circuit out 
there and that, with her power and speed, well, she might just clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Hall was ranked in the top 10 in the United States among women 65 and up. 
And whom do you suppose she was to play at Palm Valley Country Club? Cheney -- 
edging up on 80 now but the undisputed queen of the seniors, winner of 230-plus 
national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 A realist, Hall figured that Cheney might let her win three games, to be 
polite, then lower the boom. But the newcomer had another thought in the back 
of her mind: "It's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 a.m., a Corvette pulls up to the clubhouse. The license plate reads 
"Dodo C." 
</P>
<P>
 As Cheney makes her entrance, everyone has a word for her: The Prince racket 
representative wants to know what she thinks of the new equipment; Sven 
Davidson's doubles partner asks if she'll play in Europe this year; someone 
else asks if she's going to be on a display court, so they can watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this is a tough tournament for Cheney. While she's untouchable in her 
own age group -- 75 and up -- here the oldest division for women is the 65s, so 
she must "play down," against opponents much younger. That can be a hurdle even 
for her -- although no one expects a problem in the first round, not against 
Cathie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney is a picture of elegance in her whites and large cap, almost a bonnet. 
She still has textbook form, moving her feet and turning her shoulder for a 
full, fluid backhand, the maneuver most club players never learn. 
</P>
<P>
 She also knows all the tricks. On the first point, she sends Hall a message -- 
a drop shot barely over the net, with deadening backspin. Hall is frozen, 
helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall looks lost for several games as Cheney keeps going to the dropper, 
keeping her off balance. "If you play someone like Dodo, you get psyched out," 
remarks a competitor on the sidelines, Phyllis Adler, the reigning national 
70-and-over indoor champion. "She's such a legend, these other women shiver in 
their boots." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Hall settles down. Although lacking Cheney's backhand, her forehand 
is powerful and at a mere 69, she's fast, able to run down Cheney's softer 
shots. She wins a game, then another. Cheney shakes her head and takes a 
frustrated practice stroke. A chink in the armor. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they're even and -- to everyone's surprise -- the first set goes to a tie 
breaker. At the crucial point, Cheney tries yet another drop shot. Hall 
anticipates it, and slaps the ball to the far corner for a winner. First set to 
the underdog! 
</P>
<P>
 It's a war now. Cheney starts chipping back Hall's serve and charging the net 
to pressure her younger opponent. It works well enough to win the second set 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 10-minute break before the deciding third set, Cheney gobbles cough 
drops. Hall wonders is there's something wrong with her -- or if it's part of a 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd gathers for the climax. The desert sun is piercing, and some 
spectators toast it with $4 glasses of Chardonnay from a court-side bar. Next 
to it is a masseuse and his table, $1 a minute. It's not a bad life out here. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hill, sparks are flying in men's 65 doubles. Davidson and his partner 
are pitted against a team that includes a zealous lawyer from Colorado who was 
not in their class in his youth. At a critical moment, he stares when the Swede 
calls his serve out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a terrible call," the lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in no position to see it," Davidson replies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're famous for it," the lawyer snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suggest you shut your trap." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like you to try to make me." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't reach blows, but an umpire hurries to the court to keep watch. And 
Davidson quickly uses the episode to his advantage. He figures the lawyer will 
be over-eager and cut across to "poach" away his return. So he calmly hits 
behind the guy, at the spot he vacated. 
</P>
<P>
 Game, set, match. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle's the thing," Davidson says, headed for another title. 
</P>
<P>
 The women 65s are back in action. When tennis honchos first contemplated play 
in higher age brackets, some predicted "you'll never get enough women together 
who will admit their age." They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The final set between Hall and Cheney is nip and tuck. The key moment comes at 
four games each. Hall launches a stiff ground stroke at Cheney's feet, but 
Cheney is ready. She lunges into the court to pick off the ball before it can 
land -- then sends it back over the net at a sharp angle, out of Hall's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, it's match point. Cheney draws Hall in with another deft drop 
shot and lobs over her head into the open court. 
</P>
<P>
 The legend waves to the applause from the sidelines as they meet at the net to 
shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was a goner," Cheney says, shaking her head. "These legs of 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall shakes her head too. "Look at that last game, how I hit those balls out," 
she says. "It's time for self-examination." 
</P>
<P>
 There's hope for the future, though. Hall's mother lived to be 89 and her dad 
is still up and around at 99. With those genes, she should be a force when she 
reaches 90-and-over play. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson, however, does not expect to be killing opponents at that age. Soon 
after the Audi tournament, he decided that the excitement on the court posed 
too great a risk to his heart and gave up the racket for vigorous daily walks, 
"5.6 miles in 90 minutes," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't count out Ed Saunders at 90. 
</P>
<P>
 After his hip replacement, doctors suggested he forget tennis. He didn't 
listen, of course, but -- like Bo Jackson with his new hip -- was easing back 
into competition, "saving my drop shots and spins." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime? He was playing bridge. Competitive bridge. He's a master of 
the "weak two bid." Looks like one thing, means another. Fools 'em, he notes . 
. . like that "left-hander stinker serve."

DIALING UP A WEAPON AGAINST MOLESTATION; AGENCIES: BY NEXT SUMMER, CALIFORNIANS 
WILL HAVE A HOT LINE TO IDENTIFY CONVICTED SEX OFFENDERS. BUT IS IT FAIR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Its critics dismiss it as a hot line for hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Its champions say it will succeed where law enforcement has failed in 
protecting vulnerable children from pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
 A new law that establishes the seven-digit 900 telephone number, as yet to be 
determined, is the most talked-about part of California's reaction to the 
national alarm over child molesters. The politically popular measure, which 
Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law last week, will enable Californians by next 
summer to call the number and learn whether someone -- a neighbor, an employee, 
a youth leader or a boyfriend -- has been convicted of felony child 
molestation. They will also have access at their local police station to 
photographs and ZIP codes of thousands of the most violent and habitual 
convicted molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the bill sends a message to the offender," said Assemblywoman Barbara 
Alby (R-Fair Oaks), who sponsored the bill. "You've been living in anonymity 
and no one knows you're there. By golly, now you start acting funny around 
kids, someone might call up about you." 
</P>
<P>
 Or they might take more extreme measures. Residents of other parts of the 
country have used such information to run pedophiles out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington state, which allows police to notify a community when a sex 
offender has settled there, the home of a convicted child rapist was burned 
down the day he was scheduled to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, neighbors reportedly flooded the apartment unit of a rumored child 
molester and tacked up signs saying "Child Molester Two Doors Down." Likewise 
in Louisiana, which requires just-released child molesters to notify their 
neighbors when they move in, signs went up naming the offender. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you talk to victim's parents, they all say, 'If I had only known he was a 
sex offender, I would have never allowed my kid to be around him,' " Louisiana 
Assistant Atty. Gen. Greg Murphy said in support of notification laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are married with kids and have families," Murphy said. "One guy was a 
pillar of the community. He went to church every single day. He had been 
molesting kids for 30 years. . . . They have to gain your trust or they won't 
be able to be alone with your child." 
</P>
<P>
 California this year has sent a raft of messages to sex offenders. One new law 
requires them to verify their addresses every year; currently many move and do 
not re-register. Another establishes a special unit in the Department of 
Justice to monitor the whereabouts of child molesters and to perform undercover 
work to break up child sex rings operating through magazines and computers. 
Another requires registration for convicts who would otherwise have fallen 
through the cracks -- those whose sex-related offenses were dropped during plea 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a "one-strike" law could earn violent first-time child molesters 
sentences of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown reflects public anguish and frustration over several brutal and 
tragic killings of children by parolees in recent months. Entire communities 
rallied for reform after the deaths of Polly Klaas, 12, who was kidnaped last 
year from her Petaluma bedroom, and Megan Kanka, 7, allegedly lured this summer 
into the New Jersey home of a neighbor. The neighbor, a convicted sex offender, 
was charged in Megan's death. Another victim, Ashley Estell, 7, was abducted 
last year from a Texas park during a soccer game; a man on parole for a sex 
offense was convicted of her murder last week and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of that investigation, police learned that another sex offender 
had been scheduled to work as a soccer official for the same tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know pedophiles take jobs at fast-food places, toy stores, volunteer and 
charity organizations that deal with children. Women who are divorced marry 
men, unaware they are pedophiles who have gone on to molest their children," 
said Jack Stevens, a California assistant attorney general whose office 
initiated the telephone measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these people are not in prison, the only thing you can do is keep them 
from having access to children," said Stevens, who places little value on 
treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 65,000 convicted and released sex offenders in California, of whom 
about 40,000 were convicted of sex crimes against children, according to the 
state Department of Justice. Most have received little or no treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 In California and 38 other states, felony offenders must register with their 
local law enforcement agencies upon release. Even if offenders continue to 
provide their current addresses over time -- and in one study, three-quarters 
did not -- Stevens said law enforcement officials are permitted to use the list 
only to find suspects after a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new telephone number operated by the Department of Justice, anyone 
can call and ask if an individual has been convicted of a sex offense. The 
caller will need to provide the person's name and either date of birth, Social 
Security number, address, driver's license number or California identification 
number -- or the person's name and at least six physical traits such as height, 
weight, hair and eye color, and ethnicity. A Department of Justice operator 
will scan a list of felonious child molesters and either confirm or deny a 
match, revealing the specific crime involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from the calls, which cost $5 for the first minute and $2 for each 
additional minute, will be used to fund the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Addresses of registrants or information about victims will not be released. 
Nor will callers be able to obtain a blanket list of registered sex offenders 
in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can use the information to keep their children from associating with 
the offender. To guard against vigilantism, the 900 number leaves a record of 
the caller's location (calls cannot be made from a pay phone) and there are 
enhanced penalties for crimes committed against those on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, "the misidentification and discrimination resulting from this 
bill is going to be really unbelievable," predicted Francisco Lobaco, 
legislative director of the California American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go back 30 years on somebody who otherwise has rehabilitated 
themselves, reintegrated into society. Not only that sex offender, but their 
spouses and children are pariahs forever. Whether it solves any problems in 
society is problematic at best," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some social workers believe that the public ostracism will further drive 
pedophiles underground, hampering their recovery and making it more likely they 
may offend again. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Berlin, founder of the Sexual Disorders Clinic at Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore, said that while some of those who become sexually 
involved with children may exhibit a lack of conscience or social 
responsibility, others have an abnormal sexual orientation that cannot be 
punished or legislated away. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the image that fuels the legal crackdown -- faceless monsters 
kidnaping and murdering children on the street -- he said, "Tragically, one of 
the most dangerous places for children is in the home." 
</P>
<P>
 Misdemeanor molestation cases, which are less violent, are not covered by 
these new laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin said pedophiles' behavior can be modified, sometimes with drugs, to 
abstain even if they are not "cured." In one study of 600 treated offenders, 
92% were free of accusations after five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents worry the measure will open a floodgate of access to other types of 
offenders. "One concern is the next step would be the same for people arrested 
but not convicted," said Mary Broderick, executive director of California 
Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a statewide organization of criminal defense 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said legislation sponsor Alby: "Obviously the victims and myself would like to 
do a lot more. . . . The criminal justice system has been totally ineffectual 
in keeping the public safe. These people are not bank robbers. These people are 
terrible people."  
</P>
<P>
 To her, the trade-off is easy. "I say, real simple: You rape a child, your 
right to privacy is the least of things I'd see you lost, if I had any choice 
at all."

 It's trendy for college-educated 27-year-olds to move back home with their 
parents, according to news reports. I'm a college-educated 27- year-old, but I 
have not moved in with my parents. I have moved in with my friend Teri's 
parents, Sandy and Mel Breuer. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened like this: I quit my job to ride my bicycle to Florida and asked 
my parents if I could live in my old bedroom for a few months when I returned. 
"Fine, hon," they said. "We love you." 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks into my bike trek, I called my parents from a casino in Biloxi, 
Miss., and asked how they were doing. "Fine hon," they said. "We love you." 
Then they mentioned that they had decided to lease their house for six months 
and move to an apartment on the beach that was just the right size for two 
people. They didn't happen to mention where they had arranged for me to live. 
</P>
<P>
 When I returned to Los Angeles, the Breuers learned about my impending 
abandonment and offered to take me in. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two months after moving into Teri's old bedroom, I can say there are 
advantages to living with other people's parents. For one thing, it's less 
humiliating than living with your own. "Sponging off of other people's parents 
shows far more ingenuity," one friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 When you live with your own parents, no matter how old you are, you can't 
leave the house without them saying, "Whereareyougoing? Whoareyougoingwith? 
Whenwillyoubeback?" 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Breuers', when I grab my keys and head for the door, they say, 
"Bye." 
</P>
<P>
 My parents' refrigerator contains a bottle of grapefruit juice, a stalk of 
celery and a hunk of margarine. They call this "food." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Breuers', the fridge is packed with mango slices, fudge brownies, lemon 
bars, tortellini with pesto sauce, fresh bagels and dozens of balls of honeydew 
melon. They call this "something to snack on until we get to the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Mooching off other people's parents, however, is not as easy as it might seem. 
For one thing, there's the guilt of not paying rent. For another thing, there's 
the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The Breuers have a German shepherd named Magic. I have a condition called 
"defecatamagiphobia." In lay terms this means "fear that Magic will relieve 
herself in the house" -- something she has been doing recently. Magic is about 
180 in dog years and does nothing but lie on the kitchen floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, when the Breuers went to Texas, I spent the better part of 
five days nervously begging the dog to venture outside from time to time. Once 
outside, I couldn't just leave her there because it was 107 degrees, and I 
figured that if Magic bought the farm while the Breuers were gone, it would not 
reflect well on me as a house guest, despite the fact that I make my bed every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic aside, life at the Breuers' is not without its daily stresses. First and 
foremost is the issue of folding my bath towels in thirds. I grew up folding my 
towels in half, as did my parents before me, and their parents before them. 
It's a genetic thing in our family, like bunions. But at the Breuers', the 
towel racks are designed such that you have no choice but to fold your towel in 
thirds. Fold it in half, and the towel is too wide. Fold it in fourths, and the 
towel is too thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Folding a towel in thirds is not an easy thing to do. You have to hold the 
center of the towel in place by dropping your chin to your chest, a position 
that strains the sternocleidomastoid muscles of your neck and may or may not 
require twice-weekly chiropractic adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you must choose precisely the right points at which to fold the two sides 
of the towel inward so that the bottom of the towel forms a straight line. 
Inevitably you fail and are forced to repeat the process indefinitely, like 
Sisyphus and the rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of anxiety has been what to do with my used strands of dental 
floss. Growing up with my parents, this was never a problem. For one thing, I 
didn't floss. (My dentist set me straight on that one: "Gingivitis runs in your 
family, young lady.") And for another, I never cared what disgusting things I 
put into my bathroom trash can. After all, it was my parents' house. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Breuers' bathroom has such a nice, clean, white trash can. It doesn't 
seem right to blemish it with, well, trash. Besides, I have nightmares about 
how the Breuers will introduce me to their friends: This is Suzanne. She lives 
in our house, eats our food, doesn't pay rent and leaves our trash can full of 
webs of green dental floss covered with bean burrito remnants.  
</P>
<P>
 I continue to search for a solution but in the meantime have been slipping my 
dirty floss into a Ziploc bag that I keep stashed in my dresser drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 I just attended my 10-year high school reunion, and according to the Reunion 
Planning Committee, something like 92.7% of our graduating class is married, 
owns a home and has a doctorate in literature from Yale. This is not a 
particularly good time for me to be unemployed and living at the Breuers'. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, however, I had accomplishments to brag about. So what if half the 
class can recite "The Canterbury Tales" in Middle English? I doubt any of them 
can fold a towel in thirds.

'90S FAMILY; FINDING THE HUMAN TOUCH ON THE 'NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not satisfied with mere words on a screen, a few hundred contributors to the 
Internet's children-related MISC.KIDS news group have stepped away from their 
computer keyboards and put a human face on cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of personal computer discussions, MISC.KIDS regulars knew the most 
intimate details about their computer pen pals -- methods of birth control, 
labor and delivery difficulties, circumcision beliefs, as well as their 
children's history of breast-feeding, toilet-training, bed-wetting and 
emotional problems. But they had no idea what anybody looked like. 
</P>
<P>
 The more active participants in this high-tech discussion group came up with 
two low-tech solutions: an exchange of photos and family picnics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you've made those kinds of contacts, I don't think it's at all 
surprising that we'd want to physically meet," said MISC.KIDS contributor Beth 
Weiss, a University of Arizona adjunct lecturer. "I think many of us want to 
complete the mental images we have of the people we exchange E-mail with." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 photo album drew 178 participants from around the world, double last 
year's total. Each family contributed $22 and its own photos and captions. The 
book was put together using color copy machines and, because of security 
concerns, distributed only to contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to have a collection of pictures of the regular posters to know 
what they look like and a reminder of how old their kids are. I pull my own out 
fairly often," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 MISC.KIDS is a very active forum, with an estimated 50,000 readers. Its rules 
concerning user etiquette leave no doubt that most participants are practicing 
parents: "Please refrain from name-calling, tantrums or other hysterics -- we 
get enough of that from our children." 
</P>
<P>
 But the personal postings are at the heart of the news group. 
</P>
<P>
 "More times than I can count, the posts of 'my baby does x at age y' have 
helped me to realize that your (child's) mileage may vary," said Weiss, who 
compares the progress of her 2-year-old son, Jordan, with other MISC.KIDS 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The postings "have forced me to think about what I'm doing so that I'm acting 
rather than reacting as a parent," she said. "And I think that's what MISC.KIDS 
is all about . . . (it) makes me a better parent."

'90S FAMILY; LET'S MAKE A DEAL; THINK DIVORCE IS TOUGH? TRY PLANNING A FAMILY 
EVENT DURING ONE. THAT'S WHEN ALL-OCCASION MEDIATION HELPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For even the most happily married couple, planning a child's wedding or bar 
mitzvahcan lead to skirmishes over everything from the price tag to the guest 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Your mate says that if you don't invite Uncle Leo, you will scandalize the 
family; you worry that Uncle Leo's tendency to hit the nearest bottle and hit 
on the nearest blonde will scandalize the family. 
</P>
<P>
 If these blessed events are difficult for the happily married couple to 
negotiate, imagine what a source of strife they can be for the couple that's 
divorced or divorcing. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps it's no surprise that some former or soon-to-be-former couples are 
bringing such issues to divorce mediators. And mediators, who usually hammer 
out divorce agreements that cover such matters as child custody and alimony, 
are helping them come to terms on everything from color schemes to flower 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not happening so frequently that you'd call it a trend, but several 
mediators say they have had occasion to mediate children's weddings and bar and 
bat mitzvahs in the course of their parents' divorces. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Aaron, a Hartford, Conn., lawyer who's been doing divorce mediations 
for five years, says she is currently mediating a bar mitzvah -- her first -- 
for a couple handling the rest of the divorce in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not mediating the whole divorce, I'm just mediating that piece of it," 
Aaron says. "They're in litigation. And litigation, as we all know, takes a 
long time, and the court system doesn't accommodate bar mitzvahs and bat 
mitzvahs, so they needed to get this issue handled." 
</P>
<P>
 Mediators are often lawyers who also handle litigated divorces, or 
psychologists or psychiatrists who work with lawyers to put together agreements 
that will be accepted by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than hiring two lawyers and sicking them on each other in court, 
couples can sit down with a mediator and put together an agreement that they 
can then present to the court as their settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 It is cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our average one is about $3,500, but without kids it might be $1,500, 
something like that," says Bonnie Robson at the Family Law Mediation Service at 
the Institute of Living. "It really depends on how complicated the asset 
picture is. And also how agreeable the parties are. You know, lawyers always 
say that an angry divorce is an expensive divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 A mediated divorce can cost anywhere between $2,000 and $6,000, depending on 
the complexity of the case, Aaron says. Compare that to a litigated case where 
two lawyers are duplicating each other's efforts, and every hour they spend 
waiting around the courthouse is billable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mediated a divorce that ended up costing the parties somewhere around 
$4,000 to $5,000," Aaron says. "If they (had) litigated this divorce, it would 
probably have cost them each minimally $15,000 to $25,000 apiece. Because it 
was a complicated case, there were children involved, there were a lot of 
assets." 
</P>
<P>
 It is faster. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, a mediated divorce can be completed in 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 A litigated divorce can take anywhere from two to four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a case that's just coming up for trial in October," Aaron says. "And 
the case was started two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as a rule, it is much less nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sometimes see clients who are in the midst of litigating a divorce, and 
boy, how they end up hurting each other and becoming very suspicious of each 
other and the thousands of dollars that they spend on litigation, and I just 
know it's not necessary for most of them," says Dr. Leslie Strong, a mediator 
and president of the Connecticut Assn. for Marriage and Family Therapy. "Some 
people seem to require the catharsis of a battle. Most people really don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The people most likely to seek mediation, Strong says, tend to be those for 
whom "the family is bigger than their hurt or anger over the divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 He cites the example of one couple he worked with whose son was getting 
married even as they were getting divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of their discussion was about how to cope with the wedding," Strong 
says. "It seemed ironic to them to be going to the wedding of their son while 
at the same time knowing they were getting a divorce, and it kind of tinged the 
wedding with sadness, but they handled themselves with a lot of consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that mediation has been available for many years, mediators 
(perhaps not surprisingly) argue that it's still not as popular as it ought to 
be. A lot of people, seemingly unaware of the option, still choose to go 
through litigation's gantlet. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Robson says, more than half the cases that come before family court are 
"post-judgment" matters, "people who are already divorced and there's something 
going on and someone isn't complying with a part of the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 One solution to that problem, some mediators say, is something called 
mediation-arbitration, in which the mediator would be empowered to make binding 
decisions whena disagreement comes up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Frauenglass, a Glastonbury, Conn., lawyer who has been mediating 
divorces for about 15 years, is a strong proponent of that approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arbitration process is that you present your evidence just like you do to 
a judge and the arbitrator makes a decision," Frauenglass says. "Not a 
recommendation, a decision. You try to mediate, you do all the things that help 
people to get unstuck." 
</P>
<P>
 Other mediators have suggested that even couples who are not divorced or 
divorcing might find mediation a useful tool for resolving conflicts over big 
life decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples are not always in agreement even if they stay married and even if 
they have a good marriage," Robson says. "And what a mediator is is really a 
neutral third party who can help identify what the issues are and what issues 
they're in agreement about and what issues they're in conflict about and help 
them reach an agreement on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, a mediator might even help you solve the problem of Uncle Leo.

IT'S OK TO WASH AWAY THE GRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RECER, AP SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's OK to touch up the gray. A study of 99,000 women has found no evidence 
that long-term use of hair dye can cause certain types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The totality of evidence today is far more reassuring than alarming about any 
hazards of hair dye use," Dr. Charles H. Hennekens, head of the preventive 
medicine department at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the study, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hennekens said that a study of nurses ages 30 to 55 found that over a 14-year 
period there was no increase in what are called hematopoietic cancers among 
those who used permanent hair dye. Hematopoietic cancers include leukemia, 
multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
 A report on the study is to be published today in the Journal of the National 
Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study is the largest yet on the issue of cancer and hair dye, and it 
is statistically more powerful than most earlier work because the women were 
interviewed about their lifestyles before getting any disease and then were 
followed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hennekens said most earlier research that had found some association between 
hair dye and cancer were retrospective studies in which women who had cancer 
were asked to recall things about their diets, smoking and cosmetic use. He 
said those studies are weaker because the conclusions depended upon the memory 
of people who are seeking reasons for their illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society also have found no 
association between hair dye and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hennekens did acknowledge that some laboratory studies showed that some mice 
painted with hair dye did develop tumors, although the numbers of mice with the 
cancers were only slightly above normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not clear the precise relevance of these animal studies to humans," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Francine Grodstein, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health 
and a co-author with Hennekens of the Journal study, said the only possible 
exception to the general conclusion about hair dye safety is for women who use 
black hair dye for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 She said there is a suggestion in some studies that there may be a very slight 
increase in some cancers among these women, but that even this conclusion is 
uncertain and needs more study. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very small number of women, a subgroup within a subgroup," 
Grodstein said. "For the vast majority of hair dye users, there is no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Grodstein said that questionnaires used in her study asked about use of hair 
dye but did not ask about the color used. But the researchers did analyze the 
study data for women with naturally dark hair -- those most likely to use black 
hair dye -- and found no statistical evidence that they had more cancer than 
any of the other women in the study, Grodstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said the study concludes that "further investigation of the dark 
hair dyes and hematopoietic cancer is warranted."

 Although the baseball season has been canceled and the hockey season is on 
ice, sports fans found reason to cheer at "The Main Event at MainPlace '94," a 
benefit for Shortstop, the Orange County Bar Foundation's program for troubled 
youth. 
</P>

 More than 800 people turned up at Nordstrom in MainPlace/Santa Ana Saturday 
for a sporty fashion show that featured members of the legal profession 
modeling everything from athletic wear to evening gowns. The $50-per-person 
benefit was staged by Nordstrom, American Express and the Orange County Bar 
Assn. and netted about $30,000 for Shortstop, a bilingual juvenile crime 
diversion program. Winning Style 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of sports celebrities Greg Myers, catcher for the 
California Angels, and Los Angeles Raiderette Kim Seidenberg, all of the models 
were recruited from the ranks of Shortstop supporters. Volunteer models paid 
$500 each to take a turn down the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more striking was Nancy Pettus, the event co-chairwoman: 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this is MainPlace, we called this the Main Event and played off the 
sports theme," she said. Fashions included sweats, varsity jackets and career 
ensembles that Nordstrom dubbed "law suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests whooped and whistled when they recognized their favorite figures from 
the courtroom. The appreciative crowd included many attorneys, a fact not lost 
on emcee Bill Bedsworth, who joked: "We just got word that the O.J. defense 
team has finished dinner and gone home, so we are now the largest gathering of 
lawyers in California." 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, guests visited buffets stocked with hors d'oeuvres and 
desserts and indulged in a little after-hours shopping. Prevention 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop's mission is to keep troubled youngsters, most of them first-time 
offenders, from being lured into a life of crime. Youngsters and their parents 
must attend sessions at courthouses in Santa Ana or Newport Beach. They meet 
with people inside the judicial system who give them a glimpse of what their 
lives would be like if they continue to get into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a person-to-person program. The people passing the message are 
attorneys, probation officers and incarcerated kids," said William O'Hare, 
event co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters visit a holding cell and spend time with a ward of the California 
Youth Authority, who tells them what life is like in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The wards) are fairly toughened kids and sometimes they put it on pretty 
thick. They're not shy about confronting them," O'Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop serves 1,200 families a year. Youths are referred to the program by 
police, schools, probation departments and even parents. A study found that 
about 90% of youngsters stayed out of trouble after attending the Shortstop 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This works because we get the kids early. That's the key to turning them 
around," said Kathy Bonner, Shorstop director. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the models and guests were entertainers John Gastellum and Franz Miller; 
Judith Ryan, Shortstop board president; Jess Araujo, president-elect of the 
Shortstop board, and wife Donna; Jane Martin, Shortstop executive director; 
Michael Capizzi, Orange County district attorney; Michael Schumacher, chief of 
the Orange County probation department, and Mike Carona, Orange County marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Nancy Ramirez Reed, Rodger and Deanne Carey, Francisco Firmat, Kathy 
Derevan, Steve McCracken and Sue Waggener, Shannon Miller, William Grenner, 
Charmy Harker, Adriana Mier, Donald Morrow and Judy Johnson, Michael Hornak, Al 
and Cindy Stokke and Robert Whalen. KATHRYN BOLD

KPWR-FM HIP-HOPS TO A TOP RATINGS SHARE; RADIO: STATION TIES FOR FIRST WITH THE 
SPANISH-LANGUAGE KLAX-FM, THE LEADER FOR 2 1/2 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hip-hop KPWR-FM (105.9) has muscled its way back up the charts to the top spot 
among local radio stations, according to Arbitron radio ratings released 
Tuesday, tying for first place with the established front-runner, 
Spanish-language KLAX-FM (97.9). 
</P>
<P>
 KPWR had been in second place in the previous three-month survey but rose 
during the summer from 5.1% to 5.4% of the average daily audience. The 
station's morning team, tha Baka Boyz, was in sixth place, down one slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its 2 1/2-year dominance of the local airwaves, KLAX saw its 6.1% 
share of the audience drop to 5.4% over the summer, while its rowdy morning 
team of Juan Carlos Hidalgo and El Peladillo (Jesus Garcia) fell from first 
place to third. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Stern was the top morning personality, moving up from second place last 
spring. Stern, heard on classic-rock station KLSX-FM (97.1), was followed in 
second place by the veteran KABC-AM (790) team of Ken Minyard and Roger 
Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 The KROQ-FM (106.7) morning team of Kevin Ryder and Gene (Bean) Baxter dropped 
from ninth to 10th place, while the KLOS-FM (95.5) morning duo, Mark Thompson 
and Brian Phelps, remained in seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk station KFI-AM (640) rose from sixth place overall to third, with 4.7% of 
the audience -- a jump that may have been fueled by the O.J. Simpson murder 
case, which dominated most talk-radio programs during the second half of June 
and beyond. The bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were 
discovered June 13; the Arbitron ratings survey covered the period from June 23 
to Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 KFI's morning-drive period, which includes the shows of Bill Handel and the 
first hour of Rush Limbaugh, also soared -- from 10th place and 3.8% of the 
audience, to fourth, drawing 5% of all listeners tuned in to radio during that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Rival talk station KABC also appeared to benefit somewhat from O.J.-mania, 
rising from ninth to eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 But all-news stations did not seem to share in the flood of attention 
surrounding the Simpson case, with KFWB-AM (980) dropping from 14th to 19th 
place and KNX-AM (790) remaining static with a 2.6% share of the audience. 
KMPC-AM (710), which switched to an all-talk format on May 2, remained in 31st 
place, where it had been in the previous ratings period. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldies station KRTH-FM (101.1) made one of the biggest jumps of the period, 
leapfrogging from the 10th spot and a 3.2% share of the audience last spring, 
to sixth place and a 3.9% share in the summer. Radio Ratings

KOTTKE'S GREATEST HIT IS HIS ENDURANCE RECORD; MUSIC: THE VIRTUOSO GUITARIST 
WITH THE BEMUSED OUTLOOK ON LIFE HAS OUTLASTED TRENDS WITHOUT EVER STRUMMING A 
COMMERCIAL-SOUNDING NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What to make of Leo Kottke? 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his virtuoso, idiosyncratic guitar artistry, his dry, black-humored 
lyrics, and a voice that he himself describes as like "geese (breaking wind) on 
a muggy day," he hardly is the type one would figure to enjoy a long, 
successful career. Yet for 25 years now, Kottke -- who plays tonight at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano -- has endured, with nary a break in his 
album release or concert schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 His style, which has remained relatively stable, has outlasted trends from 
acid rock to disco, from punk rock to hip hop. His sound has never been 
"commercial" by any stretch, but there is little to dislike about it, once one 
gives it a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 His guitar technique is stunning without being ostentatious; there's a reason 
behind every note, whether he is playing six-string, 12-string, slide, acoustic 
or electric guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best trick," he said during a recent phone interview, "is coming up with 
pieces that are all hooks (musical phrases that immediately attach themselves 
to a listener). I love a hook. A lot of players either don't like them or feel 
above them, and a lot of players are above them, but I just love them. A hook 
is immediate, and it makes music easier for an audience to grasp." 
</P>
<P>
 Another aspect of his appeal is his self-effacing, ironic and vaguely blue 
sense of humor. His songs can come off like James Thurber crossed with Frank 
Zappa, and he is well known for engaging in witty patter from the stage with 
his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that performance is what keeps an audience," he said. "For a 
lot of performers, there seems to be a real fine line between making an ass of 
yourself and entertaining. But there has to be entertainment, because this is 
show business. There's no getting around that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kottke, 49, grew up in a family that moved from state to state a dozen times, 
which may be why he developed such a bemused outlook on life. As a child, he 
played violin, flute and trombone before settling on guitar at age 11, much to 
his mother's consternation. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was all right with the other instruments. But to her, the guitar was an 
aberration. It was like somebody spending all his time with a kazoo or a comb 
and a piece of paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to Kottke's complex, finger-picked style, one can hear strains of 
folk music, country music, blues and jazz, and one could suppose that Kottke 
must have grown up with a stack of records by Chet Atkins, the Rev. Gary Davis 
and Les Paul. But he says he learned to play without even knowing that these 
artists existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only guitar stuff I could find when I was a kid was like classical stuff 
by Laurindo Almeida, and I didn't like that. The sound I had in my head came 
from a record I had called 'Willie the Whale.' You hear this C chord: BRROOOM! 
Hi! That's the sound that I heard. And because of playing the trombone, I knew 
I wanted to play the guitar like a piano." 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah! I heard these horn lines and piano. I was really influenced by Little 
Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He began his recording career with "Twelve String Blues" on the aptly named 
Oblivion label in 1968. Since then he has released 25 albums, and he figures to 
have spent about 80% of his time on the road, where he's happiest. "The guitar 
still grabs me. If I'm away from playing for more than a couple of days, I 
really start to get weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year brought two career highlights. One was his tour as a member of the 
"Guitar Summit" (a title he says he found stuffy) with classical artist Pepe 
Romero, flamenco artist Paco Pena and jazz master Joe Pass, who died shortly 
after the tour ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "That tour was probably the nicest thing to happen to me in a while," Kottke 
recalled. "It ran about two months, and was the last thing Joe did in his life. 
It turned out to be a beautiful tour and a friendship that was too short. I 
thought I'd be able to pick Joe's brain over a two-month period, but you'd ask 
him a question, and he'd hum the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we approached this tour, I think all four of us expected it to be a 
disaster, but it turned out to be the opposite. The audience was comfortable 
with four distinctly different players and attitudes, and so were we. It really 
was a wonderful time." 
</P>
<P>
 He also spent some of 1993 in the studio recording "Peculiaroso" with Rickie 
Lee Jones. The album was released in January to positive reviews; Kottke 
credits Jones with maintaining its loose, fun atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working with Rickie on her record 'Traffic From Paradise' and she was 
like rolling on the floor, laughing her head off half the time. We were all 
falling apart, and I thought, 'This is what I need.' So I asked her to produce 
my record and in a weak moment she said 'yeah.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrific. Everybody brings an element of terror into the studio and 
she brought a new kind of terror I was totally unprepared for. She gets this 
glimmer in her eye that she's dead certain about something, and she goes with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the pair disagreed over Kottke's instrumental take on the 
Platters' "Twilight Time," a beautiful and introspective reading that is among 
the album's highlights. Jones hated the tune, but it wound up on the album 
despite her protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really detests that thing," Kottke said. "It probably has nothing to do 
with the song -- she did mention more than once that she hates that particular 
era in music. She doesn't like to hear anything from it: the attitudes that 
were around, the people in it. When she hears that song, I think she sees Ed 
McMahon as a young boy. It hits her right where it hurts. I give her credit for 
letting me put it on the album despite her feelings about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for Kottke: a live album, and a tour of Europe. He is well aware of 
having led something of a charmed life, of having been able to proceed with his 
own career above the fray, as if all the musical flavors of the month had no 
bearing on his own reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always surprises me, because people don't get to happen this way very 
often. I've had a kind of fairy-tale existence professionally, I know. It's 
chugged away at a perfect pace for me." 
</P>
<P>

Juan Capistrano. Cathy Cornell opens the show at 8. $18.50. (714) 496-8930.

'ROMEO AND JULIET' GETS DASH OF SPANISH GYPSY SOUL; DANCE: ARTISTIC DIRECTOR 
SAYS TROUPE WILL GET TO THE HEART OF FLAMENCO DURING ITS DEBUT IN ORANGE COUNTY 
ON THURSDAY. 
</P>

 The details may differ a bit, but there's Romeo, there's Juliet and there's 
reason to bring a hankie to Teatro de Danza Espanola's rendition of the 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't follow the exact same plot that Shakespeare did," said the flamenco 
troupe's founder, who goes only by the name Luisillo. "But our ballet is about 
two rival families and love between a boy and a girl that brings tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 " Luna de Sangre (Blood Moon)" is one of two works the 32-year-old company 
from Madrid will stage Thursday in its first appearance here and the first 
performances ever sponsored jointly by the Orange County Philharmonic Society 
and the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Luisillo, 68, who is the Teatro's artistic director and choreographer, created 
"Luna de Sangre" three years ago and has cast his 24-year-old daughter, Maria 
Vivo, in the leading female role. During a recent phone interview from Oakland, 
where the widely traveled troupe was beginning its second tour of the United 
States, he said he has passed onto her the lessons he learned as a disciple of 
one of Spain's great flamenco masters, Carmen Amaya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maria makes a very beautiful interpretation," Luisillo said, stressing that 
in flamenco "heart" rules over technique. "What makes somebody a great artist 
is what you have inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, flamenco was created by Andalusian Gypsies as a passionate expression 
of the profound grief they felt as itinerant yet deeply proud outcasts, 
disdained by a society that had branded them uneducated and immoral ("Luna de 
Sangre" is subtitled "Chronicle of a Gypsy Love"). 
</P>
<P>
 Two guitarists and two singers ( cantaors ) will accompany Vivo and the 
company's 22 other dancers. But, as Luisillo noted, most of the "music" is made 
by the dancers' loud, percussive foot stomping and hand-clapping. Castanets are 
used minimally during the second piece on the program, "Cafe del Puerto." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Named after a fictional cafe in the city of Puerto de Santa Maria, it is a 
plotless, lighthearted, improvised celebration of dance.  
</P>
<P>
 "Flamenco is a little bit like jazz," Luisillo said. "You have a theme and the 
singers start singing, then the dancers get involved, and together they develop 
the theme." The piece includes a dance-off between principals Daniel Fernandez 
and Mariano Cruceta. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, professional flamenco companies and soloists fill large concert 
halls and small cafes alike, but originally flamenco strictly was a private 
affair, said Luisillo, who has been choreographing works incorporating a 
variety of Spanish folk dance forms for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gypsies came to Spain in 1499, and flamenco used to be performed only 
between them. They used to sing and dance in their homes, never outside. Then 
late in the last century, schools for (other types of) Spanish dancing opened 
in Seville and the flamenco dancers came there and started singing and dancing 
for the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborate stage presentations can "adulterate" flamenco, he acknowledged. But, 
he added, they still can "represent flamenco in the purest form" and are as 
valid artistically as any symphony based on a traditional folk air. 
</P>
<P>
 "A composer takes a folkloric theme and converts it into a symphony with a 
full orchestra. With flamenco, you add feeling, lighting, costumes, decor -- 
naturally trying to keep the theme pure, but giving the work the necessary 
projection to convert it into a work of art." 
</P>

FAMILY; TAFFY FESTIVAL STILL HAS LOTS OF PULL WITH KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It started in 1985 with just a handful of veteran children's performers and a 
few amateur groups putting on a show at the Peter Strauss Ranch in Agoura. That 
year, a scant 800 people found their way to the first Theatre Arts Festival for 
Youth -- TAFFY for short -- for an outdoor family day of songs, stories and 
puppetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Word spread and TAFFY grew into an annual, all-professional event of top 
children's entertainment, attended by thousands of parents and children each 
October and frequently referred to as a Woodstock for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Taubman and Craig 'n' Co., Joanie Bartels and Dan Crow are among the 
popular children's performers whose exposure at TAFFY gave their careers a big 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
 When the festival returns for a 10th time to the rustic Peter Strauss ranch on 
Saturday and Sunday, a little show-biz gloss will be supplied by Adam Wylie of 
"Picket Fences," Ryan (R.J.) Francis of "Sisters" and "Married . . . With 
Children's" Shane Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 But producer John Wood promises that the festival remains true to its 
home-grown roots, with a generous lineup of talented children's favorites, 
multicultural music and dance and hands-on activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've dropped ticket prices $1 across the board and we're turning the event 
into a 10th birthday party for Taffy the Mouse," Wood said, referring to the 
festival's mascot, a member of TAFFY's Puddledumplin' Players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Players, a troupe of professional actors in artistic animal makeup and 
Victorian-era costumes, interact with festival-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids can make birthday presents for Taffy, wedding gifts for Lord and Lady 
Bacon (Puddledumplin's swine gentry) and scenery for the plays the characters 
put on," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stages on the patio, on the green and in the shady, stone-tiered amphitheater 
will again present a varied roster of performers. Vermont-based singer Bill 
Shontz, best known as half of the popular Rosenshontz duo, is new this year, as 
is singer-author-illustrator Barney Saltzberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Witty musical wordsmith and prolific songwriter Crow ("Milo and Otis") is back 
and so are master storyteller Paul Tracey, Japanese dance troupe Fujima Kansuma 
Kai, the Magical Moonshine Theatre puppets and ex-comedy duo Schwartz & Chung, 
zany mimes and sketch artists who will team up again for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting upon TAFFY's evolution, Wood said the most noticeable change has 
been the shifting popularity of children's music and children's theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started the festival," Wood said, "there was still a yearly Southern 
California Educational Theatre Assn. festival featuring college and 
professional groups. It was kind of a fun concept but it died out." 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of children's theater seemed to "level out" with the recent 
rise of the children's music business, Wood noted. Lately, however, he has seen 
a keener interest in theater and storytelling among young audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 His own troupe "used to do theater pieces and then we'd do a song and 
everybody would stop and look. Now we do a theater piece and it gets the most 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 A 10th TAFFY looked iffy until July. Wood is grateful for the support the 
festival receives from such companies as Mervyn's and Target, and the National 
Park Service waives some expenses in return for the Woods' producing free 
concerts and other events in the park, but more than half of the $65,000 cost 
must "walk through the door." 
</P>
<P>
 From the artists' standpoint, TAFFY continues to be an unusually friendly 
performance venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always make TAFFY part of my schedule," said Dan Crow, who performs 
nationally more than 250 times a year. "It's exhilarating. I've had kids come 
out who are now in high school . . . and they always want to talk to you about 
the fun they had at TAFFY when they were (little)." 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is as much for the artists as it is for the children," said Carl 
Weintraub, a TV actor best known as Sharon Gless' boyfriend in "Cagney & 
Lacey," and the longtime artistic director of We Tell Stories. "I can't imagine 
a year without a TAFFY festival. I just can't imagine it." 
</P>

 NBC had the two highest-rated rookie programs last week, but ABC had the most 
to crow about when the weekly prime-time figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co. came 
out Tuesday: For the first time since 1978, it has won the first two weeks of 
the season.  
</P>
<P>
 Three-time defending champion CBS, meanwhile, is running third--the only one 
of the four networks to have registered a decline in audience. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC had the top-rated show of the week in "Home Improvement" and placed three 
others in the Top 10: "Grace Under Fire," "Roseanne" and "Monday Night 
Football" (Denver Broncos at Buffalo Bills). Its new sitcom "Me and the Boys" 
tied for 14th among the week's 95 prime-time network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, whose ratings are up 13% so far this season, had three new series in the 
Top 20: the medical drama "ER" with Anthony Edwards at No. 6, "Madman of the 
People" at No. 10 and "Friends" at No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers near the bottom of the chart included ABC's "McKenna," "On Our Own," 
"Blue Skies" (in its regular time slot) and "My So-Called Life"; NBC's 
"Something Wilder" and Fox's "New York Undercover," "Fortune Hunter," 
"M.A.N.T.I.S." and "Party of Five." Southland Ratings

DEFENSE BELIEVES CASE IN LAGUNA FIRE WILL FALL; ARSON: IT WON'T SEND 
INVESTIGATORS TO MEXICO TO VERIFY REPORTS THAT SUSPECT WAS IN PRISON THERE AT 
TIME OF BLAZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Confident that charges accusing Jose Soto Martinez of setting the Laguna Beach 
fire will not stand up in court, the Orange County public defender's office 
said Tuesday that it wouldn't bother sending its own investigators to a Mexican 
prison where Martinez was reportedly held at the time of the 1993 firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined to discuss the case in any detail, saying only that it 
was still under investigation. But court-appointed defense attorneys 
representing the man accused of setting the most destructive fire in the 
county's history said they are certain that the arson charge against their 
client cannot be proved because he has an ironclad alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Mexican prison officials backed the contention of Martinez's family 
that he was 1,200 miles away in a Mazatlan prison when the fires occurred last 
October, officials from the district attorney's office have slowly backed off 
pronouncements that he set the fire that damaged or destroyed 441 homes and 
caused $528 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi called a news conference to 
announce that Martinez "willfully and maliciously" set the blaze. But by 
Monday, Capizzi's chief assistant, Maurice Evans, said that in light of the new 
information, "perhaps Mr. Martinez did not set the fire and was in prison in 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 With the possibility that prosecutors may have to drop the most serious of 
four arson charges against Martinez -- the other three were for small fires in 
Fullerton -- new questions have surfaced about the entire case against 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written response to a query from The Times, Capizzi stated that the case 
had been fully investigated by his office for two weeks, that all prosecution 
guidelines were properly followed, and that he was satisfied with the way all 
law enforcement agencies had handled the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 But others were critical of the filing. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Deputy Public Defender Jim Egar said that even after Martinez was 
granted a court-appointed attorney, law enforcement officers videotaped seven 
sessions at which Martinez was quizzed about his knowledge of arson incidents 
without his attorney present -- despite requests to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers "recklessly and extensively" interrogated Martinez, Egar said, and 
violated his constitutional rights to have an attorney present and not to make 
incriminating statements against himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that a public defender was appointed for Martinez only for 
the Fullerton fires, and that the subsequent interviews concerned only the 
Laguna fire, before a court-appointed attorney was chosen for that case. 
</P>
<P>
 But court documents show that his court-appointed attorneys formally put the 
district attorney's office on notice more than two weeks ago in the Fullerton 
case that Martinez was invoking his right to have his attorney present whenever 
he was questioned, and to remain silent "as to this case and any other matter 
whether or not a complaint has been filed therein. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said Tuesday that he thinks the district 
attorney's office may have rushed filing the arson charge against Martinez, 
without making an effort to contact the suspect's family for information that 
might exonerate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're being cautious now, whereas before they didn't exercise a 
great deal of caution," Butler said. "I guess they are trying to figure out how 
to deal with this in the media." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler also criticized the district attorney for interviewing Martinez on the 
Laguna fire even after a public defender had been appointed to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's assume that he was not in the prison in Mexico; it looks like there are 
some very serious questions of admissibility of any confession or 
investigation," Butler said. "It smells like they have serious legal problems. 
. . . If (Martinez's) statements are ruled invalid, then their case goes away 
on that as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Fullerton Police Chief Patrick McKinley, who is still convinced that 
Martinez is the man who set the Laguna fire, said that if defense attorneys 
"can show or put doubt in the jury's mind, it could be a problem. We have to 
take care of that issue one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley defended both his own department's handling of the case and that of 
the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our detectives did everything right and (the district attorney) did 
everything right," McKinley said. "We both did everything to assure that things 
were done appropriately and I'm very proud of what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police officers arrested Martinez Sept. 16, the day that three fires 
were set in and near an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his mother tried to file a missing persons report with Fullerton 
police about her son's disappearance Sept. 17, and finally succeeded two days 
later, police say they never made the connection between the man they had in 
custody and the man reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is an adult," McKinley said. "He's 26 years old. He tells us nothing 
that would indicate he's got a family. He's got all the freedom in the world to 
use the telephone. We certainly didn't deprive him." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Runnestrand, chief investigator for the Orange County Fire Department, 
said Martinez convinced him that he set the Laguna fires, the Fullerton fires 
and the Aug. 5 Green River brush fire in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, this wasn't a leap of judgment on our part or a leap of us 
wanting him to admit to these fires so badly that we overlooked inconsistencies 
or misinformation," Runnestrand said. "I was very skeptical from the start, but 
the fact that he could have guessed where these fires were started is highly 
unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Frank Ospino, who is representing Martinez, said he is 
confident his client will be exonerated of the Laguna Beach arson charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ospino said, "I haven't gotten any indication directly from the D.A., but 
we're hopeful that the charges are going be dropped," adding that the action 
could come as early as this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one of his colleagues in the South County public defender's office 
announced Monday that the office was sending investigators to gather the same 
information that district attorney investigators had already collected from the 
prison, Ospino said there had been a change of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that there is enough (information) right now that we don't need to 
duplicate" what the district attorney has already done, Ospino added. 
</P>
<P>
 A pretrial hearing on the Martinez case is scheduled for this morning at 8:30 
in Division 4 at Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ospino said he still hasn't received police reports from the district 
attorney's office regarding the Laguna Beach arson investigation, and could not 
comment on why prosecutors felt they had enough evidence to file charges 
against Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martinez's family is anxiously awaiting word on what will happen to 
the young man, whose legal name is Jaime Saille Higuera. 
</P>
<P>
 Malzquias Campos, Martinez's stepfather, said prosecutors "are not going to 
give us any more information. We are left on the outside." Campos said law 
enforcement officials "are determined to prove" that his stepson started the 
Laguna fire. "We are sad, tired, because of everything that has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Soria Ayusa, the consul for the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana, said 
his government is working to get the Laguna Beach arson charge against Martinez 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is very clear," he said. "We are approaching (Martinez's) family 
to give them legal protection and get the documents they need to prove that 
their son was in jail and prove that he is innocent of these charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal professionals, however, said they couldn't fault the district 
attorney for being zealous in an arson prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the worst crimes in the world. A fire has no conscience. It's not 
like a gun that can be pointed. Fires can go anywhere," said a Los Angeles 
County deputy district attorney who helped establish statewide charging 
standards for the California District Attorney Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said this week that it's easy for anyone 
to criticize prosecutors for deciding to charge Martinez, now that the alibi is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 "We very seldom have somebody come forward with an alibi in advance of the 
charges," Wade said. "Many times we don't find out until the trial. 
Anticipating an alibi is almost impossible. We all now have the benefit of 
20/20 hindsight that . . . this fellow may have an alibi."

O.C. JUDGE WILL GIVE TMI ASSETS A NEW MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost all the real estate assets of a $1-billion Newport Beach investment 
fund for teachers will be removed today from the control of its current 
managers, an Orange County Superior Court judge signaled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Francisco F. Firmat said he will appoint a manager to oversee about 90% 
of the operating real estate partnerships sold to investors by Teachers 
Management & Investment Corp., which was sued in August by four investors who 
alleged that the firm had fraudulently lost $100 million, most of it in 
teachers' retirement funds. The decision was immediately hailed by the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has cited evidence of conflict of interest and improper moving of 
funds by the investment company. Maurice B. Shuman and James R. Martin, who 
bought the company in 1987, have denied those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Martin nor Shuman would comment Tuesday. Their lawyer, David Grant, 
called Firmat's proposal "a fair resolution for the investors. . . . We don't 
agree with the complaints, but we're willing to do what's best for investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Firmat said Tuesday that "an interim management agreement" is nearly completed 
"that I think will resolve the concerns of both sides and preserve the assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, worked out by lawyers on both sides, the judge intends to 
appoint Dennis B. Schmucker, a veteran property trouble-shooter, as interim 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 While Shuman and Martin would keep control of TMI itself and three limited 
partnerships, Schmucker would manage and examine 30 remaining limited 
partnerships, according to the proposal, which was accepted by lawyers for both 
sides. He would make a recommendation to the court next month on whether the 
company's partnerships should be restructured, reorganized or sold. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI has raised about $1 billion from 60,000 California educators since 1968. 
Shuman and Martin have maintained that losses on the partnerships have resulted 
from California's depressed real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Seibert of Anaheim, one of those who filed the suit against TMI, was in 
the courtroom Tuesday and said afterward that she is generally pleased with the 
plan. "If they are going to recover anything," she said of court officials, 
"this is the way to do it. I feel a whole lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Another investor, Steve Gorelick of Northridge, said he too is pleased 
"because an outside person will have more insight." He and his wife, Betty, a 
teacher, have all their retirement funds invested with TMI, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Martin and Shuman would keep control of three partnerships: 
Columbia Square Ltd., which owns 154 acres of land in Santa Barbara County; the 
Parducci Winery, which owns a winery in Mendocino County; and Napa Airport 
Center, which owns 138 acres of land near the city of Napa. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schmucker, who has been the receiver for several high-profile bankruptcy 
reorganization cases in the past 10 years, including Pioneer Mortgage in San 
Diego and American Home Mortgage in Newport Beach, would have veto power, said 
Ron Rus, attorney for the investors who filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investors are delighted. Maybe what they will hear won't be good news, 
but at least they will get the truth," Rus said. 
</P>
<P>
 As manager for most of TMI's partnerships, Schmucker will have his work cut 
out for him, said real estate expert Sanford Goodkin, who runs a consulting 
company in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing to do is find out what the truth is. Schmucker's got to 
create a foundation where you can rebuild TMI or collapse the company. And 
hopefully it can be rebuilt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI, which hired teachers to help sell its real estate partnerships to other 
teachers, is insolvent, according to the suit, which sought immediate 
appointment of a receiver to take over the management of the company and its 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that TMI commingled funds from several partnerships into a 
general account in violation of partnership agreements to "conceal the true 
financial condition of the most distressed of the TMI partnerships and . . . 
perpetuate a false sense of TMI prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
 Filed Aug. 23, the suit also alleges a pattern of "self-dealing" that involved 
the "unauthorized siphoning of millions of dollars in partnership funds to 
affiliated entities" formed by TMI's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Judge Firmat stopped short of appointing a receiver to take over the 
company, he said during a court session Monday that he saw evidence "of 
commingling of funds and conflict of interest." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators who invested in TMI partnership bought stakes in both undeveloped 
land and commercial properties. As the partnerships have dropped in value, 
investors have questioned whether they should continue paying the quarterly 
maintenance fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Firmat advised them Tuesday to continue making payments, which range from $75 
to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Investor Merrill Durfell said that advice eased his mind. "Now, at least, I 
know what to do," he said.

TOP-LEVEL FOE OF ARISTIDE FLEES; HAITI: CAPITAL'S POLICE CHIEF, TARGETED FOR 
REMOVAL BY U.S., IS ADMITTED INTO DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. LEADER OF A VIOLENT 
MILITIA PLEDGES ALLEGIANCE TO EXILED PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, one of three Haitian military officers 
targeted for removal by the United States for their role in overthrowing 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, fled the country Tuesday for the Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation from the army and departure of a man described variously as a 
"killer," "thug" and "stooge" by U.S. officials, signaled an important move 
forward in the effort to restore Aristide and force Haiti's military 
dictatorship out of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.N. resolutions and American policy, Francois, Army Commander in Chief 
Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Chief of Staff Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby must resign 
by Oct. 15 to avoid arrest and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one out of three; only two left," Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman 
of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a news conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also engineered a second apparent victory Tuesday when 
Emmanuel (Toto) Constant, head of a violent paramilitary group and another 
proclaimed enemy, suddenly dropped his anti-Aristide, anti-U.S. stance and 
pledged nonviolence, friendship to Washington and allegiance to Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials conceded -- sometimes almost bragged -- that they had arranged 
Constant's new attitude by threatening the leader of the Front for the 
Advancement and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH), a military-sponsored death squad and 
political party, with severe retribution if he failed to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The exiled Aristide on Tuesday urged Cedras and Biamby to follow Francois' 
lead and leave Haiti -- the sooner the better. "In 11 days, I will be back in 
Haiti," Aristide said in an address to the U.N. General Assembly in New York. 
"Eleven days hence I will invite you to celebrate this festival of 
reconciliation and democracy and of peace back home in Haiti." If the two 
remaining military men leave earlier than Oct. 15, Aristide said, he will 
return earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois' flight Tuesday removed from the scene one of the most violent and 
corrupt officials in what has been one of the most violent and corrupt regimes 
ever to rule Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered the most powerful man in the country, the Port-au-Prince 
police chief headed for the border in the dead of night to escape embittered 
and frustrated followers who charged that he had betrayed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois submitted his resignation from the army during the day Monday and 
left his home about 9 p.m. for the Dominican border crossing an hour's drive 
away at Mal Pas, where the Dominicans blocked his entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Close friends said the escape was moved up from Tuesday because soldiers under 
his command "were going to press him to react to what happened at FRAPH 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 In a confrontation Monday between American troops and seven Haitian police 
officers who appeared to try to interfere with a U.S. raid on FRAPH offices, 
the Americans disarmed and arrested the police -- and publicly humiliated them 
by handcuffing them and wrapping the mouths of at least three with heavy tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (officers) expected Michel to react, to do something," said one 
associate. "If they knew that he was leaving it would have been bad, very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Francois was accompanied by, among others, his brother Evans Francois, who is 
his closest adviser and a former Haitian diplomat living in Santo Domingo, the 
Dominican capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 37-year-old police chief was forced to wait more than 12 hours at Mal 
Pas when Dominican border guards refused him entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Haitian diplomats acknowledged that Francois was held at the border 
because Dominican authorities had received no go-ahead from U.S. officials to 
let him pass. American officials later said the detention was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until about 11 a.m. Tuesday that Francois and his three-car convoy 
bearing Dominican diplomatic license plates were permitted through the 
12-foot-high iron gate and allowed to make the five-hour drive to Santo 
Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Port-au-Prince, Constant's reversal of position had been preceded by 
peculiar developments. Constant had been constant in his pledge to resist 
Aristide's safe return despite the 20,000 U.S. troops here to guarantee the 
president's security. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't his position Tuesday afternoon, when he told a news conference 
arranged by the U.S. Embassy that he now accepts the U.S. soldiers and 
virtually pledged his allegiance to the exiled Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on a podium hastily constructed by the Americans at the base of a 
statue honoring Toussaint L'Ouverture, the hero of Haitian independence, the 
spindly former Cedras aide told hundreds of massed reporters: "The only 
solution for Haiti today is the reality of the return of Aristide. . . . 
Violence no longer has a place in the country. Put down your stones, put down 
your tires, no more violence, no more burning, no more beating. Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 With American diplomats circling the scene, Constant said that FRAPH is fully 
cooperating with the U.S. forces all over the country. "I'm asking everybody to 
lay down their weapons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he read his statement with U.S. soldiers guarding the area, the hundreds of 
Haitians gathered nearby hooted and shouted: "You assassin, murderer. . . . You 
should be handcuffed and tried for the murders of thousands. Go away, go away." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if Constant, who has been accused privately by U.S. officials of 
using cocaine and other drugs, had been threatened with arrest on narcotics 
charges, an official smiled broadly and then said with a nod and a wink, "I 
didn't say that; you did." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the lever, the connection between Constant's shift and the U.S. 
Embassy was made evident by embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager's announcement 
that Constant would be holding the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Shrager wrote Constant's opening remarks in his embassy office 
between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday no rationale was given, even privately, for arranging a deal with 
Constant. "The decision was made by Gen. Shelton," Shrager said, speaking of 
Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of U.S. forces here. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrager did indicate that Constant is not home free. 
</P>
<P>
 FRAPH was founded in August, 1993, and is best known here for killing and 
beating rampages against civilians on behalf of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 With Constant subdued and Francois in Santo Domingo, the American focus now 
shifts to Cedras and Biamby, who have agreed to resign and permit Aristide's 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras has said he will leave the army he has used to tyrannize Haiti since 
the Sept. 30, 1991, coup, but not the country. Biamby has said nothing 
publicly, but associates say the moody general will stay until the Oct. 15 
deadline and also refuse to accept exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, U.S. diplomats here and officials in Washington say they believe 
Cedras will give up his commission and fly to Spain, probably Oct. 12, the day 
his appointment as commander in chief expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois left Haiti angry and embittered, according to a close business 
associate, charging that Cedras had sold out the country, the army and Francois 
personally by accepting the presence of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, Francois, whom most experts consider the real 1991 coup leader 
and the strongest opponent of Aristide, broke with Cedras and Biamby in 
February when he decided that Haitian resistance to Aristide's return would 
lead to disaster, his friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he was urged by his brother Evans to revolt against the two generals 
last May, when an American invasion became a distinct possibility, one 
associate said. "But he couldn't do it. He just couldn't move against his 
superior officers."

STUDY FINDS CAFFEINE HAS QUALITIES OF ADDICTIVE DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The caffeine in coffee, tea and cola can produce addiction similar to that 
engendered by alcohol, tobacco, heroin and cocaine, researchers from Johns 
Hopkins University report today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although abruptly halting the intake of caffeine has long been known to 
trigger withdrawal symptoms that include headaches, lethargy and depression, 
the new report in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. suggests that the 
drug produces the full range of characteristics associated with classical 
psychoactive dependence. 
</P>
<P>
 Those characteristics include persistent, unsuccessful efforts to reduce 
consumption, continued use despite medical side effects, tolerance -- or the 
need for ever-higher doses to achieve the same psychological effect -- and 
withdrawal symptoms when use is stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Some evidence suggests that the prevalence of dependence on caffeine is about 
the same as for alcohol -- about 14% of users -- according to an editorial by 
Dr. Richard M. Glass of the association's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers undertook the study "because there are some people who have 
problems with caffeine use and are distressed by it," said Dr. Eric C. Strain, 
the Johns Hopkins psychiatrist who co-authored the study. "It is helpful 
because it shows us that caffeine is a drug like other drugs and in terms of 
understanding the whole addiction process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although caffeine can cause symptoms such as sleeplessness and anxiety, he 
noted that it has far fewer ill effects than other addictive drugs such as 
nicotine, alcohol, heroin and cocaine, so that the significance of addiction to 
it is not yet clear. "This doesn't mean that people have to stop drinking 
coffee," Strain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the results led Dr. John R. Hughes of the University of Vermont 
to suggest that "perhaps we should start labeling coffee to indicate its 
addictive potential. That's something I'd like to know as a consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release distributed by the International Food Information Council, 
a trade group, Dr. Peter Dews of Harvard Medical School said, "This study . . . 
adds nothing of relevance to normal people consuming caffeine. The majority of 
these people (in the study) had a history of serious substance abuse or had 
mood disorders such as major depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Strain conceded that 11 of the 27 participants in the study had previously 
suffered from substance abuse or mood disorders, but had been in remission for 
four to eight years before the onset of the study. "They did not have active 
disorders," he said, and the fact that they had previously had such disorders 
was not relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 80% of adult Americans consume caffeine regularly, with an average daily 
dose of about 280 milligrams. (A 5-ounce cup of coffee or tea contains about 
100 milligrams of caffeine, while a 12-ounce cola contains about 60. Chocolate 
drinks and chocolate candy also contain caffeine, but much less.) 
</P>
<P>
 Strain and his colleagues ran newspaper advertisements soliciting people who 
thought they were dependent on caffeine. Telephone interviews of 99 respondents 
identified 27, ranging in age from 21 to 48, who were willing to visit the 
laboratory twice, undergo standardized medical and psychiatric interviews and 
keep a detailed food diary for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Examining the 27 subjects, the team found that 94% displayed withdrawal 
symptoms when abstinent from caffeine and 94% continued caffeine use despite 
medical counterindications. Some 81% had made unsuccessful efforts to cut down 
on caffeine use, while 75% needed increasing amounts. Overall, 16 of the 27 
showed all four categories that define classic dependence. 
</P>
<P>
 To further explore withdrawal symptoms, 11 of the 16 who were 
caffeine-dependent (five coffee drinkers, five cola drinkers and one tea 
drinker) volunteered to undergo two two-day periods in which they consumed a 
caffeine-free diet. During one two-day period, they were given their normal 
dose of caffeine in pill form and in the other they were given a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the 11 displayed dramatic withdrawal symptoms when they received no 
caffeine, including impairment in their normal functioning. One of the subjects 
on placebo sat in her office at work with the lights off and her head down, one 
man made multiple costly mistakes, and another missed work entirely. One woman 
canceled her son's birthday party and called her spouse home early because of 
her inability to care for the children, while another stopped shopping, 
performing household chores and even such mundane tasks as preparing her 
child's lunch. Five took aspirin or acetaminophen even though the researchers 
had asked them not to. 
</P>
<P>
 These withdrawal-related behaviors stopped when the subjects resumed caffeine 
consumption, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Hopkins team had performed a previous study examining caffeine 
withdrawal, they were surprised by the severity of the symptoms displayed by 
this group, Strain said. Much more needs to be learned, he concluded, including 
the prevalence of the dependence and whether it is associated with other 
problems, such as mood disorders and abuse of other substances. It's 
conceivable, he said, that some biological mechanism could predispose 
individuals both to caffeine dependency and other forms of substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 George Boecklin, president of the National Coffee Assn., charged that the 
study group was too small to draw such sweeping conclusions. "It is 
inappropriate to over-generalize the results of this . . . study, since 
caffeine as normally consumed poses no health risk to the average consumer and 
cannot be described as a substance of dependence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term significance of the study is still undetermined, experts agreed. 
"If it is true," said Vermont's Hughes, "this is clearly something people need 
to be educated about. . . . But if you can't show that it causes harm, what's 
the clinical significance?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fertile ground for further research," Strain said. Caffeine High 
(Southland Edition, A20) 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have found that the caffeine in 
coffee, tea and colas can produce a dependence syndrome similar to that caused 
by alcohol, nicotine, heroin and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 SYMPTOMS OF ADDICTION 
</P>
<P>
 * Withdrawal: Headaches, lethargy and depression when use is suddenly stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wanting to cut back: But inability to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contining to use: Despite problems such as anxiety, sleeplessness and 
gastrointestinal disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tolerance: Need for ever-higher doses. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM COFFEE USE CAN: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase blood cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Protect against colon and rectal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase the risk of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Magnify the effects of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make you feel better and more alert in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase sexual activity in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 JUST HOW ADDICTIVE? 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown. Some very preliminary results suggest 3% of users have severe 
dependence and 14% have moderate dependence. In contrast, 14% of alcohol users 
develop dependence and 90% of smokers do. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT TO DO 
</P>
<P>
 There is no need to give up coffee, researchers say. If you do give up 
caffeine, however, taper off slowly.

MISTRIAL RULED IN POLICE SLAYING OF TOW TRUCK DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge declared a mistrial Tuesday in the controversial 1992 case 
of a police officer who killed the unarmed driver of an unregistered tow truck, 
saying that jurors could not agree on whether to convict the officer of 
second-degree murder or a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles Horan said the jury had deliberated for two days 
before reaching a 9-3 deadlock, with the majority in favor of convicting Los 
Angeles Police Officer Douglas J. Iversen, 45, who is white, of involuntary 
manslaughter in the shooting death of John L. Daniels, a 36-year-old who was 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Iversen said he was trying to impound Daniels' truck, which 
lacked a Department of Motor Vehicles registration, and was forced to shoot 
Daniels out of fear that the driver was about to run over a group of 
pedestrians as he pulled out of a Chevron station at Florence Avenue and 
Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But witnesses said there was no such danger, and the truck was traveling less 
than 5 m.p.h. One witness reported that soon after the incident, Iversen's 
partner, Patrick Bradshaw, turned to him and asked: "What did you do that for?" 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying, which came on the heels of the 1992 riots, sparked headlines at 
the time because it took place less than two miles from a flash point of the 
civil disturbances and provoked a tense standoff between police in 
South-Central Los Angeles and a crowd of about 200 angry people. 
</P>
<P>
 The case also became one of the first important tests of the Administration of 
newly appointed Police Chief Willie L. Williams, as Iversen became only the 
second law enforcement officer in the county in more than a decade to be 
charged with murdering someone while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti later said the shooting was not racially motivated. 
Prosecutors told the jury that Iversen was on an obsessive personal crusade 
against unlicensed tow truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Iversen's attorney, John D. Barnett, called former Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner to the stand, eliciting testimony that shortly before the 
shooting Reiner had called for stricter enforcement of tow truck laws. At the 
time, Reiner said, "bandit" tow truck drivers, whose businesses are not among 
the city's sanctioned network of official police garages, were a public safety 
concern because they were notorious for recklessly rushing to accidents in 
their race to get business, and one driver's carelessness had recently resulted 
in the death of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Katherine Mader argued that the July 1, 1992, shooting 
was "out of line," contending that Iversen had a fetish about tow truck drivers 
and lost his temper when Daniels dismissed his orders to stop and began driving 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 One police official testified that it is against LAPD policy for an officer to 
fire at a moving vehicle. The official added that Iversen and his partner had 
stopped to check the registration on Daniels' truck even though they had just 
received an emergency call to respond to a felony in progress -- an auto theft 
that witnesses were watching from a telephone booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mader said the two officers had gotten the higher priority call and said they 
were on their way, "but instead decided to go to impound this particular tow 
truck," a clear violation of department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors theorized that Iversen had developed an obsession about Daniels' 
tow truck that dated to an earlier incident in which the vehicle had been 
impounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks before the shooting, Mader said, Iversen and his partner had chased 
a truck owned by Daniels' family that reportedly had been involved in a street 
robbery in which Daniels was not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck had no registration and was impounded, but was mistakenly released. 
Mader told the jury that when Iversen saw the truck at the service station, his 
intent was to get the truck back. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Iversen tried to pull Daniels out of the truck, and then shot 
him when he began to slowly pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what factors lay behind the standoff between the members of the 
jury, which was permitted by law to reach one of three verdicts: second-degree 
murder, involuntary manslaughter or not guilty. Nor was it clear whether race 
had anything to do with the disagreement among panel members. Three jurors were 
black, eight were white and one was Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Barnett said his polling of the jury indicated that the votes 
were "all over the place." Initially, he said he was told, five jurors had 
favored acquittal, but voted for involuntary manslaughter in hopes of reaching 
a compromise with three others who were convinced that Iversen was guilty of 
second-degree murder because he had drawn his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors, who began deliberations Friday, informed the judge Tuesday morning 
that they were unable to reach a verdict. Horan asked the jurors to deliberate 
further. Shortly after lunch, the jury buzzed Horan again and informed him they 
remained hopelessly split, 9 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
 After declaring a mistrial, Horan scheduled a hearing for Oct. 24. Lawyers on 
both sides and members of the victim's family said they were prepared to retry 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mader questioned why the judge declared the mistrial so 
quickly -- after just two days of deliberations. "I would have preferred that 
they continue to deliberate and try to reach a decision," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not justice," said Michelle Daniels, the tow truck driver's widow. 
"This man executed my husband. The whole thing should be done over." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mader said: "The jurors were very clear. All 12 believed that this 
was an unlawful killing. In that sense it's not all over the map. The only 
confusion was as to what degree it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Iversen, who remains free on bail, had a terse "no comment" as he left the 
Downtown Criminal Courts Building.

U.S. TO LIFT BAN ON SATELLITE TECH SALES TO CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration agreed Tuesday to lift year-old sanctions 
restricting the sale of U.S. satellite technology to China after obtaining a 
renewed, more explicit commitment from Beijing to stop exporting dangerous 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, announced at the end of a visit to Washington by Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, clears the way for U.S. companies, including 
Hughes Aircraft Co., to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in satellites and 
related technology to China. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is carried out, the agreement will also settle what has been, over the 
past six years, one of the most contentious issues between Washington and 
Beijing: China's efforts to export to Middle Eastern countries its advanced, 
solid-fuel M-9 and M-11 missiles, which are more accurate and more mobile than 
the Scuds used by Iraq in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials were exultant. "This is a global and 
verifiable ban (on export of M-11 missiles)," said one senior Administration 
official. Administration officials pointed out that the prohibition China 
signed for the M-11 missiles goes beyond the requirements of the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCR) -- the international accord that severely 
restricts the export of missiles but permits some limited exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, however, the new agreement also represents a retreat from 
the position the Clinton Administration took a year ago. Senior U.S. officials 
said then they would not lift the sanctions on satellite exports to China until 
Beijing agreed to adhere to the MTCR -- including all its rules, updates and 
revisions, which cover a wide variety of technology beyond the M-11 missile 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the end, the Administration, which recently won Russia's agreement to 
adhere to the missile accord, failed to win a similar pledge from China on the 
broader treaty. Instead, the two nations agreed Tuesday to hold "in-depth 
discussions" on having China adhere to the overall missile accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lifting of the sanctions is a welcome development," Hughes Aircraft Co. 
Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said in a written statement Tuesday night. "It 
will enable Hughes and American industry to do more business with China. This 
is a positive step as we revise our export policies to enhance trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials contended that the new agreement was not motivated by 
a desire to help U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an economic decision," said one senior Administration official. 
"This is a non-proliferation decision." 
</P>
<P>
 America's efforts to stop the sale of Chinese M-9 and M-11 missiles dates to 
1988, when it was reported that Beijing had concluded deals to sell the systems 
to Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci won some vague assurances from China 
about limiting sales of the missiles on a trip to Beijing in 1988, and in 
return agreed to clear the way for the sale of American satellite technology to 
China. In 1989, then-National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft won new promises 
not to sell missiles in the Middle East. But China's efforts to export 
apparently continued and it began moving to sell M-11 missiles to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, the George Bush Administration finally won what it felt was 
a solid commitment by China to abide by the MTCR and to refrain from selling 
the missiles to Pakistan. This pledge, hastily worked out at the end of a testy 
visit to Beijing by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, took the form of an 
oral pledge and a subsequent letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTCR applies only to missiles with a range of 300 kilometers (about 180 
miles) and a payload, or weight, of 500 kilograms (1100 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials subsequently discovered that, despite its assurances to the 
Bush Administration, China was selling components of the M-11 missiles to 
Pakistan. Chinese officials maintained that this missile was not covered by the 
MTCR, because its range and payload were below the requirements of the accord. 
U.S. officials insisted the missile had greater capabilities than China 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord that Secretary of State Warren Christopher signed with Qian on 
Tuesday contains new language apparently closing this loophole. Any missile is 
covered so long as it has enough energy to travel the required 180-mile 
distance or deliver the 1,100-pound payload, even if China claimed it had been 
advertised or tested at lower standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials also said China's new promise was better than the 
ones obtained by previous Administrations because it took the form of a signed, 
written agreement rather than an oral pledge or letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Qian agreed. Asked at a news conference how China's new promise differs from 
earlier ones, Qian replied: "This is the first time China and the United States 
have recorded and issued a written understanding. . . . This is a new form (of 
agreement)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration had imposed the satellite sanctions on China in 
August, 1993. At the time, U.S. officials estimated that they would block the 
sale of about $400 million to $500 million a year in American exports to China 
over the two-year period of the sanctions. The sanctions blocked the pending 
sale of at least seven satellites to China, including two by Los Angeles-based 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sanctions outraged some executives of U.S. high-tech industries, 
including Armstrong, who said in one speech: "It escapes me what effect our 
laying off 4,000 to 5,000 more people in California and shifting the export 
business to Europe has on the Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, the Administration eased the impact of the sanctions by deciding 
that some satellites could be sold to China if they do not include sensitive 
military technology. The two Hughes systems were then approved for sale, along 
with several other items of satellite technology. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials said the new agreement opens the way again for 
American companies to sell new systems to China by reapplying to the State 
Department for permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials also announced that China had agreed to some 
new discussions and exchanges with the United States in the field of human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials agreed to broader exchanges of lawyers and other legal 
personnel, Administration officials said. China also agreed to resume talks 
that were suspended earlier this year on its jamming of Voice of America 
broadcasts and on permitting the International Committee of the Red Cross to 
gain access to Chinese prisons.

FOR TOP U.S. COP IN HAITI, IT'S A MATTER OF TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly arrived at police 
headquarters here Tuesday morning, aides said he expected to meet the Haitian 
capital's dreaded police chief, Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois. 
</P>
<P>
 His mission: to launch the first joint U.S.-Haitian police patrols with 
Kelly's new, yellow-capped force of multinational police monitors, thus laying 
the cornerstone of a future democratic police force and ultimately of America's 
military withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Kelly went upstairs, Francois was fleeing the country, crossing at that 
very moment into the neighboring Dominican Republic. And Francois' replacement, 
a Haitian police major, appeared in no mood for callers. He rejected the joint 
patrols, denouncing the U.S. military's detention of seven Haitian officers the 
previous day and expressing strong concern for his men's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the meeting room, police headquarters was seething with anger. As the 
negotiations dragged on, Haitian police officers of all ranks muttered about 
wounded pride, hated Americans and civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an inauspicious beginning to the international task of rebuilding, 
re-educating and redeploying a police force in a nation that has had the worst 
record of police-sponsored terrorism and human rights abuses in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelly, a tough former U.S. Marine colonel and skillful politician, 
negotiated hard with the acting Haitian chief. He apologized for the 
policemen's arrest, which American military sources variously called a 
"mistake" and a "misunderstanding" on the part of the U.S. forces that detained 
them during Monday's spectacular raid on the headquarters of a violent Haitian 
paramilitary group. And Kelly gave his personal guarantee that the Haitian 
police will be respected and protected in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 After 3 1/2 hours, the major relented, on one condition: Kelly had to 
accompany a Haitian lieutenant on the first such patrol -- on foot, through a 
tough, 10-block neighborhood of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kelly did, touring a district teeming with poverty, filth and potential 
looters side by side with a Haitian officer for nearly half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 So began the monolithic, multimillion-dollar, U.S.-funded challenge of 
checkmating, then selectively destroying and re-creating a police force in a 
nation where many of the law enforcers have for years been the lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet that challenge, Kelly's International Police Monitors, along with a 
separate but parallel U.N. observer-trainer force of police and soldiers from 
Caribbean nations, must keep Haiti's police intact long enough to prevent a 
law-enforcement vacuum. Yet the monitors must simultaneously disarm and 
decommission corrupt and brutal officers in such a way that the present force 
doesn't crumble from humiliation and demoralization. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kelly fails, the U.S. troops will be the only law in town, forcing the U.S. 
Army, in effect, to become the Haitian police -- a role reminiscent of 
America's previous occupation here and one that U.S. forces commander Lt. Gen. 
Hugh Shelton has ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the Pentagon has begun stepping up efforts to install an 
interim civilian police force so that U.S. troops will not have to do the job 
alone, U.S. officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the 
first units of the interim police force could be in operation in Cap Haitien 
within a few days, and similar units are planned for selected precincts of 
Port-au-Prince as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Adm. Paul David Miller, overall commander of the U.S. operation in Haiti, 
was in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday discussing plans for the start of the new 
interim force and is expected to come up with firm plans later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The civilian force will be overseen by U.S. troops and by the International 
Police Monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tuesday's rough start illustrated, little or no groundwork had been done to 
pave the way for Kelly and the first 54 members of the multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters Tuesday morning, Jan Stromsen, the associate director of 
the joint State and Justice Department program that is sponsoring the monitors, 
said they had yet to select a site for a new police academy that is central to 
the police reconstruction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, which was modeled after a similar U.S.-sponsored program that 
retrained police in El Salvador, Stromsen said the future academy is scheduled 
to open Dec. 15, with a first class of 375 Haitian recruits beginning a 
four-month course in modern criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The first class will not be deployed until April 15 -- with international 
monitors already in place. And Stromsen confirmed that if the plan succeeds, it 
will take a full 18 months to build a Haitian force of 4,000. She also 
confirmed that the government of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, which 
will control the new force, has yet to provide them with guidelines for 
recruitment of new police and recommission of old officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy, according to Stromsen: "You begin to build a new police force as 
you demobilize the current police force." When asked, though, whether she 
expects the current force to cooperate during that process, she said, "I think 
you can anticipate that some will cooperate and some won't." 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment was reflected in the mood at police headquarters during 
Kelly's marathon meeting. "I was very mad when I heard of yesterday's arrests, 
mad enough to kill somebody" said Haitian police Cpl. Yves Joissaint, sitting 
under a tree in the courtyard while Kelly's meeting dragged on upstairs. "We 
don't accept these patrols. The American soldiers are arresting us, humiliating 
us before the people. And we should walk with them in the streets? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll work with them if they are not taking us to be killed by the people, 
because that's what they're doing now." 
</P>
<P>
 As the officer spoke, U.S. soldiers arrived with a badly beaten police agent 
named Eliscane Desir in handcuffs, and turned him over to the Haitian police. 
They had rescued him from a mob that ransacked his house and tried to kill him 
in the street -- emboldened, one of the soldiers said, by the police officers' 
arrests the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were even more hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was me who was arrested yesterday, the war would have started already," 
said Jean Pierre, a 45-year-old policeman in civilian clothes who has spent 12 
years on the force. "For most of us, we would rather have had the invasion than 
this. The massacre would have taken place, and everything would be settling 
down now." 
</P>
<P>
 But there also were officers like Cpl. Pierre Joseph Bernard, who said he was 
relieved the new police had arrived to begin their work. He too was hurt deeply 
by Monday's detention of his colleagues. But he stressed that he has been hurt 
far more by the brutal orders his colleagues have been forced to carry out 
during the past three years under military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, if we Haitian policemen had been doing our job these past three years, 
the Americans and this multinational force would not be here today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't say I'm happy, but it's a fact that officers have given these 
orders to beat people, torture people and kill people." 
</P>

WAYLAID VETO PLANS RESULT IN 9 NEW LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Nine bills that Gov. Pete Wilson intended to veto will become law because the 
governor's staff left the measures on a Capitol copying machine, failing to 
deliver them on time to the offices of the Assembly and Senate, Wilson's office 
acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several measures are technical in nature, but a few bills are significant, 
including one that slaps a tax on the sale of California timber sold overseas 
and uses the proceeds to help pay for the restoration of habitat for endangered 
salmon and steelhead. 
</P>
<P>
 One bill will require the Public Utilities Commission to set minimum rates to 
be charged by the dump truck industry, while another measure will create a 
comprehensive program to regulate large propane storage tanks, a step Wilson 
had said was unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a regrettable mistake," Sean Walsh, Wilson's press secretary, said 
Tuesday. "You have a government of human beings who make human errors. The 
governor's not happy about it, but it's part of being human." 
</P>
<P>
 The error by Wilson's office is apparently unprecedented; no one in the 
Capitol can remember a similar gubernatorial goof. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Constitution gives the governor 30 days to sign or veto all the 
bills that lawmakers send to his desk at the end of each legislative session. 
Any bill not signed or vetoed and returned to the house of the Legislature from 
which it originated becomes law without the governor's signature. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Republican chief executive handled 1,211 bills during 
September, vetoing about a quarter of them. His deadline for acting on the 
bills was Friday at midnight, and the clerks of the Assembly and Senate stayed 
in their offices until then to receive his last-minute messages. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the final rush of actions, a file folder containing the original copies 
of nine bills Wilson thought he had vetoed never reached the clerks. A Wilson 
staffer apparently left it on a copying machine outside the Assembly chambers. 
An Assembly employee found it there Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor announced Friday that he had killed the bills and released copies 
of his veto messages, but the error means that they will become law anyway. The 
fact that none of the nine bills was a major piece of legislation was lucky for 
the governor. All vetoed bills are shipped to the Assembly and Senate in the 
same way, and the ones misplaced could just as easily have been some of the 
most important measures of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The timber bill, by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), imposes a higher 
tax on logs cut in California and shipped overseas. The revenue from the tax -- 
estimated at less than $1 million annually -- will go to offset a tax credit 
for private landowners who restore habitat for the Coho salmon and steelhead 
trout. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in vetoing the bill, questioned the constitutionality of the tax and 
said that in any case, the revenue gains from the tax would "not compensate for 
the detrimental effect such taxation would have on California's business 
climate." 
</P>
<P>
 That miscue may be a minor embarrassment to Wilson's reelection campaign 
because the governor, stung by criticism of tax increases early in his term, 
has been promising not to raise taxes again. 
</P>
<P>
 The propane tank regulation measure stemmed from a 1993 explosion that forced 
the evacuation of the Napa Valley town of Yountville. It will set stricter 
standards on tanks holding 18,000 gallons or more, clarifies who will enforce 
the regulations and levies a fee on owners of the tanks to pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson contended that the bill would make the regulation of the tanks more 
complicated, not less so, and said the fees would generate less than 12% of 
what it would cost to implement the program. The bill was supported by the town 
of Yountville but split the propane industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A third bill that will become law will require the California Public Utilities 
Commission to set minimum rates for dump truck haulers. The PUC opposed the 
bill, which was sponsored by the industry, because the commission is trying to 
inject more market competition into the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, Wilson said, "would tie the hands of the PUC as it attempts to 
design regulations that fit the needs of California's changing trucking 
industry. Codifying these provisions would be contrary to that demand, and 
would make further changes to that rate structure extremely difficult and 
burdensome." 
</P>
<P>
 Another bill -- inspired by a fatal Los Angeles fire -- will require the 
owners of certain apartment buildings to post evacuation instructions in 
foreign languages if 25% of their tenants do not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 While lauding its goal, Wilson said he vetoed the bill because it "is somewhat 
misguided and would result in placing overly onerous responsibilities and costs 
on apartment building owners and operators." 
</P>
<P>
 As word of the error spread through the Capitol on Tuesday, it was met with 
disbelief by aides and legislators, who at first assumed there was some way for 
Wilson to correct it. When the governor's office announced that there was no 
way out, those who pushed the bills that came back from the dead were thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 One legislative staffer compared the mistake to baseball's infamous "Merkle 
Boner," named for a New York Giants player who in 1908 cost his team a World 
Series game by failing to touch second base as his teammate scored the winning 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Matovcik, chief of staff for Sen. Mike Thompson (D-Napa), who authored the 
propane tank bill, said the turn of events represented a form of ironic 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had much of the industry on board, safety officials, the City Council; the 
only people who opposed it were the bureaucrats," Matovcik said. "And it was 
the bureaucrats who ended up bungling it in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Kip Lipper, an aide to Assemblyman Sher, who sponsored three of the bills 
Wilson inadvertently allowed to become law, described the news as a pleasant 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you get lucky," Lipper said. "We'll take those bills any way we can 
get them." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson's reelection opponent, Democrat Kathleen Brown, could 
not resist taking a shot at the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "After four years of excuses for his failures on jobs, education and our 
state's fiscal mess, Pete Wilson's mismanagement has reached a new low," said 
Steve Glazer, a senior adviser to Brown. "This is the government equivalent of 
'my dog ate my homework.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, Wilson's press secretary, said the governor was taking precautions to 
ensure that the same kind of mistake does not happen again.

DISGUISES, SPIES AND FREEWAY PURSUITS TO GET THE PRECIOUS SCRIBBLES.

<P>
 And then there's the one about the two guys who landed in the Disneyland 
hoosegow. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened one February night in 1992, after Alfie Pettit and Duggan 
Wendeborn sneaked into Elizabeth Taylor's private 60th birthday bash there. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit and Wendeborn had crawled under some bushes near It's a Small World and 
covered themselves with leaves, then waited for the park to be cleared of 
visitors. When horns began to blare, announcing the arrival of Taylor and her 
star-studded entourage, Pettit and Wendeborn ventured out to mingle with the 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Pettit made a mistake common to criminals: He talked too much. In this 
case, he walked up to a pretzel wagon and asked the vendor how much they were. 
That was the giveaway. Everybody knew Elizabeth Taylor's guests did not have to 
pay for their pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe it?" Pettit recalled. "They surrounded me, and the next thing 
you know, they put me in this Cadillac and took me to the Disneyland jail and 
booked me. The lengths we go to to get an autograph." 
</P>
<P>
 Another tale from the autograph underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, from the posh hotels of Beverly Hills to trendy nightclubs on the 
Sunset Strip, from the back gates of television studios to sedate Westside 
restaurants, celebrities are being hounded for their signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 A brazen breed of entrepreneur has emerged in Hollywood: the professional 
autograph hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the scribble of a Taylor, Julia Roberts or Marlon Brando can command 
hundreds of dollars on the open market, these pen-in-hand hustlers have become 
an inescapable, and sometimes disturbing, aspect of celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of valuable signed photographs, some autograph hounds have piled 
into cars and chased Tom Cruise and Emilio Estevez around Los Angeles; followed 
Mel Gibson onto the Warner Bros. lot; cornered Jack Nicholson at the golf 
course, and staked out Madonna at her Hollywood Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, (autograph seekers) were very nice and friendly and truly 
collectors," said Pat Kingsley, whose public relations firm represents some of 
Hollywood's biggest stars, including Cruise and Robert Redford. "Now it's a 
business. You see some of the same ones all the time, not with a piece of paper 
and pen, but with books that include six or eight pictures from different 
movies. They get very antagonistic if the celebrities don't accommodate them. 
These are not fans at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The autograph hunters argue that some celebrities are annoyed because they do 
not make any money off the sale of their signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most celebrities feel you're making money off of them and they aren't getting 
part of it," Wendeborn said. "I have a philosophy. I'm providing a service. How 
are people in Michigan and Alaska guaranteed to get the autographs they want?" 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors contend that they should not be criticized for making money off the 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we are out there selling it, so what?" said Joe Kraus, owner of 
Celebrity Galleries in Stockton. "The artist has made money off the public, so 
the public, in some ways, is making money off them too." 
</P>
<P>
 As celebrity has become, arguably, the dominant feature of American culture in 
the 1990s, the public's zeal for owning anything linked to celebrities has 
exploded. O.J. Simpson signs football cards from his jail cell. His attorneys 
sign autographs outside court. A judge who recently lowered alimony payments 
for Barry Bonds then asked the San Francisco Giants outfielder for his 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of celebrity autographs varies depending on who they are and how 
often they sign. Kraus said one of the hardest autographs to get is Taylor's 
because collectors believe that many of her signatures are really done by 
secretaries and mailed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difficult one to obtain is Harrison Ford's. "I've heard that people in 
a movie with him can't get his autograph," Kraus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madonna will sign, but you have to catch her in the right moment," Kraus 
said. "Sometimes she will cuss at you for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the demand for celebrity signatures is high, Kraus and other 
collectors disapprove of the tactics of some autograph hunters. Grabbing 
celebrity autographs, they say, has evolved into a daunting cat-and-mouse game. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most successful autograph hunters are "chasers," who stake out 
stars at hotels, restaurants and nightclubs and then, if the stars refuse to 
sign, chase them by car until they pull over or escape in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even a mysterious group of youths who hang out together and wear 
baseball caps while collecting autographs. Their competitors complain that the 
youths, called the Baseballers, are overly aggressive and rude to celebrities 
who refuse to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Bassett got a taste of this belligerence at this year's Academy Awards 
luncheon. The best actress nominee arrived just before the meal was served, 
leaving no time for autograph hunters. As she walked past a group of them, some 
who were present recalled, Bassett was unmercifully booed and cursed until she 
dissolved into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Even veteran collectors say it has gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too hairy out there, too dangerous," said Jan Schray, 58, of North 
Hollywood, a collector of about 20,000 celebrity autographs. She worries about 
the frequency of car chases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't chase. I don't lurk. I don't follow people home and into their 
houses," she said. "But it's just a matter of time before they kill somebody 
running red lights." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nowhere are the tales of the autograph hunters so tinged with high 
drama and low comedy as in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, they revolve around Pettit, who runs Alfie's Autographs of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit cruises Hollywood in a big black Cadillac, his trunk filled with 
hundreds of celebrity photos arranged alphabetically -- for retrieval at a 
moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 He's 25, and hails from Vancouver, Wash. (His car still sports Washington 
plates, which read SIGN4ME). And he lives a block behind Mann's Chinese Theatre 
in Hollywood in an aging apartment building whose main hallway is decorated 
with old movie posters. His apartment has only a few signed celebrity photos on 
the walls: Cindy Crawford in a golden swimsuit, singer George Michael, and one 
signed "To Alfie. Love, Tina Turner." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most autograph hunters, Pettit has a system of finding celebrities. The 
Hollywood trades tell him which stars are cast in movies and TV shows. For a 
nominal fee, the city provides a list of street closures for filming 
productions. And there is the daily Hollywood News Calendar, listing times and 
locations for celebrity events such as benefits or premieres. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pettit also has his tipsters -- often parking valets at trendy nightspots 
-- whom he pays to alert him when celebrities arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 One night at the House of Blues, Pettit learned of a party for singer Patti 
LaBelle. His tipster was "Robert," a homeless man who hangs out on the sidewalk 
and watches limos pull in. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Pettit tried but failed to get the signature of Wesley Snipes. The 
actor ignored the autograph hunter in a burgundy beret as he popped up in his 
face without warning. "Nope, can't do it," Snipes said. "You got enough of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit is a master of disguise. He can look like a college student fresh off 
an Omaha bus and reappear moments later beside the unsuspecting celebrity 
outfitted like a denizen of Montmartre. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting Julia Roberts to sign a photo during the filming of "I Love 
Trouble," Pettit shaved his goatee, removed his earrings and put on glasses and 
a beret. "I went back and got three more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Pettit's best plans have not panned out, like the night of the 
Taylor party at Disneyland. For his efforts, Pettit said, he was fined and 
suspended from the park for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, a freeway pursuit of "MacGyver" actor Richard Dean Anderson 
ended in failure. Pettit and some friends began chasing Anderson after he left 
the "Tonight Show" studio in Burbank one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alfie was driving and (my son) Jeffrey and I were with him," said Yvonne 
Wolfe, 41, of Riverside. "The limo driver wouldn't stop. Alfie jumped out at a 
stoplight and showed him a picture and said, 'We just want an autograph.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said the limo driver roared off and the chase resumed until the limo 
"stopped right in the middle of the 405 Freeway. . . . Can you believe this? 
Richard Dean Anderson was slumped down in the seat. He said he's not signing. 
He's late getting somewhere. Come on! 'MacGyver' is canceled!" 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit takes pride in outsmarting celebrities or wearing them down. Take 
Madonna, who he learned was at the Monkey Bar in Hollywood one night. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Alfie) barged through the door, and ran in and out in 30 seconds," recalled 
Richard Kappler of Glendale, an autograph collector who was at the bar. "He 
didn't get (the autograph). Madonna was in a room. But he was able to scope it 
out and came outside bragging about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Pettit was staking out Madonna's house when a big truck pulled 
up and, on a hunch, he followed the truck to Venice Boulevard. Suddenly, the 
truck screeched to a halt and out jumped Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a bandanna on her head and she tells me to (expletive) off," Pettit 
recalled. "And she starts walking on the sidewalk. Madonna on Venice Boulevard! 
I started following her. I went, 'Madonna, are you OK? Do you need a ride?' And 
she says, 'I'm fine, just leave me alone.' So I went around the block." 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned, Pettit said, Madonna had been joined by a friend who was 
trying to console her. "Get the hell out of here or I'm gonna break your neck!" 
the man yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing you know, (Madonna and her friend) come down the street and I 
get my camera up and I clicked off a picture of them; and he came running after 
me, threw me over this fence, got the camera out of my hand and threw it. I 
never could find the camera." 
</P>
<P>
 Another day, Pettit spotted Madonna and San Antonio Spurs forward Dennis 
Rodman walking along Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and asked Madonna for her 
autograph. When she refused, he waited and followed them to Sunset Boulevard, 
where she ducked into Book Soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit walked up to a stranger on the street and said he would pay him $20 an 
autograph if he would go inside and approach Madonna. "He went (into the 
bookstore) and got two autographs, so I paid him $40," Pettit said. He also 
asked a girl sitting on a bus bench to go in, but Madonna turned her down. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors and rock singers are not the only celebrities who find themselves 
approached by autograph hunters. Anyone in the public eye is fair game, even 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer a 15-year-old boy from New York named Blake Le Vine chased 
President Clinton's motorcade for miles trying to secure the President's 
signature on a photo of the White House. Le Vine was treated very 
sympathetically. But then a New York tabloid discovered that he was a 
professional autograph hunter who had previously sold signed pictures of 
Clinton for as much as $450. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Vine said he was upset to be portrayed as sleazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a kid," he said. "I'm 15 years old, which they didn't realize." 
</P>
<P>
 But kid or not, Le Vine, according to one of his competitors, employs some 
questionable tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were waiting for Goldie Hawn one day in New York," recalled Wendeborn, who 
is 25, "and she comes out and signs 40 photos for (Le Vine). Nobody else got 
anything. She and Kurt Russell then got into the car and as they went up Park 
Avenue, Blake runs alongside them pounding on the car window saying, 'Please, 
Goldie, I only have five more!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit said he once spotted Barbra Streisand leaving the Directors Guild of 
America on Sunset Boulevard after promoting her film "The Prince of Tides." He 
and other autograph hunters followed her to the Bel-Age Hotel, then took a 
shortcut through the hotel and met her as she walked in.

 "She said, 'How did you know I was coming here?' She was really scared about 
people following her," Pettit recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said: 'We really know you don't like to be followed, Barbra, but we never 
see you.' So she signed for us. She tried to just do a 'Barbra' and we asked 
her for a last name, which is an 'S-T . . . scribble, scribble.' If you get a 
'Bar,' it's worth about $200. A 'Barbra' is worth $300. And, a 'Barbra 
Streisand' is worth $450 to $500." 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand then went into the hotel restaurant, but the autograph hunters 
waited around until she came out, then asked for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "She goes, 'I'm going to tell you something,' " Pettit said. " 'For one thing, 
I don't like being followed. For another thing, I don't like being waited for. 
And for a third thing, I don't like my picture being taken. You guys have 
struck out and I've been real nice and signed autographs for you. Have a nice 
day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happens in this business," he said. "Sometimes you get told."

VAST SCOPE MAY UNDERMINE HEALTH CARE INITIATIVE; PROP. 186: PLAN WOULD TAKE 
INSURANCE FIRMS OUT OF SYSTEM. COMPLEXITY MAKES IT A TOUGH SELL FOR BACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind in public opinion polls and endowed by its authors with breathtaking 
complexity, the all-embracing single-payer health care initiative on the Nov. 8 
ballot appears in danger of being buried by its own colossal ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 raises so many issues -- and represents such a sharp shift in 
health policy -- that supporters say one of their biggest tasks is getting 
enough time with people to answer all their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not easy to explain," said Bill Zimmerman, a campaign strategist for 
the measure. "We can't win on sound bites." 
</P>
<P>
 Figuratively speaking, the initiative would put more than 30 million 
Californians in the same waiting room. Its authors seek to enroll seniors on 
Medicare, low-income persons receiving Medi-Cal, the uninsured and workers and 
their families with private health insurance -- in short, all legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative promises cradle-to-grave health care coverage, a liberal 
package of mental health and medical benefits, and money for long-term medical 
care and prescription drugs. It gets the name single-payer because a single 
state agency would pay everyone's medical and hospital bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the single-payer feature, Proposition 186 goes well beyond the 
national health reform proposal made by President Clinton and so far stalled in 
Congress. Under the Clinton plan, insurance companies would continue to play a 
key role in the health system. But Proposition 186 is designed to take 
insurance companies -- and the expenses they run up -- out of the health care 
system. Initiative supporters argue that insurance profits and overhead consume 
about 27% to 30% of the health dollar, while their system can be run with 
overhead costs capped at 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipated administrative savings would help fund the system, but 
monumental tax increases would still be needed. Under the initiative, income, 
payroll and cigarette taxes would be hiked a combined $40 billion to $50 
billion annually -- roughly the amount now raised each year to run all of state 
government from combined sales, income, insurance and excise taxes on such 
things as cigarettes and alcohol. Most working Californians would pay an 
additional 2.5% of earnings in state income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the tax bite, individuals and employers would be freed of the 
payments they now make for insurance premiums and most medical co-payments and 
out-of-pocket expenses. While they are healthy, individuals under the new tax 
burdens could suffer a net loss, but with the promise of making it up when they 
become ill or grow old. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the measure pass, the authors anticipate that thousands of insurance 
company administrators and clerks, who now process claims, could be thrown out 
of their jobs. As compensation, the measure provides for up to $1 billion of 
the new tax money to go into job retraining for those affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Total dollars going into the system, counting tax money plus the state and 
federal transfers that now go into Medicare for seniors and Medi-Cal for the 
poor, could exceed $75 billion annually, according to the state legislative 
analyst, or close to $100 billion, according to analyses done by both 
supporters and opponents of the measure. Even at that, some economists say 
there will not be enough money and predict multibillion-dollar deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, federal government approval would be required before Medicare and 
Medi-Cal patients and self-insured corporate plans could be folded into the 
proposed network. 
</P>
<P>
 All that adds up to an enormously complicated measure -- and political 
problems for the sponsors of Proposition 186. A recent Los Angeles Times poll 
showed that the measure garnered just 9% approval among likely voters, although 
the poll did say that two-thirds of those questioned did not know enough about 
it to form an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 As a forum to explain the initiative as well as to raise campaign money, 
strategists have developed an extensive network of volunteers who are hosting 
house parties up and down the state. Usually a couple of hours long, the 
parties are attended by friends and neighbors of the hosts. Typically there are 
several speakers, often a physician who gives a detailed summary of the 
initiative, then answers questions. 
</P>
<P>
 One such house party in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles, co-hosted by 
Channing Chase, an actress, and her husband, Dan Saxon, an art dealer, 
attracted about two dozen people who sipped wine, ate cheese and talked about 
health insurance. Chase said she was drawn to Proposition 186 and its guarantee 
of universal coverage because so many of her actor friends are forced to live 
without health insurance when they are between jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirited debates developed about both the need for health care reform, which 
everyone seemed to agree on, and Proposition 186, which produced a split. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a frying pan now, and I think (Proposition 186) would catapult us 
into a bonfire," commented one of Chase's neighbors. She was clearly in the 
minority. House party guests chipped in just over $1,000 in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-September, the campaign was holding 50 parties a week, creating what 
was described as a positive cash flow to the campaign of about $40,000. 
Campaign strategists hope to have those figures up to 100 house parties and 
$100,000 in contributions per week in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 strategist Zimmerman said that since surveys show that more 
than 80% of the voters in California have health insurance, part of the message 
of the campaign is how easily they could lose their coverage through job loss, 
divorce or some other circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you explain it to people -- the benefits they would receive, the 
insecurity they are subject to now -- we get a consistent two-thirds majority 
favoring the initiative. The problem is it takes us 10 minutes to explain it," 
Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents don't share the view that time is all that is needed to persuade 
people to support the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that the more people hear about the initiative the more they don't 
like it," said Richard A. Wiebe, the communications director for the "no" on 
Proposition 186 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 One key group, the California State Employees' Assn., came out strongly 
against the measure after a lengthy review. The opposition is key because the 
group has been an aggressive advocate of improved health benefits for retired 
state employees. The association's stand has helped neutralize a long list of 
groups representing seniors and retired workers who are helping lead the charge 
for Proposition 186. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at it very closely and decided there is no way they could provide 
all those benefits with (the) amount of money covered," said Sheena Wolfe, 
spokeswoman for the group's 31,000-member retired persons division. She said 
analysts decided that the proposed payroll, income and cigarette tax increases 
would provide "nothing more than a minimum benefits package." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the initiative say the state employees' association is an 
exception to other working groups because it has a heavily state-subsidized 
health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 During a month of unanswered radio and television ads, the opponents spent at 
least $2 million hammering away at what their research showed were the biggest 
negatives in the minds of voters -- fears of a state-run system headed by an 
elected officeholder, big tax increases and job losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiebe said one of his biggest concerns is complacency by opponents of the 
measure who, he declared, "believe this thing is so preposterous that nobody 
would vote for it." 
</P>
<P>
 "All the movement so far has been in our favor," Wiebe said. But he said he 
was concerned that could change because the other side hasn't "come to the 
plate yet" with their radio and television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of Proposition 186 make it clear that they are part of a national 
effort aimed at ultimately moving the United States into a single-payer system. 
Many see the California election as providing a crucial test vote on 
single-payer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this goes down, we will be back. I promise you that," said one well-placed 
official in a campaign with no lack of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Scratch the surface of any rally, fund-raiser or news conference for 
Proposition 186 and you will find doctors, nurses or individuals frustrated and 
fighting mad over the health system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Proposition 186 is opposed by the leading establishment voice for 
physicians, the California Medical Assn., many doctors support it. Several 
physicians, among them Dr. Andrew Bindman, a San Francisco internist, helped 
write the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bindman said he simply got fed up with the increasingly complex and 
inefficient paper-driven system that he believes is at the root of many of the 
problems in the health care system. A huge benefit of single payer, he said, is 
that everything, from bill payment to medical policy, would come from one 
source. "The paperwork blizzard just turns to summer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 groups have endorsed Proposition 186, among them labor unions, 
consumer organizations, senior groups and numerous nurses and physician 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, the bulk of the opposition is coming from business groups, 
insurance companies and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last financial reporting period, reflecting contributions through 
June 30, the "no" campaign, called Taxpayers Against the Government Takeover, 
took in $596,396 in combined contributions. Big contributions came from the 
California Hospitals Committee on Issues, $205,000, the Health Insurance Assn. 
of America, $132,285, and the American Council of Life Insurance, $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The "yes" campaign, Californians for Health Security, reported taking in more 
-- $900,838 in cash and non-monetary contributions, including $350,000 from the 
National Education Assn. and its state affiliate, the California Teachers Assn. 
But most of that money was spent qualifying the measure for the ballot and the 
"no" campaign is expected to raise substantially more for the rest of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders believe the proposed added payroll tax, which would range 
from 4.4% to 8.9%, depending on the number of employees in a given firm, would 
deliver a staggering blow to the economy. An economic consulting firm predicts 
that passage of the initiative would lead to the loss of 300,000 jobs, largely 
because employers would make up the cost of the tax by trimming payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big fear centers on the powerful government agency that would be 
established to administer a system so large that a 1% miscalculation on costs 
could create a $1-billion problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no free lunch," said Mark Wager, president and chief executive 
officer of Cigna HealthCare of California, a health maintenance organization 
and administrator of plans for businesses. "If someone would like to show me a 
government agency capable of creating the fourth- or fifth-largest health care 
system in the world and manage it well, I'd love to see it. Something that 
size, if you don't manage it well, the costs will quickly escalate out of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters concede the reputation of government is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing we need to overcome is people's distrust of government being 
able to do anything right," said Proposition 186 spokesman Steve Hopcraft. "But 
insurance companies are not exactly doing the job. Our mission is to show 
people that insurance companies are more inefficient than the government." 
Inside the Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some main points of Proposition 186, the single-payer health care 
initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot: 
</P>
<P>
 * CARDS: Would establish the Health Security Act. Health insurance cards would 
be provided to all legal residents of California. Whether newcomers would be 
included would be up to the Legislature. Cards would provide for a wide range 
of benefits. Cardholders would be free to choose their own physician or 
provider as long as those chosen were in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * PERMISSION: Federal permission to join the system would be required for the 
enrollment of Medicare and Medi-Cal patients and employees of self-insured 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * PAYMENT: Individuals earning up to $250,000 annually, or families earning up 
to $500,000, would pay an additional 2.5% of earnings in state income tax. 
Those earning more would pay 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * PAYROLL TAX: Employers would pay an extra payroll tax of 4.4% to 8.9% on 
salaries, depending on the size of their work force, phased in over three 
years. Legal challenges would probably develop over whether the payroll tax 
would apply to self-insured corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 * CIGARETTE TAX: Cigarette taxes would be raised an additional $1 a pack. 
</P>
<P>
 * HEALTH COMMISSIONER: The program would be administered by an elected health 
commissioner. The first commissioner would be appointed by the governor and 
confirmed by the Legislature. Thereafter, the post would come up for a 
statewide vote every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * BENEFITS: The health commissioner would define benefits, be empowered to cap 
costs, set co-payments for consumers in the event of budget problems, negotiate 
budgets with hospitals, determine reimbursement schedules for physicians, 
negotiate drug prices and establish a list of drugs allowed under the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * REGIONS: The state would be divided into an undetermined number of health 
care service regions, each administered by a local administrator appointed by 
the health commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 * CONSUMER COUNCILS: Consumer councils with professional staffs would be 
funded in each region to represent the interests of consumers and help mediate 
disputes with the commissioner.

MTA: TUNNELS APPEAR SHORT OF STANDARDS; SUBWAY: INSPECTION REPORT CRITICIZES 
CONSTRUCTION, SUPERVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sweeping condemnation of the construction and supervision of subway work 
from Hollywood to the Wilshire district, transit officials said Tuesday that 
"significant stretches" of the tunnels do not appear to meet contract 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection reports "strongly indicate" that the tunneling contractor failed to 
place high-strength concrete or grout in the joints of the outer tunnel shell 
along nearly 1 1/2 miles of Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some locations, records show, the contractor used plywood sheeting, 
odd-sized blocks of wood or other materials instead of concrete to fill joints. 
Paper-sack material has been discovered in at least one area, one source told 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection firm hired by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority alleged 
Tuesday night that the contractor hid some of the problems. The contractor 
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman, chairman of the MTA, called the extent of 
the problems brought to his attention Tuesday "deeply shocking. . . . It is a 
miracle that no one was injured as a result of this nonconforming work." 
</P>
<P>
 The statements by Edelman and other MTA executives contrast with the remarks 
by agency officials during the past month. They have depicted the structural 
problems as an isolated incident confined to a nine-block area of Hollywood 
Boulevard that sank last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an announcement Tuesday, MTA officials focused on problems with the 
expansion gaps, including the improper installation of the concrete filler 
surrounding wood wedges in these joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers not affiliated with the MTA have criticized the decision by project 
engineers to allow the wedges, instead of stronger metal struts, to be used for 
bracing. The MTA last week hired a Chicago-area firm in part to review the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnels in question had been scheduled to open to train service in 1998. 
Excavation beneath Hollywood Boulevard has been halted since Aug. 18, when 
surface sinkages of up to nine inches emerged. On Aug. 20, the tunnel 
contractor evacuated workers, fearing collapse of the tunnel along the 
boulevard's north side. Investigations by federal officials remain ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, the MTA's chief executive officer, said that in his opinion 
inspectors hired by the agency gave "little attention" to the placement of the 
wood bracing and accompanying concrete material. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must get to the bottom of this problem and fix it in order to restore 
public confidence in our subway construction project," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspection reports obtained late Monday by The Times show that the tunneling 
contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, failed, in violation of original contract 
requirements, to adequately place high-strength concrete or grout in the 
expansion gaps. Instead, records show that crews at times left the 40-inch-long 
gaps filled partially by the 32-inch-long wooden wedges, along with plywood 
sheeting or other filler. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, a joint venture controlled by the 
Walnut-based J.F. Shea Co., previously have declined to comment, citing a 
provision of their contract. The firm won the contract to build the 12 miles of 
twin tunnels two years ago with a bid of $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that allegations of substandard work with the expansion gaps 
surfaced 13 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sept. 11, 1993, nonconformance report for tunneling along the west side of 
Hollywood Boulevard cited Shea-Kiewit-Kenny for improper filling of a number of 
the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several segment wedge gaps . . . were not dry-packed (with cement or grout 
material)," wrote a Parsons-Dillingham inspector. "They were covered with 
plywood and the plywood was plastered to appear as drypack, leaving voids 
behind the drypack." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar citation was filed in March. On Sept. 20 -- more than one month 
after excavation was halted because of the ground sinkages -- the lead 
inspector for Parsons-Dillingham wrote a nonconformance report alleging that 
virtually all of the Hollywood Boulevard tunnel areas were built in violation 
of the contract specifications. The Times obtained the reports under the 
California Public Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
 According to additional information released by the MTA on Tuesday, tests of 
200 random feet of the tunnels detail the substandard nature of the work: Just 
5% of the inspected gap areas, between the concrete segments, were filled 
properly to a depth of eight inches. In 60% of the gaps, less than one inch of 
grout was placed. 
</P>
<P>
 White and Edelman criticized Parsons-Dillingham for waiting until Sept. 20 to 
file the more sweeping nonconformance report, instead of intervening during the 
months when the substandard work was still being performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is deeply shocking to discover that the tunnel contractor apparently 
disregarded an important safety feature of the contract, even after they were 
warned about noncompliance," Edelman said. "It is even more dismaying to learn 
that the construction management firm has neglected to properly inspect this 
portion of the work for an entire year." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons-Dillingham, controlled by the Pasadena-based Parsons Corp., blamed 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny for the deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parsons-Dillingham's inspection procedures were followed," said the firm, 
which has received $260 million for its work on the Los Angeles subway. 
"Deficiencies observed (during tunneling) were brought to the contractor's 
attention and corrected by the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recent inspections, subsequent to the settlement on Hollywood Boulevard, have 
uncovered additional locations where the contractor failed to comply with 
contract requirements, and in P-D's opinion, the contractor concealed these 
deficiencies from our inspectors." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times photographer and reporter Tuesday observed continuous areas of 
inadequately filled expansion gaps in the tunnel beneath Vermont near 6th 
Street. There were gaping cavities next to the wood wedges, and sheets of 
plywood were observed in the expansion gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Surface sinkages of four inches have occurred along the Vermont tunnels. But 
project engineers have said the soils there are generally firmer and more 
stable than along Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward McSpedon, MTA's president of construction, noted that the tunnel liner 
will provide the initial support for the structures. The finished tunnels are 
to be poured with a separate liner of concrete and reinforcing steel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This total structure will provide (subway riders) with a safe environment in 
which to travel," McSpedon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Patsaouras, an engineer and MTA board member, said the latest information 
makes it imperative for White to "hold accountable" McSpedon and other MTA 
officials who have been supervising the efforts of Parsons-Dillingham.

GSA'S JOHNSON AGAIN ACCUSED OF MISUSING POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Services Administration chief Roger W. Johnson is under investigation 
for the second time in his tenure over allegations that he misused his 
government position for personal benefit, government officials confirmed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The GSA's Office of Inspector General is looking into the allegations, made in 
a Newsday article last week, that Johnson used his executive secretary to draft 
memoranda to his personal business consultants and had her oversee furniture 
delivery and plumbing work at his Georgetown home, on government time. He is 
also accused of using his government driver and limousine for non-official 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper reported that Johnson also used his executive secretary for 
personal correspondence, including a request to former Vice President Walter 
Mondale, now the U.S. ambassador to Japan, to invite one of Johnson's sons, a 
Nikon employee, to embassy functions. Also in question is Johnson's use of the 
government phone to exercise stock options at Western Digital. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 60, former CEO of Western Digital in Irvine and the Clinton 
Administration's highest-ranking Republican, would not comment on the 
investigation. He acknowledged in interviews last week, however, that he did 
use government staff for some personal duties shortly after arriving in 
Washington. He said he was unaware that such actions, common in the private 
sector, were considered improper in the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time the inspector general has investigated alleged 
improper conduct since Johnson was appointed by President Clinton to head the 
GSA. The first probe was sparked by newspaper reports that he improperly billed 
the government for travel expenses as well as phone and overnight mail charges. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Johnson who requested that investigation to "clear the air." The 
inspector general concluded that he owed $73 and that he had billed the 
government for some expenses he should not have, while failing to bill for some 
where he should have been reimbursed. Johnson elected to pay back $1,062 to 
make sure that no taxpayer money had been improperly spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically attributed it to unfamiliarity with the rules," Karen Shaffer, 
spokeswoman for the inspector general's office, said Tuesday. "If you've ever 
tried to fill out a government travel voucher, it's a new experience. There was 
no ill intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson contends the latest allegations fell within the same time period, when 
he was unaware of the rules, and that he has been careful to separate business 
from personal services ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer said the latest investigation is routine. "These are serious 
allegations. . . . We are trying to find out what happened," she said. "It 
should be stressed that so far, we don't have anything."

 Former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley said Tuesday that GOP Senate candidate

discriminatory language from the property records of two homes he once owned in 
Houston.

 The racial covenants, which are ineffective because they were declared 
unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1948, state that the properties 
should only be sold to "descendants of the white or Caucasian race." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, appearing at a news conference arranged by the Feinstein campaign, 
stopped short of charging that the Republican challenger practiced 
discrimination. Instead, the former mayor faulted Huffington for not showing 
leadership on civil rights by having the language removed from the official 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington angrily denied that the language even existed in records for one of 
the two properties Feinstein targeted. On the other home, Huffington said, the 
deal was handled by his surrogates and he never knew about the racially 
restrictive language because it was not contained in the document he signed. He 
also said the issue is irrelevant because the language is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a liar," Rep. Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) charged in a telephone 
interview from Washington. "They are saying that I am a racist -- this is 
McCarthyism and Mrs. Feinstein should be ashamed of herself. She doesn't 
deserve to be a senator one more day with this stuff. She should resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials said the senator was in Washington Tuesday and 
unavailable to comment on whether she thought Huffington had acted improperly 
or whether she agreed with Bradley that her opponent was racially insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein spokesman Bill Chandler said, however, that the racial covenant 
reflects improperly on a public leader. "This is something that just clearly 
isn't right," he said. "It is an action of his insensitivity and it raises 
questions about his truthfulness." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein officials also provided documents indicating that the racial 
covenant existed on both properties at the time they were owned by Huffington. 
One document regarding the disputed property indicated that the restriction was 
removed in 1993 by the owner after Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate experts said Tuesday that racial restrictions are no longer common 
in property records, but they are sometimes found in documents that predate the 
Supreme Court decision 46 years ago. They are, however, sometimes used as 
campaign fodder for hostile opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush was found to have a racial restriction in the 
records of a property he owned in Texas. And opponents of Justice William H. 
Rehnquist used the issue to challenge his nomination to be chief justice in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The first property Huffington owned in Houston was a home he acquired from his 
parents in 1976 for $70,000. Huffington sold the property two years later for 
$185,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The deed referred to a separate document listing a number of restrictions, one 
of which was the racial language. That section read: 
</P>
<P>
 "No part of Briargrove, Section 8, shall be conveyed to, owned by, leased to, 
used or occupied by persons other than of the white or Caucasian race, except 
that bona fide servants of other races may occupy servants quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas law is even more restrictive than the federal law regarding racial 
covenants. A Texas housing official said Tuesday that the inclusion of racially 
restrictive language in a property record is illegal. If discovered, state 
officials order it removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more than just carelessness," Bradley said. "I think it's gross 
neglect of his duty as a human being, to say nothing of his duty as a leader in 
public office. If you are sensitive in the matter of civil rights, you don't 
need to have someone read you the contract. You feel it from your innards."

ACCUSED ARSONIST'S ALIBI CALLED IRONCLAD; CRIME: HIS ATTORNEYS ARE CONFIDENT 
CHARGES WILL BE DROPPED AGAINST JOSE SOTO MARTINEZ. HE REPORTEDLY WAS IN A 
MEXICAN PRISON DURING THE LAGUNA BEACH FIRESTORM. 
</P>

<P>
 Confident that charges against accused Laguna Beach arsonist Jose Soto 
Martinez will not stand up in court, the Orange County public defender's office 
said Tuesday that it would not bother sending its own investigators to a 
Mexican prison where Martinez was held at the time of the firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined to discuss the case, saying only that it is still under 
investigation. But court-appointed defense attorneys representing the man 
accused of setting the most destructive fire in the county's history said they 
are certain that the arson charge against their client cannot be proved because 
he has an ironclad alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Mexican prison officials backed the claim of Martinez's family that he 
was in a Mazatlan prison when the fires occurred last October, officials from 
the district attorney's office have slowly backed off pronouncements that he 
set the fire that damaged or destroyed 441 homes and caused $528 million in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi called a news conference to 
announce that Martinez "willfully and maliciously" set the blaze. But by 
Monday, Capizzi's chief assistant, Maurice Evans, said that in light of the new 
information, "perhaps Mr. Martinez did not set the fire and was in prison in 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 With the possibility that prosecutors may have to drop the most serious of 
four arson charges against Martinez -- the other three were for small fires in 
Fullerton -- new questions have surfaced about the entire case against 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 In a response to a query from The Times, Capizzi stated that the case had been 
fully investigated by his office for two weeks, that all prosecution guidelines 
were properly followed and that he was satisfied with the way all law 
enforcement agencies had handled it. 
</P>
<P>
 But others were critical of the filing. Deputy Public Defender Jim Egar said 
that even after Martinez was granted a court-appointed attorney, law 
enforcement officers videotaped seven sessions at which Martinez was quizzed 
about his knowledge of arson incidents without his attorney present -- despite 
requests to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers "recklessly and extensively" interrogated Martinez, Egar said, and 
violated his constitutional rights to have an attorney present and to not make 
incriminating statements against himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that a public defender was appointed for Martinez only for 
the Fullerton fires, and that the subsequent interviews concerned only the 
Laguna fire, before a court-appointed attorney was chosen for that case. 
</P>
<P>
 But court documents show that his court-appointed attorneys formally put the 
district attorney's office on notice more than two weeks ago in the Fullerton 
case that Martinez was invoking his right to have his attorney present whenever 
questioned, and to remain silent "as to this case and any other matter whether 
or not a complaint has been filed therein. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said Tuesday he thought that the district 
attorney's office may have rushed filing the arson charge against Martinez, 
without making an effort to contact the suspect's family for information that 
might exonerate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're being cautious now, whereas before they didn't exercise a 
great deal of caution," Butler said. "I guess they are trying to figure out how 
to deal with this in the media." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler also criticized the district attorney for interviewing Martinez about 
the Laguna fire even after a public defender had been appointed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's assume that he was not in the prison in Mexico; it looks like there are 
some very serious questions of admissibility of any confession or 
investigation," Butler said. "It smells like they have serious legal problems. 
. . . If (Martinez's) statements are ruled invalid, then their case goes away 
on that as well."

BUSH WEPT OVER TAILHOOK, FORMER PILOT TESTIFIES; SCANDAL: WOMAN WHO IS SUING 
HILTON HOTEL SAYS PRESIDENT SUMMONED HER TO THE OVAL OFFICE AFTER HEARING OF 
THE ASSAULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When then-President George Bush learned about the Tailhook assault on 
helicopter pilot Paula Coughlin, he summoned her to the Oval Office and wept, 
according to Coughlin's testimony in federal court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After she was delivered to a back entrance of the White House in June, 1992, 
by an Air Force general, Coughlin said Bush met with her privately and said he 
was "very, very, very upset" about the attack a year earlier by a gantlet of 
drunken aviators at their annual Tailhook convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had just found out what happened to me and he was very, very, very 
upset. He said he had a 31-year-old also and (then) he started to cry. I really 
didn't know what to do," Coughlin said. "I didn't know if I could cry any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin said the President also told her he was seeking the resignation of 
Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III, who was later forced to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, four admirals were fired or forced to retire for failing to act 
on Coughlin's complaint or covering up details of the assaults, which occurred 
during a raucous Las Vegas weekend convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, a former Navy lieutenant, sued the Tailhook Assn. and the Las Vegas 
Hilton, where the 1991 convention of the independent group of aviators had been 
held for the last 20 years. Shortly before the civil jury trial began last 
month, Coughlin reached a confidential settlement with the Tailhook Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The original whistle-blower on the Tailhook scandal, a frail-looking Coughlin 
was in her second day of emotionally charged testimony Tuesday. Her lawsuit 
against Hilton alleges that the hotel chain failed to provide proper security 
during the bawdy event three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Hilton, who deny the allegations of hotel negligence, have 
suggested alternately that Coughlin was either naive about what to expect at 
Tailhook '91 or that she willingly joined the drinking and debauchery.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE 'HUFF' BANGS INTO A BIG WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Roy Huffington Jr. is having a bad week. Here he is, trying to 
purchase a U.S. Senate seat in his own, quiet way, and no one will leave him 
alone. Doonesbury is poking fun at his wife and her connections to a New Age 
guru. Tom Bradley, the former L.A. mayor, is calling press conferences to 
suggest that Huffington is insensitive to racial issues. And the national 
magazines are all over him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should the Huffingtons be stopped?" Time asks in a headline. "When you catch 
up with him," the reporter observes, "he still doesn't seem to be there." The 
New Yorker is out with a biting profile, titled, "The candidate, his wife, and 
her guru." And fax machines deliver advance copies of an even deadlier expose 
to appear in Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a while," this piece quotes a Santa Barbara Republican activist as 
saying, "you can actually get a complete idiot elected to the U.S. Senate, and 
it could happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Why, the Huff must now be asking himself, is everybody picking on him? What 
happened to those good old days of August and early September? In those happy 
times, the formula seemed simple. Huffington had a job he wanted and millions 
of dollars from his father's oil fortune to spend making sure he got it. All he 
needed to do was appear in television commercials. The only issue would be his 
opponent, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, Huffington snorted, actually believed in government. He did not. He 
believed in "a government that does nothing." He was an accessory to his own 
campaign; his positions were less relevant than the opportunity he presented as 
protest vehicle. Don't like government? Huffington's campaign cooed: Here is 
your man. In this way, Huffington fell into line behind Ross and Jerry and the 
rest of the newfangled protest candidates, and at first his climb up the polls 
was fast and easy. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, it began to get tougher. Throughout the campaign, Huffington had 
leaned heavily on his wife, Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington, an author and 
talk show host and former -- she says -- minister in the Movement for Spiritual 
Inner Awareness. She was good at fencing with reporters and debating her 
husband's opponents, but this role also left her fair game. She was more a 
candidate than the candidate himself, and as these new magazine pieces 
demonstrate, she made for livelier copy. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, for example, is Vanity Fair, describing how in their new Santa Barbara 
mansion she "issued orders over a speaker phone from the bathtub. . . . Worse 
still were slurs overheard by the staff about 'stupid and lazy' Mexican help at 
a time when Huffington was trying to target Latino votes in his district." The 
piece went on to describe incidents that question the Huffingtons' 
much-ballyhooed call to replace government welfare with private charity, 
suggesting their favorite charity was free publicity for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 And here is the New Yorker, making the case that Huffington is but a "host 
body" for his wife's ambitions, which lead to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.: 
"Huffington," Barney Klinger, a Republican stalwart, tells the magazine, "would 
make a very, very good apprentice at a McDonald's. He's totally devoid of any 
intelligence. . . . You can never get through to him. No decisions are made 
without going through Arianna." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These snippets only hint at the Huffington material available at the nearest 
newsstand. They are sufficient, though, to make the larger point: The Huff's 
days as a stealth candidate, rising quietly in the polls while Californians 
snicker at his Texas eccentricities, are finished. 
</P>
<P>
 He has hit a bump in the road, one that has tripped similar candidacies. As 
long as the world believes a protest candidate has no chance, the livin' is 
easy. It was fun to root for Ross Perot, knowing the little fellow wouldn't get 
over the top. Similarly, Jerry Brown was left alone to frolic on talk shows 
across America, steadily gaining ground -- until he won the Connecticut 
primary. Shortly thereafter, his campaign was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 What Huffington did to deserve all this attention was to pull even in the 
polls with Feinstein. That changed everything. Interestingly, many of the 
disclosures had been printed previously in California newspapers, but no one 
seemed to pay much attention. Then. They will now. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it's a compliment to Huffington, albeit a potentially lethal one. He 
will be examined seriously now as a potential U.S. senator, and not merely a 
protest vehicle. His days of hiding in the shadows, chucking darts at his 
opponent, are done. Feinstein is no longer the only issue. The real Michael 
Huffington also is an issue. People will want to know about his character and 
his past and his plans. They will want to know about his wife and her guru. The 
Huff might not have seen his last bad week.

U.S. TO ANNOUNCE NEW AID PROGRAMS FOR SOUTH AFRICA; DIPLOMACY: OFFICIALS ARE TO 
OUTLINE PLANS FOR HOUSING, EDUCATION AND ELECTRIFICATION HELP DURING PRESIDENT 
NELSON MANDELA'S VISIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. officials are expected to announce a series of programs today to further 
economic development in South Africa, a nation they hope will become a model 
for its continent. 
</P>
<P>
 During a four-day visit by President Nelson Mandela, officials here will 
outline U.S. programs for housing, education and electrification in the newly 
democratic South Africa. Also planned is a bilateral commission aimed at 
developing technology and industry. And the United States will lend its 
assistance with an economic-development conference early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials were putting final touches on these programs as Mandela arrived 
Tuesday at the White House in his first visit since April's landmark elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeted by President Clinton and a jubilant crowd of 4,000 on the South Lawn, 
Mandela made clear that he wanted even more from the United States, a country 
that he said had already played a key role in South Africa's transition. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Americans helped bring about the new South Africa, Mandela said, U.S. 
business can play a role "in ensuring that there are enough homes, there are 
enough jobs, there are enough schools, there are enough hospitals and doctors 
for our country." 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here . . . knowing I will not go back with empty hands," Mandela said. 
"Come and invest in our country." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will walk every mile with you, and . . . we will not grow weary on the 
way," Clinton rejoined. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has committed to provide $600 million in aid over three 
years for South Africa, of which one-third already has been delivered. The 
programs expected to be announced today will rely on those funds and about $10 
million in new money. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials believe that the future stability of South Africa rests on the 
ability of the government to at least partially meet the rising expectations of 
the impoverished majority. Unemployment is still 40% in South Africa, and about 
half of the population is illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The huge issue here is to make democracy relevant in the lives of the people 
of South Africa," a senior U.S. official said. "The test of democracy is not 
only that you are free, but . . . that this makes a practical difference in 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The bilateral commission is to be modeled on a commission set up between the 
United States and Russia last year. That panel has overseen negotiations on a 
joint space station and promoted other ventures, as well as assisted in 
Russia's de-nuclearization. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also has begun to work with the South Africans on fighting 
drug trafficking -- an effort kicked off by a recent visit to South Africa by 
White House drug czar Lee P. Brown. And U.S. military officials will increase 
ties and training with the South African military, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other U.S. economic development aid will come through the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp., which supports private American investment in developing 
countries by providing them with insurance, financing and information services. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Mandela held a brief meeting at the White House on Tuesday 
afternoon before Mandela headed to a State Department lunch with corporate 
executives, diplomats and social activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The South African president was a guest at a White House state dinner Tuesday 
evening with about 200 other guests and entertainment provided by singer 
Whitney Houston. White House officials said demand for invitations was "huge." 
</P>
<P>
 "People were pulling every string they could find," one source said.

 A strong earthquake rocked Taiwan this morning, breaking windows and shaking 
tiles from buildings in towns along the east coast, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake, measuring a magnitude 5.8 and centered 20 miles east of the town of 
Chengkung on the Pacific coast, was felt throughout the island, the Central 
Weather Bureau said. Chengkung is 140 miles south of Taipei. 
</P>

7.9 QUAKE JOLTS JAPAN, KILLS 16 IN KURIL ISLANDS 
</P>

From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<P>
 A major undersea earthquake killed at least 16 people in Russia's remote Kuril 
Islands late Tuesday, jolted Japan and triggered fears of tidal waves on both 
sides of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of at least 7.9, hit near the sparsely 
populated Kuril chain north of Japan. At least 176 people in northern Japan 
were injured by broken glass and falling objects, but only three injuries were 
considered serious. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6.0 magnitude aftershock was felt early today in the same area. There were 
no immediate reports of additional damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The first quake sent 10-foot-high tidal waves smashing into the Kurils, 
destroying moorings and hurling small boats onto land. But the waves were 
smaller and less destructive farther from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 By early today, about 40 small tsunami waves had been observed in Japan. Most 
were less than 3 feet high, although one was 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations said the bodies of at 
least 16 people were found on three islands in the Kuril chain. Most were 
killed by falling debris, ministry spokesman Anatoly Streltsov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor Sankov, spokesman for Russia's regional government on Sakhalin Island, 
said all of the dead were believed to be members of the Russian military. 
</P>
<P>
 In some parts of the Kurils, 18-inch cracks were visible in the ground after 
the quake, Streltsov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial quake -- which lasted more than a minute -- was centered 13 miles 
beneath the Pacific Ocean floor, near the southern end of the Kuril chain. 
Japan's Central Meteorological Agency estimated the quake's magnitude at 7.9, 
making it the strongest to hit the region in 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo., estimated the quake at 8.2. 
It is common for preliminary estimates to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage and injuries in Japan occurred on the northernmost main 
island of Hokkaido, which is lightly populated, but buildings shook as far as 
650 miles away in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists said the relatively deep hypocenter of the quake and the seabed 
topography may have kept the size of the tsunamis relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
 On the big island of Hawaii, civil defense officials ordered the evacuation of 
35,000 people from low-lying areas. Actor Kevin Costner and several hundred 
cast and crew members shooting Universal Pictures' futuristic action film 
"Waterworld" were forced to seek higher ground. An elaborate floating set used 
as an atoll in the movie was towed to deep water as a precaution.EARTHQUAKES

IDEAS; COPING WITH MOTHER NATURE, AT ITS WORST; CONGRESS SEEKS TO SET UP 
REINSURANCE PLAN FOR BIG DISASTERS. BUT A STUDY SUGGESTS ANY U.S. EFFORT MAY 
NOT BE SUFFICIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Congress is deliberating the establishment of a federally guaranteed 
reinsurance plan for big disasters, but it is faced with a problem: Even the 
U.S. government may not be able to afford to cope with Mother Nature at its 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent study by Stanford University scientists projecting damages from a 
Los Angeles earthquake as high as $145 billion or a Bay Area quake as high as 
$115 billion has compounded the challenge facing lawmakers as they consider 
proposals to make the government an insurer of last resort if private insurers 
are overwhelmed and bankrupted by a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Damages of $115 billion or $145 billion are acknowledged by sponsors of the 
bills as so great that they would overwhelm any reinsurance plan the lawmakers 
could devise. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nation has never had a disaster even one-sixth as costly, and backers 
of the plan note that the Stanford study discussed worst-case scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsurance occurs when an insurance company sells a policy and, in order to 
protect itself against heavy losses, buys its own secondary insurance policy to 
cover losses above a certain amount. But even the liability of the reinsurer 
for catastrophic losses may have ultimate limits. 
</P>
<P>
 With such disasters as the Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes and 
Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew hitting in recent years, American insurers have 
found the normal availability of reinsurance tightening and prices rising. 
Meanwhile, insured losses have soared beyond earlier expectations, as have 
special appropriations for federal disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an industry-funded group known as the National Disaster Coalition, the 
insurers have been pressing for protection. They argue at the same time that a 
more secure industry may be better prepared to sell coverage, thus relieving 
the government of part of its burden when trouble strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to proposals pending in Congress that the coalition helped to draft, 
all companies would contribute a small percentage of premiums to an insurance 
pool and in any disaster that cost a specific company more than 20% of its 
operating surplus, or the industry as a whole more than 15% of its combined 
surpluses, the pool would pay the excess losses. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pool were to be exhausted, then the federal government would loan money 
to replenish it, enabling it to pay more losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Weber, executive director of the coalition, said last week that some 
limit would be set as to how big the government exposure could get, but he said 
the amount had not yet been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said that had the fund been in operation in the last year, it would have 
accrued about $1 billion -- and spent $200 million of that to help bail out the 
20th Century Insurance Co., which sold a high concentration of all its 
earthquake policies in the San Fernando Valley and lost about two-thirds of its 
operating surplus to claims from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber questioned how likely the losses envisioned as possible by the Stanford 
study actually were. "I've never heard of figures this high," he remarked. 
"Everything would have to go wrong. The quake would have to be centrally 
located, at the busiest business times and, for such devastating fires to 
occur, it would have to be one of the windiest days of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford scientists did see wide swings in possible damage. Depending on 
how strong the winds were, it said, a magnitude 7 earthquake on the 
Newport-Inglewood fault could do between zero and $70 billion in fire damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The main bills pending in Washington are sponsored by Rep. Norman Y. Mineta 
(D-San Jose) and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii). The House bill has obtained 
more than 150 co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 But several congressional staff members involved in the matter discounted any 
chance that such legislation would win approval this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Federing, a spokesman for Mineta's House Public Works and Transportation 
Committee, called this year's hearings "basically a starting point" and said 
that prospects would be better next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heather Ingram, an aide to Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), 
said that the current bills ultimately might be folded into comprehensive 
disaster legislation now being developed for next year by a bipartisan 
congressional task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some concerns in the present bills over how the financing 
would work and who would have control over the reinsurance pool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A serious question, too, is whether bills of this type would really save the 
federal government money or just widen its exposure to paying the losses of 
private insurance as well as providing general disaster relief.

COURTS; SUSPECT IN ABORTION SLAYINGS ACTS AS OWN ATTORNEY AT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denied a justifiable-homicide defense, a former Presbyterian minister charged 
with the July shotgun slayings of an abortion doctor and a volunteer escort 
outside a Pensacola clinic decided to act as his own attorney Tuesday, telling 
a jury that those who condone abortion "will answer to God." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hill, 40, relegated his court-appointed attorneys to the role of advisers 
and then asked no questions of nine prosecution witnesses who placed him at the 
murder scene with a gun in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, in an opening statement, Hill called the government "unjust as it 
does not protect human life." 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that we participate in this evil, we will answer to God," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is being closely watched by both sides in the national debate over 
abortion. Hill is the first person to be prosecuted under the 4-month-old 
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Law, which sets up a buffer zone around 
abortion clinics and makes it illegal to threaten or intimidate abortion 
providers anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion groups have denounced the law as an attempt to shut down 
abortion protests completely. "This law won't stop people like Hill," said John 
Burt, a Pensacola-area preacher and anti-abortion activist. "All this does is 
run more moderate people away from clinics. The bombers and shooters are still 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But many abortion rights activists see the law as evidence that the Clinton 
Administration is serious about dealing with a rising tide of abortion-related 
violence that has included murder, firebombings and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is important because the trial should be quick, and a guilty 
verdict will send a strong deterrent message," said Patrica Ireland, president 
of the National Organization for Women. "If we can't get a conviction here, 
however, then we'll have an awfully hard time going for convictions on lesser 
acts of violence -- arson, bombings, shoving and pushing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is charged with lying in wait outside The Ladies Center on the morning of 
July 29 and killing Dr. John Bayard Britton, 69, and James H. Barrett, 74, 
moments after they drove into the clinic parking lot. Barrett's wife, June, who 
was in the back seat of the couple's small truck, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial opened Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson ruled that Hill 
could not argue that the killings were justifiable homicide. "There are legal 
alternatives, certainly legal alternatives far less intrusive and far less 
evil" than killing to protest abortion, said Vinson. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Hill took over his defense from two lawyers who had wanted to 
argue that Hill had killed to prevent a greater evil. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the federal law, Hill could receive a maximum penalty of 
life in prison. He is scheduled to be tried Jan. 30 on state murder charges, 
which could lead to a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles and state Atty. Gen. Robert Butterworth urged the 
U.S. Justice Department to try Hill on the federal charges first, since 
conviction is believed easier to win and would send a signal that the state 
will not tolerate continued acts of violence outside abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League, said a conviction "will send a clear message that opposition to 
abortion is not a license to murder or commit violence." She said the slayings 
of Britton and Barrett were "not isolated incidents; they are part of a 
nationwide campaign of terror designed to make abortion unavailable." 
</P>
<P>
 Pensacola, a beachfront city of 60,000 residents in Florida's Panhandle, has 
been a flash point for abortion clinic violence, beginning with a spate of 
firebombings in the 1980s and including the March, 1993, murder of Dr. David 
Gunn, who worked for the city's other abortion clinic. Another anti-abortion 
zealot, Michael Griffin, is serving life in prison after conviction in that 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton, who lived in Fernandina Beach, knew of the peril he faced. He wore a 
homemade bulletproof vest and often carried a pistol.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; ARISTIDE TELLS U.N. HIS GOAL IS RECONCILIATION THROUGH 
JUSTICE; HAITI: THE EXILED PRESIDENT REVEALS HE HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 
WEALTHY FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a triumphant speech, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide pledged to the 
General Assembly on Tuesday that "we are going to prepare the coffee of 
reconciliation in the filter of justice" when he returns to Haiti in no less 
than 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes to reconciliation! No to violence! No to vengeance! No to impunity! Yes 
to justice!" Aristide cried out to the applause of his supporters in the public 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the exiled Haitian president also made it clear that his spirit of 
reconciliation did not extend to the three coup leaders who ousted him three 
years ago and to those who are judged guilty of what he called crimes against 
humanity during the era of military rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleased with news reports that Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, the 
Port-au-Prince police chief, was en route to the Dominican Republic, Aristide 
told a news conference: "One of the three has already left. Let's hope the 
other two leave soon." Aristide was referring to Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the 
army commander, and Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, the chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian president also revealed that he had been in contact recently with 
rich Haitian families who have long opposed his return. "I have been in touch 
with some of them," he said, "and we have agreed that we must move toward a 
state of law, and that means a body of rules which we must abide by." 
</P>
<P>
 On the question of a general amnesty for those who took part in the coup that 
ousted him, Aristide repeated his longstanding position that those guilty of 
political crimes could be granted amnesty but that the Haitian constitution 
prohibits amnesty for those guilty of crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that an amnesty bill is now before the Chamber of Deputies in 
Port-au-Prince, Aristide said, "The Parliament is at work, and the president is 
awaiting its result to make his judgment." But he stressed that his decision 
whether to approve an amnesty bill would have to be made in accord with the 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's pledge of reconciliation to the General Assembly was coupled with 
the promise of an ambitious program of reconstruction and development. By the 
year 2004, the 200th anniversary of Haiti's independence from France, his 
country, according to Aristide, will boast schooling for all children, a 
thousand doctors, the planting of 6 million trees a year, economic growth of 
10% a year, a reformed system of justice, a civilian police force and, above 
all, an era of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian president, who said he would return to Haiti earlier than Oct. 15 
if Cedras and Biamby joined Francois in fleeing, extended "a special thank you" 
to President Clinton for helping to restore him to power and told reporters 
that he was completely satisfied with the performance of the American troops in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood of democratic promise was marred during the day, however, when 
officials of the Haitian mission to the United Nations forcibly removed a 
reporter from the news conference room because, they said, he had written 
anti-Aristide articles. The reporter, Franz Israel of the New York-based Haiti 
Observateur, was allowed to return only when the U.N. Correspondents Assn. 
threatened to cancel the session. 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference opened with an official protest by the association against 
the conduct of the mission. Aristide pleaded that he could not comment since he 
knew nothing about the incident. But, when pressed, he told reporters, "If 
everything depended on me, I would have said, in a word, let him come, because 
we have no right to oppose freedom of the press."

BROTHER OF FIRST LADY WINS PRIMARY RUNOFF FOR SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh Rodham, brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, easily won 
Tuesday's Democratic primary runoff for the U.S. Senate against a former radio 
talk show host who believes in a government cover-up of UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham, who got eleventh-hour campaign help from his sister, had 58%, or 
214,057 votes, to Mike Wiley's 42%, or 155,271 votes, with 97% of precincts 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 He now faces a long-shot challenge to popular Republican incumbent Sen. Connie 
Mack, grandson and namesake of the legendary owner and manager of baseball's 
Philadelphia Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done this together, and together we will continue on and repeat this 
beautiful scene a month from now as victors," Rodham told supporters at the 
Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to get a job tomorrow," Wiley said at a restaurant where he gathered 
with supporters. "It's over. I'm not running again. Leave me alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's victory was "based in part on the fact that Rodham is a strong 
candidate," said consultant John Walker who worked on the successful campaign. 
"The other reason is that Mike Wiley, or whatever his name is, is cuckoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rodham campaign ridiculed Wiley and professed not to take him 
seriously, Mrs. Clinton was brought in over the weekend for a round of campaign 
appearances amid reports low voter turnout could hurt her brother's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley said Tuesday he wouldn't support Rodham in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't support him," he said. "I have a certain amount of integrity. They 
said I was ashamed of my Jewish heritage. There was no way he was going to get 
my support after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham and Wiley met in Tuesday's runoff after neither won a majority of votes 
in the four-way Sept. 8 Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The runoff revealed a weakness in the state's Democratic Party, said Richard 
Scher, a political scientist at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democratic Party had a responsibility to put on a candidate who could 
challenge Mack," he said. "Rodham is just not a political heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham, 44, campaigned on a platform of health care reform, a woman's right to 
choose abortion and tough environmental protection.

DRUG CARTEL LINK IN KILLING OF PRI LEADER IN MEXICO DESCRIBED AS WEAK BY 
SOURCE; LATIN AMERICA: OFFICIAL THINKS SOME IN RULING PARTY MAY BE PUSHING IDEA 
SO THAT SLAYING WON'T APPEAR TO BE POLITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Links between the notorious Gulf drug cartel and Mexico's second major 
political assassination in six months may be far more tenuous than some reports 
have suggested, a source close to the investigation said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation thus far "has not tied the Gulf cartel or any other cartel" 
to the murder of Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the No. 2 official in the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), said the knowledgeable official. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf cartel certainly has contacts at all levels of the Mexican 
government, the source said, but narcotics ties to last week's murder are weak. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Assistant Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu, who is the slain man's 
brother, told reporters late Tuesday that, "We are working basically on three 
hypotheses and one has to do with political motives, the other with the 
possible participation with drug traffickers and the third is a combination." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaks from the investigation and official communiques have both emphasized 
that the attorney general's office is pursuing leads related to narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI leaders have dismissed suggestions of divisions within the party between 
reformers and the old guard, usually referred to as "dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want it to look like a political murder," the source said. "So 
far, all of the people involved are in the PRI. They want to take the heat away 
from them and put it on the drug traffickers. Nobody likes drug traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
 He made the comments shortly before the attorney general's office announced 
that another suspected conspirator, arrested Tuesday, said the trail to the 
mastermind of the assassination reaches higher than Congressman Manuel Munoz 
Rocha, already implicated in the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Jose Martin Ramirez Arauz, said that people above Munoz Rocha 
ordered the slaying, according to the attorney general's statement. The 
statement did not give any names. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez Arauz, who said he is a congressional employee, and another suspect 
arrested Tuesday are both relatives of Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, an aide to 
Munoz Rocha. Rodriguez Gonalez's brother, Jorge, said Fernando planned the 
slaying at the behest of his boss, according to previous statements from 
police. Both men arrested Tuesday said they were aware of the plot, according 
to the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The only motive Ramirez Arauz mentioned for the murder was that Munoz Rocha 
said the changes that Ruiz Massieu was making and planned to continue making in 
the PRI "got in his way," according to the statement. That coincides with a 
previous statement from Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, who police say told them that 
Munoz Rocha was opposed to Ruiz Massieu's reformist views and did not want him 
to become Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The ties to drug dealers rest on three weak links, according to the source: 
</P>
<P>
 * The minor drug record of a south Texas man who once owned the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 * A drug investigation file that names Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, the suspect 
who, according to police, told them he bought the murder weapon and recruited 
the triggerman for the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 * The relationship by marriage of suspected plotter Abraham Rubio Canales and 
alleged drug dealer Raul Valladares. Even that relationship has been 
exaggerated, the source said. Police believe that Rubio Canales' nephew is 
married to Valladares' stepdaughter, he said. Other sources had said their 
children were married. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, while Valladares is believed to be a major drug dealer, he has not 
been a member of the Gulf cartel for at least two years and was never 
particularly close to its suspected leader, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the source said that police were questioning Rubio Canales on Tuesday. A 
former official in the Guerrero state government when Ruiz Massieu was 
governor, Rubio Canales is serving a 14-year sentence for land fraud. Police 
said Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez told them that Rubio Canales conspired to murder 
Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from the Chamber of Deputies said that a caller claiming to be 
Munoz Rocha also blamed Rubio Canales. The caller, according to the statement, 
said he had proof that Rubio Canales had masterminded the killing and that the 
caller feared for his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues who knew Rubio Canales early in his career remember him as a 
well-trained and responsible public official. They said they were shocked at 
his conviction on land fraud charges, not to mention suggestions that he might 
be involved in a killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez, according to police, told them that Rubio Canales 
was bent on revenge, blaming Ruiz Massieu for his imprisonment. But PRI 
officials have played down allegations that the assassination was the result of 
splits within the party.

AZERBAIJAN LEADER ALLEGES COUP PLOT

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Heydar Aliyev accused his prime minister today of plotting a coup 
against him and thousands answered his appeal to gather outside the 
presidential palace in the capital, Baku, to defend him. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, special Interior Ministry troops held Azerbaijan's general 
prosecutor hostage overnight.After freeing him, they withdrew to their base on 
the outskirts of Baku, where they exchanged brief gunfire with surrounding 
government troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident highlighted a simmering dispute between Interior Minister Ramil 
Usubov and his deputy, Rovshan Javadov. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev said the troops loyal to Javadov had seized the country's 
second-biggest city, Gence. He alleged that Prime Minister Suret Huseinov's 
troops had joined the rebellion in Gence. 
</P>
<P>
 Huseinov denied any involvement in the alleged plot. Javadov appeared at the 
rally to declare his support for the president.

YEAR AFTER FAILED REVOLT, OUTLOOK BRIGHTER FOR YELTSIN; RUSSIA: ECONOMIC 
INDICATORS ARE UP, BICKERING IS DOWN. BUT THE PRESIDENT MAY BE HIS OWN WORST 
ENEMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin huddled inside the Kremlin 
trying to rouse his generals to quash an armed revolt by his Communist and 
nationalist foes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a rosy-cheeked and triumphant Yeltsin spent the anniversary of 
last October's rebellion basking in the political calm that has settled over 
Moscow this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 While several thousand demonstrators marched past the restored Russian White 
House to mourn the 143 people killed in last year's strife and to denounce 
Yeltsin as a "murderer" and an "alcoholic swine," most Muscovites ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in the Kremlin, Yeltsin laid out his plan for building "a 
new Russia, a Russia without malice, bloodshed and deceit." The opposition, he 
said, is no longer dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "A second October Revolution did not take place," Yeltsin said. "A catastrophe 
was prevented. This happened because Russians have learned to tell the truth 
from lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin had plenty to brag about after returning from a visit to the United 
States with $2 billion of trade and investment agreements, plus an agreement to 
speed up the timetable for dismantling the Russian and American nuclear 
arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
 A brace of positive economic statistics released Tuesday bolstered the 
president's case. Inflation rose to 7.7% in September, up from 4% in August but 
below the double-digit mark for the seventh consecutive month. In a sign that 
industrial production is stabilizing, output rose 2% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Russians living in poverty fell slightly, from 20.5% of the 
population last year to 18% in 1994, the Russian Labor Ministry announced. 
Poverty is defined as a monthly income of less than $23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Household savings have begun to pick up," Yeltsin said. "The inflationary 
expectations of both consumers and producers have markedly declined. In other 
words, the first results (of reform) are already evident." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the improving economy, Yeltsin can also take cheer from a distinct 
drop in the level of political bickering. When the Russian Parliament comes 
back into session today, it is liable to cause Yeltsin fewer headaches than the 
U.S. Congress will give President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has promised to send 40 bills to Parliament, including a long-promised 
overhaul of Russia's wildly irrational tax code. He said the leaders of both 
houses of Parliament have already agreed to a new presidential decree that 
strengthens the president's control over Russia's unruly regions by allowing 
him to appoint key provincial leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 With his enemies in retreat, the main threat to Yeltsin today may be Yeltsin 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian press has been having a field day with Yeltsin for failing to get 
out of his state airplane Friday for a scheduled meeting with the Irish prime 
minister at Ireland's Shannon Airport. And critics have once again begun 
sarcastic public discussions of the presidential drinking habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said he simply overslept Friday and his security guards refused to 
allow aides to wake him up in time for the meeting. The president said he slept 
little during the Washington summit and was tired after an 18-hour flight from 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation did not satisfy the Russian press, which noted that the 
flight from Seattle to western Ireland should not take more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where were they flying for 17 to 18 hours? Were they flying via the South 
Pole?" asked the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Pravda called Yeltsin's explanation "clumsy." Although the 
newspaper, which had been shut down by the government last year for supporting 
the hard-line revolt, did not dare directly accuse the president of being too 
drunk to appear in public, it quoted the Times of London as saying that vodka 
might be to blame for "the fiasco at Shannon."

PLAGUE SCARS IMAGE, ECONOMY OF MODERN INDIA; ASIA: EPIDEMIC REMINDS TRADE GIANT 
THAT SOCIAL CHANGE HASN'T KEPT UP WITH BUSINESS STRIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For a country that has come to see itself as the next global economic 
superpower and a regional force meriting the same U.N. status as the United 
States, the images and events of recent weeks have been frightening and 
humbling. 
</P>
<P>
 They have served as a reminder that India, one of the emerging giants of 
international trade and a trove of scientific and business talent, remains a 
Third World land of widespread poverty, filth and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the events of the past two weeks have certainly done a lot of harm to 
India," said R.C. Bhargava, managing director of Maruti, one of India's top 
auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 This autumn's outbreak of plague, the "Black Death" that decimated Europe and 
Asia centuries ago and hadn't been detected in India since the mid-1960s, has 
seriously hampered trade, transportation and tourism between India and other 
nations. But the most durable consequence may be to this country's view of 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of India was never so badly tarnished," said Saeed Naqvi, a 
columnist who flew home from Britain last week to find India in the throes of 
plague hysteria. "The country that was to march into the 21st Century with all 
the blueprints for technological advance finds itself gripped in a primitive, 
medieval epidemic. Even the glorious contrasts of India cannot explain away the 
current tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Those glum sentiments lingered even as the illness that gave rise to them 
appeared to recede. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases reported 
5,130 suspected plague cases nationwide Tuesday, but Chief Medical Officer Dr. 
N.J. Kar said the word "suspected" was misleading because in New Delhi 90% of 
the patients admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the disease, such as high 
fever, cough and chest pains, have tested negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubonic plague cases were first reported in the state of Maharashtra, east of 
Bombay, in August. Pneumonic plague broke out Sept. 19 in the western city of 
Surat, 160 miles north of Bombay. In the last 48 hours, only one new confirmed 
death from plague was reported, raising the nationwide death toll to 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now on our way to recovery," Health Secretary M.S. Dayal said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some parents were furious and thousands of pupils wore cloth masks to 
class as a health precaution, newly confident New Delhi authorities Tuesday 
reopened the public schools they had closed Thursday. The panic that gripped 
many residents of the capital also seemed to be dissipating, with fewer people 
covering their faces with handkerchiefs, masks or scarves as they walked along 
the streets near the bustling business district of Connaught Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreading the possible spread of the disease to their territories, a long list 
of countries last week clamped curbs on travel and trade with India. There were 
glimmers Tuesday that some of those restrictions might soon be lifted, and 
shipments of Indian commodities to the Persian Gulf countries, suspended 
because of the epidemic, were allowed to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 But from Australia to the West Indies, restrictions on air travel and trade or 
stepped-up health monitoring of passengers arriving from India remained in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Among India's neighbors, authorities in Bangladesh proclaimed a "high health 
alert" and offered citizens a tempting incentive to kill rats: a color 
television in exchange for 10,000 dead rodents, which can carry the fleas that 
transmit the plague bacillus to humans. Nepal closed a border crossing and 
hospitalized three nationals who returned from India with possible plague 
symptoms. In Karachi, Pakistan, five ships arriving from India were placed 
under quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian business sources said fearful Swedish customers had canceled orders for 
Indian textiles, the country's largest earner of foreign exchange, while all 
garment orders bound for Germany are supposed to be quarantined and fumigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Tejendra Khanna predicted that the "panic reaction of some 
of our trade partners" would result in a 2% decline this year in India's 
exports, or the equivalent of $453 million in lost foreign earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 India's exports posted a 20% growth rate last year but were already slowing 
down before the epidemic hit. Bombay-based analysts predicted the plague will 
only reinforce that trend. 
</P>
<P>
 For some Indian public figures, the resurgence of a disease they had thought 
vanquished by medical science and general social progress forced them to 
contemplate the balance sheet of economic reforms now in their fourth year. 
Like many U.S. critics of "supply side" economics, some concluded that the 
blueprint followed by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister 
Manmohan Singh falls woefully short of ensuring a better life for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poor have finally taken their revenge against India's economic reform 
process, and in the only way they know -- by dying," fumed Editor M.J. Akbar of 
the Asian Age newspaper. "The great contradiction in the whole economics reform 
program has been the belief that change for the better can take place in a 
collapsing environment, that you can have a leap forward in industrial 
excellence and growth even while there is regression in the quality of life all 
around you." 
</P>
<P>
 Although India's slow dismantling of its bureaucratized economy has been a 
boon for tycoons, investors and a middle class that may be as large as the 
entire U.S. population, the reappearance of the plague has reminded India and 
the world that hundreds of millions here still live in squalid conditions 
without access to the most rudimentary services such as clean drinking water 
and prompt medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Maruti's Bhargava said the epidemic showed that economic and social change 
must be more uniform, or the reforms will be so shaky they might all come 
tumbling down. When officials in Surat allowed garbage and rats to accumulate 
after monsoon downpours struck their heavily industrialized and polluted city, 
it was enough to cause a health crisis of national and international 
dimensions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson is, there's no point trying to put through an economic reform 
program if you're not going to see that implementation at the grass-roots level 
of certain functions is carried out," Bhargava said. "You can damage everything 
by some silly thing like one city not cleaning up after a flood." 
</P>
<P>
 As chance would have it, the epidemic was in full swing as India was 
celebrating the anniversary of the birth of Mohandas K. Gandhi, the Mahatma or 
"Great Soul," who would have turned 125, the age he said he wanted to reach, 
Sunday. That led to deeper soul-searching about where India is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, this country staked its claim in the U.N. General Assembly for a 
permanent seat on a reorganized Security Council. "Given any criteria -- 
population, size of economy, contribution to the maintenance of international 
peace and security and peacekeeping, or future economic potential, India 
qualifies," Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in New York.

 Oliver L. North denied on Tuesday that he lied to Congress about the 
Iran-Contra affair. He conceded later that he didn't tell the whole truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press said I lied, but the jury said I didn't," the Republican candidate 
for U.S. Senate and former White House aide told students at Falls Church High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 North, who is running against Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb, conceded after 
his address that he misled Congress. "I acknowledged in (an) informal 
off-the-record meeting with a handful of members of one committee and some 
staff that I had not told them everything they wanted to know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 North was convicted in 1989 of aiding and abetting an obstruction of Congress, 
altering and destroying classified documents and accepting an illegal gratuity. 
The convictions were overturned on appeal.

'CHEERLEADER MOM' AGREES TO PAY FAMILY OF RIVAL $150,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The infamous "Texas Cheerleader Mom," who is accused of hiring a hit man to 
kill the mother of her daughter's cheerleading rival, has agreed to pay the 
woman $150,000 in a settlement approved by a Texas judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be paid by the home insurance company of Wanda Holloway to 
Verna Heath, Holloway's alleged target, to settle a longstanding civil lawsuit, 
according to an agreement announced by a state judge late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway was convicted in 1991 of trying to hire someone to kill Heath and was 
sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new trial was ordered after one of the jurors was discovered to have 
been convicted of a drug offense. Holloway remains free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that drew worldwide attention and spawned a series of television 
movies and book deals, officials allege that Holloway wanted Heath killed so 
that her daughter would become so upset she would drop out of cheerleading -- 
opening a spot for Holloway's own daughter at a junior high school in nearby 
Channelview. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heath family will receive about $100,000 of the total settlement after 
legal fees, according to lawyers in the case. Heath and her husband, Jack, will 
receive $70,000 and their four children will receive the remaining $30,000.

WHITE HOUSE STARTS WORK ON NEW HEALTH REFORM PLAN; LEGISLATION: LEON PANETTA 
SAYS THE NEW PROPOSAL WILL EMPHASIZE COST CONTAINMENT AND MAY NOT INITIALLY 
INCLUDE STEPS TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials have begun work on a new health reform 
proposal that will emphasize cost containment but may not include immediate 
steps toward universal coverage, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country is headed toward a train crash in terms of fiscal policy. If we 
don't deal with health care costs, eventually it will bankrupt us," Panetta 
said. "From that point of view, dealing with health care reform is absolutely 
essential." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have 
spoken in recent days about their commitment to continuing the fight for health 
reform. Yet many in Washington have chalked those comments up to wishful 
thinking, doubting that the Administration really has the desire to fight the 
health battle over again with a Congress likely to be more Republican and more 
conservative than the current one. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta's comments, made in an interview with a group of reporters, were the 
strongest indication yet that those doubts are misplaced and that the 
Administration does intend to plunge back into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 A new plan, Panetta said, will be prepared in December, in time to be included 
in the budget Clinton submits to Congress in January. And this time, he said, 
the plan will concentrate much more heavily on controlling costs, which he 
described as "one of the issues that was lost in the debate" this past year. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about universal coverage, Panetta said: "Obviously that's going to 
be part of the discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 But Panetta indicated that the signature element of Clinton's initial plan 
likely will be downplayed -- a strategy that could cause rifts between the 
White House and its more liberal allies, and even within the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a linkage between effective cost controls and universal coverage," 
Panetta said, referring to arguments that it would be difficult to truly 
control costs unless everyone were part of a universal system. But whether it 
takes one bill or several pieces of legislation, and how long it takes to phase 
in expanded coverage are all still decisions to be made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta's emphasis on cost control could collide with the desires of 
congressional Democrats, who would prefer to concentrate on expanding benefits. 
A core group of liberal Democrats, for example, intends early next year to push 
for coverage of pregnant women and children as a first step, or "down payment," 
toward comprehensive health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to reach up to 10 million needy children, this approach would provide 
full insurance premium subsidies for families whose incomes are as high as 
twice the federal poverty level, or $24,640 for a family of three. Partial 
subsidies would be available to families with incomes up to roughly $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues for such subsidies would come from a 45-cent-per-pack increase in the 
federal cigarette tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary proponents of the "kids first" campaign, Sens. Harris Wofford 
(D-Pa.) and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), say they would also include in a bill half a 
dozen other elements that they believe would enjoy broad bipartisan support. 
Those include insurance market reforms that would guarantee that companies 
cannot cancel insurance when a person gets sick, a first step toward a 
long-term care program, continued tax deductibility for insurance premiums paid 
by the self-employed and administrative simplification in the insurance 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But already some opposition has surfaced. While the "kids first" benefits 
would be paid by the federal government, states might bear the burden of 
implementing and administering them -- a chore that Administration experts 
privately note could be very costly. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, critics also have warned that the "kids first" approach 
could cause employers to drop coverage for dependents, arguing that the 
government would simply pick up the slack. If employers did that, costs to the 
government would rise rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Panetta's comments about the Administration's desire to try again 
reflect a fundamental reality of the health care issue: As difficult as the 
debate is, doing nothing also has a high price. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration forecasters estimate that 50% of all increased federal spending 
in the next decade will be caused by higher health care costs for Medicare, 
Medicaid and veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we can maintain the deficit path we've established" without 
controlling health costs, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with any bill that emphasizes cost control, however, is that any 
serious proposal to reduce costs will require new limits on benefits. In the 
plan that died this year, for example, the Administration had proposed setting 
an overall budget on health costs. Even though Administration officials 
insisted the budget was merely a standby authority to be used if market forces 
failed to control costs, critics accused Clinton of proposing to ration care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also had proposed limiting Medicare costs by paying doctors 
and hospitals less and by requiring some elderly Americans to pay slightly more 
for laboratory tests and some other medical expenses. Those proposals all 
proved highly controversial. Panetta declined to say whether any of those 
proposals would resurface.

ANTI-TOBACCO DRIVE TARGETS CHURCHES, DOCTORS' OFFICES

<P>
 Anti-smoking activists are headed for the nation's churches, schools and 
doctors' offices, hoping to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures on 
petitions urging the government to regulate tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition drive, announced Tuesday by the Coalition on Smoking Or Health 
and 75 health, religious and legal groups, is the latest skirmish in the battle 
over tobacco regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco industry is deliberately trying to convince politicians and the 
public that nothing should be done," Coalition chairman Scott Ballin said. 
"They will continue to control the issue . . . unless we get out our message 
that Americans want tobacco regulated." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry scoffed at the petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal regulatory process isn't a popularity contest," said Tobacco 
Institute spokesman Thomas Lauria. "Congressmen know their constituents better 
than the anti-smoking lobby does." 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that 400,000 Americans die every year from tobacco-related 
illnesses, the Food and Drug Administration is considering regulating nicotine 
as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler insists that he is not out to ban tobacco 
and has asked Congress for the authority to regulate it without a ban. Options 
include capping the amount of nicotine in cigarettes or ending tobacco 
advertising, but Kessler has not decided his next step, spokesman Jim O'Hara 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry is fiercely fighting the FDA, spending millions of 
dollars on full-page newspaper ads saying Kessler secretly wants tobacco 
prohibited. The latest ad on Tuesday warned that organized crime rings would 
smuggle cigarettes if they were banned or too highly taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation authorizing Kessler to regulate tobacco has stalled in the House 
and the bill's author, Oklahoma Democrat Mike Synar, last month lost his 
reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballin insisted the regulation push has not died, saying the petitions will 
tell a new Congress in January what Americans really want.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; EVENT SHOWS WOMEN'S SUPPORT FOR WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing a female opponent for the second time in four years, Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson flexed his political muscle with women Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor basked in the applause -- and some cheers -- of 5,000 women 
attending the third annual Gov. Pete Wilson Conference for Women at the Long 
Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong event featured 33 panel sessions on a variety of women's issues, 
from public safety to business entrepreneurship. A number of national leaders 
participated, including American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole and 
Paramount Pictures Chairman Sherry Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference illustrated Wilson's ability to use his incumbency to boost his 
reelection campaign. Although billed as a nonpartisan event, the conference was 
run by, and showcased, a number of women serving in the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the luncheon, the governor received robust applause when he noted that 
"just last week, I was proud to sign a bill" that allows women to select their 
obstetricians-gynecologists as primary care physicians under group health care 
plans. Wilson also has designated October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
</P>
<P>
 At another point he cracked, "In this Administration, everyone wears pants," 
an indirect reference to another bill he signed that outlaws workplace dress 
codes that bar women from wearing pants. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson spoke, his Democratic opponent, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, was 
in New York to raise campaign funds. Since early in the year, she has not made 
gender a major issue in the race as Democratic nominee Dianne Feinstein did 
when she ran against Wilson in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those on the dais for lunch was Democratic Assemblywoman Jackie Speier 
of Burlingame, a Brown supporter who nonetheless is quoted in Wilson campaign 
literature as saying: "Gov. Pete Wilson has done more for California women than 
all the previous governors put together." 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, Wilson held a campaign news conference to announce the 
rejuvenation of Pro-Wilson, a woman's group claiming 5,000 members supporting 
the governor's reelection effort. Also created was a Pro-Wilson national 
advisory committee that includes such prominent Republicans as former First 
Lady Barbara Bush, former UN Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick and Sen. Nancy 
Landon Kassebaum of Kansas. Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 34 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: Gov. Pete Wilson addressed his third annual 
Conference for Women at the Long Beach Convention Center. State Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown continued her East Coast fund-raising trip, traveling from 
Washington to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Today, Wilson travels to Washington for a fund-raiser. Brown 
returns from New York and has no campaign events scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: Both U.S. Senate candidates -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
and Rep. Mike Huffington -- remained in Washington, where Congress is in 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Both candidates are scheduled to remain in Washington today. 
No campaign events are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are sensitive in the matter of civil rights, you don't need to have 
someone read you the contract. You feel it from your innards." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley, who said Huffington is racially insensitive 
because he did not remove outlawed discriminatory language from property 
records of two homes he once owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are saying that I am a racist -- this is McCarthyism and Mrs. Feinstein 
should be ashamed of herself." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Huffington, responding to Bradley's charges.

Medflies in Ventura County, Sheriff Larry Carpenter on Tuesday appealed on 
behalf of the county for state and federal disaster relief money for potential 
crop and sales losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson was expected to declare a state of emergency in the county as 
early as today, county disaster officials said. Wilson was also asked to 
forward a request to President Clinton for a federal state of emergency, which 
would clear the way for federal disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimated the damage to crops, the loss of sales and the "ripple 
effect" on associated industries such as packinghouses at up to $439 million. 
However, county agriculture Commissioner Earl McPhail said that figure is an 
outside estimate, based on early forecasts of damage, loss of sales, unpaid 
salaries and other potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 An official quarantine that may be in effect for up to six months was also 
expected to be imposed today, encompassing about 81 square miles within a 
4.5-mile radius around the site where the flies were found, the grounds of St. 
John's Seminary in eastern Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed boundaries, which would take into account roads, growers' fields and 
mountain ranges, were drawn up Tuesday by McPhail and other officials and sent 
to Sacramento for review. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of 10 more male Mediterranean fruit flies Monday brought the 
total to 41 fertile males and two mated females. All were found within 200 
meters of the seminary site. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japan, the county's most lucrative market for its citrus products, 
will not accept fruit from a quarantine area, agriculture officials in other 
Southern California counties with Medfly quarantines said that only quarantine 
areas were banned from shipments and not entire counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Sunkist, the largest citrus cooperative in the country and the 
marketer of most of the county's fruit, said they did not expect a Japanese ban 
to extend beyond the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still questionable whether other citrus-growing states, such as Florida, 
Arizona and Texas, will accept the county's produce.

 The city and county of Honolulu will pay $1.2 million in fines for dumping 
millions of gallons of untreated sewage into Hawaii's waters from 1987 to 1992, 
the U.S. Justice Department has announced. It said Monday that Honolulu 
officials also agreed to overhaul their leaking, 1,900-mile sewer system, which 
had at least 60 spills in the five-year period.

EFFORT TO DELAY GLOBAL TRADE VOTE APPEARS THWARTED; LEGISLATION: HOUSE LEADERS 
SAY ENOUGH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT EXISTS TO PASS GATT PACT TODAY. WHITE HOUSE IS 
BLAMED FOR MAKING SOME MISCUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration was thrown into a scramble Tuesday, one day before 
the scheduled vote on a global trade agreement in the House, after the pact's 
opponents and even some of its key supporters tried to delay the vote until 
after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close of the day, however, the House leadership decided it had 
sufficient support to conduct the vote today. The legislation would implement a 
massive revision of the rules governing global commerce, expanding their reach 
and slashing tariffs by an average of 40% around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going forward with it, and we think we have the votes to pass it, with 
both parties participating," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
 With few major successes in Congress during his second year in office and the 
eventual approval of the agreement not in serious doubt, his aides said, 
Clinton has portrayed the trade measure as one of crucial legislative 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion surrounding the issue came just at a point when the fog of 
political pressures should have been lifting. It was another example, critics 
said, of legislation crucial to the President being threatened by the sort of 
White House miscues that almost sank the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 One key ally, speaking on the condition of anonymity, expressed frustration at 
having to go to the mat repeatedly to bail out the Administration on some of 
its most important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure mounted a last-ditch effort to put off a vote until 
late November or early December, which would force the House into a lame-duck 
session in tandem with the Senate session that is scheduled to vote on the 
trade plan on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the debate over when to conduct the vote is congressional 
skittishness in dealing with trade issues, which used to have little trouble 
gaining wide bipartisan support. The dispute over the pact, which rewrites the 
47-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, follows an even more 
precarious battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 123-nation GATT accord would cut worldwide tariffs by about $740 billion, 
reduce other barriers to trade and extend the rules of world trade to services 
and intellectual property, such as computer programs and drug patents. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals for a delay in voting on the measure fell on friendly ears in the 
House on Tuesday as members began to wonder whether, just before adjourning to 
campaign for reelection, they wanted to cast votes on an issue that has 
organized labor up in arms and has drawn diverse opposition, from consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader to conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need to rub the nose of our labor base. That essentially is the plea 
we are getting," said Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) on the reluctance of 
Democrats, even those who support the trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the debate today, supporters must clear a procedural hurdle by getting 
at least 218 votes to move the issue onto the House floor. Majority Whip David 
E. Bonior (D-Mich.) said Republicans had indicated they would supply no more 
than 50 of the necessary votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who supports the trade measure, made it 
clear that he and other Republicans might do their best to delay the matter. 
Gingrich's comments came in a private meeting to which Foley had invited 
representatives of major business organizations and companies supporting the 
trade plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newt came in and read the group the riot act," said a participant. Gingrich 
told them, in effect, " 'I'm not supplying a single vote. My members don't want 
to give the President a victory,' " the participant said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gingrich aide said the second-ranking Republican in the House was angry that 
Clinton was trying to push the measure through at the last minute, rather than 
having sent it to the House during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have had a month to work this and get a nice handsome vote" for a trade 
plan Gingrich would ultimately like to see put into place, the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure will pass, said Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), long a supporter of the 
agreement, "but not with the 350 it would have had in August, totally because 
of the mismanagement of this issue by the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 At midafternoon, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta predicted that at 
least 170 Democrats and 60 Republicans -- 12 more than needed -- would vote for 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the White House had misjudged the roadblock it had encountered in 
the Senate, when Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) forced the two-month delay in 
the Senate vote last week. Panetta said that the issue had been allowed to get 
"caught up in the kind of general shooting back and forth that we're seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollings conducted the first of a series of hearings on GATT by his Commerce, 
Science and Transportation Committee on Tuesday. A second, with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor, was scheduled for today.

LAST AMERICAN LISTED AS POW IS EULOGIZED AT RITE

<P>
 Declared dead after 29 years, Col. Charles Shelton, the last American listed 
as a prisoner of war, was eulogized Tuesday as "one of the most excellent 
military officers our nation ever produced." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his five children asked and the Air Force last month changed his 
status to killed in action, the children said after attending a graveside 
service they still do not believe he is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our way of creating some closure and getting on with our lives," said 
John Shelton, 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton's name will be inscribed at the grave of his wife, Marian, who was 
buried at Arlington National Cemetery after committing suicide in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said his father, shot down over Laos on April 29, 1965, on a secret 
reconnaissance mission on his 33rd birthday, was a proud family man who enjoyed 
his friends, cherished his children and "fought his foes ferociously." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton received a 21-gun salute; a bugler played "Taps" and four F-15s flew 
overhead in the missing man formation.

MAYOR SELLS STOCK SEEN AS POSSIBLE CONFLICT; FINANCES: RIORDAN DIVESTS SHARES 
IN PASADENA FIRM THAT HAS DEALINGS WITH MTA. HE DISCLOSES PURCHASE OF 
$2.8-MILLION VACATION HOME IN IDAHO WITH HIS COMPANION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has moved to divest himself of stock 
holdings that presented a potential conflict of interest and, in a separate 
matter, purchased a vacation home in Idaho with companion Nancy Daly, according 
to a financial disclosure form. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's report to the city Ethics Commission shows changes in his finances 
since this spring, when he reported an investment portfolio of more than $70 
million, not counting his holdings in a blind trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor reported that in the first six months of 1994 he sold some of the 
nearly $10 million in stock he owned in Tetra Tech Inc., a Pasadena-based 
engineering services company. After the deadline for filing the financial 
disclosure form, Riordan sold the rest of his stock in the company, an aide 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock holding became controversial last summer when The Times reported 
that Riordan had voted as a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
board in a way that benefited the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's vote had helped to activate a $1.05-million contract for Tetra 
Tech. The state Fair Political Practices Commission subsequently announced that 
it would investigate whether Riordan's vote violated conflict-of-interest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said at the time that he had no idea Tetra Tech might benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a mayoral aide said Riordan decided "for a lot of reasons" to sell his 
489,157 shares in Tetra Tech. "The feeling was if he can avoid even the 
appearance of a conflict by unloading this company, why not do it," said the 
aide, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the FPPC declined to say whether Riordan's sale of his Tetra 
Tech stock would end the agency's investigation into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also reported in the financial disclosure form the purchase of 
property in Ketchum, Ida., with his companion, Nancy Daly. The pair formed M & 
A Partnership to purchase the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Property records show that the house in north Ketchum, near the Sun Valley ski 
resort, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms and sits on two lots that total 
about 2.5 acres. The properties were valued at $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Daly bought the home in March. The mayor has enjoyed fishing, 
mountain biking and skiing there, most recently visiting in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riordan aide said not too much should be read into the joint purchase of the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a precursor to anything," the aide said. "It's a place they can 
go and enjoy and a place their kids and grandchildren can go and enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Daly were on a 17-day cycling vacation in Europe and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also reported divesting his holdings in several other companies. He 
sold 45,112 shares in Abbey Healthcare, 105,888 shares in American Health Care, 
13,578 shares in Ornda Health Corp. and 45,600 of his nearly 365,000 shares in 
Mattel Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also reported $750,000 in income from a real estate investment called 
Chaparral Village; $455,000 from the Riordan, Lewis and Haden partnership, 
$260,000 from his ownership of the Pantry restaurant Downtown and $130,000 from 
his partnership's holding in the Fine Arts Building, also Downtown.

AGRIBUSINESS FIRM SUN WORLD FILES FOR PROTECTION UNDER CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sun World Inc., one of California's largest agribusiness companies, announced 
Tuesday that it has filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive John P. Brincko said the filing late Monday in U.S. District 
Court at San Bernardino is aimed at protecting growers and vendors and 
restructuring Sun World's balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The action . . . enhances our ability to meet our obligations to our growers 
and vendors and ultimately to better position Sun World to capitalize on 
continuing growth and profit opportunities resulting from its expanding line of 
proprietary and branded Sun World products," Brincko said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of California's top farms compiled by Data Harvest, a research firm, 
listed Sun World subsidiaries Treasure Farms of Irvine and Superior Farming of 
Bakersfield as 11th and 12th. They were listed with between $40 million and $60 
million in annual gross revenues each. 
</P>
<P>
 Brincko said Sun World's capital lender, Caisse de National de Credit 
Agricole, has agreed to provide the company the use of cash collateral as 
interim financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun World is negotiating a long-term commitment for debtor-in-possession 
financing from its primary long-term lender, Brincko added. That financing will 
replace the interim credit and will finance the company's day-to-day operations 
under restructuring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immediate availability of financing should instill in our growers, 
vendors, customers and employees a renewed confidence in the company," Brincko 
said. "Sun World is in a stronger position today than it has been at any time 
in the past several years." 
</P>
<P>
 He said growers and other suppliers will receive timely payments and that 
employees will continue to be paid on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers . . . can be assured of an uninterrupted supply of fresh 
produce, including the many specialty varieties of fruits and vegetables for 
which Sun World is renowned," he said.

FLIGHT ALLOCATIONS ALTERED AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT; TRANSPORTATION: POLICY CHANGE 
BY O.C. SUPERVISORS IS INTENDED TO GIVE CUSTOMERS MORE CHOICES. RENO AIR WILL 
TAKE OVER SIX AMERICAN TRIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Another discount airline intends to begin service at John Wayne Airport this 
month -- offering $69 one-way fares to San Jose -- following Tuesday's approval 
by the Orange County Board of Supervisors of a plan that revamps the way 
flights are divvied up. 
</P>
<P>
 The change, approved unanimously despite objections from United Airlines, 
tackles the longstanding problem at John Wayne of equitably dividing the 
limited number of flights allowed for noisy jetliners. The number of those 
flights was restricted under a 1975 court settlement between the county and 
Newport Beach, which was seeking to reduce jet noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say the change is also aimed at addressing major changes in 
the airline industry, where both domestic and foreign airlines are linking 
themselves with one another in various alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way of extending their route system without really extending their 
route system," said Jeff Hampton, a writer for Commercial Aviation Report, a 
trade publication based in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport's former policy for allocating flights hampered the start 
of new service by assigning carriers to a waiting list where they were stuck 
until another airline dropped some of its flights. Then the county allocated 
these landing slots among those waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, carriers already established at the airport can share 
their allotted flights with airlines that want to start service at John Wayne. 
The result, proponents said, will be more flight and fare choices for 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is also expected to benefit low-cost carriers like Reno Air, which 
already has a marketing link with American Airlines, one of the busiest 
carriers at John Wayne. Reno Air can now take over five daily flights to San 
Jose and one to Reno that were previously flown by American. 
</P>
<P>
 Service could start later this month, said Robert M. Rowen, vice president at 
Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
 But the revised flight allocation policy was strongly opposed by a lawyer for 
United Airlines, who warned that it will actually stifle competition in the 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Burt Pines told the supervisors that the new policy "will put in 
place a system of cartels. Airlines will be very reluctant to surrender their 
allocation" of flights to the airport, he said, and will tend to recruit other 
airlines to join with them instead. Together, he said, airlines will divide up 
routes so they can in effect shut out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Reno Air is being allowed to fly into Orange County, Pines argued, 
other discounters will be forever barred. He said Shuttle by United, which 
started service from several Southland airports Saturday, will not be able to 
collect enough flights to serve John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 But Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, in whose district the airport lies, 
countered that "it's great for passengers, which is why I support it." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which takes effect immediately, passed on a 4-0 vote.

GAUGING CONSUMERS' TASTES; FIRM CONDUCTS SURVEYS TO TRACK DINERS' CHANGING 
HABITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Numbers roll off Bob Sandelman's tongue faster than he can flip through his 
latest stack of statistics on what Americans think of fast-food and pizza 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 About 96% of those living in metropolitan areas go to such eateries at least 
once a month, he says. Altogether, they average 12 trips a month for breakfast, 
lunch, dinner or snacks. That means that nearly everybody, he says, is getting 
food from McDonald's or Domino's or some other chain every two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have no time for something so basic as eating," Sandelman said. "With 
dual-income households, people are going out to purchase ready-to-eat meals, 
and the need for speed and convenience is paramount." 
</P>
<P>
 Operating out of his Brea home, Sandelman has built a growing business that 
helps the chains, as well as sit-down family and casual restaurants, monitor 
and cater to the ever-changing tastes of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandelman & Associates tracks consumers' opinions of more than 120 national 
and regional fast-food chains in 49 metropolitan markets nationwide, finding 
out how aware patrons are of a chain and its products and how often they stop 
at each chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's consumer research is highly valued, clients say, because it 
targets specific metropolitan areas, polls a large sample of customers and 
costs less than other, less-focused surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Sandelman has become somewhat of a guru, opining for the 
national media on what people eat, where they go and with whom. Just 10 days 
ago, for instance, he was quoted by USA Today about the pending merger of the 
Arby's roast beef chain and Long John Silver's seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 He also studies related issues that affect the fast-food and pizza business. 
Last spring, for instance, he found through an extensive survey that 60% of the 
nation's fast-food patrons favored a no-smoking policy at fast-food 
restaurants, while only 22% opposed such a ban. The rest of the 6,230 people 
polled in 31 major U.S. markets had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a smaller poll involving casual-dining chains in the Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and Sacramento markets, even more patrons -- 73% -- favored a 
no-smoking policy in the dining area, and a surprising 45% wanted a ban on 
smoking in the bar areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Those surveys came at a time when a few fast-food chains, notably McDonald's 
and Taco Bell, said they would institute smoking bans in company-owned stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "His research gives you a pulse on what's happening locally," said Tom 
Amberger, marketing director for Wienerschnitzel Corp. in Newport Beach. "It 
gives some top-flight information quickly, and we appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Wienerschnitzel hired Sandelman to do a private survey for 
the company, which wanted to gauge the effectiveness of its new advertising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's biggest hot dog chain poked fun at itself with self-mocking ads, 
even referring to itself as "Chez Weenie." Billboards across Southern 
California showed jumbo chili dogs next to such headlines as "The culinary 
equivalent of mud wrestling" and "It's cheap. It's messy. Hey, you are what you 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandelman polled consumers both before the campaign was launched and after it 
was over. The results, Amberger said, showed that the ads made consumers more 
aware of Wienerschnitzel and that awareness translated into higher sales for 
the privately held company. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say they watch their health and they exercise," Sandelman said. "But 
when they eat out, they consider it a treat. They eat salads at home and then 
go have fatty burgers at a Wendy's or McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 With a master's degree in business administration, the 49-year-old Sandelman 
has worked at such nationally known companies as conglomerate Procter & Gamble 
and advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. But the demise of another ad agency 
left him without work in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jobs in senior management then were not easy to find," he said. While looking 
for work, he also took stock of his abilities and his desire to strike out on 
his own in an area that would be fun. He liked the food industry, and he 
figured he was good with details and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The food industry is so competitive," he said. "There are new ad campaigns 
every few months, new menus. It's always changing. I found that exciting." The 
constant changes also meant that fast-food chains, especially, needed a 
continuing stream of information about consumer reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The chains had lost their only inexpensive research tool when a company that 
had been selling local survey results gave up that line of work. In 1988, 
Sandelman stepped in and, with advice from Bob Wisely, then a marketing 
executive for hamburger chain Carl's Jr., launched his fast-track study of 
consumer awareness, usage and attitudes regarding fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 By focusing on a local market and selling the results to the chains or their 
franchisees in that market, Sandelman is able to offer his quarterly reports at 
a low cost. For a year's subscription, he now charges up to $12,000, the amount 
most researchers would charge for just one report that provides similar 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 For an additional fee, Sandelman adds specific questions in any survey that 
particular clients might want. He retains Verity Group in Fullerton to make the 
calls to restaurant patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also started regular consumer surveys on family-style restaurant chains 
like Sizzler and Souplantation and on casual-dining chains like Red Lobster and 
the Olive Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six years, Sandelman & Associates has grown steadily and 
profitably. The company projects revenue of $1 million for this year, Sandelman 
said. Two years ago, his wife, Bev, quit her job helping Carl's Jr. develop 
branch sites to join the company. Then JoAnn Aprati was hired to help with 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to kick the kids out," Bev Sandelman joked about the couple's two 
grown children, "so we could use their bedrooms for offices." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the company incorporated and hired Jeffrey T. Davis to open an 
office in Dallas, where he works to add more markets to the surveys and more 
restaurant chain owners and franchisees to the client list. 
</P>
<P>
 That such an operation would become successful hardly surprises Wisely, now a 
Carl's Jr. franchisee in Santa Rosa. Wisely used to work on such surveys before 
joining the Carl's chain, and he was impressed with Sandelman and his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very bright guy," Wisely said, "and he has become very knowledgeable 
about the business."

COLUMBIA-HCA TO MERGE WITH HEALTHTRUST IN $5.4-BILLION DEAL; HEALTH CARE: 
COLUMBIA IS ALREADY THE NATION'S LARGEST HOSPITAL OPERATOR. THE NEW FIRM WOULD 
HAVE 311 FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corp., the nation's largest hospital company, said 
late Tuesday that it will merge with HealthTrust in a transaction valued at 
$5.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the merger, in which Louisville-based Columbia would pay 0.88 share 
of its stock for each HealthTrust share and assume about $1.8 billion in 
HealthTrust debt, the combined company would own and operate 311 hospitals and 
have about 170,000 employees. Annual revenue of Columbia after the merger would 
exceed $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia said in a statement that the two companies believe the merger will 
allow them to control the cost of providing health care to patients while 
maintaining quality. They said they expect annual savings of about $125 million 
from the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This consolidation will enhance our efforts with physicians and managed-care 
organizations as we together seek cost-efficient, quality results," R. Clayton 
McWhorter, chairman and chief executive of Nashville, Tenn.-based HealthTrust, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 McWhorter would be chairman of the new company. Thomas F. Frist Jr., 
Columbia's current chairman, would be vice chairman, and Richard L. Scott, 
president and chief executive of Columbia, would keep his current positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia and HealthTrust's merger proposal comes during a period of widespread 
consolidation in the health care industry as providers and manufacturers seek 
to remain profitable in the face of efforts to control the growing cost of 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards of the two companies had been meeting on and off for some time 
before agreeing to the merger late Tuesday evening, according to Rosalyn Elton, 
vice president of finance for Columbia.  
</P>
<P>
 Elton said the stock portion of the transaction works out to $3.6 billion 
based on Columbia's closing share price Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia shares ended at $42.75, down 87.5 cents on the New York Stock 
Exchange. HealthTrust shares ended down 37.5 cents at $32 on the NYSE.  
</P>
<P>
 The merger was announced after the close of trading.

AGRIBUSINESS FIRM SUN WORLD FILES FOR PROTECTION UNDER CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sun World, the California produce giant that brought consumers the seedless 
watermelon, has filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. bankruptcy code, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bakersfield-based firm -- known around the world for its patented fruits 
and vegetables -- filed the petition late Monday in federal court in San 
Bernardino. Its parent company, Sun World International, also filed for 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned company is the largest U.S. grower and marketer of 
seedless watermelons and table grapes and the largest U.S. marketer of 
tangerines and mandarin oranges. It is one of the world's largest marketers of 
citrus and California dates. 
</P>
<P>
 John P. Brincko, the new chief executive brought in less than three weeks ago 
to lead the company's restructuring, blamed Sun World's problems on heavy debts 
in farm property and equipment, along with unprofitable crops and money-losing 
joint ventures.  
</P>
<P>
 Brincko is a turnaround specialist who has helped restructure a variety of 
troubled companies, including Knudsen Foods, Foremost Dairies, Globe Securities 
Systems and Omni Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bankruptcy petition will allow the company to continue its 
operations and protect the 1,000 or more growers whose produce is marketed 
through Sun World. Sun World's sales in recent years have hovered around $200 
million annually for more than 70 varieties of fresh produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has essentially been without working capital financing for almost 
a year," Brincko said, "which says something for the strength of the company. 
But you can't go on that way forever and ever. . . . The filing also enables us 
to get some financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Brincko said Caisse de Nationale de Credit Agricole, a large French 
agricultural bank and Sun World's working capital lender, has agreed to provide 
interim financing until a new lender can be found. Sun World's long-term 
lender, John Hancock, is considering more investment in the restructured 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Brincko said growers now sending fruit to Sun World -- mangoes are currently 
being harvested -- will receive full payments for their shipments, but those 
awaiting payments for previous shipments, like other creditors, may not be paid 
in full. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big blow will be to the people that were running their product through 
Sun World," said David L. Moore, president of the Western Growers Assn. " . . . 
Hopefully they will be getting their money." 
</P>
<P>
 Sun World's products include the seedless watermelon, which the company 
introduced to spectacular success in 1988; the DiVine ripe tomato; Superior 
Seedless table grapes, and Black Diamond plums.  
</P>
<P>
 The company, with offices and production facilities in the San Joaquin and 
Coachella valleys and Orange County and marketing throughout the United States 
and 30 foreign countries, provides jobs for 600 full-time and 4,500 seasonal 
employees.

FIXERS' UPPER; 9 MONTHS AFTER QUAKE, VALLEY CONTRACTORS HAVE THEIR HOPED-FOR 
BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daily invasions into the San Fernando Valley by an army of carpenters, 
plumbers, masons and electricians signal that, for small construction and 
repair businesses, the hoped-for boom from the Northridge earthquake has 
finally hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand is so heavy that some customers are waiting months for repairs. Some 
contractors are turning customers away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people are just starting their repairs now," said Robin Bauer, who 
co-owns the small Northridge contracting firm ADB Construction & Installations 
with her husband, Dean. "If no one calls for the next two years, we will still 
be busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Those new customers Bauer is trying to squeeze in must now wait weeks to get 
small jobs done and months for larger ones, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in business comes from homeowners who were held at bay for months by 
lengthy insurance negotiations and pending aid checks from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. With that settled, contractors say, they are 
finally getting hired to attack the big home-repair jobs left by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although calls for free estimates and small emergency fix-ups poured in 
immediately after the Jan. 17 temblor, the major surge for contractors has only 
begun in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lag time when no one was getting money," explained contractor 
John Wurster, owner of John Wurster & Associates Inc. of Calabasas. He said the 
impact of the quake on his business didn't take shape until July, when his 
monthly sales surged 100% compared to the same time last year, and they are 
holding strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Steele, owner of Reseda-based Artisan Concrete, spent the first months 
after the quake in frustration, waiting for the work to come in. "Now it's not 
frustrating," he said. "But there's no time left for personal stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Steele has been working more than 60 hours a week since the earthquake. He 
says his sales this year will be up 30% over last year's, but the downside is 
he has no time to spend with his sons in football practice. And his phone just 
keeps ringing. "We are breaking our backs trying to keep up with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For contractors -- an industry populated by small mom-and-pop companies -- the 
quake-triggered bounty is a reprieve after several bad years. Many had endured 
losses as a result of a slowdown in new home construction and remodeling. Now 
these same firms are turning customers away. Some are working strictly by 
referral, eschewing calls from yellow-page shoppers. Others have abandoned free 
estimates. Small contractors surveyed say their sales have at least doubled 
this year compared to last. 
</P>
<P>
 What's feeding the construction boom is $665 million in Federal Emergency 
Management Agency grants for home repairs, paid out as of Sept. 1, and an 
estimated $7.2 billion in insurance claims still flowing into 
earthquake-affected areas. In addition, about $928 million in earthquake-loss 
loans has been disbursed to homeowners and renters by the Small Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Further fueling the boom are homeowners who find the temptation to remodel 
their quake-damaged homes irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are adding on new bathrooms and new rooms in their houses. We haven't 
seen that since the '80s," said Jim Alexander, vice president of Woodland 
Hills-based William Frankel Plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair boom comes as no surprise to staff members at the area office of 
City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who have learned to keep fraud hot line numbers 
at their fingertips because they are deluged with complaints of contractor 
rip-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it news to the dispatchers at the Devonshire Division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, who field a daily smattering of complaints from 
raw-nerved residents about construction noise. And Ken Knox, senior lead 
officer for the West Valley Division, said contractor fraud and illegal dumping 
are the hot topics at Neighborhood Watch meetings he attends. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to reports of fraudulent and unlicensed operators, officials with 
the Contractors State License Board have conducted numerous sweeps of 
earthquake-hit areas. So far they've cited 65 people for doing construction 
work without a license, an offense that carries a maximum fine of $15,000. 
Another 117 fines have been assessed to contractors who were unable to provide 
proof of workers' compensation insurance, according to Sam Hayne, a spokesman 
for the board. 
</P>
<P>
 More serious offenses, such as taking payments without doing any work, have 
also been rampant. The city attorney's office has prosecuted about 50 cases 
involving earthquake-related contractor fraud, spokesman Mike Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions vary on how long the boom will last. Many contractors say that 
although requests for new jobs may be peaking, they have enough work in the 
pipeline to keep them busy for months, if not years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 85% of earthquake insurance claims have been paid out, according to 
the Western Insurance Information Service, an insurance industry trade group 
based in Los Angeles. Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County 
Economic Development Corp., said there are enough quake repairs remaining to 
tide over contractors until the economy improves and housing construction takes 
off again in 1996 or later. 
</P>
<P>
 Few small contractors are as sanguine. Although revenues at A Straight Line 
Construction Co. are up 75% this year from last and the firm has hired 13 new 
workers, owner John Van Diepen doesn't see the end of hard times.  
</P>
<P>
 "Aerospace workers used to be our fundamental client base. Now our client base 
is earthquake victims. But when this is done, who is it going to be?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a short-lived boom is good enough for Miry Rabinovitch, co-owner with 
husband Ze'ev of Banai Construction in Van Nuys. "We aren't going to be 
millionaires," she said. "But right now we are enjoying not having to worry 
about tomorrow."

JUDGE INDICATES HE'LL NAME A NEW MANAGER FOR TMI FUND; LAWSUIT: TROUBLE-SHOOTER 
DENNIS B. SCHMUCKER WOULD HANDLE MOST OF ITS REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge in Orange County indicated Tuesday that he is going to 
remove nearly all the real estate assets of a $1-billion teachers investment 
fund from the control of its current managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Francisco F. Firmat said at a court hearing in Santa Ana that he will 
appoint a manager to take over more than three quarters of the real estate 
partnerships controlled by Newport Beach-based Teachers Management & Investment 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Firmat said he intends to make the appointment today. Attorneys on both sides 
confirmed that the new manager will be Dennis B. Schmucker, a veteran Southern 
California real estate trouble-shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's action came as part of a civil lawsuit filed in August filed by 
four investors who allege that TMI fraudulently lost $100 million of investment 
funds -- most of it in money invested by teachers for their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has cited evidence of conflict of interest and improper movement of 
funds by the investment company. Maurice B. Shuman and James R. Martin, who 
bought the company in 1987, have denied doing anything wrong or improper. 
Neither Martin nor Shuman would comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Their attorney, David Grant, called Firmat's proposal "a fair resolution for 
the investors. . . . We don't agree with the complaints, but we're willing to 
do what's best for investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Firmat said Tuesday that "an interim management agreement" is nearly completed 
"that I think will resolve the concerns of both sides and preserve the assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Under its terms, Shuman and Martin would keep control of TMI itself and three 
limited partnerships. Schmucker would be appointed to manage 30 of the 
remaining limited partnerships, according to the proposal. Five other 
partnerships are in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmucker would decide whether to restructure, reorganize or sell the 
company's assets and report back to the court next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmucker has handled several high-profile bankruptcy reorganization cases in 
the past 10 years, including those of Pioneer Mortgage in San Diego and 
American Home Mortgage in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman and Martin have maintained that losses on the partnerships resulted 
from a depressed real estate market in California. TMI has raised about $1 
billion from 60,000 California educators since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the plaintiffs in the suit, Kay Seibert of Anaheim, who was in the 
courtroom Tuesday, said she was generally pleased with the proposed plan. "If 
they are going to recover anything," she said of court officials, "this is the 
way to do it. I feel a whole lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Another investor, Steve Gorelick of Northridge, said he too is pleased 
"because an outside person will have more insight." He and his wife, Betty, a 
teacher, have all their retirement funds invested with TMI, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Martin and Shuman would keep control of three partnerships: 
Columbia Square Ltd., which owns 154 acres of land in Santa Barbara County; the 
Parducci Winery, which owns a winery in Mendocino County, and Napa Airport 
Center, which owns 138 acres of land near the city of Napa. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schmucker would have the power to veto decisions made on those 
partnerships, said Ron Rus, attorney for the investors who filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI, which hired teachers to help sell its real estate partnerships to other 
teachers, is insolvent, according to the suit, which sought immediate 
appointment of a receiver to take over the management of the company and its 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Aug. 23, alleges that TMI commingled funds from several 
partnerships into a general account in violation of partnership agreements to 
"conceal the true financial condition of the most distressed of the TMI 
partnerships and . . . perpetuate a false sense of TMI prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges a pattern of "self-dealing" that involved the 
"unauthorized siphoning of millions of dollars in partnership funds to 
affiliated entities" formed by TMI's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Judge Firmat stopped short of appointing a receiver to take over the 
company, he said during a court session Monday that he saw evidence "of 
commingling of funds and conflict of interest." He did not elaborate.

PUBLISHER REED ELSEVIER AGREES TO BUY LEXIS/NEXIS ON-LINE BUSINESS

 Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier said Tuesday that it reached an agreement 
to acquire Mead Corp.'s Lexis/Nexis on-line information operation for $1.5 
billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed Elsevier said it will acquire the assets of Mead Data Central, which 
operates the Lexis/Nexis legal and business publishing business.The acquisition 
also includes Michie Co., a leading U.S. state law publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition is a perfect strategic fit for Reed Elsevier," company 
Chairman Pierre Vinken said in a statement.  
</P>
<P>
 Reed Elsevier will finance the acquisition from surplus cash and $1 billion in 
further borrowings, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mead Data Central unit last year posted an operating profit of $68 million 
on $551 million in revenue, and in the first eight months of this year it 
generated $58 million in operating profit on revenue of $406 million, Reed 
Elsevier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead said earlier that it was selling the publishing operation to focus on its 
core forest products business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that the value of this unique asset has now been successfully 
unlocked for the benefit of Mead shareholders," Mead Chairman Steven Mason said 
in a statement. "This is a time of tremendous opportunity for Mead in the 
forest products industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is subject to U.S. antitrust clearance and is expected to close by 
Dec. 31, the companies said.

REED ELSEVIER AGREES TO BUY LEXIS, NEXIS ON-LINE UNITS; TELECOM: DEAL MEANS 
$1.5 BILLION FOR MEAD CORP., WHICH WANTS TO FOCUS ON MAKING PAPER.

<P>
 Mead Corp. has agreed to sell its Lexis and Nexis database services for $1.5 
billion in cash to Reed Elsevier, a British-Dutch publishing company whose U.S 
properties include Variety and Publishers Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, made late Tuesday, followed nearly five months of bidding 
for Mead Data Central, Mead's information retrieval subsidiary. Mead put the 
unit on the block in May, saying it planned to focus on its core business of 
making paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Lexis, the world's largest legal database, and Nexis, one of the biggest 
news-retrieval services, store and distribute electronic information to more 
than 300,000 clients. The Nexis service contains the archives of thousands of 
publications, including the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition is a perfect strategic fit for Reed Elsevier," Pierre 
Vinken, the company's chairman, said in a statement. "Our strategy emphasizes 
future growth from the English-speaking world, particularly the U.S.A., and 
expansion in subscription-based publishing serving the professional and 
business markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Mead Data Central last year posted an operating profit of $68 million on $551 
million in revenue. In the first eight months of this year, it generated $58 
million in operating profit on revenue of $406 million, Reed Elsevier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts had projected that the company would sell for anywhere from $700 
million to $2 billion. Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times, 
was one of the bidders. Toronto-based Thomson Corp. was also in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed Elsevier is a joint venture of Reed International, a London-based holding 
company, and Elsevier of Amsterdam. The company owns Martindale-Hubbell Law 
Directory and Cahners Publishing, which publishes Variety, the entertainment 
trade magazine; Publishers Weekly, and Design News. 
</P>

 Mead Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Steven C. Mason said proceeds of the 
sale will help the company achieve its goal of increasing shareholder value by 
concentrating on forest products.

 Dayton, Ohio-based Mead is a leading maker of paper, pulp and packaging 
products. It said it will consider using the funds to buy back some stock, 
reduce debt, acquire related companies and improve manufacturing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry analysts had questioned Mead's decision to unload its database 
services at a time when the world is exhibiting a voracious appetite for 
on-line information. But others suggested that Mead's services would have 
eventually lost ground to competitors using newer technologies.

 Lockheed, Martin Marietta Set $100-Million 'Breakup Fee': The aerospace firms 
said either company would get $100 million if the other abandoned their 
$10-billion merger in favor of joining with another suitor.In a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, they also said each has the right to back 
out of the deal if regulators force them to shed significant assets on 
antitrust grounds. Lockheed said it believes that "adequate competition exists" 
to preclude the need for any divestitures. But if the government does require 
such sales as a condition of approving the merger, Lockheed said, "we would 
have to take a serious look at the impact of the request" on the deal.

 Missile Contract Award Challenged: McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it protested 
the Navy's selection of Hughes Aircraft Co. over McDonnell to be the sole 
builder of the Tomahawk cruise missile, a contract valued at more than $1 
billion. A McDonnell spokesman said the protest will enable the company "to 
obtain information so we can get a better understanding of the Navy's decision" 
last month. Hughes called the contest "fair and open" and said the Navy made an 
"appropriate award."

 Carter-Wallace to Retrench: Faced with the collapse of profits from two of its 
key drugs, the New York-based company said it will slash its pharmaceutical 
research and sales staffs and curtail manufacturing. The use of the drugs -- 
Felbatol, an epilepsy medication suspected in 11 deaths, and Organidin, an 
asthma treatment pulled from the market in June -- was called into question by 
the Food and Drug Administration. Analysts said Carter-Wallace Inc. may 
eventually get out of prescription drugs altogether, leaving its future to 
consumer products.

 Cap Cities Interested in Expanding Cable Investments: Capital Cities/ABC Inc. 
would like to explore new cable ventures despite uncertainty about the future 
of the industry, said Robert Iger, new president and chief operating officer of 
the TV and print company. The company already has substantial stakes in ESPN 
and ESPN2, Arts & Entertainment and Lifetime.In a brief comment during a panel 
discussion at an industry forum, Iger listed several stumbling blocks for 
cable: that there are many cable stations already delivering hours of 
programming, that it's not clear demand will increase and that cable's place as 
a distribution channel for programming may be superseded by new methods. Others 
at the forum argued for the primacy of programming over distribution.

 Sematech to Forgo Government Funding: The 7-year-old computer chip research 
consortium is expected to formally announce today that it will give up the $90 
million a year it now gets from the Defense Department by late 1996.The 
consortium will continue its work using corporate funds, which currently 
account for half the consortium's budget. Sematech and its backers -- most of 
the major U.S. chip makers -- indicated earlier this year that they will soon 
give up government funding. Sematech was founded in 1987, when the U.S. chip 
industry was staggering in the face of competition from Japanese companies.

 American Express Will Reportedly Cut Thousands of Jobs: The financial services 
company is beefing up a two-year cost-cutting effort with a plan to eliminate 
more than 4,000 jobs and slash $500 million in expenses, analysts and sources 
close to the company said. The goal is to merge many of the company's global 
operations amid growing competition in the $635-billion credit card 
industry.American Express recently launched a new credit card and pledged to 
introduce more products in coming years to boost market share. The company 
could announce the cuts by the end of the week, a source said, adding that the 
changes are a continuation of a 1992 effort to cut $1 billion in operating 
costs. An American Express spokesman said no decisions had been made.

MCI TO INVEST $30 MILLION TO BUY 20% OF INTERACTIVE CABLE SYSTEMS; 
COMMUNICATIONS: THE MOVE MARKS COMPANY'S FIRST VENTURE INTO CABLE TV.

<P>
 MCI Communications is investing $30 million for 20% of Interactive Cable 
Systems Inc., a private firm that provides local telephone service and wireless 
cable television to apartment houses. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, MCI filed to provide local telephone service in five states as it 
launched its first major effort to enter the $90-billion local telephone 
market.Interactive Cable's Active-Tel local telephone unit will be a 
distributor for MCI long-distance service as part of the investment agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment marks MCI's first venture into cable television, said Kevin 
Inda, a company spokesman. He downplayed that fact. "We don't consider this a 
major investment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive, based in Los Angeles, provides wireless cable TV and telephone 
service in competition with local cable and phone monopolies in more than 20 
states. It has 85,000 cable subscribers and contracts in place to provide local 
telephone service to 20,000 apartment units, according to co-Chairman Andrew 
Adelson. The company also plans to provide security and energy management 
services to apartment dwellers. "The apartment is a very lucrative consumer 
unit that has yet to be exploited properly," Adelson said. He said the 
investment will give MCI "a jump in learning about the cable business."

FUNDING DELAY IS KEEPING SEC FROM FULL POLICING; SECURITIES: THE AGENCY 
SUSPENDED ALL NONESSENTIAL SERVICES AFTER A HOLD WAS PLACED ON A SENATE BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERROL A. COCKFIELD Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Securities and Exchange Commission offices in Los Angeles and around the 
country were largely unable to maintain full policing of the nation's 
securities markets for a second day on Tuesday as the agency's funding was held 
up in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. was forced to suspend all the agency's 
nonessential services Monday, causing a cut in travel expenses and subsequently 
delaying examinations of mutual funds, brokerages and investment advisers. 
Investigations are normally conducted by SEC lawyers, but the agency's workers 
have been confined to their desks since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the SEC regional office in Los Angeles, examiners were forced to reschedule 
appointments and postpone program work, administrator Elaine M. Cacheris said. 
"We're doing our best to keep our programs functioning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources told the Associated Press that Sens. Orrin Hatch 
(R-Utah) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) had ordered a hold placed on a bill 
to provide full funding for the SEC. Senate and SEC staff members, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, told the AP that the two senators were attempting to 
place an unrelated tax amendment on the bill, which has been approved by the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt sent a letter to the Senate on Tuesday citing problems at his agency 
since the hold was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am deeply distressed that the interests of U.S. investors and U.S. 
corporations are being jeopardized because (the bill) has not yet been approved 
by the Senate," Levitt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt said in his letter that six SEC staff members were forced to return 
from the examination of a brokerage firm in Tennessee and that the inspection 
of a $250-million investment adviser was canceled, both within a 24-hour 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding hold also resulted in reduction of the fees the SEC collects when 
companies register stocks and bonds with the government, amounting to a daily 
loss of $740,000. The money usually goes to the federal Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC also said it will have to discontinue Edgar, its popular electronic 
filing system, by Oct. 11 if funding is not restored. That action would affect 
3,400 companies that depend heavily on the system for corporate filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $305 million requested by the SEC for the 1995 fiscal year, Congress 
has appropriated only $125 million because of a dispute between House Democrats 
and Senate Republicans over whether the SEC should be self-funded through its 
own fees.

DETROIT'S BIG 3 POST STRONG SEPTEMBER SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Big Three domestic auto makers said Tuesday that September sales were 
nearly 10% ahead of a year ago, prompting company officials to again predict a 
strong finish for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more room there to grow," said General Motors Corp. Executive Vice 
President William Hoglund after the company reported car sales 22.3% higher 
than in September last year and an increase of 4.8% in light-truck sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co.'s sales of cars and trucks rose a combined 7.8% higher over a 
year ago. Chrysler Corp. was up slightly overall, but its car sales lost ground 
against last year for the fifth month in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had several plants closed down as we've retooled for new models," said 
Thomas J. Osborn, director of sales and marketing operations planning at 
Chrysler. The auto makers are launching most 1995 models this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Several new, high-volume cars and trucks are expected to keep the market hot 
through fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to pent-up demand and great new product, the current market is 
being driven by relatively cheap and readily available credit, plus aggressive 
lease deals," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile 
Dealers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford retook the lead in September in the race for bragging rights to the 
country's best-selling car. In August, the Honda Accord had passed Ford's 
Taurus, but Taurus rebounded with a strong September and was leading Accord for 
the year's first nine months by about 2,300 sales. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. sales by the industry as a whole were 7.3% ahead of September, 1993.

 GM Reorganizes Car-Making Units: The shuffling will place Saturn under the 
same operating group as the rest of the General Motors Corp. small-car 
operations.The company's mid-size cars will be aligned with its large luxury 
car segment. The company said the changes are evolutionary and designed to help 
the recovering auto maker lower costs further and develop new vehicles more 
quickly. For Saturn, the restructuring means future models may evolve from 
other GM divisions and that those vehicles could use many of the same parts 
used in GM's other small cars. Company officials downplayed the potential 
effect on Saturn's autonomy.

company has agreed to hire new workers at an Ohio transmission plant to settle 
complaints about production speedups and heavy overtime. A strike at the Toledo 
Powertrain Plant was averted when General Motors Corp. agreed Monday night to 
hire 125 employees, said Ed McNulty, bargaining chairman for United Auto 
Workers Local 14, which represents 4,100 people at the plant.GM also agreed to 
address safety issues at the Toledo facility, McNulty said. The plant builds 
transmissions for 11 U.S. and five foreign assembly plants. The new workers 
will be the first permanent factory hires for GM since 1986.

INDICATORS' GAIN BIGGEST IN 5 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government's main economic forecasting gauge had its strongest showing in 
five months during August, a sign of sustained growth that could mean higher 
interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Tuesday that its index of leading economic 
indicators surged 0.6% in August, the 13th straight month without a decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, 1993, the barometer has risen 10 times and remained unchanged 
three times. It held steady this July after two months of small gains. The last 
time it rose more than August was in March, when it jumped 0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a good momentum in the economy," said economist Roger Brinner of 
DRI-McGraw Hill, a forecasting service in Lexington, Mass. The index "is 
consistent with a stream of news." 
</P>
<P>
 The August advance in the index was nearly across the board as nine of the 11 
components showed improvement. Factory orders for consumer goods led the way, 
followed by slower business delivery times that usually are a sign of rising 
orders and fewer weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing were stock prices, raw materials prices, consumer expectations, 
the average workweek, business orders for plant and equipment and building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The only negatives were a lower money supply and fewer unfilled orders for 
durable goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts are looking to Friday's unemployment report for further signs that 
the economy may be reaching the limit of its ability to expand without 
inflation. The jobless rate is 6.1%, which some analysts consider close to full 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, which has raised interest rates five times since 
February, pays particular attention to the job market for signs of worker 
shortages that could lead to higher wages and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee to boost 
rates to 5.25%, a half-point rise, when the policy-making group next meets Nov. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 But some say they believe Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was handed authority by 
the committee last month to move sooner if conditions warrant. Index of Leading

SENATE CONFIRMS TIGERT'S NOMINATION TO HEAD THE FDIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ricki Tigert can take the yellow ribbon off her law office door. The Senate 
finally confirmed her nomination to be chairwoman of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her law partners hung the ribbon as a show of sympathy and support after her 
nomination became ensnarled in Whitewater politics eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans had held up the 49-year-old banking attorney's nomination to force 
Democrats to hold hearings on President Clinton's Whitewater investments in 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-one hours of Senate hearings were conducted. But opponents, led by 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, the Banking Committee's senior Republican, 
then argued that it was inappropriate for a Clinton friend to head a regulatory 
agency involved in the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Tigert agreed to remove herself from any Whitewater-related 
decisions if confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-7 vote approving Tigert's nomination came after the Senate averted a 
threatened Republican filibuster 63 to 32, with seven Republicans joining 56 
Democrats in voting to limit debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigert becomes the first woman to head a federal banking agency and takes over 
an FDIC board that has been without a confirmed chairman since the August, 
1992, death of William Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigert was nominated 11 months ago and was recommended 17 to 1 by the Senate 
Banking Committee in February. Republicans had blocked a vote by the full 
Senate in the intervening months. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC insures $2.5 trillion deposited in banks and savings institutions. It 
also serves as the primary federal regulator of the 8,800 smaller 
state-chartered banks that aren't members of the Federal Reserve System. 
</P>
<P>
 As she begins her five-year term, Tigert will face the task of shrinking the 
FDIC, which had expanded rapidly to handle the hundreds of banks that failed in 
the late 1980s and early 1990s. It has about 12,000 employees and a $2-billion 
budget.

 Troll Company Makes Koosh Deal: The creator of the popular Koosh toys has sold 
the company to a New Jersey company that makes troll dolls.Russ Berrie & Co. 
announced this week that it has purchased Oddzon Products for an undisclosed 
price and plans to continue selling the products under the same name. Oddzon 
nets about $30 million annually in revenue on the sale of the popular, 
no-bounce balls made of spaghetti-thin rubber strands, in addition to several 
other spinoff toys. Analysts said Oddzon's market stability may help Russ 
Berrie overcome losses it suffered after its initially popular troll dolls 
fizzled. The $300-million company also designs and sells stuffed animals, 
picture frames and novelty gifts.

LATEST FRAGRANCE COMES IN NEW PUMP DISPENSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look out, Chanel. Some of the latest French fragrances are not being sold at 
fancy boutiques, but at the gas pump. 
</P>
<P>
 French drivers can now pull up their Peugeots to the pump and fill up with 
gasoline that smells more like vanilla than fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The French oil company Total began offering vanilla-scented gasoline and 
lemony diesel fuel in recent months as part of a campaign to eliminate the 
unpleasant odor associated with fuel, company spokeswoman Claire Vielot said. 
Total has since decided to play up its perfumed product through 
tongue-in-cheek, scratch-and-sniff advertisements in several women's magazines, 
including Elle. The ads, modeled after perfume publicity, display the four 
different grades of fine-smelling fuel in elegant, crystal bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 The scented fuel was concocted in response to a survey of 240 Total customers 
that revealed 41% of men and 74% of women disliked the smell of gasoline, 
Vielot said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our idea was to eliminate the scent of gasoline, not to create a perfumed 
gasoline," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after extensive research matching up scents with the differing fuel 
grades, a representative panel of Total customers chose a "fruity vanilla" and 
a lemony scent to grace their gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a follow-up survey, customers' noses were happy. More than 50% of 
the customers questioned said their gas smelled better, without the strong odor 
normally associated with gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the fuel is available at only a handful of stations around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Although first to create scented gasoline, Total follows in the sweet-smelling 
trail of French oil company Elf Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Elf invented a type of "biomask" to hide the strong smell of their diesel 
fuels and oil as early as 1990, said Elf spokesman Thomas Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
 The biomask hides most of the displeasing diesel odor, but the fuel still 
smells like fuel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Elf, experience in creating good smells comes naturally. The company owns 
the pharmaceutical company Sanofi, a major player in the global perfume 
industry. Sanofi produces scents for Yves Saint Laurent, Van Cleef & Arpels, 
and Oscar de la Renta, among others.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW FALLS 45 ON NEW INFLATION FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks were hammered in a broad-based selloff Tuesday as new signs of economic 
strength -- and fears of higher inflation -- pushed bond yields up again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average tumbled 45.76 points to 3,801.13, its lowest close 
since Aug. 23. Worse, the broad market was slammed much harder than the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers swamped winners by 17 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, and most 
stock indexes suffered bigger declines than the Dow's 1.2% loss. The Standard & 
Poor's 500, for example, sank 1.6%; the Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller 
stocks plunged 1.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading was heavy at 336 million shares on the NYSE, another sign of 
investors' discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market opened higher, but that sentiment grew increasingly 
sour as the day wore on, and selling ballooned. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's report Tuesday that its key economic forecasting gauge rose 
in August at the fastest rate in five months set the tone, fueling new concerns 
about higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of recent strong auto and retail store sales released late in the day 
added to the picture of a surging economy, further spooking investors, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields, which have been rising sharply since mid-September, edged up 
again on Tuesday. The 30-year Treasury bond yield reached a new 27-month high 
of 7.88%, up from 7.85% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists now believe that the Federal Reserve Board may have to raise 
short-term interest rates again, perhaps as early as Friday, to cool the 
economy. The government will report September employment data on Friday, and 
faster-than-expected job growth could send inflation fears rocketing unless the 
Fed acts, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts said the stock market was hurt by more than interest rate 
concerns on Tuesday. In the afternoon, Wall Street was hit by reports, later 
denied, that House Speaker Thomas Foley supported putting off a vote to 
implement the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT -- the most 
important new world trade treaty in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. delay on GATT could have negative ramifications for markets worldwide, 
analysts say, because the assumption of freer trade has been one of the key 
pillars supporting stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial shares leading the Dow lower included Alcoa, off 1 3/8 to 84 1/2; 
GM, off 1 1/8 to 45 1/8; International Paper, down 1 1/4 to 77 7/8; and Union 
Carbide, which slumped 1 3/8 to 32 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have pushed many industrial issues higher in recent months, but the 
market may now fear that another Fed credit-tightening move will threaten to 
tip the economy into recession sometime in 1995, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industrial stocks losing ground included Dow Chemical, down 3 1/8 to 74 
1/8; Georgia-Pacific, down 1 1/4 to 75 5/8; and Nucor, off 6 to 63 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many technology stocks continued their recent selloff. Cyrix tumbled 4 3/8 
to 38, Intel slumped 2 1/4 to 58, Advanced Micro Devices sank 1 3/8 to 25 1/8 
and Hewlett-Packard dropped 2 1/8 to 84 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some interest-rate-sensitive stocks dropped sharply. First Chicago sank 2 to 
43 5/8, Travelers lost 1 1/8 to 31 1/2 and Golden West Financial gave up 1 1/8 
to 38 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, L.A. Gear fell 3/4 to 7 after the shoe maker said 
third-quarter earnings declined in part because of excess inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, pipe-maker Ameron fell 1 1/8 to 32 3/8 after slumping 2 1/2 on Monday. 
The company reported higher quarterly earnings on Tuesday, but one brokerage 
reduced its earnings estimates, which Ameron said were too high all along. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's few big gainers was drug firm Marion Merrell Dow, up 2 1/4 
to 26 on renewed takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 London's FTSE 100 index rebounded 18.3 points to 3,001.8, but Frankfurt's DAX 
30 lost 16.8 points to 1,994.95. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average lost 81.42 points 
to 19,568.61. Mexico City's Bolsa index eased 15.99 points to 2,670.02.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: PG&E AND EDISON STOCKS GENERATE SHIFT IN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid extremely heavy trading in shares of Pacific Gas & Electric and in 
Southern California Edison parent SCEcorp on Monday, a large investor is 
rumored to have cashed in PG&E stock to buy SCE. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable Wall Street traders named that investor as Los Angeles-based 
Capital Group, the giant mutual fund company considered to be one of the 
country's savviest market players. 
</P>
<P>
 By exchanging shares in PG&E (which serves Northern California) for SCE (which 
serves much of the Southland), it's doubtful Capital Group would be making any 
judgment about either stock's short-term prospects. That's because the firm 
tends to be a very long-term investor. Nonetheless, Capital obviously sees some 
kind of merit in SCE stock, which has been one of the worst-battered utility 
shares over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's trading, 7.3 million shares of PG&E changed hands, making it the 
most active New York Stock Exchange issue. The same day, 4.4 million shares of 
SCE traded.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the volume in both stocks Monday occurred in single mammoth "block" 
trades -- a 5.7-million-share block of PG&E, and a 3.1-million-share block of 
SCE -- and both of those blocks were handled by brokerage First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong indication that the seller of one block was the buyer of the other 
was that both blocks crossed the market within five minutes of each other. PG&E 
stock fell 87.5 cents to $21.875 on Monday, while SCE shares rose 50 cents to 
$13.375. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital Group, as is its policy, declined to discuss its trading. But traders 
and analysts believe that Capital decided to reduce its huge stake in PG&E, 
which totaled 15 million shares as of spring, and take a substantial position 
in SCE. Until now, Capital has owned little of SCE. 
</P>
<P>
 Both stocks have suffered the double whammy of surging market interest rates 
and mounting competitive worries this year. Higher rates have depressed all 
utility stocks, driving their dividend yields up. But the competition issue has 
been more pronounced in California than in many other states, because 
regulators here have suggested a bold plan to allow big electricity consumers 
to choose any power source by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly responding to prospects for dramatically increased competition -- which 
naturally could crimp earnings -- SCE in June slashed its annual dividend from 
$1.42 a share to $1. The stock, in turn, has plummeted from its all-time high 
of $25.75 in 1993 to $13.25 now, a 48.5% drop. 
</P>
<P>
 PG&E, meanwhile, has collapsed from a peak of $36.75 in 1993 to $21.75 now, a 
drop of 40.8%. That decline occurred even though PG&E increased its annual 
dividend this year -- from $1.88 a share to $1.96. What's more, PG&E continues 
to insist that it sees no reason to cut the dividend anytime soon, even with 
greater competition looming. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's rough treatment of PG&E stock, however, suggests that many 
investors believe a dividend cut is inevitable. At the current stock price, the 
dividend yield on PG&E is a whopping 9.0%. That contrasts with a 7.5% yield on 
SCE stock. If PG&E were to cut its dividend, the yield would decline 
automatically. Thus, by pricing the stock to yield 9.0% now, the market may 
already be factoring in a lower dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the future of open competition for electric consumers in California 
is far from decided (regulators will be weighing alternatives well into 1995), 
Wall Street sees PG&E burdened under any scenario by its Diablo Canyon nuclear 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how quickly PG&E decides to write off the cost of that facility, 
earnings could be penalized by 30 cents to 60 cents a share, each year, for six 
to 12 years, says analyst Barry Abramson at Prudential Securities in New York. 
Even with such huge write-offs, he says, PG&E might be able to preserve its 
current dividend. "But they're not going to be raising the dividend for a long 
time to come," Abramson contends. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, SCE -- having already bitten the bullet and cut its 
dividend -- now is in position to begin raising it again, if slowly, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wall Street's rumor mill is on target, Capital Group, at least, has decided 
that the risk versus potential reward in deeply depressed SCE stock must rival 
or exceed that of PG&E stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's worth remembering that there were buyers on the other side of 
the PG&E stock block as well. If the dividend isn't cut, and if interest rates 
eventually come down, PG&E's stock recovery could be dramatic. But those are 
two "ifs" for which the market won't yet give PG&E the benefit of the doubt.

GOLDMAN REPORTEDLY PLANNING STAFF CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goldman, Sachs & Co. is considering cutting 5% or more of its staff in the 
next several weeks amid declining profit, a source close to the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest investment banking partnership may pare more than 400 of 
its 9,200 jobs, said the insider, who did not want to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of Goldman's possible cuts come three weeks after Chairman Stephen 
Friedman said he would step down at the end of November, when the firm's fiscal 
year ends. He will be replaced by Jon Corzine, co-head of the firm's 
fixed-income division. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the cuts are expected to come from support staff and fixed-income 
operations, Associated Press reported. Goldman, one of the most profitable 
firms on Wall Street, is considering the cutbacks during year-end performance 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fixed income is the major line of business these days," said John Keefe, an 
independent analyst who follows Wall Street. "It makes sense that is going to 
be the first thing to expand and contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street profits are suffering their worst decline since 1990 because the 
end of the three-year bond rally caused trading profits and underwriting fees 
to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms such as Merrill Lynch & Co., Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., CS First Boston 
and PaineWebber Group Inc. have dismissed employees because of declining 
business. General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit is expected to 
announce hundreds of job cuts as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman earned $446 million in the first half of fiscal 1994, a decline of 68% 
from a year earlier, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc. Profit in the 
second quarter ended May 27 fell 91% to $64 million.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; NEW SIGNS OF STRENGTH SPUR A SELLOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks were hammered in a broad-based selloff Tuesday as new signs of strength 
in the economy added to mounting fears of rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.76 points to 3,801.13. The stock 
market's best-known barometer has fallen more than 150 points since hitting its 
recent high of 3,953.88 on Sept. 15. Broader market barometers also plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of strong auto and retail store sales released late in the day added 
to the picture of a surging economy, further spooking investors about inflation 
and giving stock prices another downward shove. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline went across the board, with declining issues outnumbering gainers 
by about 13 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was a hefty 336.12 
million shares, up from 278.43 million on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the news boosted the yield on the 
Treasury's key long bond to 7.88%, the highest since June, 1992. It closed at 
7.85% on Monday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 11/32 
point, or $3.44 for every $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising bond rates pushed the dollar lower against the German mark. 
However, the U.S. currency held its value against the Japanese yen. In New 
York, the dollar closed at 1.546 German marks, down from 1.554 marks on Monday. 
The U.S. currency closed at 99.63 Japanese yen, up from 99.58 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong September sales of cars and light trucks offered the latest indication 
that the economy is showing no signs of cooling off. In addition, Johnson 
Redbook Service reported that U.S. retail store sales rose 2.3% on a seasonally 
adjusted basis in September, compared to the month-earlier level. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Commerce Department said its key economic forecasting gauge 
rose in August at the fastest rate in five months. The Index of Leading 
Indicators, which is supposed to forecast economic trends six to nine months 
ahead, climbed by 0.6% in August after being flat in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Good economic news has been bad for stocks lately because investors are 
concerned that the Federal Reserve will give interest rates another boost to 
cool the economy. The Fed has already raised rates five times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A morning of mild price changes gave way to a sharp slide midday. 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat economic data has led many investors to think that the Federal 
Reserve may not wait until its next meeting in November to raise rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said a strong September jobs report Friday could be enough to prompt 
a rate increase by the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The semiconductor and other technology stocks were especially hard-hit in the 
selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite, weighted with technology stocks, plunged 13.58 points to 
close at 747.30. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cyrix Corp. fell 4 3/8 to 38, clipped by a Cowen & Co. downgrade. Intel 
Corp. dropped 2 1/4 to 58, Advanced Micro Devices sank 1 3/8 to 25 1/8 and 
Texas Instruments lost 2 1/8 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Express rose 1/4 to 30 1/4 in heavy trading. The company said a 
review of its cost structure was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marion Merrell Dow gained 2 1/4 to 26 on renewed speculation that the drug 
company might be a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 * Landmark Graphics dropped 6 1/8 to 17 1/8 after saying its earnings and 
revenues for the quarter ended Sept. 30 would be below Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Gear fell 3/4 to 7 after the clothing maker said third-quarter earnings 
declined on an increased proportion of children's products sales and excess 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks ended mixed. In London, the Financial Times 100-share average 
rebounded 18.3 points to 3,001.8. Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average retreated to 
1,994.95, down 16.8 points on the day. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average 
ended down 81.42 points to 19,568.61, and Mexico City's dropped 15.99 points to 
2,670.02 points. Interest Rates

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; INTERACTIVE MEDIA 
PUBLICATIONS SLUG IT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The billions of dollars allegedly to be made in building the information 
superhighway remain but a gleam in the eyes of computer, telephone and cable 
television companies. But for one group of businesses -- publishers, trade show 
operators and others involved in "marketing/communications" -- the game has 
already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a slick weekly trade magazine called Interactive Age made its 
debut, and it will be joined next week by an equally well-financed competitor, 
Interactive Week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Electronics Industries Assn. announced that it was canceling 
an interactive technology trade show scheduled for next year, having lost out 
to a competing show scheduled for the same weekend. Still on the calendar this 
month alone are Multimedia Expo, Hollywood 2000 and Defining the Electronic 
Consumer III. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous newsletters are slugging it out too. And public relations firms are 
starting "interactive divisions" with an abandon that seems at times to outpace 
the pool of potential clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care whether the telephone companies are more successful than the 
cable companies who are more successful than the wireless companies," says 
Interactive Week publisher Jack Dolce. "It doesn't even matter to us at the 
moment that true interactivity is not taking place. What is of concern to us is 
that tons of money is being spent by all of them to position themselves, and to 
do that they have to market and they have to advertise." 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the emerging multimedia industry can continue to support the 
surfeit of marketing opportunities, panel discussions and reading material 
being dumped upon it is unclear. Many are already burned out on information 
about the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like, 'No! Not another magazine!' " says Cecilia Ceccone of the Writers 
Guild of America's interactive division, upon being handed a free copy of 
Interactive Age earlier this week. Ceccone was one of about 100 attendees at 
"Interface VIII," an interactive media seminar held Tuesday at the Beverly 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Herd, executive director of the Hollywood Radio & Television Society, the 
co-sponsor of the seminar, blamed the plethora of similar events for 
lower-than-expected attendance. "I'd think people would be falling out of the 
windows for something like this," Herd says. "But there are so many forums like 
this now." 
</P>
<P>
 That is apparently what the Electronic Industries Assn. decided when it 
announced Tuesday that it was canceling its planned interactive show, scheduled 
in Philadelphia on the same dates in May that the new Electronic Entertainment 
Expo was to take place in Los Angeles. Key exhibitors such as Sega of America 
had decided not to go east. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like it was more tearing the industry apart than anything else," 
said EIA spokeswoman Cynthia Upson. 
</P>
<P>
 The new interactive magazines will be entering a market currently 
well-populated with newsletters -- such as Digital Media, Interactive Content 
and the recently deceased Technology & Media -- and with special sections of 
established publications such as Advertising Age and Variety.  
</P>
<P>
 Interactive Age Publisher Chuck Martin says there will be room for both trade 
publications with the easily confused names. A product of CMP Publications 
Inc., which publishes Communications Week, Home PC and a number of other trade 
papers, the magazine -- initially a monthly -- is aimed at businesses and has a 
base circulation of 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the already-tortured history of the two fledgling magazines, it is not 
surprising that Interactive Week's Dolce disagrees. He and three other former 
CMP executives now working for Interactive Enterprises -- a start-up with 
backing from CMP's archrival, Ziff-Davis Publishing -- are targets of a 
$5-million CMP lawsuit accusing them of breach of contract and misappropriation 
of confidential information.  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in competition -- fair competition. But we cannot let CMP and its 
people be taken advantage of," CMP President Michael Leeds wrote in a memo 
distributed to all CMP employees in August, explaining why the firm is suing 
its former employees, now housed in an office a few towns away from CMP's 
headquarters on Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, Leeds says Dolce and the others were involved in developing the 
plans for CMP's interactive magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Retorts Dolce: "Until we announced Interactive Week, Michael Leeds didn't have 
the vaguest idea of what the interactive market was. There should not be two 
newspapers in this market."  
</P>
<P>
 Dolce says his business plan calls for the publication to start making money 
in 1996. But that will depend in part on what happens to its backer, 
Ziff-Davis, which is currently up for sale. CMP's Martin will say only that the 
company plans to spend "what it takes" to successfully launch Interactive Age. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a grudge war," says Louis Rosetto, publisher of Wired, the hot 
consumer-oriented digital 'zine. 
</P>
<P>
 "CMP vs. Ziff Davis. Is there room for two? I don't know, but I know I'll only 
read one."

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: 
COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; SHOCKING CLAIMS ABOUT BATTERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Dell Computer Corp. bragged a few weeks ago that the battery in one of 
its new Latitude notebook computers lasted 17 hours and 5 minutes in an 
independent lab test, I was intrigued. Short battery life, after all, is the 
proverbial Achilles' heel of mobile computing, and Dell was saying it had 
essentially solved the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I had the opportunity to test two of the color models in the Latitude XP 
family, and in both cases the fancy new lithium ion batteries died in less than 
three hours. False advertising? Well, not exactly. But as I soon learned, 
battery life remains a vexing problem, and a definitive solution is nowhere in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, I should also say that Dell appears to have gained at least a 
temporary lead in the hotly contested battery-life race. The company chose to 
make longer battery life a central feature of its re-entry into the notebook 
computer market -- it had been forced to pull out last year after a string of 
failed products -- and the results are impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Dell line ranges in price from a $1,399 black-and-white model with a 
33-megahertz 486SX microprocessor to a $5,000-plus fully configured 
active-matrix color Latitude XP with a 100-MHz 486DX4 microprocessor and a 
whopping 524 megabytes of hard disk storage. 
</P>
<P>
 All machines have built-in 3.5-inch floppy drives and full-size keys. The 
screens measure about 9.5 inches diagonally, which is just fine for Windows 
software. They also have a comfortable palm rest and a central track ball below 
the space bar, much like the original Macintosh PowerBook -- a design I prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 The most original feature, though, is the lithium ion battery technology, 
which is also used in some Toshiba laptops. The main advantage of lithium ion 
batteries is that they weigh about a third less than other batteries of the 
same capacity and don't have the re-charging difficulties of nickel metal 
hydride and nickel cadmium batteries, the main alternatives. The disadvantage 
is cost: Dell prices the lithium ion battery at $199, compared to $99 for a 
nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery. (Nickel cadmium batteries are even 
cheaper, but Dell does not use them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now what about this 17-hour life span? For help, I turned to Marc Abrams, 
special projects manager at VeriTest Inc. in Santa Monica, the independent lab 
that had tested the Dell notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17 hours didn't really represent a typical user, Abrams explained. That 
result was just one from a series of different tests, and it was performed on a 
50-MHz model with passive-matrix color screen, which uses less power than 
active-matrix color. The test scenario basically represented someone who turned 
the machine on and left it on all day, but mostly with the lid closed and not 
in use. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell achieved such astounding results because its power management system 
draws far less power when the computer is in "sleep" mode than any computer 
previously seen at VeriTest: It draws just 10 milliamps of power, compared to 
the previous champion miser, IBM's ThinkPad, which draws 50 milliamps. Abrams 
noted that some cheap off-brand notebooks don't have a sleep mode at all and 
merely blank the screen while continuing to draw up to one amp from the 
battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Many machines, including the ThinkPad color computer, also cheat on 
performance by reducing screen brightness when operating on the battery. That's 
a good way for anyone to extend battery life, because the screen is the biggest 
power drain, but I'd rather have the option of trading a bright screen for 
shorter endurance. The Dell Latitude XP models I tested showed the same 
brightness whether I was on battery power or had the AC line plugged in. 
</P>
<P>
 I did my own tests with a software program from DiagSoft Inc., part of is 
PowerMeter performance-testing software, which worked the computer harder than 
users normally would. I ran the test with all power management disabled, which 
prevented the computer from shutting down the hard drive, central processing 
unit or screen. And the program itself recorded the time on the hard disk every 
five seconds, which is more disk exercise than would normally occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The VeriTest measures, by contrast, use a mechanical gadget, Keyboard Annie, 
which is programmed to type a series of real keystrokes into real Windows 
programs, with periodic bursts of activity and pauses, just the way most people 
actually work. 
</P>
<P>
 So how long will the Dell notebooks with lithium ion batteries actually run? 
They lasted longer than any other make VeriTest has examined. According to 
Abrams, "You really can fly across the country with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what kind of portable computer you have, there are ways to eke 
out a few more minutes from your batteries, according to Abrams. Reducing 
screen brightness as much as possible is a good start. So is minimizing use of 
the floppy drive. Another, counter-intuitive way is to make sure you have at 
least eight megabytes of RAM if you use Windows. Although the extra RAM uses a 
little extra energy, the additional hard disk access that Windows needs when 
running with only four megabytes of RAM uses even more. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the hard drive has no effect on battery drain, according to 
Abrams. Faster microprocessors do take more energy than slower ones, but the 
speed might let you finish your work more quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest step you can take, though, is choosing the correct type of screen 
at the outset. Color active-matrix screens are nice (though expensive), and 
either color or monochrome active-matrix is all but essential if you intend to 
work on your patio or anywhere else with bright sunlight. But your battery will 
last a lot longer with passive-matrix. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever your choice, the Dell machines should do you well. At six pounds plus 
a small AC adapter, either of the machines I tested is light enough not to be a 
bother carrying over my shoulder through long airport concourses -- even with 
an extra battery.

 Eight years ago, Kenneth Kaplan got an offer to sell his software company, 
Microware Systems Corp., to Microsoft Corp., which was already well on its way 
to dominating the personal computer software industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty tempting," said Kaplan, the firm's president and a co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
 But one late night a short time later, a Microware executive "slammed his hand 
on the table and said, 'I don't want to work for the blankety-blanks. I want to 
destroy the blankety-blanks,' " Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been our policy ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft is still trying to break into Microware's business, making programs 
that run computerized functions of things that are not typically thought of as 
a computer -- like a TV, pay phone, traffic light or a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Their growing rivalry, despite its David vs. Goliath nature, is a sign of how 
computing is changing. In time, many products will have chips and software 
running inside them, and most people won't notice or think of them as 
computers. Microware hopes to be a standard-setter in program design for those 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The company gained attention last winter when one of its programs, called 
David, was chosen as the software for set-top devices in the interactive TV 
services that Bell Atlantic Corp. will start this winter in northern Virginia, 
New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Such set-top boxes are the key appliances that let TVs receive the advanced 
home shopping or video-on-demand services that phone and cable companies 
envision. 
</P>
<P>
 Microware has also formed a similar agreement with Nynex. Kaplan said he hopes 
to announce arrangements with at least two more regional Bell phone companies 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company suffered its first loss last month when Southwestern Bell Corp. 
chose Microsoft and Lockheed Corp. as its partners for a two-way TV trial in 
suburban Dallas late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft is developing a full-network program for use in both the switching 
centers and the homes and businesses at the end of a network. Microware's 
software is more flexible, with the set-top box being one of many uses for it. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of Microware's lead is that David has been licensed by 22 
manufacturers, including IBM, Philips Consumer Electronics, GoldStar and 
Samsung. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a version of Microware's core OS-9 operating system, developed 
in the early 1980s as a speedy way for a computer chip to manage simultaneous 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 750 companies have put OS-9 in more than 4,000 products, ranging 
from the CERN particle accelerator (an atom smasher) to pay phones in France.  
</P>
<P>
 Such applications account for about 70% of Microware's approximately $20 
million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive TV is by far Microware's biggest opportunity since Kaplan and 
friend Larry Crane started the firm in 1977 when they were students at nearby 
Drake University. Kaplan predicts annual revenue could grow to between $100 
million and $200 million in 1999.

FORUM; THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING/TECHNOLOGY/INNOVATION; CAN UNIVERSAL SERVICE 
BE PRESERVED IN INFORMATION AGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New communications technologies, ranging from on-line computer services to 
wireless telephones to interactive television, are undermining an idea that has 
long been a part of U.S. communications policy: universal service. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Ma Bell monopoly subsidized basic local phone service to make it 
widely accessible, and some of those subsidies are still built into telephone 
rate structures.Similarly, broadcast television, bankrolled by advertisers, can 
be received by more than 90% of U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition and new technology, however, have made such subsidies hard to 
sustain. But the idea behind universal service -- that it's virtually 
impossible to participate fully in society without access to basic 
communications -- is more relevant than ever. Some argue that the concept of 
universal service must be extended to a wide range of emerging electronic 
information services, perhaps by requiring companies to provide free or 
discounted service to schools and other public sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications legislation that recently died in Congress would have 
addressed some of those issues, but not all of them. The Cutting Edge is 
interested in your views. Should emerging telecommunications providers give 
subsidies to low-income consumers, or can the free market be counted on to make 
these services affordable to all? How should such subsidies be provided? Should 
the principle of universal service be extended to new electronic information 
services, and if so, by what mechanism? 
</P>
<P>
 Send electronic mail to edge@news.latimes.com or fax responses to (213) 
237-7837, or mail to The Cutting Edge, Business Section, Los Angeles Times, 
Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles, CA 90053. Please keep your comments as 
concise as possible and include your name and telephone number. We will print a 
selection of responses next week.

 For the derogatory term air head substitute gas head , and you will have a 
fitting description of what may become the brain of future optical computers. 
In a paper published recently in the British science journal Nature, a team of 
USC physicists describe a device that could function as a central processing 
unit consisting of nothing more than a thin glass cell filled with cesium gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Optical computers use light rather than electrical signals to process 
information. In principle, they can run many times faster than today's 
computers because they operate at the speed of light. And for pattern 
recognition, they are much more adept than electronic computers because they 
compare patterns simultaneously rather than in one after the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesium gas is extremely sensitive to light, making it a useful element in an 
optical processor. Say you had an aerial photograph of a battlefield and wanted 
to determine how many tanks were in the photo. Projecting one laser beam 
containing the information from the photo and another from a picture of a tank 
would change the frequency of the cesium electrons wherever there was a match. 
</P>
<P>
 A third beam coming from behind scatters off the image, creating bright spots 
where there is an overlap. Because the cesium vapor responds quickly to these 
low-power beams of incoming light, the prototype developed by the USC team 
performed computations in 30 nanoseconds (30 billionths of a second). Other 
materials now used require several billion times as much power input and 
therefore can perform the calculation only 10 times per second. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Assistant: Tired of having to place a number of calls from that 
airport telephone booth just to be sure you've gotten all your e-mail messages 
and voice messages, then make follow-up calls while precariously balancing your 
Rolodex? How about asking your Wildfire Electronic Assistant for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The brainchild of Wildfire Communications of Lexington, Mass., the device is 
the first telephone-based electronic assistant that interacts with harried 
mobile professionals through voice commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do you have to carry it with you. The Pentium-based computer system that 
runs Wildfire is installed at your office and connected to the public telephone 
network by a high-speed T-1 connection. A built-in database stores user and 
system information, and the operating system enables the software to use 
speech-recognition hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 The system recognizes each caller by name and knows exactly where to find 
information relating to that caller. It maintains a list of telephone numbers 
so the user can "voice dial" outgoing calls simply by asking for a person by 
name. Wildfire screens calls and routes important ones to your hotel room or 
car phone. And it will schedule follow-up calls -- all through voice commands. 
But none of this comes cheap: The system will begin shipping in January at a 
price of $46,850.

 Seeing Eyes: For photographers, the camera is an extension of the human eye. 
But researchers also want to photograph the inside of the living human eye with 
as much detail as possible as an aid to treating eye diseases. This week, 
scientists at the University of Rochester in New York announced that they have 
taken the sharpest pictures yet of the eye's cones -- the photoreceptors that 
allow us to detect color and see clearly during the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rochester scientists shined a low-power beam of yellow light from a dye 
laser through the pupil and onto the retina, the screen inside the eyeball that 
captures light signals and transmits them to the brain. The retina, which is 
packed with photoreceptors, reflected the light back to a special electronic 
camera outside the eye that is many times more sensitive than photographic 
film. In contrast to the 10-micron structures that the instruments your eye 
doctor uses can see, the team was able to see individual cones about three 
microns wide. Seeing these individual cones could help doctors detect or treat 
several types of eye disease, including age-related macular degeneration, the 
leading cause of blindness in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Guiding Lights: Like lighthouses of old, modern-day beacons will eventually 
guide Japanese drivers through the rough waters of traffic jams. Japan's 
National Police Agency has come up with a system called a Universal Traffic 
Management System, which it intends to deploy in traffic-clogged Tokyo in early 
1996. One feature of the system, now on trial in Kanagawa Prefecture south of 
Tokyo, is to change the intervals between signal changes, depending on the 
amount of traffic. Optical sensors along main roads and at crossings would 
detect the speed of passing cars and beam that information via FM transmitters 
to control centers. Based on the information, the centers decide the frequency 
of signal changes.

 Fuel Misers: After five years of setting the pace in the fuel economy race, 
the Geo Metro's reign is over. 
</P>
<P>
 At 56 miles per gallon on the freeway and 47 in city driving, the Honda Civic 
hatchback is the stingiest gasoline miser on the road among 1995 model cars, 
the federal Environmental Protection Agency reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cars and light trucks tested by the EPA were in a range of 18 to 
29 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving. But Irvine-based 
Mazda Motor America Inc. had two winners: the Mazda Protege, at 34 mpg, was the 
least thirsty compact, and the Mazda 626, at 29 mpg, had the best performance 
among mid-size autos. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-based American Suzuki Motor Corp. also got good reviews from the EPA: The 
soon-to-be-discontinued Suzuki Samurai, at 29 mpg, and Suzuki Sidekick, at 27 
mpg, were the most fuel-efficient light trucks.

 Irvine Apartment Communities said Tuesday that it has bought parcels of land 
in Irvine and Tustin for a total of $10.6 million and plans to build apartment 
complexes on the two properties.

 The Newport Beach real estate investment trust, formed last year by Irvine 
Co., said it will build 378 units on the 15-acre Santa Clara site in the 
Westpark section of Irvine and 436 units on the 18-acre Rancho Monterey site in 
Tustin Ranch.

<P>
 Irvine Apartment Communities purchased and began construction on two apartment 
sites in Irvine earlier this year and said it intends to buy one more site in 
addition to the two announced Tuesday. Its goal for the year, the company said, 
is to begin construction on a total of 2,200 apartments.

 "We are optimistic about the Orange County economy," said Richard E. Moran 
Jr., executive vice president of the real estate trust. "We think there will 
continue to be demand for apartments as the economy stabilizes and grows." 
</P>

 Construction at the Santa Clara and Rancho Monterey sites is underway, and the 
first of the three-story walk-up apartments will be ready for tenants in the 
first quarter of 1995, the company said. Both developments are to be completed 
within 18 months.

FRENCH WINEMAKERS EXPECT 1994 TO BE A VERY GOOD YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 France's winemakers are in a heady mood over this year's harvest, predicting 
it will yield a vintage of high quality but only average quantity. That result, 
they say, could herald strong demand and a slight upward pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the best-known wine regions, growers and producers pleased about 1994 
are savoring the prospect of memorable wines at stable or slightly higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are happy men," Hubert Bouteiller of the Bordeaux Wine Council said last 
month. "At the moment, the conditions for harvest are exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
 A hot summer with much sun and just the right amount of rainfall has produced 
an early-maturing harvest from Bordeaux to Burgundy and Beaujolais, from 
Champagne to the Rhone, wine industry experts report. 
</P>
<P>
 Definitive evaluations, of course, will be made only after the grapes are 
picked, crushed, fermented and put into casks and bottles. But growers and 
producers have already conducted laboratory tests on the grapes as they near 
maturity. Winemakers acknowledge that they tend to be optimistic about each 
successive vintage at this time of year, but they say this year's harvest is of 
unusually uniform -- and high -- quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grapes have a good taste and they are fleshy, and the state of health of 
the vines is remarkable -- all the characteristics for a good year," Bouteiller 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Though he was speaking only of Bordeaux, home to some of France's finest red 
wines as well as the sweet white Sauternes, his words were echoed by experts 
from other prestige regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burgundy, source of some of the world's most costly and elegant wines, 
"everything is going well," said wine industry chemist Odile Meurgeus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are entirely optimistic about both whites and reds, and for the Cote d'Or 
as well as the Cote de Beaune," she added in a telephone interview from Beaune, 
referring to the region's two priciest growing zones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quality is very uniform, quantity is average, weather conditions continue to 
be favorable and there are no signs of disease on the vines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearby Beaujolais region, home of the fruity red wines that are 
typically drunk young -- often within months of the harvest -- 1994 will be of 
"high quality," the region's wine board said in a statement. "Maturity is 
excellent and the state of health of the vines appears exceptionally good." 
</P>
<P>
 In Champagne, where prices have tumbled on weak demand in recent years, 
growers and producers are optimistic about emerging from the doldrums this 
year. "We have high hopes for a lovely harvest," Champagne board director Andre 
Enders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields will be big enough to allow for a rigorous selection of grapes destined 
for those bottles bearing a vintage year, Enders said. Vintage champagne is 
produced only in the best years. Most champagne bottles bear no year on their 
labels, consisting as they do of blends of several years' harvests.

FOUNDERS SMILING AT SUCCESS OF ALL-NATURAL TOOTHPASTE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1960s, it was parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. Today, it's cinnamon, 
sage, lemongrass and fennel-toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes from Tom's of Maine, the tiny company biting into larger 
corporations' market share of the $1.5-billion toothpaste industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, say the company and analysts: a winning combination, especially 
for Baby Boomer customers, of all-natural products and the firm's donations to 
environmental and social justice causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who says capitalism must be as it's been practiced?" co-founder and president 
Tom Chappell told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many natural products never make it out of health food stores, too esoteric 
for average consumers. Thanks to aggressive marketing, Tom's, based in 
Kennebunk, Maine, started wiggling its way onto drugstore and supermarket 
shelves alongside Colgate, Crest and other "normal" pastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years and a billion tubes after it was launched during the "Age of 
Aquarius," the flower child of toothpastes sells $10 million to $12 million 
annually, the vast majority of Tom's total sales of $15 million to $20 million. 
Its 250 all-natural products include shampoo, deodorant and mouthwash. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, Tom's has grabbed a 0.7% market share away from more established 
competitors like Proctor & Gamble. In major markets such as New York, Boston 
and the Rockies, the company claims the share is between 2% and 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-haired, folk-singing Chappell and wife Kate founded the company in 1970 
to put a non-phosphate detergent on the market. But they found their herbal 
toothpaste -- first made in old milk pasteurizing cans and today in a one-room 
"factory" -- a better seller. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tom's healthy recipe -- no additives, dyes or sugars -- consumers also 
get conscience. No animal products are used or testing on animals is done. And 
Tom's gives 10% of pretax profits to groups such as the Rainforest Alliance.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a capitalist. I'm a product of a capitalist society," said the former 
employee benefits counselor for Aetna Life Insurance. "But I want to make 
capitalism accountable to its communities, people and environment." The company 
grew 20% to 30% annually between 1988 and 1993 before hitting a snag last year. 
The firm, trying to stay within its "no animals" creed by replacing petroleum

NEW ZEALAND'S BEST NOT YET SERVED; MARKET: THE COUNTRY IS EMERGING AS THE NEXT 
LOW-COST, HIGH-QUALITY WINE OF CHOICE FOR AMERICANS. SAUVIGNON BLANC IS 
EXPECTED TO BE ITS SPECIALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This nation's young wine industry has sprung from anonymity to international 
acclaim in the space of a generation, and experts believe the best is yet to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Following on the surge of imports from Australia, New Zealand wines are 
scheduled to become the newest low-cost, high-quality reds and whites to grace 
American tables. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a story that began with European immigrants, who felt it was possible to 
grow more than grass on South Pacific shores spanning latitudes as broad as 
North Germany to North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The early days featured plantings of Muller Thurgau grapes sold in cardboard 
boxes to a protected domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
 Boom in the 1970s turned to bust in the 1980s before a deregulated industry 
emerged, focused on exports of good value wines, mostly to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The star variety now is Sauvignon Blanc, described by one enthusiastic British 
wine retailer as "like bungee-jumping into a bottomless pit full of gooseberry 
leaves while strapped to (Australian supermodel) Elle Macpherson." 
</P>
<P>
 The retailer liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is a bright, straw-colored drop with lively 
acidity and a herbaceous character. North Island versions have a melon or 
honeysuckle flavor, and they are expected to sell in U.S. wine stores for $7.75 
to $15.50 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Zealand wine industry has come from nowhere in 25 years to challenge 
the established wisdom of what is good in the wine world, but how good is New 
Zealand wine? 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago we were at the top of the fourth division or bottom of the 
third division and we are now probably in the premier division," John Buck, 
chairman of the Wine Institute of New Zealand, told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in the top four, but we're closing in." 
</P>
<P>
 The ingredients for New Zealand wine's growing respect were a good and varied 
climate, a lack of history that freed winemakers from tradition, food 
technology skills borrowed from the dairy industry and a willingness to 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buck believes most commentators still miss the point about New Zealand 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sauvignon Blanc," he said, "is a stepping stone in an evolving wine industry. 
. . . If you are brutally honest, it is a cash-generator." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was like a white Beaujolais or up-market Muller Thurgau, with a 
short maturation period, short turnaround and high yields. It was appropriate 
for a young industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wineries who have done well out of it are now investing in cabernet and 
pinot-based reds and methode champenoise ," Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is where the next wave of quality will come from, as early as the 1995 
vintage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wine writer Vic Williams sees the bubble eventually bursting worldwide on 
Sauvignon Blanc, with the future lying in grapes like Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (Riesling) is perceived as being slightly sweet, but in New Zealand we 
seem to be able to balance that with enough acid to give it zing in your 
mouth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, poor yields in recent years mean New Zealand is 
struggling to meet demand for its wine. 
</P>
<P>
 New Zealand wine exports rose sevenfold between 1987 and 1993 and the industry 
is seeking a further threefold increase to NZ$100 million ($60 million) in 
value by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports now account for nearly 21% of total wine production.

OSTRICHIZED; NEIGHBORS CHEER EVICTION EDICT, CALL CHATSWORTH MAN'S FLOCK FOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Siding with ruffled neighbors, a Los Angeles zoning panel Tuesday ordered the 
owner of a Chatsworth estate to get rid of his 800 or so ostriches and emus, 
calling the big, flightless fowl a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals was a victory for about 30 
neighbors in Monteria Estates who complained to the panel about odors, dust and 
airborne feathers that they blame on the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell is there and it comes from one source: 800 animals urinating and 
defecating," longtime neighbor Warren Berlinger told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently moved by the complaints, the board took the unusual step of 
ignoring a recommendation by a zoning administrator to limit to 195 the number 
of ostriches -- the largest and strongest birds in the world -- and emus -- a 
similar but slightly smaller Australian creature. Instead the panel voted to 
banish all the flightless birds from the seven-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a majority of the people in that area who cannot live there 
(comfortably) and that is not fair," said panel member Chris Kezios. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision will not put an end to the year-old dispute. Jay S. Bulmash, 
attorney for the owner of the estate, David Mohilef, said he plans to appeal, 
either to the City Council or to a court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulmash said the panel has no right to make such a decision, because the board 
can impose restrictions only on commercial properties. He argued that the 
estate is a private "aviary," not a business, and was granted a city permit to 
operate as such in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence before you that we are a commercial venture," he said, 
prompting snickers and disapproving comments from neighbors in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began about a year ago in Monteria Estates, a gated community of 
very expensive houses in northern Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohilef hired scientists and others to buttress his arguments that his 
agriculture-zoned property was clean and safe and that there was no proof that 
his birds were creating the problems. But his neighbors persisted, complaining 
to city officials and hiring their own lawyers in their battle to oust the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 After a contentious hearing in July, Associate Zoning Administrator Daniel 
Green recommended the 195-bird limit. He imposed no restrictions on the other 
200 or so farm animals, such as goats, on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohilef appealed Green's decision to the zoning board. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bulmash said the ranch is used only to raise and study the birds, 
Green said he suspects Mohilef is profiting from sales of the birds or their 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said ostrich meat, feathers and skin are in high demand and the 
oversized eggs are selling for as much as $3,000 each. "This is a cash cow," he 
said. "It's a lucrative business." 
</P>
<P>
 At least half the hearing was spent taking testimony from 17 angry neighbors 
who said the odors and dust caused by the birds are making their lives 
miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor played a tape recording for the panel of a high-pitched squealing 
that he said was the sound of emus mating at 1 a.m. on a recent Saturday 
morning. "I can't sleep at night," the neighbor said. "I literally can't sleep 
at night." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most common complaint concerned odors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stench is unbearable," said Gordon Lester, who has lived near the site 
for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stench makes you want to throw up," said another neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said dried bird droppings blow onto nearby trees and bushes and into 
swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "How in the name of fair play and common sense can these conditions be allowed 
to continue?" asked Thomas Beeler, who said he has lived 30 feet from the 
property since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision, Greg Butts, whose property adjoins Mohilef's, said he was 
pleased with the ruling but fears that an appeal by Mohilef will only drag the 
dispute on longer without a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised if it takes another year," he said.

TILT TRAIN ACES LOCAL AUDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The train from Spain rode smoothly (but not all that quickly) through the 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech, Spanish-made Talgo train, which is designed to tilt into curves 
to maintain speed, glided through the first of its exhibition runs Tuesday 
along Metrolink's Santa Clarita line. Commonly used on Spanish National 
Railways and other rail lines in Europe, the Talgo handles with ease curves 
that require traditional trains to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 This should have been cause to celebrate in north Los Angeles County, where 
the winding tracks have been blamed for the almost 1 3/4-hour commute from 
Lancaster in the Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Talgo took the curves like butter, the many scheduled stops along 
this route kept the train from achieving anything near its cruising speed of 
more than 125 m.p.h. It instead traveled at about 80 m.p.h., or only slightly 
faster than Metrolink trains now in use on that run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Metrolink officials said they were impressed by the train's technology and 
might be able to make good use of it on routes that do not have so many stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the highest quality trains in the world, both in comfort and 
technology," said Richard Stanger, Metrolink executive director. "I think the 
tilt-train technology that allows higher speed is inevitable in Southern 
California, (but) not necessarily along the Metrolink lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly's Transportation 
Committee, said there is a "huge opportunity" for high-speed rail in Southern 
California because it can improve public transportation while using existing 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tuesday ride was only for officials and members of the press. Regular 
passengers can try it on the same route today and on the Los Angeles-San Diego 
Metrolink run Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who take it will probably enjoy the ride. Talgo might not be much faster 
than Metrolink, but it's undeniably more luxurious. 
</P>
<P>
 While each double-deck Metrolink car carries 145 passengers, Talgo cars carry 
a maximum of 36 in recliner seats with fold-down trays, magazine pouches and 
overhead reading lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Talgo car has three video monitors mounted on the ceiling and positioned 
so at least one is visible from every seat. For a snack, passengers have a 
choice between a casual diner and a more formal dining car. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do dental work here, too," quipped one passenger Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the differences between Metrolink and Talgo cars stem from their 
differing day-to-day functions. Unlike Metrolink cars, the Talgo models are 
used mostly on long-distance routes with relatively few stops. 
</P>
<P>
 One potential problem for passengers susceptible to motion sickness is that 
Talgo's elevated suspension can produce a rolling motion similar to what is 
felt on the deck of a ship. At least one of the passengers Tuesday said she 
felt slightly nauseated. 
</P>
<P>
 Talgo is not the first tilt train to get a local tryout. Last year Southern 
Pacific tested a Swedish-made model on its Santa Barbara-Moorpark route. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to try Talgo for themselves, it departs today from Los 
Angeles at 9:02 a.m., arriving at the Acton Metrolink station at 10:38. It 
leaves Acton at 11 to return to Los Angeles at 12:33 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, it leaves Los Angeles at 9:40 a.m., arriving at the San Diego 
station at 12:38 p.m. It departs San Diego at 1:30 to return to Los Angeles at 
4:55 p.m.

'EPICENTER U.' CAPTURES EARTHQUAKE AFTERMATH; EDUCATION: CSUN FILM STUDENTS' 
WORK DOCUMENTS FRUSTRATION, ANXIETY AND HOPE THAT FOLLOWED THE DEVASTATING 
TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They knew the genre well -- how to light the scene starkly and set the camera 
low to achieve an ominous, bigger-than-life effect. But the film students 
figured the only disaster they would ever shoot would begin and end on a 
Hollywood sound stage.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, an earthquake came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months after the Jan. 17 temblor laid their classrooms low, Cal State 
Northridge film students and their professor are putting the final touches on a 
bittersweet project: a documentary film on the Northridge quake that left them 
out of school and out of their homes, shaken and mourning the loss of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Aptly titled "Epicenter U.," the 16-millimeter film is a quirky mix of 
disaster and academia, of therapy and movie-making, of rubble and rising from 
it. "It's painful to be in an earthquake, but it's a joy to make a film about 
it," said professor and producer Alexis Krasilovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 A documentary filmmaker of 20 years, Krasilovsky began "Epicenter U." before 
the earth had settled back into itself that Monday morning. When the appliances 
stopped toppling at her Silver Lake home, she calmed her shaken, but safe, 
6-year-old son and allowed herself a moment of contemplation over their close 
call with a 14-foot bookshelf. Then she ran for her movie camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings were coming down, flames were rising up, and the filmmaker's 
instinct took over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like salivating," she said. "It was a Pavlovian reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 When her class met next, Krasilovsky asked how many of her students' homes had 
been damaged. Most students raised their exhausted hands, and shooting began in 
earnest despite far more pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A scene with Salvador Morales is dark and shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 He stands against a chain-link fence, a crumbling apartment complex behind 
him. He speaks in jagged sentences. "This is the building where I live . . . 
yellow-tagged. I have to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 The setting changes, more rubble. Morales has moved inside his apartment, 
pulling at a shard of sheet rock. "They looted my apartment. They stole my 
piano. I couldn't believe it, because it's a heavy piano . . . I don't care 
about what I lost, but you kind of lose faith in the human race." 
</P>
<P>
 Working on both sides of the camera, Morales joined the cast and crew of 
"Epicenter U." after delaying his own student film. 
</P>
<P>
 The most costly natural disaster in U.S. history was a startling and strange 
event that demanded documentation, he said. For while looters stole his 1910 
upright and his art-major wife's paintings, other people ran into the street to 
help neighbors they'd never met. The good, the bad and the fantastic was 
unfolding before his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedicated to the memory of CSUN students Manuel Sandoval and Jaime Reyes, 
among the 16 killed when the Northridge Meadows Apartments complex collapsed, 
the film concentrates on the earthquake's effects on the university and its 
students. But, as all good filmmakers know, keeping the focus of the story 
tight helps make the theme universal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film is dealing with emotions that come out of all natural disasters," 
said executive producer Deborah Abrams, a former student of Krasilovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it's not just students who have gotten involved. Many in the film 
industry experienced the quake as well, and have offered invaluable support so 
the shoestring production will be ready for a premiere on the quake's first 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 They've donated editing equipment, cameras, film, lighting. A man at a 
production shop wouldn't accept Krasilovsky's check for his work on the 
soundtrack. His Woodland Hills home was demolished, he told her, and he wanted 
only a copy of the finished film as payment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Editor Amy Tompkins gave up better-paying feature film work for the rest of 
the year to splice together the footage. Some of it is raw and overexposed, she 
said, lending a unique feel to the piece, a sense that shaken young filmmakers 
are simultaneously learning their craft and documenting their scattered lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very endearing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the credits roll, the passionate voice of civil rights activist 
and former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young sounds. It is his commencement speech 
given June 6 to those who graduated despite the quake: "You've been blessed by 
having been born in difficult times. Go and . . . contribute these blessings." 
</P>
<P>
 As Young's voice fades, a grinning graduate runs in slow-motion toward the 
camera, his mortarboard in place, tassel swinging.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; CITY RESTRICTIONS ON OUTDOOR MALL EASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Rinda Plaza in Mission Hills, which has prompted complaints about a 
cruising problem for months, won a reprieve Tuesday from a city crackdown 
because of the shopping center management's efforts to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunwest Property Management, which runs the outdoor mall in the 14700 block of 
Rinaldi Street, successfully appealed some city-imposed restrictions on the 
mall's operation at a hearing before the city's Board of Zoning Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good hearing," said Stephen Chan, director of Sunwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The board allowed mall stores to stay open past 9:30 p.m. and compromised with 
mall management on the removal of public telephones and the hiring of three 
armed security guards.  
</P>
<P>
 Chan has complied with most of the several conditions the city imposed on the 
mall in July, including the adding of gates at five of the eight entrances and 
asking mall tenants to close early on Sundays. In addition, he has given the 
Los Angeles Police Department a rent-free substation at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, police and neighbors said Tuesday, is a reduction in the cruisers 
who frequented the mall for years each Sunday night, disturbing neighbors with 
traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like Mr. Chan is really trying to work with us," said Hilda Ramirez, 
a member of a neighborhood watch group formed in February to deal with the 
cruising issue. "We're very happy with the progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of hiring three armed guards, as instructed earlier by the city, the 
Board of Zoning Appeals allowed Chan to employ two uniformed, unarmed guards to 
patrol the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan argued that an armed guard would raise insurance costs for the plaza if a 
shooting occurred and was unnecessary with the addition of the police 
substation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan also reached a compromise with the board to allow merchants to stay open 
until 10 p.m., past the 9:30 p.m. curfew demanded by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And the board agreed to allow the mall to keep the five public pay phones, 
which Chan argued were needed for emergencies. But the phones must be altered 
so that they are unable to take incoming calls, limit callers' time on the 
phone to 15 minutes and, if that does not discourage drug dealing, to add 
surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Chan must work out an improved lighting plan for the parking lot with 
city officials by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will review the impact of the conditions at the mall in 90 
days. Meanwhile, officials in the city of San Fernando, where part of the mall 
is located, will hold a public hearing on Oct. 17 to consider whether to adopt 
the conditions imposed by the city of Los Angeles. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; KVCM TUNING UP FOR LISTENERS OFF CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mark Brower learned that the Valley College radio station would be 
broadcasting off campus for the first time this semester, the last place he 
thought he would be looking for music was his mother's closet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the broadcast student, who is acting as KVCM's station manager, soon 
learned that there are more adjustments than just changing a dial when going to 
the big time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first started by playing elevator music," Brower said of KVCM's first 
broadcasts on United Artists Cable Channel 15, a community affairs channel. 
"I'm not a big Barbra Streisand or Neil Diamond fan. I had to sneak the records 
from my mom." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, KVCM had played rock and pop music. Now, the 35-year-old, 
student-run station is heard on both Channel 15 and radio station 830 AM from 7 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were many lessons to learn with the expansion to a new, larger 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable subscribers were accustomed to listening to the "elevator music," as 
Brower, 19, called it, that accompanied the public service announcements on 
Channel 15. So, instructor Ray O. Wilson had his students play plenty of Neil 
Diamond and Barbra Streisand while they slowly phased in rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of 'dos' and 'don'ts,' " Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important lesson came Monday when the station broadcast a 
word that Wilson and others deemed offensive to lesbians during a public 
service announcement about a march planned by a gay and lesbian group. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the announcement also included smacking sounds that were 
"inappropriate" for the audience. Later, he whisked disc jockey Rich Rhodes 
from behind the microphone to defend the broadcast before a classroom of fellow 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes, 33, who did not make the announcement himself, became incensed, 
gathered up his tapes and stormed out of the station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich is extremely mad and I doubt he will be back," Brower said. "That's 
unfortunate. He's one of our best DJs. But the guy who was doing the PSA 
(public service announcement) was not in the broadcast department and is not 
supposed to be on the air. Rich put him on the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Another student, who asked not to be identified, said Wilson overreacted. 
"It's not easy being a DJ here," the student said. "Wilson blows up a lot. . . 
. Wilson took Rich too far." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson believes students should be taken to task for what they do on the 
air. "That's part of the broadcast department -- learning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and his students hope to work together to educate the cable television 
audience to happenings at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to announcements about college sporting events and activities, 
Wilson hopes the station can interest high school students who may later attend 
Valley College by airing television interviews with high school coaches, and, 
later, high school sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a reason to get people to stop switching channels and 
listen," said Wilson. "And Valley high school students don't have their own 
station." JEFF SCHNAUFER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; TRAIN DEATHS AFFECT 
OTHERS AS WELL AS VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every time someone ends it all by jumping in front of a speeding Metrolink 
train, every time a reckless motorist or unwary pedestrian gets smashed by a 
locomotive, Edward Pederson has to look at the results. 
</P>
<P>
 As safety manager for Metrolink, Pederson is responsible for educating the 
public about the dangers of the tracks and enforcing track rules. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also in charge of in-house investigations of train-track deaths, which 
start with him looking for what's left of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people don't respect the train tracks, that's my bottom line," 
Pederson said. "A death doesn't just affect one life, it affects other people's 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Metrolink service began in 1992, 30 people have died on the rails, with 
12 deaths classified as suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is usually a fatal miscalculation, Pederson said. Someone sees a 
crossing gate coming down and thinks he can drive around it before the train 
gets there. Or someone thinks that any convenient place to cross the tracks is 
as good as any marked crossing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Trains are unpredictable," Pederson said. "They can come on either track at 
any time. We try to make people aware of the fact that tracks are for trains, 
not people." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attempt to challenge the trains will lose, he said. A Metrolink 
locomotive weighs 132 tons. Each car comes in at about 96 tons. Average train 
length is four cars and one locomotive -- or more than 500 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if an engineer sees a stalled car or unaware person on the tracks, at 
Metrolink's average speed of 60 m.p.h., it can take more than a third of a mile 
to stop, Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson recalls his most troubling cases: a grandfather, daughter and 
granddaughter in Glendale who died taking a shortcut across the tracks; a 
bicyclist in Sunland, who thought he could make it around the closed gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gates were down for a reason, the lights were going, the crossing was 
making a noise for a reason, but he decided he could beat the train and went 
around for whatever reason," Pederson said. "Why? And I'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the suicides. All the educating in the world about track safety 
won't stop those who want to die in dramatic fashion in front of a train. What 
they don't consider, he said, are the other people they affect: the engineer 
who feels helpless, the witnesses who feel traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Pederson recalled, a 30-year-old man leapt in front of a 
train within view of a schoolyard full of children. "There are other ways to 
deal with that pain, to deal with that anger he might have had," Pederson said. 
"He took it out on other people." 
</P>
<P>
 After each death, Pederson heads to the scene to find out if required 
procedures were followed, if the engineer blew the train whistle, if the 
engine's headlights were on, if crossing gates worked properly. 
</P>
<P>
 He interviews the crews and engineer to see if anyone needs counseling and, if 
there is any suspicion, orders immediate drug and alcohol tests for the train 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson also tries to see if there is anything Metrolink can learn from the 
incident, or any way to modify the track area -- such as putting up new 
barriers or gates -- that would lessen the chances for future accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of tugs at you," said Pederson, who worked in a hospital emergency 
room for 10 years as a registered nurse. "I look at how the engineer is 
affected, because he saw what happened and he feels helpless. How does the 
engineer deal with that, not only today but next week and next year?" 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of Pederson's job is working to prevent train deaths. He runs 
programs for children, teaching them to "Look, listen and live."  
</P>
<P>
 Adult promotions encourage people not to "pick a fight with a heavyweight." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a 0% accident rate, if there was a 0% injury rate, then I 
wouldn't have a job," Pederson said. "But unfortunately human nature and 
accident rates tell me that I'm going to have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Dismally far into the future, it appears.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; MERCHANT'S SLAYING STUNS NEIGHBORHOOD

<P>
 After arsonists burned down Samuel Zekarias' convenience store during the 1992 
riots, he and his wife thought they had weathered the worst crisis they could 
imagine in their adopted country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had stayed burned," his sister-in-law, Yeshi Robinson, said 
Tuesday. "If it had stayed burned, he would still be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday morning, the 46-year-old Ethiopian immigrant was shot and killed 
by a man who robbed his 7-Eleven store at 4930 W. Pico Blvd. The gunman escaped 
with an undisclosed amount of money and is still at large, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zekarias was a businessman, he cared about more than making a buck, 
friends say. He used to give food to drifters who came to his store, and 
contributed time and money to neighborhood causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say Zekarias seemed to provide the sunshine in their quiet Lake View 
Terrace neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was part of the reason why everyone enjoyed living on this street," said 
neighbor Sandy Hubbard. "Before I even knew who he was, he'd wave, say 'Hi, how 
are you, what's going on in your life?' He was so friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Brkic, who lives across the street, said she and other neighbors were 
shocked that crime, for so long a threatening but abstract concept, had claimed 
one of their neighbors. The incident makes her consider leaving Los Angeles, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be getting worse and worse instead of better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zekarias and his wife, Emebeth Haile, 39, came to Los Angeles in 1972. They 
have a daughter, Lydia, now 12, and both studied for a time at Southwest 
College in Los Angeles, before working a series of jobs. Somehow, they scraped 
together the cash to buy their house and in 1987 the 7-Eleven franchise on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The store had been robbed twice before, but Zekarias just handed over the 
money and nothing worse happened, said Robinson, Haile's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest incident, a 25-year-old clerk was with Zekarias when the robber 
entered the store, flashed his gun and demanded money, according to police. 
After emptying the cash register, the man ordered the merchant to open the 
store safe. When Zekarias explained that the safe is programmed to open only at 
certain times, the man shot him, according to Detective L.J. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The store clerk was not injured, Jones said. The detective said that as far as 
he knows, Zekarias and the clerk offered no resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for suspects who rob these types of locations to without 
provocation shoot and kill their witnesses," Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 Southland Corp., the parent company of 7-Eleven, has offered a $25,000 reward 
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Zekarias' killer. 
Police described the killer as African American, 33 to 35 years old, clothed in 
a black jacket, blue T-shirt and dark pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident seems particularly senseless to Zekarias' neighbors since it 
claimed the life of someone who gave so much to the community. Recently, 
Zekarias sat in on a meeting between city officials and neighbors where 
residents expressed their concerns about the Lopez Canyon Landfill.  
</P>
<P>
 He has also stuffed envelopes, handed out flyers and contributed money to the 
fight to close the dump, and he has campaigned for other issues, said Hubbard, 
president of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always working to make the quality of life here better," she said. KAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FIREFIGHTERS OFFER READINESS SEMINAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department, mindful of the widespread destruction 
brought by last year's wildfires, is planning a special seminar to educate area 
homeowners on steps they can take to protect their property. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first-of-its-kind seminar, firefighters will demonstrate equipment 
available to defend residents' homes from heat and flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the firestorm, the whole industry and fire-protection service mind-set 
has changed," Fire Inspector Michael Chuck said. "This is the first time we've 
shown the public what's available." 
</P>
<P>
 The expo, on Oct. 15 in the Agoura Hills City Hall parking lot, will be free 
and will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. For information, call the Fire Department 
at (213) 881-2411. 
</P>
<P>
 The department will still hold to its policy of evacuating residents in cases 
in which out-of-control fires threaten lives, Chuck said. The new emphasis, he 
said, is on helping homeowners better prepare their residences against fire 
before they are forced to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 One example, he said, is special heat resistant blankets that can be draped 
over residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Automatic sprinkler systems, which can be laced with a special foam to make 
them more effective, are available, he said. There also are special pumps that 
draw water from swimming pools to fight flames for situations in which 
firefighters are unable to get their equipment into out-of-the-way places. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most effective technique, according to fire officials, is clearing 
all brush and combustible materials within a 30-foot radius of residences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without that defensible space -- even if you have a fire engine sitting in 
your driveway -- they are not going to be able to protect your house," Chuck 
said. Residences with a 30-foot cleared space "have a 96% chance of surviving 
the wildfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials warn homeowners not to be complacent -- especially those 
who live in areas that were spared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were extremely fortunate (in Agoura Hills)" said Scott Brewer, director of 
the city's Disaster Response Team. "But what that means is we have another 
year's growth on the vegetation on our hillsides. We are even more primed now."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; AIRPORT PICKS FIRM FOR SEISMIC RETROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank Airport Authority has awarded a half-million-dollar contract to a 
local firm to retrofit its main terminal to meet seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport commissioners voted unanimously Monday to hire Burbank-based Wm. 
Christian Co. to reinforce the airport's Terminal A to comply with the city 
building code.The company submitted the lowest bid at $383,095, but is 
authorized to spend up to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport was advised in June that it had to conduct a structural analysis 
of its main terminal and then retrofit or demolish the building. The airport 
had previously declined in 1991 to carry out the study, saying the terminal was 
"probably substantially in compliance already" with building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials told the Airport Authority that the airport was not exempt. 
Retrofitting is to be completed by March, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In question are a few brick columns inside the terminal, which must be bolted 
to the roof and floor. Officials in June estimated that retrofitting would cost 
millions of dollars, but staff estimates eventually put the project at about 
$550,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the building is not fully up to seismic standards, the terminal 
escaped damage in the Northridge earthquake. Only Terminal B and the airport's 
parking structure suffered damage in the temblor. HENRY CHU

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; THEATER'S SEATS RUN AFOUL OF CITY CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening night for the third season of Glendale's resident Shakespearean drama 
company is expected to take place tonight as planned with a performance of 
"King Lear," but not without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because A Noise Within, which stages classic plays in a 99-seat theater 
on the third floor of the historic Masonic Temple building at 234 S. Brand 
Blvd., mistakenly went ahead with city-funded renovation of its quarters 
without permits, officials said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials became aware of the mistake in recent weeks and hurriedly 
approved most of the work, including a temporary wooden stage and new roofing. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, officials said that before the theater opens its doors 
tonight, it must remove a tiered wooden platform on which the seats are 
arranged because it is considered a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will leave the audience situated head-to-head and the only people who 
will be able to view the performance will be those sitting in the first two 
rows of the theater," said Susan Boyd, a member of the theater's board of 
directors. "Obviously, that is a major concern to us from a subscriber 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater company is renovating its space in the building with a 
$2.5-million loan it received earlier this year from the Glendale Redevelopment 
Agency. But it has run into trouble of late for proceeding with the job without 
first seeking approval from the city's Historic Preservation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the commission held an emergency meeting to review a fire 
sprinkler system that had already been installed in the theater. The sprinklers 
were approved by the commission and then by the City Council, but the 
commission held another emergency meeting Monday when questions arose as to 
whether the the roofing work, stage and seating platform met city codes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they worked hurriedly to avoid forcing the theater to 
postpone opening night. A Noise Within, along with the Alex Theater, Glendale 
Center Theatre and another stage company moving into Glendale, is part of an 
emerging theater district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people say city government people don't do anything out of the 
ordinary," said city Planning Director John McKenna, "(but) many staff members 
spent an inordinate amount of time to get this thing done." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David Ramsay said building inspectors will go to the Masonic 
Temple today to make sure the seating platform has been removed. Meanwhile, 
Boyd said A Noise Within's building committee will meet with its contractor to 
try to find a way to have tiered seating in the hall without violating city 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members said they sympathize with the theater group, but said 
they were bound by law. Councilman Sheldon Baker added that the city should not 
"be required to hold (the theater's) hand every step of the way" through the 
approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very unfortunate situation but there are some rules we have to follow 
for public safety reasons," Baker said. "I don't know what else can be done."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SHOWS TO RAISE FUNDS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group intent on saving Glendale's public library system from the effects of 
city funding cuts is putting on a show. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the Glendale Public Library, a nonprofit group that raises money 
for books, children's activities and other library programs, is teaming up with 
A Noise Within, a local Shakespearean and classic American theater group, to 
stage two performances of John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men." 
</P>
<P>
 "Funding has been severely cut in Glendale for the past three years," said 
Nancy Spiller, a member of the group's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book purchasing budget for the central library, five branches and 
bookmobile is $200,000, half its 1990 level of $400,000," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the library was able to buy 11,000 books, compared to 20,000 books 
two years earlier. Spiller said that is "sorely inadequate" for a library 
system that has 180,000 cardholders and serves about 1.3 million people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiller said "Of Mice and Men" was chosen partly because Steinbeck was a 
Glendale-area resident and because the Pulitzer Prize-winning author would "no 
doubt be saddened by the rapidly declining state" of public libraries today. 
Early in his writing career, Steinbeck lived in a house just a block from where 
the Eagle Rock Plaza now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances of "Of Mice and Men" will be at 8 p.m. Friday and Nov. 11 at the 
repertory group's theater in the Masonic Temple building, 234 S. Brand Blvd. 
Tickets are $12 for the first performance and $19 for the second performance, 
and the proceeds will go to the library group's general fund to be used for 
various programs. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE MUSIC TEACHER TO JOIN PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DOYLE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you close your eyes you can practically see the short, smooth sounds that 
float from Stephen Piazza's clarinet. The imaginary hues that come to mind are 
the same that paint a man who aspires to color the rest of the world with his 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "My love for music comes somewhere from the center of my being," said Piazza, 
who has been Pierce College's music department chairman since 1978. "It was a 
calling. . . . I knew when I was 11 years old that this is what I was destined 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At 44, Piazza has hit the peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills resident was invited to perform with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic this winter and spring, when the group will travel to Mexico City, 
New York's Carnegie Hall and Washington's Kennedy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza first gained recognition by the internationally renowned orchestra 
almost 15 years ago after auditioning with a group of other hopeful musicians. 
Although Piazza placed "highest" in Southern California, the orchestra chose 
someone else for the permanent chair, placing Piazza on a list to fill in 
vacant spots when a member was ill or on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then he has performed more than 200 times with the orchestra, picking up 
gigs along the way with the American Ballet Theater and the Los Angeles Opera 
Company. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the first time he will play with the Los Angeles Philharmonic as 
a staff musician. "You only know how good you are by how many times you are 
invited back," said Piazza, who will continue to conduct the symphony band at 
Pierce and meet the demands of music department chairman between 
four-day-a-week rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 When scheduling conflicts do occur, Piazza says he will arrange to bring his 
students to rehearsals so they can see first-hand what the professional 
experience is like. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will get a chance to see how a world-class orchestra plays together as a 
cohesive whole. It's inspiring. It's something I want my students to love and 
appreciate like I have over the years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's love for music was sparked at age 11 when he decided to become a 
"rock 'n' roll sax player." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother wanted me to be a lawyer," said Piazza, who began playing the 
saxophone in the school band at Van Nuys Junior High School. He also played 
with the band at Notre Dame High School, while waiting for an audition date at 
the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He finally got the audition, but 
received a rejection letter weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letter said, 'Best of luck in your chosen endeavor.' What was I supposed 
to do, become a plumber? I was crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 But he persevered and eventually was awarded a scholarship to USC, where he 
earned his master's degree in music. 
</P>
<P>
 While he said his paychecks this season from the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
won't "pay for a Mercedes," the honor is so great that he'd do it for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people go to hear the Philharmonic, they are taken to another 
dimension," said Piazza. "I want to be part of what takes them on that journey 
. . ." ALICIA DOYLE

 In conjunction with the United Nations International Year of the Family, Cal 
State Northridge is sponsoring "Families Under Fire," a two-part forum to 
address the status of children in today's society and the media's impact on 
concepts of family values. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 11, Eleanor Maccoby, a retired psychology professor and co-chairwoman 
of the Carnegie Task Force on Meeting the Needs of Young Children, will examine 
how the status of women affects the status of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Maccoby has just returned from the world population conference in Cairo, said 
Susan Crow, director of development of CSUN's School of Communication, Health 
and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hot issue now, but it hasn't been in the United States," said Crow, 
who hopes that the forum will bring more attention to family and child issues. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 1, the second day of the forum, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist 
Jonathan Freedman will give a lecture on the media's response to poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day event is free and open to the public. For more information, call

RAIN LASHES VALLEY IN FIRST STORM OF SEASON; WEATHER: IT WAS A WET WELCOME FOR 
FALL AS AN UNUSUALLY EARLY DOUSING CAUSED POWER OUTAGES AND TRAFFIC SNARLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Although fall officially began almost two weeks ago, residents of the San 
Fernando Valley did not get their first taste of it until Tuesday when the 
season's first rainstorm hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an inch of rain fell in the Valley by Tuesday afternoon, but that 
was still more than had fallen by this point in the season for the past three 
years, according to Weather Data meteorologist Curtis Brack. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really kind of early in the season for rain," Brack said. "You usually 
don't expect these kind of storms until late December or early January." 
</P>
<P>
 Most parts of Los Angeles County got less than an inch of rain by early 
Tuesday evening, with Newhall receiving about half an inch and Woodland Hills 
only a quarter of an inch, Brack said. The most recent heavy rainfall on an 
Oct. 4 was in 1987, when more than four inches fell on Burbank and almost six 
inches in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious weather-related accidents were reported, but there were problems 
with a flooded freeway, a power outage in Burbank, and boulders that blocked 
freeway lanes in Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, the westbound Ventura Freeway was flooded at Haskell Avenue and 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Studio City, according to a California Highway 
Patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a whole lot Caltrans can do right now," said CHP Officer Kerri 
Hawkins. "They just wait until it stops raining." 
</P>
<P>
 The rain-related power outage in Burbank interrupted service Tuesday afternoon 
to about 600 businesses and 6,700 residents. The 1:30 p.m. blackout occurred in 
an area bounded by Victory and Magnolia boulevards and Hollywood Way, said Ron 
Stassi, spokesman for the city's power company. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newhall, two 18-inch boulders rolled down the hillside of the Golden State 
Freeway connector road to the Antelope Valley Freeway and blocked a lane for 
about an hour, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the wet season begins, CHP officials advise drivers to prepare their cars 
for rain. Commuters should check the tread on their tires, replace old 
windshield wipers, and properly inflate their tires, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a direct correlation between over-inflated tires and hydroplaning 
speed," said CHP officer Woody Tweed. "The more air you put in your tires, the 
greater speed you can do before you hydroplane." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the rain's effects were welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Upstart Crow bookstore and coffeehouse at Universal CityWalk, customers 
jammed into the tiny store to escape the cold weather and warm themselves with 
a cup of java. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fuller than usual," said cashier Mario Novoa, 18. "We sold more 
coffee and cappuccinos than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, the store's chic patio was empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very crowded and we had to bring in the tables from outside," Novoa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoda Lambert of North Hollywood also welcomed the rain, if only to give her 
red and yellow rosebushes a break from the summer's heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain is wonderful," Lambert said. "It helps fill out the hedge trees and 
makes my garden fresh and pretty."

POLICE INVESTIGATOR IS FOUND SHOT TO DEATH; VAN NUYS: SGT. MICHAEL LUND, 
REPORTEDLY DESPONDENT, APPARENTLY KILLS HIMSELF IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE 
STATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles police internal affairs investigator, reportedly despondent over 
personal problems, shot himself to death in the parking lot of the Van Nuys 
police station Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Michael Lund drove into the parking lot about two hours late for his 8:30 
a.m. shift, sat in his car for awhile, then put a pistol in his mouth and 
pulled the trigger, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officers coming and going saw him sitting in his car" -- whether before or 
after his death was unclear -- said Lt. John Dunkin, a police spokesman. 
"People thought he was reading a newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 The body was noticed by another officer about 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said that Lund, 39, apparently died from a single bullet to the head, 
and that ballistic tests would be conducted on a handgun recovered from his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Lund, a 15-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, had spent about 
a year in the Internal Affairs unit at the station's Valley Bureau, which 
oversees the five San Fernando Valley police divisions. Police would not 
comment officially on what could have driven Lund to suicide, and did not 
release details about his personal life, including whether he was married or 
had children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunkin said work-related matters did not appear to be a factor, according 
to a preliminary investigation. "There is no (police) investigation he is 
involved in that would have had any bearing on this," Dunkin said. "We're not 
going to discuss that in any detail. Whatever it was, it was obviously very 
troubling to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Several officers, who asked not to be identified, said there were indications 
that Lund was troubled over a personal relationship, possibly with a woman. 
Just before his death, he had dropped his young daughter off at her school, one 
police source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Staggs, president of the Police Protective League, said he had been 
Lund's partner 12 years ago when the two worked the Skid Row area Downtown. He 
described Lund as a popular, easygoing officer respected by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just dumbfounded. We are lost," Staggs said. "It is tragic when you 
lose a police officer from their own weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an outstanding police officer, very amicable, very fair to everyone on 
the street," he added. "He is very highly thought of. Everyone is in shock 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Said another officer: "He was a pretty stable, happy-go-lucky guy. I guess we 
all have personal problems, and sometimes they overwhelm us. That's what 
happened here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lund's death is apparently the first suicide by a Los Angeles police 
officer in at least several years, according to Staggs, he said concern over 
the issue has come to a head in recent years. He said that the issue of suicide 
was discussed at a meeting of the National Assn. of Chiefs of Police recently, 
and that most police experts said officers' domestic problems -- compounded by 
the intense stress of the job -- were the primary cause of suicides.

CSUN APOLOGIZES FOR BROCHURE ART; NORTHRIDGE: THE FLYER, MAILED TO 40,000 
ALUMNI, WAS ILLUSTRATED WITH A SKETCH OF MEXICAN BEANS SLEEPING UNDER 
SOMBREROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a protest by Latino faculty and staff members, Cal State Northridge 
issued a formal apology Tuesday for a homecoming brochure illustrated with a 
stereotypical sketch of Mexican beans sleeping under big hats. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus official responsible for the brochure mailed to 40,000 local alumni 
said he originally thought the artwork, depicting two pinto beans under 
sombreros, showed a pair of hotdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure drew an especially strong reaction from CSUN's Latino employees 
because it was distributed shortly after a protest against changes to a program 
that serves minority students. The critics also cited a fraternity party flyer 
circulated two years ago that drew similar protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still dealing with the same issues of stereotypes we were dealing with 
25 years ago," complained Frank Muniz, a counselor on campus. "I was angry at 
how this even could be approved without someone noticing it would be 
insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-inch artwork is one of several illustrations on an 11-by-17-inch 
brochure advertising the campus' Oct. 22 homecoming activities. The artwork 
shows a pair of hunched-over beans wearing sombreros sitting on a serape, a 
blanket-like Latino garment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the stereotype of sleeping Mexicans," Muniz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray Mounger, CSUN's newly hired director of alumni relations who supervised 
development of the brochure, said he failed to see the image that way when he 
first reviewed the illustration. "I asked for partying hotdogs, and when I saw 
the (proof), it looked like hotdogs to me," Mounger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly regret the brochure offended people. It wasn't meant to be 
offensive to anyone," said Mounger, who arrived recently from George Washington 
University in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger said he just asked the brochure designer to insert various pieces of 
stock art in the brochure to make it livelier. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the apology letter to the campus community, Director of University 
Development Michael Hammerschmidt, Mounger's supervisor, called the image 
"inappropriate" and "offensive." In an interview, Hammerschmidt said he would 
reprimand Mounger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The images used are offensive to members of this community, and it is most 
unfortunate that they appeared in a mailer which was intended to be welcoming 
and inclusive, not exclusive in any way," wrote Hammerschmidt, apologizing on 
behalf of the university relations division. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials said the apology was to be submitted to the Daily Sundial, the 
campus student newspaper. It will also be included in a university information 
bulletin to be distributed on campus later this week and reprinted in an alumni 
publication to be mailed out next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammerschmidt said he too checked the proof of the brochure prior to printing, 
but said, "I only read the words. I didn't look at the artwork." In addition to 
the alumni mailing last week, the brochure was routinely distributed Friday to 
faculty and staff on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 With CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson out of the country on a trip, complaints 
from Latino faculty and staff members began to reach Provost Louanne Kennedy's 
office by Friday afternoon. "As soon as I saw it Saturday, I said we needed to 
apologize," Kennedy said.

DAMAGED PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER TO RELOCATE IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's largest public health center, housed in 13 trailers 
since the Northridge quake, will relocate in spring to a nearby office building 
while the county rebuilds the quake-damaged facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Tuesday by Los Angeles County supervisors to rent an office 
building one mile south of the quake-damaged health center will improve 
conditions for patients, many of whom have been forced to seek medical care 
elsewhere or wait outdoors in the parking lot to be seen at the makeshift 
clinic.  
</P>
<P>
 But the reprieve will not come until April because the three-story office 
building that the county plans to lease at 6931 Van Nuys Blvd. has to be 
remodeled, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is really looking forward to it," said Ernest Espinoza, the center's 
associate administrator. "The trailers are better than the tents we first had 
after the quake, but it's still cramped here."  
</P>
<P>
 The trailers, situated in the parking lot of the health center in the 7500 
block of Van Nuys Boulevard, provide only about a quarter of the amount of 
space the center occupied before the Jan. 17 earthquake. About six weeks after 
the quake, the five-story, 34-year-old building was condemned when inspectors 
found previously undetected cracks in support beams on the top floor.  
</P>
<P>
 About 4,300 patients per month now visit the temporary health center for free 
or low-cost medical services, down more than 40% from normal, Espinoza said.  
</P>
<P>
 "(It is) imperative that the full scope of medical services be restored at an 
interim facility as soon as possible," said Supervisor Ed Edelman, who 
represents the area and introduced the motion in favor of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the proposed lease, the county will pay about $36,000 a 
month, including utilities and maintenance, to rent the office building from 
owner Joshua Michaely for a maximum of five years.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the county will raze and rebuild the original health center.  
</P>
<P>
 The lease and the cost of rebuilding will be entirely funded by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services and 
insurance benefits from the old building, said Claus Marx, a county spokesman.

GLENDALE HIGH CHOSEN SITE FOR EVENING SCHOOL; STUDENTS: CLASSES FROM 2:45 TO 9 
P.M. ARE EXPECTED TO EASE OVERCROWDING AND SAVE MONEY. THERE WILL BE NO 
INTERSCHOLASTIC SPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Glendale High School was chosen Tuesday as the site for what is believed to be 
California's first evening high school, shocking some parents and teachers who 
had been certain it would go to another campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next fall, the school will be shared by administrators, teachers and 
students of Glendale High and the new Evening High School, which is expected to 
operate from 2:45 to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale School Board selected Glendale High on East Broadway on a 
unanimous vote based on a recommendation from Deputy School Supt. Donald Empey. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving high school students the option to take classes in the late afternoon 
and evening is one way for such financially strapped school systems as 
Glendale's to cope with overcrowding, while saving money by using existing 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening High School will not offer interscholastic sports. But it will offer a 
wider range of courses than those at continuation schools for teen-agers with 
academic and disciplinary problems, Glendale Unified School District officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of where to put the new school raised strong opposition from 
neighbors of Hoover High School on Glenwood Road, who feared it would increase 
nighttime traffic and teen-age loitering. About 200 people signed petitions 
urging the district to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have high hopes that late-afternoon and evening classes 
will appeal to students who do not perform well in the morning or who are 
unable to spend time with their families because of conflicting work schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Teachers Assn. backs the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 At Glendale High, some teachers -- including one who served on the task force 
that established guidelines for the experimental program -- were unaware that 
Empey had recommended their campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of students at Glendale High worry that efforts to incorporate 
freshmen into the school next fall for the first time will be complicated by 
the simultaneous launching of Evening High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people have questions, logistically, about how things will 
work. Quite frankly, there are concerns. The timing of it seems difficult," 
said Jan Bills, president of Glendale High's Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bills and others said they had been convinced the evening school would be sent 
to Hoover High. But Empey contends that neither he nor the task force ever gave 
grounds for such an impression during the search for an adequate site. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale has three high school campuses, in addition to a continuation school. 
Empey said serious consideration was given to only two: Glendale and Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea that this Evening High School would go to Hoover or Glendale 
has been in the discussion stages for several months," he said. "There's been 
no secret about it." 
</P>
<P>
 To remain open for its first year, Evening High School must have at least 250 
students, he added. District officials envision it may serve as many as 600 
before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report to the school board, Empey listed two main reasons that Glendale 
High would make the best site for Evening High School: The campus is close to 
major streets and needs a staggered school day to alleviate the overcrowding of 
about 3,440 students next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High School, by contrast, is in a primarily residential neighborhood, 
will serve 2,959 students next fall and has 210 fewer parking spaces than 
Glendale High.

L.A. TO ASK FEMA TO EXTEND PATROLS OF 'GHOST TOWNS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hoping to protect vacant, quake-damaged buildings until most repairs are 
completed, Los Angeles housing officials said Tuesday they will ask the federal 
government to continue paying for private patrols of "ghost towns" through 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials said they will request next week that the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency pay to extend a 120-day contract for private security guards 
for an additional 90 days.The extension would cost $480,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The federally funded patrols were launched in July to keep vagrants, vandals 
and looters from entering the empty, crumbling buildings and further damaging 
the properties. The original $600,000 security contract was scheduled to expire 
Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sam Luna, director of the city's neighborhood recovery program, said the 
guards are needed for another 90 days to give building owners more time to 
rebuild. "The reports we get from residents, property owners and property 
managers is that they are doing a good job," Luna said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he expects a positive response from FEMA. "We don't see a 
problem being approved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards are only part of a $2.8-million federally funded effort by the city 
to seal the buildings from trespassers. City crews have also boarded up windows 
and erected fences around most vacant ghost town buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guards patrol 15 ghost towns, mostly in the San Fernando Valley. 
Each quake-damaged neighborhood has been assigned at least two guards and one 
patrol car to protect the buildings around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of additional crime problems at a ghost town in North Hills, the city 
increased the security there by assigning 10 unarmed guards and one patrol car 
with two armed guards. In addition, a mounted unit of the Los Angeles Police 
Department will be deployed in the area whenever it is available, Luna said.

 A Rosamond man has been charged with making a false crime report for inventing

 Sheriff's investigators conducted a two-week investigation and "were on the 
verge of arresting a deputy" before they became suspicious of the man's story, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They initially believed him," Stone said. "He just kept giving descriptions." 
</P>
<P>
 David Johnson originally said a deputy sheriff stopped him near San Fernando 
Road and Sierra Highway and took him to the Santa Clarita station, authorities 
said. He falsely charged that the deputy failed to book him properly, changed 
from his uniform to street clothes and took him to a remote area of Castaic, 
where he met another deputy, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said both deputies then beat him up and let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, authorities said, Johnson was beaten up by some former drug 
suppliers and first told the story about the deputies to his wife, to conceal 
from her that he was continuing to use methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife called the Santa Clarita sheriff's station and filed a complaint and 
Johnson was taken to a local hospital were it was confirmed that he had been 
assaulted, setting off the investigation of the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson admitted to Internal Criminal Investigations Bureau investigators on 
Sept. 14 that he had lied and charges were filed against him more than two 
weeks ago, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put in a lot of man-hours," said Sheriff's Lt. Barbara Persten, in charge 
of the Santa Clarita station's detectives. "I am glad that we filed the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of complaints, some are valid, some are not," Persten said. "But 
when someone alleges criminal misconduct, you are putting somebody at risk."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ELECTIONS / LANCASTER BALLOT MEASURE; CITY 
WANTS COUNTY TO PAY BILL IF TAX PROPOSAL IS UNNECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The way irate Lancaster officials see it, county supervisors have stuck them 
with a $32,000 tab for a meaningless ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the City Council approved a Nov. 8 ballot measure to ask 
residents if they would be willing to pay a property tax increase to support 
expanded local library services. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's library, which is operated by the county, is open only four days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 But now it seems the tax might not be necessary. County supervisors -- who 
earlier this year said city residents would have to fund additional library 
hours -- say they have recently learned of an unexpected multimillion-dollar 
surplus in county funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on Tuesday, three of the five supervisors said they will vote to scrap 
the county library tax plan, which includes the provision to collect taxes from 
residents of cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster officials agree the plan should be thrown out. "I don't think we 
need to help them with anything if they find that kind of money," Mayor Frank 
Roberts said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors are scheduled to vote on the plan Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tax plan is rejected, as expected, Lancaster officials believe the 
advisory measure they've put on the ballot will have no value. That's where the 
$32,000 comes in. It's the estimated cost of adding the measure to the election 
ballots that are prepared by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, council members voted unanimously to ask county supervisors to 
remove the library question from the ballot. And if it cannot be removed at 
this point, the council wants the county to pay the extra expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the ones who put us over the barrel in the first place," Councilman 
Michael Singer fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Ventura, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder's 
office, said it's too late to remove it. The November ballots are already being 
printed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the Antelope Valley, blamed the 
"liberal majority" of the board for the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have a community paying for an unnecessary election," he said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Antonovich also said he does not believe the county can afford to repay 
Lancaster for the cost of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resources we have, we are attempting to put into the libraries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Bellman, a spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman, said Lancaster officials 
could have used less costly methods, such as public meetings, to gauge 
community support for the proposed fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county did not ask or require them to have an advisory vote," Bellman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster is one of four cities that opted to ask its voters if they are 
willing to pay up to $30 a year more in property taxes per single-family house 
to restore library services. 
</P>
<P>
 San Dimas, La Verne and Walnut -- the other cities that have placed library 
tax advisory measures on the Nov. 8 ballot -- have not voted at this point to 
seek reimbursement from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials promised that the money collected in each city would only be 
used to restore hours and personnel at that city's branch library.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CORONER SEEKS HELP IDENTIFYING SUICIDE VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office is seeking the public's help to 
identify a man who climbed a utility pole, then leaped to his death from a 
rescue ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said the incident occurred Sept. 4 near the 
corner of 3rd Street East and Lightcap Street in Lancaster.The man, described 
as about 35 years old, with brown hair and brown eyes, climbed the pole, 
reached for electrical wires and threatened to jump, Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies and firefighters were able to coax him onto a ladder but 
were unable to stop the man from jumping to his death, he said. The man had no 
identification and his body remains at the coroner's building. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier asked that anyone with information about the man's identity call the 
Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station, (805) 948-8466, or the coroner's 
identification staff, (213) 343-0754.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PAROLEES OFFER TIPS ON DETERRING CRIME; 
PREVENTION: CONVICTED FELONS TELL A CHURCH AUDIENCE THAT GOOD LIGHTING CAN HELP 
PROTECT PEOPLE AND PROPERTY.

 A gang leader, a car thief, a robber, a drug dealer and a burglar were among 
the crowd gathered at Santa Clarita United Methodist Church Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not there for religious training. They were there to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to give you advice on how to protect yourself and your property 
because I've taken a lot from this community when I was a youngster," said 
Ronald Dene, 27, a convicted burglar, at the meeting sponsored by the local 
chapter of Mad About Rising Crime, which promotes community involvement in the 
battle against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dene and the other speakers on the program were all recently paroled from 
state prison. They are now enrolled in volunteer recovery programs at Ryan's 
Center in North Hollywood, a live-in center that provides counseling and job 
placement services for parolees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were nervous before the crowd and obviously not accustomed to public 
speaking. But the audience was receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents laughed when one speaker described getting stuck in the bars of a 
ventilation duct of a business he was trying to break into. They listened 
intently when another told them that car protection devices such as alarms and 
metal bars across steering wheels aren't very effective, but electronic 
tracking systems are. 
</P>
<P>
 They took advantage of a chance to learn from the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there three good things a business-oriented person can do?" asked James 
Popejoy, 53, a Valencia jewelry store owner who was shot in the head and chest 
when four armed men robbed his store two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lighting is real important," replied Mark McCray, 38, paroled three months 
ago after serving an eight-year sentence for manslaughter. "Keep it well-lit 
and maybe leave a radio on inside. If a burglar thinks there's someone inside a 
lot of times they'll back off." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarms inside a home or business and a warning sticker outside will often 
deter a burglar, the parolees said. Large dogs are also a useful deterrent, but 
not foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get a piece of meat, throw a Valium in it and come back an hour later 
and get into your house," said Thomas Cruz, 38, a burglar paroled in July after 
serving time for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Gangs play a large role in many serious crimes, said McCray, who once led a 
125-member Van Nuys gang. He advised residents not to appear intimidated by 
gang members, but also not to confront them.
