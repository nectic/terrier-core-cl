 TIDY SUMS: Parting is sweet sorrow, but money helps ease the pain. . . . Some 
Ventura County officials leaving the employ of local government are getting 
healthy farewell checks from the county (B1). . . . Outgoing Supervisors Vicky 
Howard and Maria VanderKolk and Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg 
will receive lump sums for extra vacation time. . . . Perks for local 
government officials were a hot topic a couple of years ago -- but whether 
reforms went far enough remains an issue of debate for watchdog groups. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE HAVEN: It's been five months since Casa Pacifica, the county's only 
residence for abused and neglected children, opened its doors to youngsters 
(B1). . . . Fund-raising efforts to meet operating expenses are continuing, on 
the heels of a construction campaign that brought in about $10 million. . . . 
"The need's still there," spokeswoman Tanya Gonzales said. Officials are hoping 
to raise $450,000 toward operating costs this fiscal year -- about 10% of the 
annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 FAST QUIPS: Sporting a vanity license plate has almost become a California 
cliche. . . . But in a game of one-upmanship, Ventura motorcycle cops are 
weighing in with their own retort to motorists whose plates boast about the 
driver's speeding abilities. Officers have installed frames around their 
license plates with such phrases as: "If you got the speed, I've got the time." 
. . . The attempt at humor isn't always a big hit for motorists caught in the 
fast lane, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 GIVING BACK: As school finances tighten, teachers often find themselves 
dipping into their personal budgets to pay for basic classroom equipment. . . . 
In the spirit of the season, one teacher suggests that ordinary citizens think 
about giving to teachers (Voices, Page B13). . . . In Ventura, the school 
district's educational foundation has already such a campaign under way. 
Participating downtown merchants are donating a portion of their sales proceeds 
to a fund that provides grants to help teachers meet classroom expenses.

MUSIC REVIEW; A NOG TOAST TO A STYLISHLY HANDLED 'MESSIAH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though its first performance (April 13, 1742) and all subsequent performances 
under Handel's direction had nothing to do with Christmas, his "Messiah" is now 
considered so de rigueur during the holiday season that some people would no 
sooner miss the oratorio than their seasonal egg nog. Then, as with the 
beverage, it's forgotten the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tradition of giving them what they want, the Pacific Symphony presented 
its 14th annual "Messiah" at a sold-out Segerstrom Hall -- on a shopping 
Saturday afternoon a week before Christmas, no less. The names on the marquee 
were hardly household names, but that didn't matter: Handel's "Messiah" was in 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, though, the relative unknowns were worth coming to hear. 
Richard Westerfield -- whose main claim to fame early in his career seems to be 
that he's a "principal cover conductor" (read understudy and bridesmaid) for 
the New York Philharmonic -- proved to be an enlightened and sure-handed 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 With the reduced forces of the Pacific Symphony (30 in all) and the Pacific 
Chorale (a slim 60), Westerfield fashioned a "Messiah" that incorporated 
elements of the so-called authentic style. 
</P>
<P>
 His violins (for the most part) eschewed vibrato, producing appropriately 
steely, wheezy sounds. He sculpted phrases with rugged articulations, firm and 
lithe rhythms, spaces between notes and halting cadences.  
</P>
<P>
 He got the Pacific Chorale to sing with feathery lightness, transparency and 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The solo quartet was headed by soprano Andrea Matthews, who revealed a 
genuinely pretty voice, lustrous and graceful, which she used straightforwardly 
yet intelligently. Mezzo-soprano Melissa Thorburn sang her solos with fluid 
clarity, though in her low-key approach she missed a dramatic opportunity or 
two.  
</P>
<P>
 Tenor Stanley Cornett sounded frail on occasion, out-of-tune at others, but 
generally dispatched his music handily. William Parcher displayed a cavernous 
baritone and went in mostly for stentorian rhetoric (his sixteenth-note runs 
sounded especially ponderous), but he could also wax sensitive in a charming 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Readily responding to Westerfield's direction, the Pacific Chorale didn't 
labor for speed or struggle for softness. Words mattered. Its fortes were crisp 
and forthright, if not particularly imposing. Its phrasing was meticulous and 
varied and built steadily toward climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony produced sounds both alert and full of character 
throughout, accompanying recitatives and arias with especial care and elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all its strengths, this "Messiah" was no model of precision, though 
it was never slack -- call it rough and ready. It got the job done. Now to the 
nog.

JAZZ REVIEW; AN ACE HOMECOMING FOR SAXMAN BRANDON FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as recordings go, saxophonist Brandon Fields has beenmostly missing in 
action over the past couple years. The strength of his first set Saturday at 
Randell's made that circumstance seem almost criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields, who received much of his musical education growing up in Fountain 
Valley, is one of the more interesting contemporary saxophonists on the scene. 
Sure, he likes big, accessible beats, but he also knows how to make something 
of them, giving those even-handed rhythms the kind of twists and turns that 
belie the shallowness associated with pop-jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Never one to utilize cheap, emotional appeals, Fields brings a sincerity to 
his performance missing from such horn men as Dave Koz, Richard Elliot or pop 
instrumentalist Kenny G. His playing, however, still generates the same kind of 
excitement as these musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 For the return to his childhood stomping grounds (Fields was last seen in 
Orange County with Earth, Wind & Fire vocalist Philip Bailey this past summer 
at the Hyatt Newporter), the saxophonist brought in a top-notch backup quartet 
that featured trumpeter, organist and long-time associate Walt Fowler. This 
double-brass lineup brought immediacy to the themes and a weighty, harmonic 
depth that was a sure attention grabber. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields' "Guilt by Association" put the horns to good use early. The 
tenor-trumpet blend gave the funk-jazz number the feel of '60s-era Art Blakey 
and his Jazz Messengers. Fields wasted no time establishing his personality, 
working with the kind of probing lines and hearty caterwauling that fellow sax 
man Joe Henderson would admire. With Fields' playing matched in intensity by 
Fowler's agile trumpeting, the tune set a high standard early in the set. 
</P>
<P>
 That standard was maintained as Fields moved through a variety of original 
material. The tenor-fluegelhorn blend of "Part Human" gave warmth to the 
samba-paced, slightly sinister minor-key theme. The ballad "Gina" was built on 
a simple bass line while featuring Fields' quirky alto solo that contained 
plenty of squeaks, catcalls and sinewy lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact Fields plays with wide-ranging sense of tone, he never allows 
his squeals or guttural displays to dominate the work. Often such techniques 
were deftly understated, a ploy that gave them even more impact. And when it 
came time to wail, you could feel the emotion behind the dynamic display. 
</P>
<P>
 While new tunes from a forthcoming album were the most impressive, older 
numbers were given new life with the saxophonist's fine variations.  
</P>
<P>
 A call for "Bull Funk" from Fields' first CD gave him a chance to shout and 
sing the blues on alto. The tune developed some of the moodiness that Miles 
Davis brought to his electric work, with Fowler's organ accompaniment taking on 
some of the kinky character of Davis' own keyboard embellishments. The tune's 
hard-blown bridge -- featuring only trumpet, sax and drums -- made for the kind 
of passage that sends electricity coursing up one's spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Steve Cardenas offered thoughtful contrast to Fields' more dynamic 
improvisations, playing each note as if to make it stand alone. His chordal 
accompaniment thickened the already detailed mix and his unison play with 
Fields' lead on "Brain Dance" brought an electric edge to the stimulating 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tom Warrington's astute bass and drummer Dick Weller mixing it up with 
both on- and off-beat percussion, the set was one of the best heard in this 
room in some time. More contemporary artists should follow Fields' lead, rather 
than constantly looking for ways to generate commercial interest. 
</P>
<P>
 His melding of traditional jazz sensibilities with contemporary forms is just 
the kind of music today's fans tired of the pop market will embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So why has it been so long between albums for Fields, possibly one of Southern 
California's most popular saxmen? The answer, as the saxophonist explained in 
an interview between sets at Randell's, has to do with his previous record 
company.  
</P>
<P>
 Fields' four albums for the now-defunct Nova label were among that company's 
most successful. But when that company went under in 1993, Fields, whose last 
release for them came in 1991, was left without a label. It took awhile to find 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only musician from the label to show up at the bankruptcy hearing 
and try to buy the rights to my albums back," he explained. "But I wasn't 
successful (Sin-Drome Records of North Hollywood purchased the entire Nova 
catalogue). If they're being distributed now, I don't know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields has been signed by Positive Records and will cut a new recording for 
the label early next year.  
</P>
<P>
 "It'll have Walt (Fowler) and Steve Cardenas on it. I'm really looking forward 
to doing it. It's been a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Fields hasn't been busy. He appears occasionally as a leader in 
Los Angeles area clubs and is often called to do session work for other 
musicians. He's featured on the recent release from the German-based Basement 
Productions release from Back Street, "What We Like," and is seen regularly at 
North Hollywood's Baked Potato playing with the group dubbed "The Anonymous All 
Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields, who attended high school in Santa Ana and studied music at Cal State 
Fullerton and with band leader Charles (Doc) Rutherford at Orange Coast 
College, spent a few weeks this summer touring with Earth, Wind & Fire (in 
addition to the tour with Bailey). But he's most anxious to get his own career 
firing on all cylinders again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really difficult these days with the way radio station formats work," he 
said. "We've lost stations that play our kind of music and without that 
exposure, it's really hard to get noticed. And the clubs just aren't as popular 
as they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 But based on the strength of the new material aired at Randell's on Saturday, 
1995 could be the year Fields -- the one-time Rippingtons and Tower of Power 
saxophonist -- generates his own exposure.

 Ready to Revoke?: Miramax Films, which faces a hearing this week over 
advertising related to its forthcoming film, "Ready to Wear," ran full-page ads 
in both Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter on Friday with the headline, 
"This is not an ad to see the movie Ready to Wear ." The ad went on to describe 
itself as "a statement of protest" over threats by the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America to revoke the R rating of director Robert Altman's fashion-industry 
sendup, "Ready to Wear," which opens Christmas Day. The dispute is over a 
semi-nude photo in film-related advertising of supermodel Helena Christensen. 
The photo appeared prominently in the Friday ads, as it did in a recent ad by 
Columbia Records to promote the film's soundtrack. The Columbia ad included a 
line saying, "See the Movie," which the MPAA said was equivalent to a movie ad 
and violated the association's standards. Miramax says the photo is a fair 
reflection of its film and its rating, and has retained lawyer Alan Dershowitz 
to fight what it calls censorship. The MPAA has scheduled a revocation hearing 
for Thursday in Washington. Miramax says the loss of its rating so close to the 
film's opening could greatly impact the number of theaters willing to show it.

 The Write Stuff: Budd Schulberg, who pioneered and taught the Watts Writers 
Workshop in the aftermath of the Watts riots, is writing a one-hour dramatic 
pilot, "Write On," for Bill Cosby and NBC, inspired by Schulberg's experience 
teaching the Watts Workshop. Schulberg, 80, is also busy fine-tuning the stage 
adaptation of his classic Oscar-winning 1954 film "On the Waterfront" for 
Broadway producer Mitchell Maxwell for a projected opening at the Atkinson 
Theater in April. The "Waterfront" play, co-written with Stan Silverman and to 
be directed by Gordon Edelstein, recently opened a limited run in Chicago. The 
Broadway casting is not set. STAGE

 Long Beach Changes: Long Beach Civic Light Opera has reshuffled its season. 
"Ain't Misbehavin' " is canceled -- rights were withdrawn because a national 
touring production took precedence. "A Chorus Line" has been moved up from July 
to take the vacated March slot, and "Man of La Mancha" -- produced and directed 
by the group's new producing artistic director Luke Yankee -- will replace "A 
Chorus Line" next summer. RADIO

 Newtwatchers: KCRW (89.9 FM) will keep an eye on Newt Gingrich and the 104th 
Congress with its new weekly show, "The First Hundred Days." The program, set 
to air Fridays at 2 p.m. for 13 weeks, beginning Jan. 6, will take a look 
inside the "Gingrich revolution" and report on its emerging philosophy, 
strategy and agenda. David Horowitz, co-author of "Destructive Generation: 
Second Thoughts About the Sixties," will host the show. Guests will include 
House Speaker Gingrich, House Whip Dick Armey, Senate Whip Trent Lott and other 
members of the Gingrich team including Reps. Dana Rohrbacher and Chris Cox.

 Shakur Seeks Delay: Tupac Shakur needs a better doctor's note if he wants to 
be excused from court. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Paul Flynn on Friday 
extended an arrest warrant issued nine days ago and told the rapper's attorney 
to have him in court Jan. 25. Flynn said there wasn't enough information in a 
doctor's note that claims Shakur is in no shape to travel from New York to Los 
Angeles, where he faces weapons charges. Shakur was shot two weeks ago in a 
robbery outside a New York recording studio.

 Less Than Wonderful: Stevie Wonder, usually a stickler for perfection, played 
a medley of his hits on an untuned grand piano Friday in Ghana. "We all have to 
sacrifice a little for African unity," he told the audience, which waited six 
hours to hear him sing at the national theater in Accra as part of the PanaFest 
cultural festival, which he is co-chairing. There have been other problems at 
the PanaFest, a celebration of the re-emergence of African civilization and the 
uniting of the African family. The festival, which began Dec. 9, has attracted 
only a third of the expected 3,000 visitors. Some visitors have complained of 
lack of hotel space or inadequate facilities and some performers have played to 
near-empty halls. Many Ghanaians have stayed away, saying entry fees are too 
high. BETH KLEID

WEEKEND REVIEWS; THEATER; 'LOST CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL': 'TIS THE SEASON TO BE 
LONELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cloud of cigarette smoke hangs over the stage during "The Lost Christmas 
Festival III: Permanently Lost," the third annual festival of one-acts at the 
Lost Studio. It's no coincidence that a lot of the people in these plays smoke. 
The future risk of cancer is not a big concern with the denizens of these bleak 
dramas, most of whose characters are preoccupied with the formidable task of 
getting through the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 When that day happens to be Christmas, the lost and the lonely can be crushed 
by the juggernaut of holiday cheer, as these plays amply demonstrate. Many of 
the pieces have specific Christmas themes, but don't expect an atmosphere of 
jollity and good will. On the contrary, the relentless downbeat tone could 
precipitate a prolonged seasonal depression for the impressionable playgoer. 
</P>
<P>
 These are character-driven, determinedly avant-garde works that tend to be 
heavy on absurdism and light on plot. The most notable exception is Murray 
Mednick's "Baby, Jesus!" in which two mischievous young girls call up 
pathetically eager prospective mothers on an adoption hotline pretending to be 
pregnant teen-agers considering adoption for their babies.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Guy Zimmerman's crisp direction, Roxanne Rogers and Dawn Howard both 
appall and amuse as the youthful pranksters, and a satisfying twist wraps up 
this macabre package. (Interestingly, this, the most successful play, is the 
only one not directed by its playwright.) 
</P>
<P>
 The curtain raiser, Mick Collins' "I Gotta . . . Stella," a slight, disjointed 
piece about an anguished young convict and his unfeeling father, goes by 
quickly, leaving little impression beyond a sense of vague unease.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Goodrich's "Boxing Day," about a lonely, volatile Cockney gangster, is 
more specifically menacing, thanks to a galvanic central performance by C. J. 
Saunders, who at one point makes love to a Christmas tree with complete 
conviction. However, Goodrich's choice of Pamela Gordon to play the gangster's 
failing father is one of the more bizarre touches in a frequently bizarre 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Goldberg's "The Inn Amid Grove and Copses," in which a homeless 
modern-day Mary and Joseph seek shelter at a Portland bed-and-breakfast, 
derivatively travesties Ionesco. Unfortunately, Goldberg's limp direction kills 
the vestigial humor in his absurdist farce. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranting lunatics -- or at the very least outright eccentrics -- figure 
prominently in these dramas, and Wes Walker's "Crazy Mary," in which two women 
encounter a bloody madwoman, is no exception. Although his writing is sometimes 
pointlessly amorphous, Walker directs with a chilling precision that makes his 
meandering dialogue all the more creepy. Sharon Shayne is both elegant and 
ravaged as the fluttery schoolteacher Sofia, a combination of Jean Brodie and 
Blanche DuBois -- with a little Bald Soprano thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival closes with "The Only True Santa," John Steppling's terse, 
elliptical drama about a cheap department store Santa gripped in an existential 
crisis. A grim view from society's underbelly, this is vintage Steppling -- 
save for the underlying drollness that suggests that Steppling is deliberately 
parodying his own style. Amid this glum atmosphere, the tongue-in-cheek is 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponderous scene changes by the Three Wise Men and Mary need to be sped up so 
that this "Lost Festival" arrives at its destination more quickly. 
</P>

COUNTERPUNCH : MAKING ROOM FOR THE MINORITY SCREENWRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CALVIN R. BIRDSONG, Calvin R. Birdsong is president of the Organization of 
Black Screenwriters, which has 60 members who are actively pursuing careers in 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reported comments of "NYPD Blue" co-creator David Milch'NYPD' Figure Tries 
to Clarify Race Remarks," Calendar, Nov. 10) offer the opportunity for a 
much-needed discussion of the minority writer's role in the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Our group, the Organization of Black Screenwriters, has worked for six years 
to assist the development of African American screenwriters and their access to 
the industry through education and orientation projects. We note Milch's 
statement that his Oct. 15 remarks were taken out of context. However, we feel 
it important to respond to two of the points he reportedly made: 
</P>
<P>
 First, we support the need for "affirmative action for writers" in the most 
basic sense of a conscious, ongoing effort to increase the numbers of minority 
and female writers working in the entertainment industry. (Milch apparently 
expressed opposition to affirmative action for writers although he later said 
he is committed to finding qualified writers of all ethnicities.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A study by the Writers Guild West last year found that minority writers made 
up only 4% of the industry total. This is far below the ethnic makeup of the 
feature film and television audience. It is also far below what is achievable 
with applied effort. Projects such as writers' workshops and other efforts at 
inclusion have found a strong response from minority writers. More can and 
should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of American film and television projects will increasingly depend 
upon the industry's ability to portray our society's ethnic diversity in all 
its human complexity. The best and most consistent way to maintain such quality 
is through a steady increase in ethnic and gender diversity throughout the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, we disagree with the notion that black writers have a greater 
difficulty writing about the "dominant culture" than members of other ethnic 
groups. From birth, African Americans are inundated with the values, history 
and opinions of the dominant culture. Indeed, the challenge for blacks is to 
find their own ethnic perspective within that dominant culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the turn of the century, black writers such as W.E.B. Dubois have 
commented on the cultural duality that is a hallmark of African American life. 
This duality arises from the narrow perception that blacks have not 
substantially contributed to American culture. A strong element of "emotional 
neutrality" toward the dominant culture is an important survival mechanism for 
blacks in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual observers should be careful not to view the effects of inexperience and 
less training among some black screenwriters as an inherent obstacle to such 
writing by blacks. African American's dualistic role in this society gives us a 
unique creative perspective on the dominant culture. 
</P>
<P>
 We are very confident that over time, the ongoing development of black 
screenwriters, and their increased inclusion by the industry, will produce 
achievements comparable to that of African Americans in novels, poetry and 
indeed the whole array of creative work.

COUNTERPUNCH : THIS KIND OF 'DISCLOSURE' MISLEADING, DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELLY M. MANDELL, Shelly M. Mandell is a former president of the L.A. 
National Organization for Women and has been an advocate for women's rights for 
20 years. She is on the board of directors of L.A. NOW and a partner in the law 
firm of O'Donnell & Mandell. She and her partner, Jack O'Donnell, practice in 
the areas of civil rights, including discrimination, harassment of all types 
and family law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prior to the book's release, I received a call from a woman writer in 
Hollywood -- in "The Business" -- asking me if I knew Hollywood was launching 
sexual harassment onto the big screen -- and guess what?: a white, male 
corporate executive is going to play the victim. I said, "You're kidding." She 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Since reading "Disclosure" by Michael Crichton, I've withheld judgment pending 
the film's release (" 'Disclosure': The Plot Thickens . . . ," Calendar, Dec. 
9). As I entered the theater, I was armed with popcorn, Milk Duds and a 
preconception the movie would not comport with the type of sexual harassment I 
do battle with daily in my legal practice. I sat down with concern for the 
negative backlash this film could spring from its "loins." 
</P>
<P>
 I am now more concerned than I thought I would ever be. 
</P>
<P>
 My qualifications to pass judgment on this film? . . . Three points. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I am a woman who has actively participated in the American work force 
for 30 years. I experienced sexual harassment when it didn't have a name. Ask a 
woman in the real work force and she will tell you . . . the vile comments, the 
slaps on the butt, and the quid . . . "I can help you sweetheart if you're nice 
to me" . . . pro quo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traversing the Rubicon, I became a feminist and assisted the National 
Organization for Women in the creation of laws deterring abusive work force 
behavior toward women, gays and minorities. The law has since grown teeth, 
setting forth specific damage provisions aimed at perpetrators of harassment. 
Legislation was needed then; continuing enforcement is needed now. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, as an attorney in Los Angeles, I have encountered hundreds of victims 
seeking legal assistance for abuse at work, in schools, in residences and from 
husbands. Ninety-eight percent of these victims are women forced by social and 
economic realities to endure unlawful behavior in the name of "two kids and a 
missing father." . . . Glamorous? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, for all of us, Hollywood cheated. The film-going public and the 
countless employees in the garment industry, law enforcement, security and 
other fields were not considered as Crichton offered his twisted message. 
Reality was quickly pedaled away by the Stairmaster in the "perpetrator's" 
design command post. With macabre humor, a major social issue of our times is 
submerged in a gender-ironic confrontation between two people. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgotten is that the issue of sexual harassment is not about gender or sexual 
orientation. It's about people fostering integrity among themselves at home, at 
work and in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The film is an inaccurate diagnosis of a rampant social disease. Of course, 
sexual harassment is not about sex: It's about the misuse of power. The film, 
however, was about sex and personal agendas. Sexual harassment is about people 
forgetting other people are human and not only a vice president, secretary, 
student or wife. It's about people's fear of a lack of control over their own 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 To suggest otherwise, discloses nothing of value to society. In fact, it does 
just the opposite.

COUNTERPUNCH : HERE'S A FEW 'VAMPIRE' SUGGESTIONS TO CHEW ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN O'NEILL, Dan O'Neill is a fiction writer, essayist and critic who 
frequently writes about movies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all this year's films the one I've been most disappointed with is 
"Interview With the Vampire." The book was spellbinding. It offered charismatic 
characters and exotic locales. In Neil Jordan, the film had a director who in 
the past had shown exceptional talent for capturing the moods and nuances of 
people caught in complex and unusual situations. It should have been a classic 
horror film: scary and sexy. 
</P>
<P>
 What it ends up being is boring. There are no chills. And although there was 
supposed to be a homosexual subtext to the picture, it was so hidden I couldn't 
find it. The actors looked at the rats with more lust than they did at each 
other. It turned out to be the kind of project Eric Rohmer might have made had 
he been assigned to do a big-budget existentialist movie. After enduring it, I 
felt like one of the walking dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But enough about the past. The film billed itself as "the Vampire Chronicles," 
so obviously there are going to be sequels. So, I'd like them to get it right 
and improve in the future. Here are some suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 First, Tom Cruise is very good. He's not the tall European, aristocratic 
Lestat, but he's an aristocrat in his own right. He's very funny and very 
campy. He brings a lot of life and fun to the picture. In the right production, 
his performance could work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dump Brad Pitt. His one-note performance was too dreary. He's supposed to be 
grieving for his normal life, but there's nothing in his performance to 
indicate he wasn't a lump there too. Two-hundred years of his whining is too 
much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 If future projects don't give us a central character we can identify with and 
care about, they won't work. George Hamilton, who brought such style and pathos 
to his comedic role in "Love at First Bite," should be kept in mind as a 
possible role model. 
</P>
<P>
 As for directors, how about Roman Polanski? He's already made a horror film 
that was scary and funny in "Fearless Vampire Killers." Pedro Almodovar, 
another bad boy of European cinema, has an uncanny knack for depicting marginal 
people in weird situations. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if you want an American, we have our resident genius of comic horror: Tim 
Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 There is great black comedy subject matter with vampires in a new version of 
the nuclear family as the last party animals left in the world. Let's see them 
in action in Los Angeles, New York and this time give Paris its due as a 
hedonists' nightspot. 
</P>
<P>
 Done right, we can escape more drab snooze fests and have a "Rocky Horror 
Show" for the millennium.

JAZZ REVIEWS; RICHARD ELLIOT LETS HIS MOVES UPSTAGE HIS MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tenor sax player Richard Elliot, who performed with his band Saturday night at 
the Strand, may not sit on top of the pop instrumental sax heap, but he's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd pleaser, he tours about 120 days a year and sells lots of albums.But 
popularity and the ability to excite an audience don't necessarily translate 
into a musical experience that has impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic, ingratiating saxophonist kept the Strand audience happy with 
his mix of slow, pop ballads and driving pieces composed of short, punchy 
riffs. But much of that fan response had nothing to do with the music. 
</P>
<P>
 As he played, Elliot was constantly mobile -- moving around and bending, 
leaning, bouncing. Sometimes, he got down on his knees. Once, at the end of 
"When a Man Loves a Woman," he mock-collapsed on the stage, issuing whiny tones 
as he lay crouched.  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere during the show, he made two romps through the crowd, both greeted 
with rousing applause. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this extra-musical stuff seemed so silly. Elliot can really play and 
doesn't need to pander to the crowd with "show biz" tactics. When he wanted to, 
he engaged the audience with his big sound, smooth technique and rhythmic, 
appealing lines. 
</P>
<P>
 All the flashiness, and subsequent lack of focus on music, undermined many of 
the numbers, from an overblown "Over the Rainbow" to "When a Man Loves a 
Woman." "The Christmas Song" and a mellow groover, "Sweat," were more 
listenable. 
</P>
<P>
 He was given strong support by his band: Dave Reinhardt (drums), Naoki Yanai 
(bass), Richard Smith (guitar) and Ron Reinhardt (keyboards). ZAN STEWART

JAZZ REVIEWS; DESPITE 'SANTA,' BENOIT SET TURNS COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keyboardist David Benoit opened his show Friday at the Strand in brilliant 
fashion with the seasonal anthem of anticipation, "Santa Claus Is Coming to 
Town." But the promise of that first number faded in the absence of further 
delights. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing the trio arrangement heard on the late Bill Evans "Trio '64" 
recording, Benoit turned the holiday ditty into a vehicle of expression, 
playing at the pace of a pixie's dance while coloring the mood with ironic, 
bluesy touches. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the pianist's delivery was a bit busy -- some pause would have 
emphasized the sardonic nature of his reading -- the tune was easily the 
evening's highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 But from there, with the addition of sax and electric guitar, things turned 
cold. Playing largely from his recent "Shaken Not Stirred" recording, Benoit 
resorted to the kind of bland material that gives his expressive talents little 
showcase. His repetitive, all-too-pleasant themes were warmly received, but 
most gave him little chance to show any emotional depth. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little variation in the rotating mix of backbeat and ballad numbers. 
"Chi-Chi's Eyes" contained some clever, veiled references to Paul Desmond's 
"Take 5" and Jeff Kashiwa's flute work gave the tune a comforting grace. Many 
of the numbers featured the classical stateliness that has become Benoit's 
signature, but none took advantage of that cultured mood, dissolving instead 
into the kind of simple lines that mark the worst of fusion jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Kenny Rankin joined the band for a thin performance of Lorraine 
Feather's thoughtful lyric to Benoit's "Days of Old," and David Pack gave a 
strong reading of the throwaway words he penned for the pianist's "Any Other 
Time." On sax, Kashiwa, always strong with pop-flavored material, brightened 
some songs with solos. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benoit never topped the feeling he generated with "Santa Claus." There 
were moments during Vince Guaraldi's "Charlie Brown Theme" when the pianist 
threatened to cut loose -- but ultimately didn't. All in all, this was an 
evening that could have used more naughty and less nice. BILL KOHLHAASE

TV REVIEWS; DELICATE TELLING OF 'ONE CHRISTMAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first dramatization of Truman Capote's short story "One Christmas" spins a 
delicate coming-of-age tale that is unequivocally Capote country. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Tony Bill is faithful to the personal tone of the material, which 
features Henry Winkler, Julie Harris and Katharine Hepburn among a veteran 
cast, and the production lovingly captures the holiday warmth of 1930 upscale 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The script by producer Duane Poole crucially suggests a child's viewpoint and 
mirrors Capote's edginess, lack of sentimentality and sense of childhood candor 
and wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Framed by the whiff of bittersweet personal reminiscence, the story is 
anything but a fluffy Christmas card. It opens in rural Alabama, where a shy 
8-year-old boy (T.J. Lowther) is reluctantly put on a bus to New Orleans by his 
devoted, garrulous cousin (Harris), who has raised him. She fills the boy with 
awe by promising him that "it will snow" in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, it does snow, in a magical way, but not before our innocent young 
traveler has run a gantlet of characters and life-changing experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the wide-eyed lad is his estranged father (Winkler), a 
street-smart peacock of a ladies' man whose exotic cafe society lifestyle and 
relentless hustling both bedazzle and scare his son.  
</P>
<P>
 Winkler, an endearing liar in arguably his freshest performance, is terrific 
as a complex, slip 'n' slide con man desperate to do all the right father 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Hepburn, she's barely in the movie, appearing only in a series of short 
scenes as a flinty New Orleans grande dame wary of Winkler's encroachments on 
her society daughter (Swoosie Kurtz). Physically, Hepburn looks fine but her 
voice is sometimes inaudible and her casting is frankly more sentimental than 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
 The copper-toned cinematography (Thomas Del Buth) and the production design 
(C. Robert Holloway) lend the movie a warm sheen. * "One Christmas" airs on at 
9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39). RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; 'TENNESSEE WILLIAMS': A FRAGILE MASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tragedy of Tennessee Williams' career isn't fully expressed in the new 
documentary portrait for the "American Masters" series, "Tennessee Williams: 
Orpheus of the American Stage," but, then, no single television program could 
fully encapsulate the man's poetic gifts and colossal self-abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the first postwar American playwright to reach stardom, and the first 
to watch that star crash terribly to Earth. To this day, Williams' 
extraordinary string of artistic and commercial triumphs signifies a kind of 
watermark for the ambitious American writer. His demolition by a hostile press 
and his seemingly self-indulgent drug and alcohol excesses also signify the 
American writer's worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the very obsession of the light and dark sides of the human being that 
course through his best plays extend to his own personality -- and celebrity. 
It makes for a complex, heady brew, and this program takes a few sips of it 
when you want producer-director Merrill Brockway to chug it all down. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous documentaries on Williams, especially one made by Harry Rasky in the 
late 1970s, traveled much deeper into Williams' mind -- largely because 
Williams spoke on-camera with a directness of which few writers are capable. In 
the new film, we can glimpse that directness in a series of brief interview 
clips (from Mike Wallace in 1958 to Dick Cavett and David Frost in 1970). 
</P>
<P>
 But because Williams has been dead 11 years, others must speak for him. 
Williams is perhaps the only subject on which Gore Vidal is a softy, and he 
shows it here. Old pal Maureen Stapleton is far more revealing and honest, 
evincing love, concern and impatience for her gifted, fragile friend. 
Playwright Edward Albee eloquently offers the playwright's case, and critic 
Robert Brustein provides the best insight: Williams' lyricism stemmed from his 
ability to let his characters roam free. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brockway is very good at visually linking references in key plays such 
as "The Glass Menagerie," "Streetcar Named Desire" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" 
to elements from the playwright's life, the strongest impression left is how 
well Williams' work is preserved on film. Long clips from even the lesser-known 
films, such as "The Fugitive Kind" (his adaptation of "Orpheus Descending" with 
a virile Marlon Brando and an incandescent Anna Magnani), keep the poetry and 
passion intact, played out by some of the century's best actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the clips may feel dated, but they testify to how Hollywood was once 
marginally concerned with putting literary voices on the screen, and how, when 
a playwright dies, he becomes a filmmaker. Drowning himself in the 1960s in 
drugs, booze, paranoia and self-pity, Williams couldn't keep up with the 
celebrity that Broadway success made possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the presence of Albee here, flush with the new success of "Three 
Tall Women," is a reminder that Williams could have come back had he not risen 
each morning with the "chemical cocktails" his friends describe. The legacy of 
Williams is all the fine plays; the tragedy is all the fine plays that never 
were. 
</P>

IN L.A., MUSICIANS HEAR THE SIREN CALL -- AND HOPE; JAZZ: FIRST-RATE LOCAL 
MUSICIANS HOPE FOR A BREAKTHROUGH IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELD VIA A RECORDING, BUT 
THE ODDS ARE AGAINST THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's the good news: Los Angeles may have more first-rate jazz musicians in 
residence than any other city in the world. (OK, Gothamites, with the outside 
exception of New York City.) 
</P>
<P>
 And here's the bad: Very few jazz players (here or in New York) are making a 
living in their chosen field. Many, in fact, owe their survival to income from 
film, television and recording studio work, weekend weddings and parties, and 
an occasional tour in support of a pop singer. 
</P>
<P>
 The siren call for every jazz musician is the possibility of breaking out of 
this semi-anonymous world via a recording -- preferably on a major label. But 
the Catch-22 that players face is the fact that major labels are primarily 
interested in performers with potential commercial sizzle: young, widely touted 
winners of prestigious competitions such as Joshua Redman and Jacky Terrasson; 
immigrants with a salable story to tell, such as Cuban expatriate Gonzalo 
Rubalcaba; or already well-established and highly visible artists such as the 
various members of the Marsalis family. 
</P>
<P>
 But for jazz musicians, hope springs eternal. If the large companies aren't 
interested, many players surmise, then why not try the small ones? And, in a 
worse case scenario, there's always the longshot chance of catching lightning 
in a bottle by putting out one's own album. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, sadly, it doesn't work. Lightning doesn't strike much around 
L.A. these days. But, if nothing else, the product issued by small independent 
record companies provides appealing musical rewards for the jazz fan with a 
little curiosity and a lot of persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 In this random survey of small label recordings, the most notable aspect is 
the minimal number of albums by African American and Latino players. Sadly, 
this is an accurate reflection of the product being released on small labels in 
Southern California, suggesting that both the financial and the social 
integration of the jazz community -- for whatever reason -- still have a long 
way to go. Despite the limited creative perspective that results, the 
collection nonetheless reveals the uncommon array of ear-catching music being 
produced by a few of the Southland's intrepid local musical heroes. These 
albums are generally available or can be ordered at major record stores: 
</P>
<P>
 "Skyway" (Soul Note Records) (** 1/2), for example, a new release from drummer 
Adam Rudolph's world music-tinged group, Moving Pictures, blends free-blowing 
solos with gripping percussion undertones. This is a fascinating take on jazz 
as music that reaches for, and often connects with, the improvisational spirit 
that drives the expressive voices of the world's other musical cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Jeff Gauthier's "Internal Memo" (9 Winds Records) (**) moves through 
a different fringe of the jazz mainstream. Gauthier's compositions are quirky 
and offbeat, bubbling with unexpected rhythms and occasional warm lyricism. His 
violin-playing, however, is upstaged by the powerful rhythm section of pianist 
Dave Witham, drummer Alex Cline and bassist Eric von Essen. Each solos 
impressively, with Cline bringing dramatic avant-garde fervor to his backup 
efforts. On one track, the gifted Von Essen adds some effective chromatic 
harmonica playing to his bass work. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran tenor saxophonist Bill Perkins is a survivor of '50s West Coast jazz 
whose playing has remained persistently forward-looking over the years. On 
"Frame of Mind" (Inter-play Records) (***) his solos are filled with a 
slipping, sliding articulation that curiously juxtaposes Ornette Colemanesque 
phrasing against a cool, Lester Young-based sound. It's a fascinating kind of 
risk-taking adventurousness, enhanced by Frank Strazzeri's hard-swinging, 
ever-probing piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Recordings from former "Tonight Show" orchestra trombonist Bruce Paulson and 
pianist Dave Ferris take a more middle-of-the-road approach. Paulson's 
"Minnesota" (Sea Breeze Records) (**) features a mixed bag of standards and 
jazz lines played with grooving exuberance by a band that spotlights 
saxophonist Bob Sheppard and pianist Bill Cunliffe. Unfortunately, the 
pleasantries of Paulson's epigrammatic improvisational style are too often 
brushed aside by the solos of the ever-busy Sheppard, who also figures 
prominently in Ferris' "The Quiet One," (9 Winds) (**). Sheppard's brusque, 
aggressive tenor dominates on this album, as well, tempered only by Ferris' 
catchy melodies. Perhaps not surprisingly, Ferris plays better on two tracks in 
which Sheppard is not present. Even there, the pianist's lines, despite their 
harmonic interest, are undercut by an awkward, rhythmic ungainliness.

 No such problem with Rickey Woodard, who probably could make a Gregorian chant 
swing. Including his new release on Concord, "Yazoo," (***) in a group of small 
label outings may seem like slipping in a ringer. But Woodard is a player who 
has labored long and hard with a minimum of recognition, and Concord -- even 
with a prolific release schedule -- is not precisely a major label. Besides, 
it's a splendid, entertaining album, in which Woodard, with trumpeter Ray Brown 
and the first-rate local rhythm team of Cedar Walton on piano, Jeff Littleton 
on bass and Ralph Penland on drums plays an irresistibly appealing program of 
pure, straight-ahead, classic jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. is blessed with a host of excellent arrangers, and Tom Kubis is one of 
the finest. On "A Perfect Match" (Real Records) (** 1/2) he has orchestrated an 
album's worth of charts for a big-band, little-band combination of the Swedish 
"Bohustan" large ensemble and "The Real Thing," Sweden's most popular small 
jazz group. Kubis' orchestrations are superb, virtual primers of big-band 
writing, executed with enthusiasm and commanding skill by the talented Swedish 
players. And on several of the up-tempo choruses -- "Scratch My Back" is a good 
example -- the orchestrations and the players come together with an energy and 
drive comparable to the best large American jazz ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big-band release, "The Music of Pat Metheny & Lyle Mays," (MAMA 
Foundation) (** 1/2) assembles a potpourri of Metheny & Mays music performed in 
massive, Stan Kentonish charts by former Kenton trombonist Bob Curnow. The 
group, which includes such accomplished soloists as (among others) trumpeters 
Bobby Shew and Wayne Bergeron, saxophonist Danny House and guitarist Paul 
Viapiano, leans heavily in the Kenton direction, sacrificing some of the 
contemporary qualities of Metheny & Mays in the process. But the recording is 
excellent, the charts well-crafted, and Curnow's disciplined L.A. Big Band 
gives a pretty fair indication of what a Kenton ensemble might sound like in 
the '90s.

RAIDERS WIN BY A WHISKER, 17-16; PRO FOOTBALL: SEAHAWKS COME CLOSE BUT KASAY'S 
MISSED FIELD GOAL IS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE VICTORY FOR L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler has decided he won't shave until his team 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has his beard this morning, but only by a hair. 
</P>
<P>
 When John Kasay's 43-yard field-goal attempt sailed just wide right with nine 
seconds to play, the Raiders were finally able to celebrate a 17-16 victory on 
Sunday that left them at 9-6 and left a Kingdome crowd of 53,301 stunned and 
silent for the first time all evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't tend to make things easy," said Coach Art Shell, the sweat from the 
tension-filled ending still on his face moments after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a 77-yard, fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Hostetler to Tim Brown 
to finally put the Seahawks away. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. After all, the Seahawks were coming into 
the game with a 6-8 record. They were coming in with 16 injured players, 
including eight starters. They were coming in with a green quarterback who was 
making only his fourth career start in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 They were coming in with an offense built around a running back playing with 
two broken ribs, who was limited even further as the evening wore on by a 
twisted ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some green quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Some injured running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Warren, broken ribs and twisted ankle and all, rushed for 122 yards, 
averaged 5.1 yards per carry, and scored on a 33-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Dan McGwire, filling in for injured starter Rick Mirer, completed 
only 14 of 34 passes for 166 yards without a touchdown. But he put together the 
crucial final drive that nearly won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been easier for the Raiders if they had been able to keep their 
offensive line together. That line has suffered all season from injuries and 
inconsistency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday night provided the line its biggest test. It's bad enough coming 
into the Kingdome where the decibel level of the crowd has left more than one 
offensive line unable to hear the desperate cries of its quarterback, yelling 
signals accompanied by background noise as loud as a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it is under the best of circumstances. Sunday night, the 
Raiders faced the worst of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Left tackle Gerald Perry was knocked out of the game in the second quarter 
because of a concussion when he was hit in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 His replacement, Robert Jenkins, was thrown out of the game in the third 
quarter when he was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 That forced Shell to move Greg Skrepenak from right tackle to fill in for 
Jenkins at left tackle, Kevin Gogan from right guard to right tackle, and 
veteran Max Montoya in at right guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow it all worked when it had to, although Hostetler was sacked five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in an awkward position," Gogan said. "They were able to pin their 
ears back and come because they knew we had to throw." 
</P>
<P>
 It was on one of those Seahawk sacks that Jenkins lost his cool and his chance 
to finish the game. 
</P>
<P>
 When Antonio Edwards celebrated over the fallen Hostetler after recording a 
sack, Jenkins shoved Edwards, bringing Seattle's Rufus Porter into the act with 
a shove of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it for Jenkins, who was given the first ejection of his professional 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a guy should celebrate," Jenkins said. "But it seems to be the 
thing going on in the league this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders took the early lead before all the problems with the offensive 
line began, Harvey Williams, who led the Raiders with 93 yards rushing, scored 
on a five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasay answered with a 41-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Jaeger's 24-yard field goal gave the Raiders a 10-3 lead, but Warren's 
run evened the game before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the ball back at their own 18-yard line with less than a minute to 
play in the half, the Raiders chose to run out the clock on the ground and take 
the tie into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more Kasay field goals, from 50 and 33 yards, put Seattle on top, 16-10, 
until Hostetler and Brown pulled the Raiders back on top with one blistering 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I held the strong safety as long as I could," said Hostetler in explaining 
why he looked left before going back to Brown down the right sideline. "Then, I 
let it fly and Tim caught it in stride." 
</P>
<P>
 It sure looked like the Seahawks were done. Especially when a fumble, 
consecutive penalties and an incomplete pass left them with a fourth and 17 at 
their 19-yard line with 1:34 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGwire completed passes of 19 and 32 yards to Kelvin Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Two runs by Warren put Kasay in position. He had already made several booming 
kicks. The two sides lined up and Kasay swung his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit it good," he said. "It was a great snap and a great hold. This is a 
crazy game and I don't know if I'll ever understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 While Kasay tried to figure it all out, Raider special-teams player Dan Turk 
stood over his Seattle counterpart Trey Junkin and yelled, "You lose, Junkin." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawk responded with a slap against Turk's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Turk never felt it. He was too busy enjoying the razor-thin victory.

BETTIS CAN'T RUN AND RAMS CAN'T HIDE IN CHICAGO; PRO FOOTBALL: BEARS HOLD THE 
RUNNING BACK TO SEVEN YARDS IN EIGHT CARRIES IN 27-13 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Present woeful results suggest Red Grange has a better chance than Jerome 
Bettis of gaining the 23 yards Bettis needs to reach 1,000, and, like the Rams, 
he's dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a Chicago defense that surrendered 247 rushing yards to Green Bay a 
week earlier, Bettis, who set a preseason goal of 2,000 yards, piled up seven 
yards in eight carries in his poorest NFL performance. The Bears (9-6) not only 
grounded Bettis, but pulled away from the Rams with 163 rushing yards of their 
own in a 27-13 victory before 56,276 at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who carried a club-record 39 times against the Bears in a 20-6 victory 
to close out the 1993 season, has averaged 2.3 yards per carry during the Rams' 
six-game losing streak and has 977 yards in 304 carries for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to the point now," Bettis said, "that if we were just by ourselves 
(facing no defense) it would be hard to execute the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis' day began with a dropped pass, included a serious finger injury that 
sidelined him late in the third quarter, and ended with a reporter accidentally 
popping him in the head with a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just kill me, why don't you?" Bettis said in jest. "Things are rough, all 
right. As an offense I think it's to the point where we have lost confidence in 
running the ball. I didn't have a good day by any stretch of the imagination, 
and I think it took its toll on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram offense has not only gone into full retreat, it has placed the team's 
quarterbacks in harm's way. After Bettis fumbled, and the Rams recovered for no 
gain at the Bear one-yard line in the first quarter, Chris Chandler called a 
sneak and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bettis went nowhere on second and goal from the four-yard line in the 
second quarter, Chandler tried another bravo dive, and was blasted by a trio of 
defenders one yard shy of the goal line. The Rams (4-11) settled for a field 
goal, but the blow Chandler suffered eventually forced him from the game with a 
bruised kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Bettis' sluggish play, the Rams had a 10-3 lead early in the second 
quarter before collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have no answers," said linebacker Shane Conlan, who played in three 
Super Bowls with the Buffalo Bills. "The way we played on defense, I'm just 
very embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Ram offense shut down in the second quarter, Bear rookie running 
back Raymont Harris, who scored his first NFL touchdown and ran 23 times for 92 
yards, dictated the terms of surrender. The Bears' 27 points were the most 
scored by the team's offense since the third game of the 1993 season when the 
offense posted 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries to defensive tackles Sean Gilbert (bruised ribs) and Jimmie Jones 
(bruised abdomen) contributed to the Bears' offensive binge. Running back Lewis 
Tillman, providing relief for Harris, gained 69 yards in 14 carries and an 
extra one-yard touchdown for security in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like we're kind of falling apart," said Robert Young, Ram 
defensive end. "Injuries are setting in, and times are just getting harder and 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor play on special teams, which plagued the Rams when they were healthy 
earlier this season, continued to be the team's nemesis. Chicago defensive 
lineman Alonzo Spellman, who was left almost unchecked, blocked a 42-yard Tony 
Zendejas field-goal try on the final play of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Todd Kinchen, who mishandled three punts in the last three 
weeks, fumbled a punt return to set up a 30-yard field goal by Kevin Butler in 
the third quarter to increase the Bears' lead to 20-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't get it done, and it's been like that all season across the 
board," said Ram defensive end Fred Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's because we have young guys or because guys are hurt or 
what. We're not dead, but we probably wish we were dead a long time ago the way 
things have gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, it's like you have this intense pain and you just wish it would 
go away. But it's not going to go away until after next Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' run for respectability mounted some momentum in the fourth quarter 
after an erratic Chris Miller had put the team in position to score. Miller, 
playing in relief of Chandler, completed nine of 22 passes for 69 yards, and 
appeared to have thrown a four-yard touchdown pass to tight end Troy Drayton to 
bring the Rams to within a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Rams celebrated, an official standing in the back of the end zone 
waved his hands in disapproval. The official ruled Drayton juggled the ball, 
and allowed it to hit the ground before securing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy Drayton caught that ball in the end zone," Coach Chuck Knox said. 
"That's a touchdown. There ain't no ifs, ands or buts about it. The field 
judge, who was removed totally from the play. . . . according to our people who 
saw replays, they confirmed it was a catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton said the same thing, but replays appeared inconclusive. They showed 
Drayton juggling the ball, and losing it down his leg as he fell. The 
incomplete ruling forced the Rams to settle for a 21-yard Zendejas field goal 
with 9:10 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears responded with a 26-yard kickoff return and a 10- play, 59-yard 
drive for Tillman's decisive one-yard touchdown plunge with 3:36 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started so well and I thought this was going to be our day," Stokes said. 
"But then it just fell apart, kind of like our whole season."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; CHIME IS RIGHT FOR AN UPSET

<TEXT>
<P>
 Phillip Chime's layup with 10.7 seconds to play in overtime lifted Texas San 
Antonio to an 87-85 upset victory over 13th-ranked Arizona State on Sunday 
night at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (5-2) led by 10 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Texas San Antonio (3-2) sent the game into overtime when Marlon Anderson's 
layup with two-tenths of a second remaining tied the score at 74-74. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Johnson's layup with 4:11 to play gave Texas San Antonio its first lead 
since the game's opening basket. Darren Webber scored six of the Roadrunners' 
next eight points to give Texas San Antonio an 84-80 lead with 45.5 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 An offensive foul on Arizona State guard Marcell Capers seemed to ice the game 
for the Roadrunners, but Chime was given a technical for hanging on the rim 
after he was whistled for traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Burton made the technical free throws to pull Arizona State within 
84-82. Thaddeus Wordlaw made a free throw to extend the Roadrunners' lead, but 
Sun Devil forward Ron Riley made his second three-point basket with 15.4 
seconds remaining to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arizona State watched Riley's basket go through the net, Chime ran 
downcourt and made the decisive basket off a long inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph's 60, No. 22 Villanova 57 -- Carlin Warley's free throw and Dmitri 
Domani's two foul shots in the final 30 seconds lifted the Hawks (3-0) over the 
Wildcats (4-3) at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 After Villanova's Kerry Kittles tied the score at 57-57 on a layup with one 
minute to play, Warley was fouled by Jonathan Haynes. Warley made the first of 
two free throws with 27.9 seconds remaining before Villanova called time out 
with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Domani then drew an offensive foul on Haynes and converted both foul shots 
with 2.6 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Bass and Bernard Blunt had 13 points each for St. Joseph's.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN LAST TRIP TO PASADENA, THEY GOT DEAL ON EARLY RESERVATIONS 
</P>

 Penn State earned its spot in the Rose Bowl this year by winning the Big Ten 
championship, but it wasn't that way the last time the Nittany Lions came West 
for the 1923 game. 
</P>
<P>
 After the team went undefeated in 1920 and 1921, Penn State officials signed a 
contract with the Tournament of Roses for the 1923 game in the spring of 1922 
-- six months before the season. The pact looked good when the Nittany Lions 
won their first five games, but they won only one of their final five to finish 
6-3-1, one of the poorest records in Rose Bowl history. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Rose Bowl: California's Wonder Team, champions of the West and undefeated 
for the third consecutive season, turned down a bid to play Penn State in 1923 
because of its weak record. USC, which had lost only to Cal, gladly accepted 
its first Rose Bowl invitation and defeated the Nittany Lions, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Penn State Coach Joe Paterno is a graduate of Brown University. 
What other well-known Brown graduate -- who played in a Rose Bowl game -- also 
coached in the game? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really: The late Duffy Daugherty, when he coached at Michigan State, never 
believed in the importance of spring practice. "It doesn't tell you anything," 
he said. "It's like having your daughter coming in at four o'clock in the 
morning holding a Gideon Bible." 
</P>
<P>
 Riding in style: Washington running back Napoleon Kaufman lost his chance to 
play in the Rose Bowl when the Huskies were placed on probation, but the 
Pacific 10 offensive player of the year will be in Pasadena on game day. 
Kaufman will represent the East-West Shrine Game on the Masonic float during 
the Tournament of Roses parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock bottom: Bob Glauber, writing in the Sporting News, lists the 28 NFL teams 
in order of their fans' devotion. The Rams are No. 28. Glauber's comment on 
their basement status: 
</P>
<P>
 "How bad are Rams fans? Bet you we don't get one letter or phone call about 
their last-place rating." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his quarterbacks: Sam Wyche, the Tampa Bay Buccaneer coach, is an 
incurable optimist. After he was bombarded with trash thrown from the stands -- 
including a pair of binoculars -- as he trotted off the field after a loss, his 
reaction was, "The good news is we didn't have anybody with very good aim." 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know?A National Hot Rod Assn. top fuel dragster leaves the starting 
line with a force nearly five times that of gravity, the same force a space 
shuttle has when it leaves the launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
 The right genes: Bruk Vandeweghe of the Miller Lite Pro Beach Volleyball Tour 
is the son of former Miss America Colleen Hutchins and former NBA star Ernie 
Vandeweghe. Bruk's siblings include brother Kiki, a former UCLA and NBA player; 
and sisters Taune, a 1984 Olympic swimmer, and Heather, captain of the national 
women's polo team. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Wallace Wade, who played for Brown in 1916, coached Alabama in 
1926, 1927 and 1931 and Duke in 1939 and 1942.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sleeping in Seattle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Raiders seemed to be doing Sunday night when they were 
fortunate to beat a grossly inferior team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is assumed that they will play with more intensity Saturday in the Coliseum 
against the Kansas City Chiefs, who have beaten them in nine of their last 10 
regular-season and playoff games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't much difference between the playing personnel of the Rams and the 
Chicago Bears. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the Rams might have an edge. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bears defeated the Rams, 27-13, at Soldier Field, are 9-6, and are 
very much alive in the playoff race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are 4-11, losers of six in a row, and out of the playoffs for the 
fifth consecutive season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best explanation is that the Bears' Dave Wannstedt is in the 
invigorating, early stages of what likely will be a distinguished coaching 
career, while the Rams' Chuck Knox is just about at the end of what has been a 
distinguished career. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wannstedt should be regarded as the leading coach-of-the-year candidate in the 
NFC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Another coach doing a terrific job is Bobby Ross. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's 21-6 victory over the New York Jets gave the Chargers their second 
AFC West title in their three years under Ross. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years before Ross' arrival from Georgia Tech, the Chargers twice 
finished last under Dan Henning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't think the NFC is virtually a cinch to win the Super Bowl again, 
you weren't paying attention to the conference showdowns: Pittsburgh-Cleveland 
Sunday and San Francisco-Dallas last month. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That was nice of Jimmy Johnson to confirm the exclusives of ESPN, NBC and 
dozens of newspapers that he is staying with Fox TV instead of returning to 
coaching. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Announcers Kevin Harlan and Jerry Glanville were much too kind to the Rams, 
often praising them for "not quitting." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Glanville was a lot funnier as a coach than he is as a commentator. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Steve Young wasn't having one of the best years ever by a quarterback, 
Barry Sanders would be the most valuable player in the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' most remarkable statistic is his six runs of more than 60 yards this 
season, compared to three for the rest of the league. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Break up the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 No list of the league's most exciting quarterbacks would be complete without 
Brett Favre. . . .

 Favre, who led Green Bay to a comeback victory over Atlanta in the Packers' 
last game at County Stadium in Milwaukee, is great one minute, awful the next, 
and rarely ordinary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on NBC for conducting an interview promoting its upcoming golf coverage 
during game action at Candlestick Park on Saturday. Poor Dick Enberg turned 
around too late and misidentified Anthony Miller as Glyn Milburn during a long 
Denver pass play. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sorry that the Buffalo Bills won't be playing in Miami on Jan. 29, 
1995, but their accomplishment in reaching four consecutive Super Bowls never 
should be minimized. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You know the party is over at Rich Stadium when only 56,784 attend an 
important game against New England and more than 9,000 ticket-holders don't 
show up. . . .

 I couldn't get enough UCLA basketball Saturday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Neither could the other ESPN viewers who were unable to watch the Bruins' rout 
of LSU at Baton Rouge until only 1:17 was left in the first half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was that the first game of a doubleheader in Atlanta went into 
double overtime, delaying the start of ESPN's Louisville-Georgia Tech telecast. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Cardinals had beaten the Yellow Jackets, UCLA had a 39-30 lead 
over LSU. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the major networks, ESPN doesn't have separate feeds and couldn't break 
away from Atlanta to show the UCLA game to the Southern California audience. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 While beating LSU by 20 points for the second consecutive time, the Bruins 
demonstrated uncommon depth and their most intense team defense in years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In games that were shown in their entirety Saturday, Arizona's victory at 
Texas El Paso and California's win over Minnesota also showed the strength of 
the Pacific-10 Conference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be long before Howard Schnellenberger has Oklahoma back among the 
nation's football powers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine all the hours of torrid negotiating that must have gone into the trade 
that sent Ben VanRyn from the Dodgers to Cincinnati for William Brunson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs the Senators when Washington is first in war, first in peace and 
last in the NFC?

 TV IS EASIER 
</P>
<P>
 When Jimmy Johnson finally made his much-hyped, orchestrated and expected 
announcement Sunday on Fox's NFL pregame show that he was forgoing coaching 
offers to stay in television, colleague James Brown asked: 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to feel comfortable walking away from $3 1/2 million?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown apparently knew what he was talking about. A television source close to 
Johnson said the Philadelphia Eagles recently offered him a base salary of $2.5 
million with another $1 million coming from TV and other ancillary deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources estimated that Fox, which has signed Johnson to a new three-year 
contract, would pay him in the $800,000-$900,000 range, with HBO chipping in 
other $300,000 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking with reporters after he got off the air, Johnson said: "I've found 
something at this stage of my life I love more than coaching football." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the problem with coaching is the amount of time he feels he must 
devote to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Dallas, I lived three blocks from my office, and there wasn't one day 
during the year when I didn't go into the office," he said. "I just don't want 
to again devote my entire being to thinking of nothing but winning football 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Might he change his mind? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can any of us predict what we will be doing or how we will be thinking three 
years from now?" he said. "I plan to fulfill my contract with Fox." THANKS FOR 
THE BRATWURST 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, there was, well, the end. 
</P>
<P>
 After Green Bay Packer quarterback Brett Favre dived over the goal line for a 
touchdown that beat the Atlanta Falcons, 21-17, with 14 seconds to play, he 
saluted the fans of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope they really enjoyed it," Favre said, "because I sure did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers have played a portion of their home schedule in Milwaukee every 
year since 1933. But in a revenue-generating move, the product of 108 luxury 
boxes, they decided to play all their home games at Lambeau Field, 120 miles 
away in Green Bay, beginning next season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers finished with a 107-63-1 record at Milwaukee and went out in 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 When Green Bay Coach Mike Holmgren left the field, he climbed a pile of snow 
near the first-base dugout, pumped his fists into the air and blew kisses to 
the crowd of 54,885 at County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Milwaukee! Thank you," he hollered over and over. NO. 5 ON HIS 
MISS PARADE 
</P>
<P>
 Losing to the New England Patriots, 41-17, hurt Buffalo Bill Coach Marv Levy 
deeply, but then again, he has had practice at it. There were defeats in Super 
Bowls XXV-XXVIII, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "We forget the Super Bowl the day after the day after it's played," Levy said 
again and again. "We look at every season as a fresh start." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah? How about Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "From my standpoint -- other than the Super Bowl losses -- I can't remember a 
game where I've been more disappointed, or feel worse about, than this one," 
Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because he's fighting the future, which looks as bleak as a Buffalo 
winter. Nostalgia doesn't keep you warm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a feeling of sadness that we are not the team we have been," Levy said. 
LONG NIGHT, LONGER DAY 
</P>
<P>
 Cris Dishman of the Houston Oilers was a bleary-eyed father for the game at 
Kansas City, maybe because he remembered what happened to David Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Dishman's wife went into labor shortly before midnight Saturday, and he lined 
up a charter flight to Houston to be there for the 7:12 a.m. delivery. Then he 
flew back to Kansas City, arriving 90 minutes before the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Williams, an Oiler offensive lineman, missed a game and was fined 
a week's pay when his wife went into labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Dishman and Chris Jr. are fine, actually in better shape than the 
Oilers, who lost, 31-9. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 The end justifies the Means: Natrone Means rushed for 73 yards in 23 carries, 
giving him a Charger-record 1,265 yards. He broke the mark of 1,225 set by 
Marion Butts in 1990. . . . San Diego won its second AFC West title in three 
years. The Chargers have won the division five times -- the others were from 
1979-81. They have never won the AFC championship. . . . New England became the 
first team in NFL history to have five receivers with more than 50 catches in a 
season. Vincent Brisby has 51 after making four catches Sunday. The other New 
England receivers with more than 50 catches are AFC leader Ben Coates with 93, 
Michael Timpson with 71, LeRoy Thompson with and Kevin Turner with 52. . . . 
Whoa, Nellie: Miami's Keith Jackson claimed the Miami record for receptions by 
a tight end with his second catch of the day, topping the mark of 54 set by 
Bruce Hardy in 1986. New England's Rickey Reynolds became the first opponent to 
return a fumble for a touchdown against the Bills since teammate Vincent Brown 
did it in November, 1992. . . . Thurman Thomas rushed for 77 yards, giving him 
1,057 for the season. Thomas has rushed for at least 1,000 yards in six 
consecutive seasons, breaking a team record held by O.J. Simpson. . . . That 
guy Kenn, he's a real doll: Atlanta tackle Mike Kenn, a 17-year pro, became the 
seventh player in history to play in 250 games. The others are George Blanda, 
Jim Marshall, Jan Stenerud, Earl Marshall, Jackie Slater and Pat Leahy. . . . 
Atlanta's Craig Heyward surpassed 1,000 combined yards for the first time in 
his career. His eight touchdowns are the most by a Falcon running back since 
Gerald Riggs in 1986. . . . At least they only have to erase the first name in 
the record book: Brian Mitchell set a record for most yards on kickoff and punt 
returns this season with 1,792. He passed Arizona's Stump Mitchell, who had 
1,737 yards in 1981. . . . Henry Ellard had 60 receiving yards to move into 
fifth place for receiving yards in a Redskin season with 1,316. . . . Once 
again proving Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz had no idea what she was talking 
about: The Redskins became only the sixth team in NFL history to go winless at 
home. The others were New Orleans and Seattle in 1980, Dallas in 1989, New 
England in 1990 and Indianapolis in 1991. . . . With one game remaining, Miami 
is still waiting to score its first touchdown in the first quarter. The 
Dolphins have been outscored in the opening quarter, 82-15, but have outscored 
the opposition in every other quarter. . . . Miami's Dan Marino extended his 
league record of 4,000-yard seasons to six in the first half. Marino reached 
another milestone in the second half when he became the second quarterback in 
history to attempt 6,000 passes. Only Fran Tarkenton, with 6,467 in an 18-year 
career, attempted more. . . . Atlanta's Terance Mathis has caught at least four 
passes in every game this season. . . . The Steelers' Kevin Greene, who leads 
the AFC with 14 sacks, did not have one Sunday. His next one will be the 100th 
of his career. SAFE AT HOME? 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay Buccaneer Coach Sam Wyche is in jeopardy of losing his job after his 
third losing season, and Tampa is in danger of losing the team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Wyche was grasping at straws Sunday after the Buccaneers 
won their fourth game in a row, this at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wyche: "It generates enthusiasm locally and contributes to the logic that 
we should keep the team together. The players, the coaches and the management 
want to stay in Tampa." ANAHEIM BROWNS? 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Brown owner Art Modell has joined the growing list of sports 
franchise owners who want a stadium with all the bells, whistles and luxury 
boxes, but Cuyahoga County and city officials say they don't have $300 million 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they just spent $447 million on the Gateway sports complex to house 
the Indians and Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't ask the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor believes there has to be local public and private financial 
support before the state should be asked to participate," said Mike Dawson, a 
spokesman for Gov. George Voinovich, former mayor of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Modell might move the team, current Cleveland Mayor Michael White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, how about Anaheim, to replace the Rams if they move to St. Louis? There 
is precedent, after all. They were originally the Cleveland Rams. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Denver linebacker Dave Wyman reinjured his right knee Saturday and will 
require surgery that has finished his season. . . . The New York Jets lost 
quarterback Boomer Esiason because of a concussion when he was hit in the 
helmet by San Diego's Junior Seau in the second quarter, but he is expected 
back Saturday against Houston. There was no penalty called. Even if he comes 
back, though, Esiason will share time with rookie Glenn Foley, Jet Coach Pete 
Carroll said. . . . Other Jet injuries: defensive end Kurt Barber (sprained 
knee) and tight end James Thornton (hamstring). . . . Atlanta quarterback Jeff 
George broke a finger on his left (non-throwing) hand and was replaced by Bobby 
Hebert in the first quarter of the Falcons' game against Green Bay. . . . 
Buffalo special teams star Steve Tasker broke his right arm during the first 
half while covering a punt. . . . Philadelphia running back Charlie Garner's 
season ended when he ruptured a tendon in his left knee. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I think we would lose 13 games? No, I didn't, but if we had won five 
games, do you think I would feel any better than I do now? No, I wouldn't."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington Coach Norv Turner, who was brought from the Cowboys to rebuild 
the team and now finds he has some heavy lifting to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always get a little nervous when he starts running around, but he has made 
big plays doing that. There's never a dull moment with these guys, is there?"  
</P>
<P>
 -- Green Bay Packer Coach Mike Holmgren after quarterback Brett Favre 
scrambled nine yards to beat the Atlanta Falcons, 21-17, with 14 seconds to 
play and no timeouts left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quitting is a tough word to use, but I question if some guys want to finish 
out the season. Nothing can change unless you change the ingredients. I've just 
got to play with the guys who are put next to me."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Linebacker Al Smith of the 1-14 Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one more game and the nightmare is over."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Oiler running back Lorenzo White, giving you an idea who Smith might be 
talking about. TONIGHT'S GAME: DALLAS AT NEW ORLEANS 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints are playing their best football of the season, but that probably 
won't make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans (6-8) has won four of seven games, including the last two -- the 
first time in 25 games that the Saints put together consecutive victories. 
Coach Jim Mora said after each of the last two games that it was his team's 
best overall game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Bates has given the ground game some respectability and Jim Everett has 
looked more like his old self each week. Everett has passed for 19 touchdowns 
and 3,350 yards. Last week, he connected with Michael Haynes five times for 103 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Saints have not defeated an opponent with a winning record.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys have lost only three games, but what is worrisome is that in last 
week's loss to Cleveland they did not play well until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Troy Aikman threw two interceptions against Cleveland after 
throwing six all of last season. He has passed for 13 touchdowns, with 10 
interceptions. But the Saint defense won't be as tough as the Brown defense, 
and Aikman will not have to pass much. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Emmitt Smith to carry the ball about 30 times. Smith had 112 yards 
against the Browns and scored two of his NFL-high 21 touchdowns.

CARDINALS ENJOY PLAYOFF BUZZ AS LATE-SEASON SURGE CONTINUES; INTERCONFERENCE: 
THIRD CONSECUTIVE VICTORY, 28-7 OVER BENGALS, MAKES POSTSEASON PLAY A REAL 
POSSIBILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Playoff excitement isn't the norm in Phoenix. Neither is a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, neither is a coach like Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals took another step to their first winning record since 
1984 and their first postseason appearance in a non-strike year since 1975 by 
beating the Cincinnati Bengals, 28-7, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to try and get to the playoffs," said Garrison Hearst, who ran a yard 
for the first Cardinal score and threw a 10-yard pass to Larry Centers for the 
second. Jay Schroeder passed 15 yards to Ricky Proehl for the third score by 
Arizona, which entered the game with an NFL-low 20 touchdowns. Centers ran 10 
yards for the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning their third consecutive game, the Cardinals (8-7) clinched their 
first .500-or-better season since going 9-7 a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the New York Giants' 16-13 victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, the 
Cardinals can make the playoffs by beating Atlanta on Saturday, coupled with a 
Dallas victory over the Giants and a San Francisco win over Minnesota on Monday 
night. Losses by the Giants and Green Bay at Tampa Bay would have the same 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go to Atlanta with a positive attitude and come out next week real 
focused," said Hearst, who had 62 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder's toss to Proehl came on the first play of the second quarter as 
Arizona built a 21-0 lead, its biggest early margin since the first half of a 
31-14 victory over Pittsburgh on Oct. 9, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot what it felt like, it had been so long," said Ryan, hired in 
February after Joe Bugel was fired following a 7-9 season. "Like Seth Joyner 
said on the sideline, it feels good to have the pressure off." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the game a lot of fun," said Centers, who had four catches and set a 
franchise record with 72 receptions in a season. He broke the record of 70, set 
in 1984 by Ottis Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The game became tighter in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder sat out the second half because of a sore right knee, and the 
Cardinals bogged down behind Steve Beuerlein until a fourth-quarter drive 
capped by Centers' scoring run on a draw play with 10:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals dominated, keeping the ball for 31:31 to just 18:29 for 
Cincinnati and outgained the Bengals, 375 yards to 189. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals (2-13), who lost their fifth in a row, scored on Jeff Blake's 
four-yard pass to Carl Perkins in the third quarter. But they had just 33 yards 
at halftime against Arizona's third-ranked defense, partly because of two lost 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got off to a bad start and didn't recover," Cincinnati Coach Dave 
Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner intercepted a pass in the end zone in the third quarter to end 
Cincinnati's last serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said he felt Joyner's interception, which came on the first Bengals 
possession after their score, was a killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That broke out backs. We had the momentum going our way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said he looked toward Harold Green and saw Joyner. He said he never saw 
Joyner drop in front of Tony McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first read was the flat, and he was covering Harold in the flat, and when 
I went to throw the ball to the inside, he broke off his guy and came inside to 
pick it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearst scored on the third play of an 11-yard drive which began after an 
Arizona punt hit Roger Jones on the ankle and Bryan Reeves of the Cardinals 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Cardinals score came after a more conventional punt. Hearst had two 
eight-yard runs during the 64-yard drive, then took a pitch from Schroeder, 
rolled right and threw to Centers in the end zone after the safeties moved up 
for run support. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals got another break when Blake pulled back from center too quickly 
and fumbled. Keith McCants recovered on the Bengal 27.

REDSKINS PERFECTLY AWFUL AT HOME; NFC: THEY END UP WITHOUT A VICTORY AT RFK 
STADIUM FOR THE FIRST TIME AS TAMPA BAY INCREASES WINNING STREAK TO FOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Washington Redskins are struggling through the kind of season usually 
endured by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington wound up winless at home for the first time in franchise history, 
losing to Tampa Bay, 17-14, Sunday on Errict Rhett's three-yard touchdown run 
with seven minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers (6-9) won their fourth consecutive game, their longest winning 
streak since starting out 5-0 in 1978. They can avoid their 12th consecutive 
season of double-digit losses with a victory next week at home against Green 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins (2-13), meanwhile, finished 0-8 at RFK Stadium, where there were 
9,097 no-shows on a sunny, 50-degree day. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, in its first year under Coach Norv Turner, set a team record for 
most losses in a season. The Redskins also dropped their seventh in a row, 
their longest losing streak since 1964-65. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole approach to this is that we are going to continue to get better on a 
weekly basis, on a monthly basis, on a yearly basis, and we'll find a way to 
win close ballgames and we'll win a lot of games," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the eighth time this season, Washington lost a game in which it led in the 
second half. Tampa Bay got the winning touchdown after Vernon Turner returned a 
punt 37 yards and Erickson threw a 13-yard pass to Scott Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhett, who stung the Redskins two weeks ago by running for 192 yards in a 
26-21 victory, was held to only 64 yards in 23 carries. But quarterback Craig 
Erickson finished 19 for 34 for 267 yards with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just did a good job (defending the run)," Tampa Bay Coach Sam Wyche 
said. "We decided we had to throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins did not score in the second half. They had a chance to extend a 
14-10 lead at the end of the third quarter, but Heath Shuler's third-down pass 
from the Tampa Bay 27 went through Henry Ellard's outstretched arms, and Chip 
Lohmiller missed a 44-yard kick on the next play.

GIANTS SURVIVE BIZARRE ENDING; EAGLES GET EXTRA SHOT, STILL LOSE; NFC: 
PHILADELPHIA GIVEN CHANCE TO TIE THE GAME AFTER TIME RUNS OUT BUT FIELD-GOAL 
TRY MISSES. 
</P>

<P>
 Somehow, out of the chaos, the New York Giants are still in contention. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants survived a bizarre finish that seemed to symbolize their difficult 
season and defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 16-13, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Daluiso's 18-yard field goal with 54 seconds left gave them their fifth 
consecutive victory and kept them in the playoff hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, who benched quarterback Randall Cunningham in favor of Bubby 
Brister, fell out of the postseason picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team was sure where it stood in the final, frenzied moments. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Eagles driving for a tie, Victor Bailey was stopped at the New York 
27 following a five-yard reception, and time seemed to run out. 
</P>
<P>
 But with players and spectators on the field and the game apparently over, 
referee Gordon McCarter ruled that two seconds should be put back on the clock 
because Giant linebacker Jessie Armstead had picked up the ball and run 
downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 With no timeouts left, Brister then spiked the ball to stop the clock. The 
extra time was not enough to save the Eagles, though, when Eddie Murray's 
44-yard field-goal attempt was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstead said he felt no sense of relief after Murray's miss. He insisted he 
was only doing his job when he picked up the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was just lying there," he said. "The whistle hadn't blown. I just 
did what I had to do. It was loose because the whistle hadn't blown. Get that 
distinction." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Coach Dan Reeves said he's still not sure how the Eagles got off their 
last field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, there's no way they can spike the ball and get the kick off," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strange finish "really is a tell-tale sign of the way this season has been 
for us," defensive end Erik Howard said. "We've seen it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (8-7), who overcame a seven-game losing streak this season that 
included a quarterback switch, must defeat Dallas next Saturday to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (7-8) lost their sixth in a row and end the season in Cincinnati. 
The NFL's second-most penalized team, Philadelphia helped beat themselves with 
11 penalties worth 98 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "As was the case all season, penalties hurt us all day long," Coach Rich 
Kotite said. "Then we fumbled and things continued to spriral downward from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth-quarter interception -- it was the fourth consecutive game in which 
the Eagles have thrown one -- set up the Giants' game-tying touchdown. A fumble 
by Philadelphia's Jeff Sydner on the ensuing kickoff led to Daluiso's field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown, 18 of 27 for 264 yards, led the Giants on their tying drive after 
Thomas Randolph intercepted a pass from Brister with 7:36 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Brister got his first start of the season in part because Cunningham had 
thrown fourth-quarter interceptions in the Eagles' previous three games. 
Brister finished 25 of 39 for 182 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not meant to be, I guess," said Brister, who will remain as starter in 
the final. "I've never seen so many penalties. I don't know if the refs stunk 
that much or we just committed a lot of penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph's turnover set the Giants up for an eight-play drive that ended with 
Dave Meggett's five-yard run with 3:54 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydner's fumble on the ensuing kickoff, caused when he ran into his own 
teammate, was recovered by Willie Beamon at the Philadelphia 36 with 3:42 left 
to play. The Giants drove to the Eagle one before Daluiso made the game-winning 
field goal.

PLAYOFF FEVER GROWS IN ARIZONA; INTERCONFERENCE: TEAM IS ONE VICTORY AWAY FROM 
A RARE WINNING SEASON AFTER DEFEATING BENGALS, 28-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Playoff excitement isn't the norm when it comes to the Cardinals. Neither is a 
winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, neither is a coach like Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals took another step toward the franchise's first winning 
record since 1984, when they were the St. Louis Cardinals and Jim Hanifan was 
the coach, when they defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 28-7, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they are closing in on a possible postseason appearance for the first 
time in a non-strike year since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to try to get to the playoffs," said Garrison Hearst, who ran a yard 
for the first Cardinal score and threw a 10-yard pass to Larry Centers for the 
second. Jay Schroeder passed 15 yards to Ricky Proehl for the third score by 
Arizona, which entered the game with an NFL-low 20 touchdowns. Centers ran 10 
yards for the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning their third consecutive game, the Cardinals (8-7) clinched their 
first .500-or-better season since going 9-7 a decade ago. The Cardinals moved 
to Phoenix in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 With the New York Giants' 16-13 victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, the 
Cardinals can make the playoffs by beating Atlanta on Saturday, coupled with a 
Dallas victory over the Giants and a San Francisco victory over Minnesota on 
Monday night. Losses by the Giants and Green Bay, which plays at Tampa Bay, 
would have the same effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go to Atlanta with a positive attitude and come out next week real 
focused," said Hearst, who had 62 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder's toss to Proehl came on the first play of the second quarter as 
Arizona built a 21-0 lead, its biggest early margin since the first half of a 
31-14 victory over Pittsburgh on Oct. 9, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot what it felt like, it had been so long," said Ryan, hired in 
February after Joe Bugel was fired following a 7-9 season. "Like Seth Joyner 
said on the sideline, it feels good to have the pressure off." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the game a lot of fun," said Centers, who had four catches and set a 
franchise record with 72 receptions in a season. He broke the record of 70, set 
in 1984 by Ottis Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The game became tighter in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder sat out the second half because of a sore right knee, and the 
Cardinals bogged down behind Steve Beuerlein until a fourth-quarter drive 
capped by Centers' scoring run on a draw play with 10:04 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals dominated, keeping the ball for 41:31 to only 18:29 for 
Cincinnati and outgained the Bengals, 375 yards to 189. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals (2-13), who lost their fifth in a row, scored on Jeff Blake's 
four-yard pass to Carl Perkins in the third quarter. But they had only 33 yards 
at halftime against Arizona's third-ranked defense, partly because of two lost 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner intercepted a pass in the end zone in the third quarter to end 
Cincinnati's last serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said he felt Joyner's interception, which came on the first Bengal 
possession after their score, was a killer. "That broke our backs. We had the 
momentum going our way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake said he looked toward Harold Green and saw Joyner. He said he never saw 
Joyner drop in front of Tony McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first read was the flat, and he was covering Harold in the flat, and when 
I went to throw the ball to the inside, he broke off his guy and came inside to 
pick it off," Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearst scored on the third play of an 11-yard drive that began after an 
Arizona punt hit Roger Jones on the ankle and Bryan Reeves of the Cardinals 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Cardinal score came after a more conventional punt. Hearst had two 
eight-yard runs during the 64-yard drive, then took a pitch from Schroeder, 
rolled right and threw to Centers in the end zone after the safeties moved up 
for run support. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals got another break when Blake pulled back from center and 
fumbled. Keith McCants recovered on the Bengal 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Three running plays gained 12 yards, and Schroeder then found Proehl in the 
flat. Hit at the goal line by James Francis, Proehl fumbled into the end zone 
but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals got 143 of their 189 yards in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins' scoring grab was set up by a 54-yard Blake-to-McGee pass. Blake 
dropped the ball into Perkins' hands in the back of the end zone on the next 
snap.

ON WAY TO EAST TITLE, DOLPHINS UNABLE TO GET PAST COLTS, 10-6; AFC: MIAMI TWICE 
REACHES THE TWO, BUT GOES WITHOUT A TOUCHDOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 34 GAMES.

 Give this one to the Indianapolis defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts defeated the Miami Dolphins, 10-6, on Sunday, as Dewell Brewer 
returned a punt 75 yards for a first-quarter touchdown and the Colts' defense 
twice held Miami at the two-yard line, including a pair of game-saving stops in 
the closing minutes by Ashley Ambrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was probably the best defensive game that we played all year," 
Ambrose said. "We executed almost 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss marked the first time in 34 games the Dolphins did not score a 
touchdown. It also kept Miami (9-6), which already has earned a playoff spot, 
from clinching the AFC East title for at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis (7-8) was eliminated from a possible playoff berth with Kansas 
City's victory over Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 19-yard field goal by Indianapolis' Dean Biasucci with 8:10 remaining, 
Dan Marino completed four passes, including a 29-yarder to Keith Jackson, 
taking the Dolphins to the Indianapolis four. Two runs by Bernie Parmalee gave 
Miami a first down at the two, but that's where the comeback stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Parmalee ran for no gain, then Marino threw three incomplete passes, the last 
two broken up in the end zone by Ambrose, and Indianapolis took over on downs 
with 2:47 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy (Mark Ingram) ran like a fade, stop route. He was acting like they 
were going to run it," Ambrose said of the final Miami pass. "I was waiting for 
a break and he broke it. I just stuck my hand to where the ball was coming to." 
</P>
<P>
 Marino said the victory was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't execute at the end," he said. "We didn't do what it took to 
get in from the 1 1/2-yard line. That's what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis picked up one first down to the 15 and, with Miami out of time 
outs, was able to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins can still win the division title with a victory over Detroit on 
Christmas Day, the lone game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts finish at home against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Marino: "It's real disappointing. Every time we had a chance to do 
something, it seems like we can't win the big game when we have to. It's 
extremely disappointing. But we're going to have to find a way to regroup and 
win next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer's 75-yard punt return for a touchdown was a club-record seventh return 
for a score this season and gave Indianapolis a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outside guys, whenever they give you a shot, hold those inside guys up," 
Brewer said. "I don't care who you are, if you are a returner and you've got 
pretty good talent, you can make something out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened, the guys just did a great job and I just ran up the middle and 
ran to the outside and broke a couple of tackles and saw the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami used more than eight minutes on its next possession, reaching the 
Indianapolis 35 before Marino was sacked for the second time by Tony McCoy, 
forcing another punt. McCoy finished with three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a complete victory," McCoy said. "The defense stopped them when we had 
to, the offense made the big play when we had to and special teams scored a 
touchdown. You can't ask for any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk, who rushed for 64 yards and increased his season total to a 
team rookie-record 1,200 yards, ran 24 yards to midfield on the first 
Indianapolis possession of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Miami's Bryan 
Cox took Indianapolis to the 25. The Colts could get no farther, however, and 
Biasucci, whose first field-goal attempt was blocked by Tim Irwin in the first 
quarter, missed a 43-yard attempt with 2:26 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, who led Miami back from a nine-point fourth-quarter deficit to a 22-21 
victory when the teams played at Miami six weeks ago, completed five passes on 
the next drive as the Dolphins reached the Indianapolis 11 with 13 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of trying a field goal by Pete Stoyanovich, who kicked a 33-yarder 
for a 3-0 lead in the first quarter, Marino completed another pass to Irving 
Fryar at the two, and time expired before the Dolphins could run another play, 
keeping the Colts' lead at 7-3 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a defensive game all the way," Colt Coach Ted Marchibroda said. "We 
had two goal-line stands right down there, and maybe three, because before the 
half they didn't have time to kick it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went out expecting to win. It's wonderful when you're able to call the 
shot beforehand against a good team."

MONTANA KEEPS CHIEFS IN PLAYOFF PICTURE, 31-9; AFC: QUARTERBACK RETURNS AFTER 
TWO-WEEK ABSENCE AND THROWS TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES IN VICTORY OVER HOUSTON. 
</P>

 Joe Montana, sharper than he has looked in more than a month, is giving the 
Kansas City Chiefs renewed hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, sidelined for two weeks because of an injured left foot, threw two 
touchdown passes and the Chiefs defeated Houston, 31-9, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City remained in the playoff chase while sending the dispirited Oilers 
to their 11th consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (8-7) ended their three-game losing streak. They can still claim a 
wild-card berth by defeating the Raiders at the Coliseum next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything felt fine," Montana said. "It was a little tender. But once you 
get out there and move around, it's all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City's victory, coupled with New England's 41-17 victory over Buffalo, 
officially eliminated the Bills, who lost the last four Super Bowls. Last 
season, Buffalo beat the Chiefs in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-14), who won 11 consecutive games last season to reach the 
playoffs, committed five turnovers. Houston is assured of at least tying for 
the worst record this year; Washington and Cincinnati are 2-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston finishes next week at home against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs led, 7-3, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell they really didn't want to be out there, and all they were 
doing was going through the motions," wide receiver J.J. Birden said of the 
Oilers. "At halftime we just said let's go out there and get it done and get 
out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana connected with Derrick Walker on a 10-yard touchdown pass in the first 
quarter and slipped a 25-yarder between two defenders to Lake Dawson in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually trying to hit the tight end," Montana said with a laugh, 
adding it was his fault the ball was closer to Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lake likes the ball. He going to catch it whenever he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana wound up completing 16 of 26 passes for 235 yards, bringing his career 
total to 40,337 and passing Johnny Unitas for fourth on the career passing 
chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie fullback Donnell Bennett scored on a 12-yard run to put the Chiefs on 
top, 21-3, late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers got a 48-yard field goal from Al Del Greco late in the first period 
and a 20-yard scoring pass from Billy Joe Tolliver to a wide-open Haywood 
Jeffires in the fourth. The Oilers missed on a two-point conversion pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo White, whose fumble on Houston's first play last week led to a Seattle 
score in a 16-14 loss to the Seahawks, fumbled on the fifth play at the Oilers' 
29. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, Montana connected with Walker over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, a second-round pick out of Miami, broke three tackles in his 12-yard 
scoring run. He was taken away in a cart late in the fourth period because of a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the fourth period, Montana and Dawson hooked up on a 50-yard 
pass play to the Oiler 14 that set up Lin Elliott's 21-yard field goal and a 
24-9 lead.

CHARGERS FINALLY NAIL DOWN WEST TITLE; AFC: SAN DIEGO KNOCKS ESIASON OUT OF THE 
GAME WHILE DOMINATING NEW YORK JETS, 21-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Their 6-0 start was not forgotten by the San Diego Chargers. They simply 
forgot how they got off to such a quick beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, they rediscovered the formula: A stingy defense, big plays from 
quarterback Stan Humphries and powerful runs by Natrone Means. That was more 
than enough to subdue the slumping New York Jets, 21-6, and clinch San Diego's 
second AFC West crown in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of my starts and wins and the two division titles in three years," 
Humphries said after throwing for three touchdowns. "No one expected us to be 
anywhere this year and we proved what we can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the big plays we made earlier in the season. It's been something 
we've been fighting four, five weeks to find." 
</P>
<P>
 After their quick start, the Chargers went 3-5. They lost their last two games 
with the division title within reach. But in the Jets, they found a team even 
more inept in December. 
</P>
<P>
 New York (6-9) has lost four consecutive games and has scored 26 points in 13 
quarters -- or since the Jets led Miami, 24-6, after three periods in a battle 
for first place in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to get the monkey off our backs, and it feels as if a lot of 
weight has been lifted off our shoulders," Charger Pro Bowl linebacker Junior 
Seau said. "We've had a couple of opportunities to get to this point in the 
past couple of weeks, and it's been frustrating, because we haven't taken 
advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it feels satisfying to get it done today." 
</P>
<P>
 The game turned when Seau knocked out Jet quarterback Boomer Esiason with a 
shot to the head in the second quarter. Esiason had just released the ball and 
was off-balance when hit. He stayed on the ground for several moments, then 
walked slowly to the bench. Soon after, he headed just as slowly to the locker 
room with a concussion and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boomer was scrambling around and I had to come up and contain it," Seau said. 
"He was leaning and we collided and he had to come out of the game. That was a 
big thing for us, because Boomer is the leader of their offense. We got it 
going after that." 
</P>
<P>
 No penalty was called on the play and the Jets got a field goal on the next 
snap for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps inspired by Seau's hit, the Chargers came alive offensively for 
touchdown drives of 64 and 65 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries completed 19 of 26 passes for 280 yards and three touchdowns. Tony 
Martin had three catches for 116 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This put us up there as champions," Martin said. "It felt really good to get 
that under our belts." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss officially eliminated the Jets from playoff contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the enthusiasm we had coming into the year," said wide receiver Rob 
Moore, the team's only Pro Bowl player, "we had great things envisioned. It's 
very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego was plagued by poor protection for Humphries, who was sacked three 
times in the first half. But the defense kept things close with constant 
pressure, getting five sacks and rarely allowing the Jets any room to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was one of our best defensive games of the year," Seau said. "It 
came at the right time."

NBA ROUNDUP; TRAIL BLAZERS WIN EASILY OVER KNICKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clyde Drexler scored 33 points and Clifford Robinson 24 as the Portland Trail 
Blazers defeated the New York Knicks, 111-87, on Sunday night at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler scored 31 in the first three quarters, dominating defenders John 
Starks and Hubert Davis and more than offsetting a 24-point, 14-rebound 
performance by Patrick Ewing of the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight's game is a good example of how well we can play," said Drexler, who 
made 14 of 19 shots and didn't have a turnover. In his only game against the 
Knicks last season, Drexler made one of 11 shots and scored two points. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Strickland added 17 points and 11 assists as Portland's starting guards 
outscored their New York counterparts, 50-15. The Blazers' Chris Dudley matched 
Ewing's rebound total with 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played any better than that, that's for sure," Portland Coach P.J. 
Carlesimo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Smith scored 18 for the Knicks, who finished their Pacific Division 
trip at 1-2 with a victory over the Sacramento Kings and losses to the Phoenix 
Suns and the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our perimeter game is nonexistent," Knick Coach Pat Riley said. "I am not 
accusing a team like ours that has a collective heart of not trying. But I see 
a real trend developing where we're getting beat in a lot of phases." 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 103, Miami 102 -- Benoit Benjamin scored 12 of his season-high 24 
points in the fourth quarter at East Rutherford, N.J., including two free 
throws with 2.4 seconds to play that gave the Nets the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets trailed entering the fourth quarter, 80-76, and fell further behind 
when Bimbo Coles and Kevin Willis made early baskets, giving Miami an 84-78 
lead.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; AFTERNOON DEELITES EASILY WINS FUTURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether it's the Kentucky Derby or the Hollywood Futurity, Burt Bacharach gets 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get more nervous when you're (a) 3-5 (favorite)," Bacharach said. "In a 
horse race, you can't stop the orchestra and say, 'Let's take it from the top 
again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon Deelites, Bacharach's latest Kentucky Derby hopeful, went off at 1-2 
and calmed his owner on the far turn at Hollywood Park when he sailed past A.J. 
Jett and The Exeter Man en route to a 6 1/2-length victory in Sunday's $500,000 
Hollywood Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon Deelites will finish second to Timber Country, the Breeders' Cup 
Juvenile winner, in the Eclipse Awards voting, but the rivalry between these 
California-based Derby candidates will be settled on the track rather than 
through the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 Running 1 1/16 miles in 1:40 3/5, Afternoon Deelites galloped to the wire 
under Kent Desormeaux while tying the stakes record, set by Valiant Nature last 
year. He missed Power Forward's 1987 track record by three-fifths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Richard Mandella, the undefeated Afternoon Deelites was responsible 
for the smallest field in Futurity history. Thunder Gulch ran second, finishing 
10 lengths ahead of A.J. Jett, and The Exeter Man and Nice Fred completed the 
order of finish. The Exeter Man had the best excuse, rearing and throwing his 
rider in the gate and then bleeding so badly from the nostrils that Gary 
Stevens' gold silks were a different color when he returned to the jockeys' 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacharach, the award-winning composer who has been breeding and racing horses 
for more than 25 years, was introduced to Derby goose bumps earlier this year 
when Soul of the Matter ran fifth at 16-1 at Churchill Downs. Soul of the 
Matter, a sore-footed horse who needed extra attention, finished the year with 
a victory in the Super Derby and a fourth in the Breeders' Cup Classic and will 
be back in action this winter at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unthinkable to have these two horses at the same time," Bacharach said. 
"This is as good as it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 After Afternoon Deelites began his career with victories at six and seven 
furlongs, Mandella was more concerned about last Sunday's too-fast workout than 
he was the colt stretching out in distance for the Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He finished strong at seven furlongs, and we weren't adding that much to the 
distance," Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacharach shed more light on that 1:23 1/5 seven-furlong work a week ago. "I 
was standing next to Dick that morning," he said. "He really did it in 1:22 
4/5, according to Dick's clock." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Futurity, Afternoon Deelites wasn't as close to the pace as he had been 
in the Hollywood Prevue five weeks ago, but he still was less than two lengths 
off the lead, in third place, while A.J. Jett turned in fractions of :22 4/5 
and :46 after a half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an aggressive, quick colt," Mandella said. "Our job has been to get 
him to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 On the far turn, the son of Private Terms and Intimate Girl was tired of 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He carried me around there," Desormeaux said. "Effortlessly, that's the word 
that sums it up. I guess this makes him super already. The thing is, he's doing 
everything without being asked. So wait until we ask him. He got to those two 
leaders awful easy. He humbled me." 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder Gulch, who had already won a stake around two turns, taking the Remsen 
at Aqueduct, was more than seven lengths behind going down the backstretch. 
Wayne Lukas, who trains Timber Country and Thunder Gulch, hailed Afternoon 
Deelites' winning time, but additional compliments came grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to evaluate," Lukas said. "The one barometer you have in a race 
like this is time, and that was excellent. But again, time is one thing, and 
competition is another. My horse made a nice late run, and I thought he ran 
well, but I would have liked to have seen him a little closer early. (Timber 
Country) will have to deal with the winner, and there will be others. It will 
be an interesting spring. It's never easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani, riding Thunder Gulch for the first time, believes the colt 
will improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was second best, but when this horse matures a little more, I think he'll 
be able to compete with that other horse," Nakatani said. "The other horse 
right now is real sharp and knows what's going on. My horse, he just tends to 
do what he has to do. But the winner was impressive." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron was riding at Hollywood Park Sunday after riding 
California-based Soviet Problem to a seventh-place finish in the $1.7-million 
Sprinters Stakes in Japan. Japanese horses continued to dominate their own 
races, with Sakura Bakushin O winning the Sprinters for the second year in a 
row and this time running the distance of about six furlongs in course-record 
time of 1:07 1/5. Honor the Hero, who battled Soviet Problem for the early lead 
in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, finished eighth in Japan. Soviet Problem, who was 
second to Cherokee Run in the Breeders' Cup, was beaten by more than seven 
lengths. . . . In another race in Japan, McCarron rode the 2-year-old Automatic 
to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonproductiveasset, despite bleeding badly, won the Flying Continental 
Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park. Second in the Strub and fifth in the Santa 
Anita Handicap, Nonproductiveasset was sidelined for eight months this year 
because of a bleeding problem. . . . In another race on the card, Saltgrass won 
for the third time in 17 starts, beating favored Pollock's Luck by 1 3/4 
lengths in the Manila Handicap. . . . Eddie Delahoussaye won three races for 
the second consecutive day.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES; CONVERSATION WITH 
ALMA NORIEGA AND BARBARA WILSON; HAVING A MENTOR WHO CARES 'CAN MAKE YOU DO 
BETTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District is the nation's second-largest. But 
close to one-third of its nearly 700,000 students drop out before receiving 
their high-school diplomas. In an effort to reverse that trend, school 
officials have developed the Each One-Reach One mentor program, which matches 
interested adults with high-school students to let them see firsthand why 
staying in class can positively affect their futur e .  
</P>
<P>
 ALMA NORIEGA, a 17-year-old senior at Taft High School in Woodland Hills , and 
her mentor BARBARA WILSON, a nursing student at Pierce College and a hospital 
pharmacist, discussed their year-long relationship in the mentor program with 
Times staff writer KEVIN BAXTER . 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What drew you into the mentor program in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: I wanted to make a difference. You always hear people talking about 
young people, kids in high school, and they say all they do is get involved in 
crime, they don't care about school. Yet those same people don't want to devote 
any of their time to try to change that or try to make something better for 
somebody. So I thought this would be a good way for me to get involved. I 
wouldn't have minded when I was in high school if I had somebody kind of push 
me a little in the right direction. You know your parents do so much, but when 
you get some outside influence I think it makes it even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega: When I first joined, it really wasn't explained very well to me. I 
was just asked if I wanted to be in a program that was going to help me. I 
thought, "Well, yeah. I'm not going to lose anything." But most of the kids 
that joined with me, they're not in the program anymore. They didn't get along 
with their mentor or whatever. For me, well, I thought it was going to help me 
and it did. That's why I'm still in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your relationship like? 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega: She talks to me like a friend and I see her as a friend. I can talk 
to her about anything, not just homework. She tells me her problems with her 
job, financial problems. And I try to help her with them. When we first 
started, she didn't get on my behind to do this, do that. She wasn't bossy. She 
didn't even bring up grades. When she comes, she talks to me about how I've 
been. Then we talk about grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: It's not just a formal relationship that we have, it's a friendship. 
You're more able to stick with somebody who's a friend, take them a little more 
seriously. I think that's why it works. It was real awkward when we first met. 
Alma didn't look at me that much. We just needed to get to know each other. I 
didn't want to be over-eager and smother her. We talked about things we had in 
common. Like I'm a student and she's a student. I'm Asian American. We talk 
about the racism that I've experienced and things that she's experienced. 
There's a lot of things that we can relate to.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of experiences do you share with Alma? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: I tell her what it's like to be in school and working part-time, 
trying to make rent, trying to pay for books. So she knows what's ahead. Right 
after I got involved in the program, I was laid off from my job. That was a 
difficult time for me but it was a real-life experience for Alma to get a 
little exposure to what it's like when you are laid off, how you feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How have your views of the program changed over the past year? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: I was going to turn Alma into an honor student. And I used to get 
frustrated. Then I got to know Alma. I drove down to South-Central Los Angeles 
and went to her house and realized how her day worked, how early she had to get 
up just to be here. It made me realize it wasn't going to be just an 
academic-type situation. I was going to try to get to know her and understand 
her because I had respect for her. Now I'm glad she does any homework! She 
spends a lot of time helping her sister take care of her baby. And when you 
hear Alma talk about how she keeps the kids in line when her mom is not around, 
you understand that's a lot of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega: I'm glad I got involved. But it would be better for people to be a 
mentor when the kids are little. Everybody has their own mind in high school. 
In junior high and elementary school, you can still change them because they're 
still kids and what they look at is their big brothers and stuff. I looked up 
to my big sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Hasn't the program made you a better student? How? 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega: My grades have gone up. I come to school more often. Now I want to 
graduate. I wasn't going to graduate because I didn't have enough credits but 
now I'm making up classes so I can go to college. Barbara told me it was 
important. And then I realized it was. I want to be a nurse too. I thought it 
was going to be real easy for me. But the way she talks about it, it seems like 
it's going to be hard. So I have to do better, work hard.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you measure what effect the mentor program has had on Alma? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: I know Alma's grades have gone up. I'm not going to take credit for 
that, but I would talk to her about her grades, bring it more into the 
conversation. And then she would talk more about it. That's how it started. Any 
time somebody helps you -- and it's not for money but because they want to -- 
having somebody care about you can make you do better.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What qualifications should a good mentor have? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: You just need to be a caring human being. If you can't relate on one 
level, there are always other ways you can help somebody. You don't have to be 
a minority to relate to other minorities. It's just to have somebody to support 
you and remind you of all the good things that can happen and all the great 
things that are in store for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the reward for the students is the help and motivation they need to 
finish school, what's the reward for the mentor? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: I get to see a different perspective on everything. She tells me how 
she feels. We talk about politics. I've gone to her house and met her family. 
It's an enriching experience. You can't go into this program thinking that 
they're just kids because they're not. They're already on an adult level as far 
as practical, common sense-type things.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES; GRIPE; 'IS HANDS-ON 
LEARNING SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARPI SARAFIAN, Assistant professor of English, Cal State Los Angeles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My recent experience as a substitute teacher for grades K-12 in a Southern 
California school district raised some important questions about the state of 
public education: What constitutes learning and how do we make the learning 
experience meaningful to our children? 
</P>
<P>
 For learning to take place, what is being taught must be relevant. Classrooms 
are full of the most attractive gadgets. Posters, maps, globes, pictures, 
colorful charts, puzzles, board games, building blocks, aquariums -- all 
designed to make learning accessible and fun. No one denies the value of 
putting together an electric circuit, as I watched a group of fourth-graders 
do, with pieces of wire, a battery and a toothpick, to learn about the world 
around us. 
</P>
<P>
 But I fear that by moving the playground into the classroom to make the 
educational experience relevant to their life outside school, we unwittingly 
seem to be sending the message that learning, per se, is not fun. I fear these 
gadgets limit our students' understanding of what is relevant to what can be 
touched and/or experienced visually. They imply that anything requiring 
conceptualization and imagination is simply not worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 My experience with junior high students seems to support my theory. At this 
level, it becomes increasingly difficult to use hands-on methods because 
subjects become more abstract. For example, in English, students can no longer 
read storybooks with pictures but take on novels and are asked about their 
comprehension. As a result, these kids are far less curious about learning and 
are far more undisciplined.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of acknowledging that something is wrong, some schools hide behind 
euphemisms and label the more obnoxious students "the active ones" and give 
them special privileges. One unruly seventh-grader was allowed to play his 
favorite video game on the computer at the back of the room despite the fact 
that the noise disrupted the rest of the students who were supposed to be 
working silently. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the teachers I talked to are well aware of the problem, and though 
visibly angry and increasingly impatient, say they feel trapped in a system 
they cannot change. They note that administrators often pay more attention to 
things like new policies on classroom discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that we need to redefine what makes learning meaningful. We 
need to push students beyond the fun part, past the minimum-effort level to the 
limits of their capabilities. This is not confining their independence. It is 
creating an atmosphere that promotes disciplined effort and critical thinking.

 I can't imagine what this school would be like without the financial, 
emotional and physical support we get from the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 We have just under 700 students at our school, kindergarten through sixth 
grade. Our student achievement scores are high, perhaps not as high as some 
other districts, but they're up there. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the standard state funding per student, the state also provides 
us with GATE funds for gifted students, special education funds, school 
improvement funds, and minimal bilingual education funds for our English as a 
Second Language students. About 24% of our students are Korean; the rest of the 
school is predominantly white. 
</P>
<P>
 We could not get by on state funding alone. We rely on the support of our PTA 
and Support Our Schools, (S.O.S.), a nonprofit foundation that raised 
approximately $400,000 this year. The district divides this money between the 
three elementary schools, one middle school and our high school, based on a 
priority list of student program needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Our PTA raised more than $46,000 last year and they are hoping to raise about 
$59,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 With that money, the PTA supports our "Great Books Program" that involves 
parent volunteers in teaching our youngsters to think critically about 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The PTA also pays for an art specialist who develops projects based on each 
teacher's curriculum. After consulting with each teacher in the school, she 
comes up with projects such as drawing maps or constructing a rain forest, 
whatever it is that is pertinent to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a Macintosh lab with 34 computers that the parents support with 
"scrip." (Parents buy scrip, a certificate that can only be spent at a specific 
grocery chain, which donates a percentage of parents' purchases to the school). 
Scrip sales pay for our computer facilitator's weekly salary. 
</P>
<P>
 S.O.S. funds our music and drama program. They hire a drama consultant and a 
music consultant, both of whom spend 12 weeks at each elementary school in the 
district. S.O.S. also donates money for a supply budget for each school and 
they pay for an extra teacher at each of the three elementary schools to reduce 
class size. 
</P>
<P>
 This is my third year as principal of this school and, no matter where I've 
been, I believe parental involvement is always important. It gives parents a 
window that enables them to see what's going on with their child's education. 
It allows them to have a better understanding when their children come home and 
talk about what's happening in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Our parents are involved in every phase of the school. They're an integral 
part of our campus. They do book fairs. We have a campus beautification 
program. The parents come out on weekends, they plant flowers and trees, they 
water the plants in the summer to make sure they'll make it through the heat. 
Last year they volunteered 56,000 hours of their time. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this involvement sends a message to the students that we're a family, 
that we all care about the school. They see their parents valuing what is 
happening at this school on a day-to-day basis. We have a lot of working 
parents here who volunteer to do whatever they can whenever they can. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I support public education. I think there needs to always be a 
partnership between the school, community, its students and parents. We must 
build on what's happening at school with what's happening at home. I have high 
standards and expectations for my own children and for the children here in La 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 All children can learn and we are here to make a difference. Parents, schools, 
the district and community -- we all need to find a key for all these kids. We 
are always working to improve the school and fine-tune the curriculum. Keeping 
up with technology is also a big, big deal. I've worked in a lot of schools. It 
makes no difference what the zip code of the school is. It's about caring and a 
dedicated staff. You have to love kids, no matter what.

SUPPLEMENTARY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS BRING IN ENRICHMENTS AND A PRIVATE GIFT 
SUPPLIES A COMPUTER LAB, BUT STRUGGLING PARENTS CAN'T PROVIDE MUCH HELP.

 There are approximately 1,200 students, pre-kindergarten to fifth grade, in 
our school. We have a high turnover rate, so the number varies from day to day. 
Few days pass that we don't have a parent either checking a child out or 
registering a child in one of our classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Our school is about 50% Latino and 50% African American. Unlike some schools, 
however, our parents seem to work very well together, without any friction 
between the racial groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Parental involvement is absolutely important to a child's success, but there 
are economic realities that make it impossible for parents to volunteer at the 
school. As I tell my parents, there are a number of ways to be involved without 
attending meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of our parents attend teachers' conferences. We ask the parents 
to encourage their children to return their homework and we ask them to discuss 
school rules with their children. That's a form of involvement in which all 
parents can participate. 
</P>
<P>
 We do have a cadre of parents who are very involved and who are at the school 
on a regular basis. We no longer have a PTA but we have a strong Booster Club. 
PTAs have to send dues to a central office, but with a Booster Club, 100% of 
the money goes to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Booster Club raises roughly $5,000 a year and that money pays for some of 
the extras, such as field trips or holiday celebrations. Santa Claus came to 
school last week and the Booster Club provided a stocking full of goodies for 
each child. One of their goals this year is to purchase an alarm system for the 
school because recently we have had a number of break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Money certainly helps but I don't think that it's the only thing. There are 
schools where achievement levels are high compared to other schools with more 
money. I think student achievement has to do with the dedication of the staff, 
which is as important as money. 
</P>
<P>
 We do get money from other sources. We get federal funds because we are a 
Chapter One school, which means we have low test scores and high levels of 
poverty. The federal government also funds our IBM computer lab, part of a 
program responding to the civil unrest that broke out after the first Rodney 
King trial in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a School Readiness Language Development Program, funded through 
integration funds, money from the state and district to relieve the effects of 
segregation. The program allows us to prepare 4-year-olds and their parents for 
elementary school. Integration funds also go to our Language Development 
Program for African American students. And as a school with large numbers of 
students with limited English-language proficiency, we get state bilingual 
funds. While those funds can be used only on particular populations of the 
school, we received $119,603 in state funds this year from the School 
Improvement Program. That program is probably one of the best because all the 
children benefit from it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past six years, the youngsters also have benefited from a private 
donation by the Riordan Foundation. We have two "Write-To-Read" labs -- a 
kindergarten and first-grade program that provides computer labs for children, 
where they practice reading and writing simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we're on the road to addressing the problems we have at this school. 
</P>
<P>
 We recently decided to become a LEARN (charter) school, which will give us 
more autonomy from the district to pursue solutions to our problems. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not satisfied with the achievement level some students have shown on 
tests. Part of that may be because there's more transiency in our community 
than in communities where the scores are higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Our parents do what they can. They are very supportive. But, obviously, they 
are not as affluent as some parents at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about our school is our children. I think visitors to our 
school would be pleasantly surprised.

 Parents and teachers always want you to live up to this standard. They want 
you to be responsible about school and your social life and a job if you have 
one, but they talk to you like you're a child. Teachers want you to think for 
yourself but when you question their point of view, they try to make you look 
like your opinions don't mean anything. When I'm on my own and I'm "an adult," 
I hope I can remember what it was like to be a teen-ager.

 Adults downplay our problems but want you to understand their problems. 
Parents and teachers don't really seem to understand that what might seem small 
to them is a big problem to me. Maybe trying to get a good grade or having a 
fight with a friend might seem trivial to adults, but to a lot of teen-agers 
school and friends are a large portion of their lives. Sure, for our parents, 
losing their job would be a big thing, but they have to realize that our 
problems are big to us.

 My parents want me to be like an adult but they don't want to give me the 
respect of an adult. Like when adults talk to other adults, they talk to them 
as their peers, not like a child. My mother, for example expects a lot of 
responsibility from me but she won't let me grow up. I would like a little 
respect and consideration.

 Adults generally don't care what we have to say. I suppose it's a maturity 
factor as to why parents and teachers generally won't accept the opinions of 
young people. I work for the student newspaper. If (both) I and the L.A. Times

would have more respect for, or care what they ask? It's just the way things 
are.

 I think it depends on the adults. My parents treat me like an adult but other 
adults will look down on you. My parents have always tried to answer my 
questions and never talk down to me. But other adults don't want to bother. It 
probably is a maturity thing. When you seem mature people tend to treat you 
differently. I'm not saying it's right, but that's the way it is.

LOS ANGELES' HOUSES OF TROUBLE; CITY COUNCIL PONDERS MEASURES TO COPE WITH THE 
FESTERING SORE OF ABANDONED HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abandoned homes, once a rarity in Los Angeles, are increasingly common because 
of the riots, the Northridge earthquake, the lingering recession and the plunge 
in real estate values. Owners are required to board up the vacant properties. 
If they don't, the city will pay for the work and then place a lien on the 
property. But Times staff writer Larry Gordon found that mere plywood is not 
deterring gangs, drug addicts or homeless squatters, who can turn somebody 
else's American dream into an urban nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the vacant property more secure and less available for criminal 
activity, City Councilman Marvin Braude, who chairs the Public Safety 
Committee, supports an ordinance that would require metal grating on windows 
and doors and tall fences around the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 At the committee's direction, the city attorney's office is drafting the 
measure, which would also give police greater authority to arrest squatters and 
set up a toll-free hot line to allow neighbors to report trouble. These steps 
should reduce the menace and slow this worrisome and, in some cases, deadly 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors, firefighters, police officers and housing officials count 
more than 3,000 vacant properties in Hollywood, the Westlake area, Watts, 
South-Central Los Angeles and Pacoima and other sections of the San Fernando 
Valley. Unchecked, the blight spreads domino-fashion. Law-abiding neighbors 
flee neighborhoods afflicted by graffiti-covered crime pads, crack houses and 
squalid squatters' lairs that become breeding grounds for rats. In Hollywood, 
squatters recently tortured and killed a man in an uninhabitable apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant properties also become fire hazards. More than 300 fires have been 
set by vagrants in such structures this year, causing at least two deaths. In 
the Westlake area last month, homeless people were rescued from a blaze in a 
boarded-up residential hotel. The building had been sealed three times and had 
partially burned three times before the final blaze. The City Council will pay 
to tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition is ordered after fire or vandalism destroys more than 60% of the 
building and it becomes a threat to public safety. Tearing down such nuisances 
is not cheap, but it must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the rash of plagues -- riots, recession and earthquake -- Los Angeles 
had escaped the urban decay reflected by boarded-up neighborhoods in Detroit, 
Newark, St. Louis and other old cities. Before it's too late, the City Council 
should impose stronger security, speed the process of taking over vacant 
properties and make it easier for nonprofit groups to acquire and salvage 
abandoned homes.

DEFANGING A VITAL WATCHDOG; SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS SOME ENEMIES 
IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Republican Congress has made it known that the Securities and Exchange 
Commission is one of the U.S. government agencies that it is targeting for 
budget cuts and curbs on litigation. With more money than ever pouring into 
stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other investments, this is not the time to 
scale back on the watchdog agency assigned to oversee the securities business 
and look out for consumer interests. This is especially true now that the SEC 
is investigating the possibility of influence peddling in the Orange County 
bankruptcy debacle. Back in April, the SEC found the county's investment 
strategies risky but not illegal based, the agency says today, on the 
information available then. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC should be spared cuts that will impair its operations and that have an 
adverse impact on the public interest. The agency has already been unable to 
maintain adequate inspection programs to keep up with the phenomenal growth in 
mutual funds and investment advisory businesses. The unexpected bankruptcy of 
Orange County is presenting a host of securities questions that need 
illumination and exploration. Newly popular investments such as derivatives, 
for example, need more stringent investor-capital requirements and disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC, under Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., has pushed investor awareness 
programs and clamped down on so-called rogue brokers, those who are known to 
abuse client accounts yet always seem to find another job in the business. 
Levitt has also managed to coax the securities industry to take corrective 
actions voluntarily on some questionable practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In looking for ways to secure more funds, Levitt has suggested that the SEC be 
allowed to keep the fees and fines it generates and now turns over to the 
Treasury. But Sen. Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican in line to head the Banking 
Committee's securities subcommittee, objects on the grounds the agency would 
become too independent and intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investments by their very nature are risky. The decisions are ultimately 
the investor's. But a measure of protection from unscrupulous operators, 
less-than-adequate disclosures, unfair and fraudulent brokers and other such 
practices is justified. The SEC's mission is to do just that. It must have the 
funds and personnel to get the job done. Whether the money comes from the 
Treasury or the fees and fines collected by the SEC itself, the investment 
would be profitable in terms of protecting the American investor.

 Re "Gingrich Backs Denial of Medicare to Wealthy," Dec. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 When Newt Gingrich suggested that retirees with over $100,000 in income will 
have to buy their own medical insurance, I hope he was including members of 
government. Congress has worked out the cushiest of retirement and medical 
benefits for itself and left the rest of us hanging. Lawmakers should live by 
the same laws they make for us. If we have to pay through the nose for our 
medical care, everyone in Congress should too. 
</P>
<P>
 And let's hear it for double dipping, cost-of-living raises and more money in 
yearly government retirement benefits than the average worker who is slaving 
away ever sees in a lifetime. Guess where all that money comes from. That 
little worker's tax dollars. Government's gotten so fat and sassy, not to 
mention greedy, it's amazing there isn't revolution.

attack Social Security and Medicare. Once these grinches set a high age limit 
for Social Security and a lower income limit for Medicare, they can slowly 
undermine the whole structure by raising the ceiling for Social Security and 
lowering the income threshold for Medicare time and time again. None of these 
grinches has any plan to lower the cost of health care.

 These attacks on the well-being of the elderly are a declaration by the

taxpayers were cut in 1986 from 50% to 28%, taxpayers increased their taxable 
income by more than 40%." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, work the numbers. Rich taxpayer X pays 50% on say $100,000 taxable 
income. He keeps $50,000, the government gets $50,000. Now, increase taxable 
income by 40%. Taxpayer X now makes $140,000. At the lower 28% rate, the rich 
taxpayer now pays $39,200 and keeps $100,800. X gets richer, the government 
loses $10,800, and the shortfall is made up by the rest of us or left on the 
table as deficit, just like it actually happened.

sense, to have it for an unlimited number of children, but this obviously is no 
longer the case. How about helping to balance the budget by limiting the 
exemption to two!

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to apply for a position as a lawyer in the environmental movement 
described by Alexander Cockburn in "Green Message Needs a New Messenger" 
(Column Left, Dec. 8). As I understand it, while "soft, corporate and 
politically ductile," lawyers in this movement nonetheless get "spacious D.C. 
quarters," six-figure incomes from "corporate foundations," and work "swollen 
with corporate slush, hand in glove with arrogant federal agencies."What a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 As for my credentials, I have been an environmental/public interest lawyer for 
22 years. Obviously, my colleagues have been holding out on me since my world 
bears no relationship to Cockburn's. Instead, it is inhabited by a handful of 
dedicated lawyers who, in and out of Washington, fight in the trenches every 
day against corporate power and government malfeasance, ridiculously 
outnumbered, understaffed and underpaid.  
</P>
<P>
 Their "spacious" offices are usually the size of a walk-in closet, overflowing 
with legal pleadings, documents and phone messages. They frequently represent 
the very grass-roots organizations, "out there," that Cockburn so idolizes. 
Indeed, following Martin Luther King's axiom, "agitate, legislate, litigate," 
they have brought countless lawsuits to stop the "incinerator in the poor part 
of town or cancer clusters associated with poison waters and soils" Cockburn 
rails against. They deserve accolades not disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to the recent election results and what they mean for the 
environment, I have some free legal advice for pundits like Cockburn, the 
"thinkers" not "doers": stop looking for scapegoats, start looking for answers.

 Re "Retire the Scholastic Aptitude Test," Commentary, Dec. 4:

 I would like to thank Lee A. Coffin for publicly stating what I have felt all 
along, that standardized tests do not do a good job of measuring academic 
achievement in the classroom and that they are biased against poor and minority 
students. Why can't the College Board abandon the SAT altogether? Haven't the 
members of the College Board got anything better to do with their time than 
make the lives of high school juniors and seniors miserable?

at the 1800 block of Wilcox Avenue in Hollywood (Nov. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lee Bryant, the victim, was my brother.He hung with all the black 
dudes, his two last girlfriends were Mexican (one of them still very much in 
love with him), so whoever said that he was touting white supremacy was a liar! 
Robert's best friends were all black and Mexican and they are outraged about 
that article, and so am I. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother did have a home here with me and my mother. He had just gotten out 
of Wayside Nov. 25. He would have come back home, if he had the chance.

WHY DOES IT ALWAYS TAKE A CRASH -- OR TWO?; ON SAFETY ISSUES, THE FAA SEEMS 
LOCKED IN A HOLDING PATTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crash of an American Eagle turboprop in North Carolina last week that 
killed 15 people couldn't have come at a worse time for the commuter airline 
industry. And the timing wasn't much better for the Federal Aviation 
Administration, which deservedly has been blistered by air safety advocates for 
its repeated and well-documented failure to act quickly on key airline safety 
reforms, including needed safety improvements for commuter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, less than 24 hours after the North Carolina tragedy, and 
nearly two months after another American Eagle accident claimed 68 lives in 
Indiana, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena launched safety audits of the 
commuter airline industry and promised to beef up inspection standards. A swift 
reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 Not upon examination of the record. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board strongly cautioned the FAA to bring 
commuter aviation's inspection rules in line with larger jet aircraft as early 
as 1991. Similar warnings were sounded a year later by congressional 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 But as with other critical safety issues -- including crash-resistant fuel 
lines, ground-proximity warning systems, large-jet wake turbulence and aircraft 
icing -- the FAA was locked in a holding pattern.  
</P>
<P>
 Why? A recent and revealing series on the FAA by Times staff writer Jeff 
Brazil cites, among other reasons, the agency's dual role as promoter and 
protector, the absence of an effective system to identify aviation safety 
hazards and Byzantine legal requirements that call for lengthy cost-benefit 
analysis before any regulatory change can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA let years pass and hundreds of lives be lost before implementing 
appropriate safety policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat to passengers from ice buildup on aircraft wings, for example, was 
well-documented since 1982, when 78 died after an Air Florida 737 crashed on 
takeoff in Washington, D.C. After 23 more icing-related accidents, the 
government finally toughened its icing procedures in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the FAA was warned of the danger for small planes following too 
closely behind Boeing 757 jets. Experts recommended increasing the minimum 
trailing distances. The agency, worried about the economic impacts, delayed 
changes. Two fatal crashes later, those distance requirements were increased. 
FAA Administrator David Hinson defends his agency's safety record but 
acknowledges that the bureaucracy could respond faster. A proposed database 
will help. So would a "safety czar" to oversee regulation of the airline 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the changes announced last week, Secretary Pena should mold an agency 
that puts safety in the skies first. That can't happen when regulatory changes 
get bounced around like a hot potato between the Transportation Department, the 
Office of Management and Budget and the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no shortage of ideas. The real question is how many more dead bodies 
will have to be pulled out of planes to justify long-needed changes.

CHARITY AND TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the era that I grew up (1930s and 1940s), charity was a part of everyone's 
life. Those that had, gave, and those that were in need, received and gave 
thanks.In those days my family received more than they gave and we were always 
thankful for the help we received. As I grew older and became more successful 
in life, I found out how the givers felt when they actively donated time or 
material things to a person, family, or charitable organization. Call it 
satisfying one's ego, but one feels something special when actively donating to 
a charity you believe is helping those in need and who are grateful for the 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot remember a time when I, or others I knew, didn't give with love in 
their hearts. If you believe as I do, that actively giving gives satisfaction, 
then why do we support a system that gives to the needy through federal, state 
and local government taxes? I don't know one person that feels satisfaction 
when paying taxes. However, the political and social bureaucracies that take 
your taxes and distribute most to the so-called needy are feeling the 
satisfaction we should be feeling and are getting paid for it. We taxpayers 
must love misery instead of the satisfaction of actively giving because we keep 
feeding the bureaucrats' egos more each year.

CHECHNYA INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Chechnya Invasion Puts Yeltsin in Harm's Way," news analysis, 
Dec. 12: 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya became a part of Russia at the same time as California became a part 
of the United States: in the middle of the last century. Now, let's imagine for 
a second that those guys who brandished foreign flags before the recent 
elections in California would prevail, and thenew governor declared 
California's independence from the United States.As long as that would happen 
in violation of the U.S. Constitution, some federal presence in the state would 
be inevitable. Would you choose to call this presence an "invasion"? 
</P>
<P>
 Webster defines "invasion" as "a hostile entrance into the territory of 
another." Neither United States nor any other country in the world has 
recognized the "independence" declared by Dzhokar M. Dudayev. So, whose 
territory has Russia invaded? Really, all cats are gray in the night.

NOT ORPHANAGES OR PRISONS, BUT RESPONSIBLE FATHERS; POVERTY: LET'S ATTACK THE 
PROBLEM RATHER THAN WAREHOUSE ITS CONSEQUENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BLANKENHORN, David Blankenhorn is president of the Institute for 
American Values and the author of Fatherless America, to be published in 
February by Basic Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposal to build more orphanages is similar to our current strategy of 
building more prisons. Both ideas assume that more brick-and-mortar structures, 
staffed by public or quasi-public employees, can fill the vacuum in our society 
created by the growing collapse of parental capacity and the disintegration of 
the married-couple child-raising unit. Both, in short, are strategies for 
rescue and quarantine. Both are aimed largely at the growing ranks of 
fatherless children in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals, in my view, have no right to profess outrage at the idea of 
orphanages, as if current living conditions for millions of our children 
constituted anything other than unconscionable cruelty. Nor do conservatives 
have any business discussing this proposal as part of a triumphant, 
in-your-face political rhetoric, as if reopening orphanages in the United 
States at the close of this century constituted anything other than an 
admission of failure.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, before we decide simply to accept the trend of family fragmentation, 
while concerning ourselves only with warehousing some of its consequences, we 
would do well to consider the recent experience of the Hennepin County, Minn., 
Board of Commissioners. Earlier this year, the board drafted a "vision 
statement" to identify priorities for the future. The document called for a 
community "where healthy family structure is nurtured and fewer children are 
born out of wedlock." This goal produced what the Minneapolis Star Tribune 
termed "a big ruckus." A reporter from the newspaper summed up what many local 
leaders were saying about the commissioners and their idea: "Exclusionary. 
Judgmental. Intolerant. Offensive. Stigmatizing. Degrading. Archaic." 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant parks commissioner was outraged: "Why is this statement here? Why 
are you pointing fingers?" The county's community health director argued that 
"we have a lot of single parents who work here. A lot of them feel it was 
shaming to them as single parents." 
</P>
<P>
 A lesbian leader chastised the commissioners for "discounting" gay and lesbian 
parents. A pastor said that the real issue was jobs, not marriage. A United Way 
leader said that the real issue was how to "nurture" children, not "how people 
choose to configure themselves." A state fiscal analyst told the commissioners 
that "there are a lot of good single-parent families and there are a lot of bad 
two-parent families, and you're not going to change that."  
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of this firestorm, the commissioners, or at least some of them, 
insisted that the county's escalating rate of unwed childbearing -- about 27% 
in 1992 -- was causing or aggravating problems from child poverty to infant 
mortality, thus lowering the quality of life for everyone in the county. Their 
message was simple: We need to change our minds on this issue. Moreover, the 
commissioners hoped that the new goal would help them refocus policy 
priorities. The traditional goal had been to ameliorate consequences of trend. 
Now there was an additional goal: to reverse the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Two points: First, if you want to say something controversial, say that every 
child deserves a father and that unwed childbearing is wrong. Second, the 
Hennepin County vision statement ignited and gave shape to a serious local 
debate about the possibility of recovering the fatherhood idea. That 
possibility concerns not just the politics of Hennepin County, but the future 
of the nation. It is time for all of us to consider this. Perhaps we can even 
agree that, as a national strategy for reversing the decline of child 
well-being, the fatherhood idea is far more consistent with the better angels 
of our nature than either the prison idea or the orphanage idea.

WHEN BIGOTRY OUTPACES TECHNOLOGY . . . ; COMMUNICATIONS: WE NEED TO ATTACK THE 
MESSAGE, NOT THE MODEM, TO ENSURE ON-LINE SERVICES ARE FREE FROM CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS E. WELCH, Douglas E. Welch is a computer consultant. He can be 
reached at dewelch@pop.com. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As each new technology marches onto the scene, there are some who instantly 
blame all the ills of society on it. Groups calling for the censorship of 
computer networks are forgetting that it is not the technology that is causing 
the problem, but the people using the technology. Instead of targeting the 
authors of hate speech on the computer networks, they are targeting the 
networks themselves. This only reinforces the immediate need for on-line 
computer services to be protected by the federal government as "common 
carriers," like telephone utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatemongers and bigots have always been a part of human society. Through 
ignorance and bullying, they gather their flock, but it is through open debate, 
education and reasoned discourse that they are best confronted. Instead, 
professed anti-hate groups are attacking the providers of on-line services in 
an effort to force them to remove offensive messages or prevent their posting. 
Rather than using the technology to fight back and denounce this hate speech, 
they are seeking to remove the freedom of speech altogether. Were the situation 
reversed, I am sure you would hear them decrying the evils of censorship as 
loudly as they call for it now. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone companies cannot be sued when offensive or illegal calls are placed 
through their systems. On-line services deserve the same kind of "common 
carrier" status. There is no reason on-line services should have to be both 
provider and policeman. This places them in danger of being a censor. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line users have several simpler options. They can merely ignore the message 
with the press of a key or set up their "kill file" to ignore messages of 
certain content or from a certain user. Ultimately, on-line services provide 
users the chance to engage these hatemongers in a forum free of physical threat 
with hopes of liberating their narrow focus. The immediacy of posting a 
response to such a message can only be found in the on-lineworld. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services are no passing fad. They are rapidly gaining popularity on 
par with telephone and fax service. We need to stop treating on-line services 
like something new and ensure that they are free from censorship pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Censorship has always been defined as a "slippery slope" that can easily lead 
to a repression of ideas and a lower quality of life. Whether we communicate 
via paper, phone lines or on-line computer services, our freedom of speech 
should be protected. Hate groups should be targeted for their messages, not how 
they send them.

...AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS LAG BEHIND; COMMUNICATIONS: WITHOUT LEGISLATION TO 
ALLOW US TO CODE OUR OWN BITS, OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ARE AT RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Would you give the FBI the right to scan the mail you send and receive if the 
agency says it needs to? Would you trade some of your privacy rights so that 
the FBI and other state agencies could catch a few more drug dealers? You did 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the FBI and other law enforcers have just won the right to scan all our 
digital phone and fax calls. In October, Congress passed and the President 
signed an FBI-backed bill that will force phone companies to retrofit their 
phone lines with devices that let the FBI and others plug in and listen to 
digital talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI cast the measure as a way to fight crime. "We see a rocky road ahead 
for law enforcement," FBI chief of investigative technology James K. Kallstrom, 
said, "because the (new digital) technology hasn't been designed with the 
correct feature packages." Those "correct" features are just those that would 
keep you from sending secure messages by phone or fax or electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the First Amendment right to say what you want to say in your own 
way. The new digital phones convert what you say into long strings of 1s and 
0s. To say it in your own way you can encrypt those 1s and 0s with the latest 
smart software. The FBI wants to be sure it can crack the codes you use. It 
wants to limit the kinds of codes you can use and wants to be sure it can 
listen to you use them. The FBI does not want you to speak in a language it 
cannot hear or understand. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, the Clinton Administration tried to do much the same thing 
for the FBI with its failed "Clipper Chip" proposal. That would have built the 
code breaker right into new computers, phones, modems and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 The new FBI measure goes straight to the phone companies. FBI Director Louis 
Freeh claims that the FBI failed to carry out 91 court-ordered wiretaps because 
of poor line access. The new bill will pay the phone companies $500 million to 
retrofit the phone lines as the FBI sees fit. Thus will the state pay for our 
prior consent with our own tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Congress approved wiretaps that stem from a court order. To get a 
court order for a wiretap, the FBI must show probable cause of a crime or a 
threat to national security. In practice, probable cause has come to mean just 
that the FBI asks for a wiretap. That stems in large part from the new 
search-and-seizure powers that the Reagan and Bush administrations and the 
Supreme Court gave the FBI, CIA and police to wage the Cold War and the war on 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, AT&T held a monopoly on phone lines. And phones were analog, as are 
most still. You speak into a phone and the phone turns your speech into smooth 
changes in current that flow over wires to some other phone or microwave link 
or satellite link. The FBI can tap a phone or fax call if it can intercept the 
analog signal. 
</P>
<P>
 New communications are digital. And each phone company uses its own digital 
schemes and devices to send and receive digital messages. The FBI can crack our 
codes only if it has direct access to them. It has such access for wireless 
phones and faxes since these transmit through the air. The FBI and police can 
tap your cellular phone without a warrant. They can scan calls at random to 
look for key words and case leads and they do so as a matter of course. 
</P>
<P>
 At root, the FBI still wants us to use codes that it or the National Security 
Agency can crack. The NSA has 12 underground acres of computers to crack codes 
in Fort Meade, Md. It also has little or no oversight. So far, the NSA has used 
export laws to stop Microsoft and other firms from using encryption codes in 
their software that the NSA felt were too hard to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a digital-rights act -- a law that gives us the right to code our own 
bits in our own way. This would extend the First Amendment to the Information 
Age. The law would cost zero tax dollars, and a bold politician could propose 
it today. Then we would not have to trust the goodwill of unchecked state 
agencies that buy computers by the ton and swap databases at the speed of 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 A digital-rights act would ensure our right to secure speech in the face of 
the next wave of digital and wireless advances. Or else at each step we will 
face trading more of our digital privacy for more government control.

STEELERS TRAVEL DOWN MEMORY LANE; AFC: A RECORD HOME CROWD CHEERS PITTSBURGH TO 
A 17-7 VICTORY OVER CLEVELAND, CLINCHING THE HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE THROUGHOUT 
THE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the ultimate throwback weekend. The Pittsburgh Steelers took an entire 
city -- and the Cleveland Browns -- back to the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers, pumped to a Super Bowl-like pitch by a towel-twirling, 
throwback-to-the-'70s crowd and given two gift scores by the Browns, defeated 
Cleveland, 17-7, Sunday to secure the AFC Central title and home-field 
advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers (12-3) won their seventh in a row, their longest streak since 
1983, and have won 12 games for only the fourth time in franchise history. They 
won Super Bowls the other three times they did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what this is all about, trying to get to the big show," Pro Bowl 
linebacker Kevin Greene said. "If we win two (playoff games), we're in the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the last seven AFC teams to hold home-field advantage made the Super 
Bowl. The only exception was the Steelers, who lost a divisional playoff game 
at home to Buffalo in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're a better, more mature, more experienced team than we were then," 
All-Pro cornerback Rod Woodson said. "Like today, we made mistakes too, lots of 
them, but we also made big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns (10-5) simply made too many mistakes. Committing three turnovers 
and three bad penalties, they were swept by Pittsburgh for the first time since 
1981 and will enter the playoffs as a wild-card team even if they finish with 
the second-best record in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 A poor-starting team -- they were held scoreless for three quarters last week 
by Philadelphia -- the Steelers turned two Cleveland penalties into touchdowns 
on their first two possessions. That forced the Browns out of their 
conservative, run-oriented offense, and played into the hands of a defense that 
has allowed an NFL-low 14 touchdowns in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Testaverde, 21 of 42 for 250 yards and two interceptions, took the 
Browns on the longest scoring drive of the season, 84 yards, against the NFL's 
top-ranked defense. But Testaverde also took them out of the game with bad 
defensive reads, inexcusable interceptions and underthrown passes to wide-open 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers' unexpected big lead helped limit the Browns' Leroy Hoard, 
averaging nearly 100 yards a game the last six weeks, to only 25 yards in eight 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're better than the Steelers. Definitely, we're better than them," the 
Browns' Bennie Thompson said. "Take away the penalties and the turnovers and 
they can't stand a chance against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil O'Donnell didn't complete a pass for nearly two quarters, but completed 
six of seven, including a 40-yard touchdown pass play to Yancey Thigpen in a 
14-point first quarter against a defense that had allowed only 38 first-quarter 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those 14 points took Cleveland out of its game plan and got them all out of 
whack," the Steelers' Carnell Lake said. "It was just fantastic, the whole city 
was fired up. After that, we just fed off the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns, who haven't won in Pittsburgh since 1989, can only wonder what 
would have happened if it weren't for the turnovers and 96 penalty yards. 
</P>
<P>
 With Pittsburgh lined up to punt on fourth and one from the Browns' 45 on its 
initial drive, Thompson, the Browns' big-play specialist on special teams, 
jumped offside. Instead of punting, the Steelers had a first down at the 40, 
and O'Donnell crossed up the defense by connecting with Thigpen for a touchdown 
on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell threw incomplete on a third-and-10 on Pittsburgh's next possession, 
but cornerback Don Griffin's pass interference penalty gave the Steelers a 
first down at the 21. 
</P>
<P>
 A play later, O'Donnell connected with Eric Green for 17 yards for a first 
down at the three, and Barry Foster, returning from a two-game injury layoff to 
gain 106 yards, scored two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 14-0. It was also a madhouse inside Three Rivers, packed with a record 
crowd of 60,808. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it," Steeler rookie Brentson Buckner said. "It 
was like a college crowd because they never shut up. There was as much 
intensity in the stands as there was on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns had numerous chances to get back in it, driving to the Steelers' 
32, 38 and 14 on successive possessions, only to be stopped twice on downs and 
once by Gary Jones' interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde finally got the Browns back into the game with a 14-yard scoring 
pass to Mark Carrier with 10 seconds left in the half. But it wasn't enough in 
a game in which Gary Anderson's 49-yard field goal represented the only 
second-half scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns also botched a potentially pivotal third-quarter possession as 
Derrick Alexander's 15-yard taunting penalty for ill-advisedly spiking the ball 
in Greg Lloyd's face nullified a 14-yard catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite outgaining Pittsburgh, 331-277, and allowing only one sack to a 
defense that leads the NFL with 54, Cleveland didn't seriously threaten again 
until Testaverde's fourth-down incompletion from the Steeler two in the final 
minute.

 Hail to the chief: President Clinton called for income tax cuts for people who 
need job retraining or who will be buying new homes. "That's our Bill," says 
comic Argus Hamilton: "Always thinking of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on freshman GOP Sen. Fred Thompson's speech in response to the 
President's address: "He's a former movie actor. By the time he finished 
talking, it felt like Nancy Reagan had never left office." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills found one part of Clinton's tax reduction plan 
intriguing: "Families earning less than $60,000 would get a $500 credit for 
each Cabinet member who resigns under fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on a White House security scare: "I guess the alarm was set off by a 
woman who stepped over the security line. Turns out it was just an overanxious 
Elizabeth Dole measuring for drapes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the news: Hamilton, on Boris Yeltsin's nose surgery: "Everyone over 
there is amazed. This is the first time in Russian history that one of their 
leaders has come out from under anesthesia." 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Alex Pearlstein of Redondo Beach, on the study that says 50% of 12th 
graders have experimented with drugs: "Teachers say that's about the same 
percentage of students who have experimented with homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the same report, which indicates that teen drug use 
has increased: "Their self-designed anti-drug campaign isn't really working: 
Just say huh ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, on a possible Disney theme park in Latin America: "They'll mix Magic 
Kingdom technology with South American culture. All the jets on the airplane 
ride will carry cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Marc A. Holmes, on discovery of the chemical enzyme TPA, which 
may help people who exercise avoid heart attacks: "Scientists also think 
they've isolated the enzyme that makes rich people tie sweaters around their 
necks." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on why former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders should visit O.J. in jail: 
"If anybody needs some creative advice on how to spend time when you are alone, 
it's O.J.!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mills' Orange County update: "Voters in Manhattan Beach have overwhelmingly 
approved former County Treasurer Robert L. Citron as roving ambassador to their 
sister city of Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 Newark police say a major enforcement problem is the Russian Mafia. Comedy 
writer Tony Peyser says that when they make you an offer, "you have to stand in 
line before you decide you can't refuse."

</P>
<P>
 While reader Chuck Hall of Los Angeles was putting son Chase, 6, to bed one 
night, the two discussed the fact that Chase's name had appeared on the 
reprimand board at school with three check marks. Hall asked him what the boy 
could do the next day to keep his name off the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Without hesitation, Chase replied: "Go home."

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; THANKS, BUT SHE'LL PASS ON THE TRUE CONFESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When my housemate and I moved to Los Angeles, we invited two new friends to 
our home for dinner one Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't know them well. Part of the reason for having dinner with them was 
to get to know them better. In that regard, it was a resounding success. 
</P>
<P>
 Too resounding. I learned from one that she hadn't spoken to her father in 15 
years, not since her 21st birthday when he had knocked her unconscious. She 
didn't say why, and I wasn't certain etiquette allowed me to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 The other said she was going home for a visit soon -- the first in a number of 
years -- and that her mother had planned a party for the occasion. Sounds like 
fun, I remarked. Not such fun, I learned. Her mother had also invited her older 
brother, the one who had molested her throughout her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 All this before the main course. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't just them. During a lull in the conversation -- one guest was 
trying to recall whether she'd undergone electroshock treatments in 1984 or 
1985 -- my housemate (revealing a voluble facet to her personality I'd never 
seen -- and hope never to see again) confided that she was in therapy, and that 
my mother is the least sensitive person she's ever met, as though these two 
revelations were intrinsically related. She also told our new best friends that 
I had difficulty communicating important feelings to my father. 
</P>
<P>
 What important feelings? I inquired. You know, she knowingly replied. I 
didn't. Like the time you were embarrassed when he gave you that ugly 
briefcase; you didn't like it and didn't want to use it, but you didn't know 
how to tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 I was 10 years old, I protested. Sometimes the wounds inflicted during 
childhood leave the deepest scars, one dinner companion commented -- fixing me 
with a penetrating stare, no doubt looking for deep scars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Only I had some. As I polished off a bowl of ice cream, one new friend 
described how Overeaters Anonymous had rescued her from the brink of dietary 
disaster; how for years she had stuffed herself into near-oblivion, going so 
far one evening as to chew massive amounts of beef bouillon cubes washed down 
by gallons of hot water when her cupboards were otherwise bare. 
</P>
<P>
 I quietly decided against a second helping. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I poured myself a glass of port, an apparent cue for the other guest 
to tell us about her lifelong struggle with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Next followed a spirited debate whether addiction to alcohol or food was 
worse, during which someone told a story involving a late-night feeding frenzy 
that would have shamed the entire shark kingdom. The House of Pies figured 
prominently in the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it about Los Angeles that inspires otherwise well-mannered and 
reasonable people to forget both in their compulsion to confide their lives' 
intimate details to almost total strangers? Do I need to know things so 
personal that you wouldn't want to tell them even to your mother? Especially 
not my mother -- the insensitive one. 
</P>
<P>
 I come from buttoned-down Washington, suit capital of the world. Gray suits at 
that. With vests. The place where no one talks about personal difficulties. 
Where the mayor had to be caught on video smoking crack cocaine before 
admitting that he had a little problem . Where 12 jurors watched that videotape 
-- and half couldn't even be sure that there was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't necessarily think it's a better way to live; it's just the way I'm 
accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it occurred to me. About that problem I have communicating with my 
father. Maybe if I just invited him to a dinner with these friends on Saturday 
night. . . .

BOOK REVIEW; A CAUSTIC COMEDY WITH A PLOT TOO DELICIOUS TO PASS UP; PLUCKING 
THE APPLE BY ELIZABETH PALMER , ST. MARTIN'S PRESS/A THOMAS DUNNE, $20.95, 272 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ginevra Haye is an Oxford-educated art critic of some repute who cares nothing 
about her appearance. And why should she? Self-employed, she is intent on 
finishing an academic treatise and rarely leaves her cottage in Little Haddow; 
she has few friends, because of graceless, clumsy manners and careless, 
corpulent looks; and in any case her husband, Kevin, a bricklayer, is employed 
in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginevra reserves most of her energy for intellectual work -- and her "Little 
Haddow Kama Sutra" as well, the journal in which she fantasizes a steamy 
romance with art dealer James Harting, with whom she had her first sexual 
experience many years before. For the love of James, will Ginevra resolve to 
improve her figure and make the best of her attributes, thus forging a 
connection between her cerebral interests and her physical self? 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, especially after we learn that Ginevra is in fact losing weight 
and seeking counsel on her attire, it seems that "Plucking the Apple" may be 
following the path blazed by Fay Weldon's wonderfully wicked "Life and Loves of 
a She-Devil" -- boy beds girl, boy deserts girl, girl takes furious revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 That proves not to be the case, however; neither Ginevra's appearance nor her 
journal come to mean much in the novel, as if author Elizabeth Palmer had 
changed its plot midstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of focusing on this character, as one might expect from the early 
going, Palmer instead portrays with dark humor the romantic entanglements of 
four marriages, none particularly attractive. "Plucking the Apple," a 
bestseller in Britain, is a caustic comedy of domestic manners, and, if it's 
too diffuse and lightweight to rival Weldon's best and blackest humor, it won't 
be mistaken for a work by Anita Brookner, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The Careys are the central couple in the novel: Jack, the rising artistic star 
at the gallery run by James and Victoria Harting, and Ellen, Jack's 
long-suffering, indispensable wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery has scheduled an exhibition of Jack's new work, but as deadlines 
loom, the work, as usual, doesn't yet exist; Jack has been too busy cheating on 
Ellen to lift a paintbrush, and Ellen, at long last, is seriously thinking of 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Things come to a boil when Jack takes up with James' sister, Tessa Lucas -- 
gorgeous, socially ambitious, nearly nymphomaniacal, and married. Tessa proves 
more than a match for Jack, being a woman as egocentric and willful as he, but 
with even less compunction and much less talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer describes Tessa's beauty as being "so potent that it currently 
transcended the emptiness of her head," but that doesn't prevent Tessa from 
devising an ingenious scheme to enrage both Ellen and her own husband, the 
brooding poet, Alexander, and thus clear her way to become the second Mrs. Jack 
Carey. As Tessa blandly tells her brother about spouses, "I don't want the one 
I've got. I want a different one." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginevra believes, we're told early in "Plucking the Apple," that "marriages 
were either made in heaven or in hell and there was not a great deal in 
between." The hellish certainly dominate this novel: Ellen stays with Jack 
mostly for the children's sakes, Alexander with Tessa almost exclusively for 
her dazzling looks, Ginevra with Kevin purely for the sex, their intercourse 
being limited exclusively to the sexual. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hartings alone appear to have a viable relationship, but only because of 
the art gallery, it seems; James suffers the often-insufferable Victoria in 
large measure because her ingratiating social skills are good for business. The 
one truly loving couple in the novel, ironically, is the battling Careys, for 
when synchronized -- which admittedly isn't often -- Jack and Ellen are capable 
of recovering the passion and trust of their courting days. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not come as a surprise, given the above, that "Plucking the Apple" ends 
equivocally. There are no happy reconciliations; Ellen alone receives good news 
at the novel's close, learning that she may finally be able to embark on a 
career commensurate with her abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer doesn't tie together the novel's many loose ends with much conviction 
or elegance, but it's only fair that she provides Ellen, the book's one 
attractive character, with a promising future. Ellen is described at one point 
as a "born muse" -- indeed, she inspires superior creative work, following 
lovemaking, in two characters -- but until the novel's conclusion she is far 
too busy taking care of her husband and children and their home lives to be 
able to determine whether she might be an artist in her own right. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a feminist heart beating in this book, but Palmer, wisely, doesn't let 
it stop her from ridiculing equally the parties on either side of the battle of 
the sexes. Feel free to give "Plucking the Apple" to fans of Fay Weldon, and to 
men as well as women -- but on no account to a couple heading off on their 
honeymoon.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: SPORTS MERCHANDISING

 RAM DEMAND: Christmas Eve is shaping up as the last ever home game for the 
Rams in Anaheim, but holiday gift items with the team logo and colors are still 
popular. At Upper Deck card and clothing store in Anaheim, owner Bruce 
Gershenoff is steadily shipping Ram merchandise to places such as South Dakota, 
Canada and Scotland, despite the team's dismal record and uncertain future. . . 
. In fact, anything with a National Football League team logo is hot. "I'm 
selling a lot of pro football jerseys, as well as Christmas ornaments and 
coffee cups," Gershenoff said. "Pro football fans are extremely loyal." 
</P>
<P>
 STRIKE ONE: With no Mighty Duck call being sounded from Anaheim, don't expect 
a repeat of last year's frenzied run on the National Hockey League team's 
paraphernalia. Bruce Surdin, president of the National Skate Locker across from 
The Pond, says NHL souvenirs and apparel are not nearly as popular as they were 
a year ago because of the league's work stoppage. "We're finding fans do not 
want to support the teams," Surdin said. "Last year we sold about 150 custom 
jerseys (game sweaters) a month. Now we sell about 10." 
</P>
<P>
 GOPHER HOLE: For golfers who spend more time in the trees and rough than on 
the fairway, modern technology comes riding to the rescue. The Gopher golf-ball 
finder, available in most Orange County golf stores, has a free-swinging 
antenna that points toward a lost ball, even underwater. . . . Ken Bodger, the 
Gopher's West Coast distributor, says it works by filtering out everything 
except the wavelength given off by a Surlyn ball covering and that "99% of all 
golf balls are Surlyn covered." 
</P>
<P>
 HOT ITEM: With one of the healthiest snowpacks in years covering local 
mountains, equipment for winter play is going fast, says Jeff Jones, president 
of Newport Ski Company. The hottest selling items are boot-heaters, which have 
recently gained popularity with skiers and snowboarders. . . . "Boot-heaters 
are being made a whole lot better than they used to be," Jones said. "It's like 
roller blades; they have been around since the '80s but didn't catch on until 
the '90s."

YAO YILIN; EX-VICE PREMIER OF CHINA, CONSERVATIVE ECONOMIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yao Yilin, 77, a former vice premier and a conservative economist who helped 
launch China's market-oriented reforms. Yao disappeared from view for months in 
1991, reportedly because of an illness, and had not been seen in public since 
he retired from his last official post in 1992.Yao was associated with China's 
periods of economic retrenchment since it embarked on market-oriented economic 
reforms in 1979. He was a prominent figure in 1989, when reforms were rolled 
back after a military crackdown on the democracy movement. Yao worked closely 
with Premier Li Peng, whom he had mentored and who also is an economic 
conservative, but reportedly was forced to resign in 1992 for being too 
narrow-minded. Born in 1917 in the poor eastern China province of Anhui, Yao 
joined the Communist Party in 1935 and was a student activist at Beijing's 
Qinghua University, the nation's top technical school. During the 1937-1945 war 
against Japan, he served as a regional party official. After the Communist 
takeover in 1949, Yao worked in the trade ministry and was named minister of 
commerce in 1960. He was purged during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, but 
recovered his former post in 1978. The following year, he was named vice 
premier. On Dec. 11 in Beijing.

MIKE DOWNEY: A JEKYLL-AND-HYDE OUTFIT GETS KICK OUT OF ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't care if it hits the upright or if a bird falls out of the sky," 
Raider tackle Chester McGlockton said of the football that could have been the 
downfall of the Raiders, had a kicker from Seattle kicked it straighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Escaping by the hairs of their chinny-chin-chins, the Raiders ran their 
winning streak to three, defeating the Seahawks, 17-16, Sunday night in a game 
at the Kingdome that they were very lucky to win. 
</P>
<P>
 When a perfect spiral from Hostetler went right through Andrew Glover's 
fingertips on third down with scarcely two minutes to play, forcing the Raiders 
to punt, even Al Davis sat in the press box pounding his fist and saying, "That 
was the game! That was the . . . game!" seven or eight times. Meaning they 
could have locked it up right there. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Al's coach, Art Shell, said afterward, "This team doesn't do anything 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen games into a 16-game season, we still don't have a clue whether the 
Raiders are ready for the playoffs or for layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do they go from here? They go home, where this Saturday's date with Joe 
Montana and the Kansas City Chiefs could be the last game the Raiders play this 
season . . . or the last NFL game anybody ever plays at the quakey-breaky 
Coliseum . . . or the game that catapults the Raiders into the playoffs with a 
mean little four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us have given up trying to outguess the Raiders. They might very well 
open and close the season against the San Francisco 49ers, beginning on a 
Monday night and ending at the Super Bowl. Or they might go belly-up against 
the Chiefs, who have beaten them eight of the last nine times they met. 
</P>
<P>
 This is such a schizoid team. Good one minute, evil the next. Sane one week, 
nuts the next. Sharp, dull, strong, weak. Would the real Raiders please step 
up? 
</P>
<P>
 Here they were, playing a Seattle team riddled by injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they dominate? For a while they did, taking the crowd out of the game. 
Raider fans made more noise than Seahawk fans during the opening quarter. They 
got to cheer a beautiful pass from Jeff Hostetler to Rocket Ismail and a 
slashing run by Harvey Williams into the end zone on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the only appearance on artificial turf for the Raiders all season, 
and it appeared they were going to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 But after that, they dominated nothing. Seattle's defense came breathing down 
Hostetler's neck on every play, pushing L.A.'s offensive line all over the 
dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler became so frustrated that he again hauled out his new favorite move 
-- throwing the football at an opponent. And offensive tackle Robert Jenkins 
became even more frustrated, throwing punches at a Seahawk who came 
steamrolling right over him on the way to sacking Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 The foolhardy Jenkins got himself ejected from the game. Which put the Raiders 
in a serious hole, because offensive tackle Gerald Perry already had been 
knocked out of the game, suffering a head injury on a play that later Perry 
could not even remember. "I was all about giving it a try," Perry said, "but 
doctors didn't feel we should chance it." 
</P>
<P>
 That meant the Raiders had to move Kevin Gogan to an unfamiliar side and 
summon 38-year-old Max Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little difficult," Montoya said, laughing, "when you get tossed in there in 
the middle of the third quarter, stiff as a banjo string." 
</P>
<P>
 As if the offense wasn't having enough problems, the defense had one also. His 
name was Chris Warren and he kept running right through the Raiders, even 
though he supposedly still had two cracked ribs from an automobile crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy ran like he has extra ribs," admiring Raider lineman Anthony Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ribs aren't broken, man," Nolan Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think you're right," Smith told his teammate. "I want to find out who Chris 
Warren's P.R. guy is, so I can hire him." 
</P>
<P>
 In all honesty, the Raiders played another splendid game on defense, once 
again holding their opponents to a single touchdown. But there was one serious 
lapse, late in the game, that nearly cost them their whole night's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth down, Seattle buried deep in its own end, and somehow Kelvin Martin 
slipped free in the secondary for a 19-yard catch to keep the drive alive. 
There wouldn't even have been any drive had Glover snagged that third-down flip 
from Hostetler, who had taken pains to aim carefully in a tricky situation. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton couldn't believe it when Martin got loose. All night long, big 
Chester had been tackling everyone and everything in sight. He truly is turning 
into one of the great defensive players in the game. But when Martin caught 
that pass, nothing felt great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Makes you want to cry, just cry," McGlockton said. "One play, one damn play, 
the guy pops one." 
</P>
<P>
 About all the Raiders did thereafter was backpedal, until finally John Kasay 
lined up the field goal to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he was thinking about at that moment, McGlockton said, "Him 
missing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody in the Kingdome jumped higher than Glover on the final kick, trying his 
best to redeem himself for that dropped pass. He didn't block it, but like his 
teammates, he did get to see it sail wide to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders were real tired at the end," Seattle Coach Tom Flores said. 
"Thought we had 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 They were ready to be had. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGlockton rushed to the Raiders' defense, saying, "Tell you what, people 
have been writing us off all year, saying we ain't this and we ain't that. But 
we're still here. We ain't going away until we're ready to go away."

HOW'S THIS FOR PICTURE: EVEN RYAN MAY BE IN IT; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER 49ERS, 
COWBOYS, STEELERS AND CHARGERS, POSTSEASON SPOTS ARE MOSTLY UP IN THE AIR. AND 
DON'T COUNT OUT BUDDY'S CARDINALS YET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NFL playoff picture went from cloudy to confusing to downright scary 
Sunday when Eagles fell, Bills were driven off and football's grizzled predator 
remained standing. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 With one week remaining in the regular season, the only thing certain is that 
if Ryan's Arizona Cardinals complete their improbable stretch run by making the 
playoffs, that sound you hear will be the rest of the league cringing. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 After their fifth victory in six games Sunday -- a 28-7 defeat of the 
Cincinnati Bengals -- the Cardinals can fulfill Ryan's outrageous preseason 
playoff pledge if the following occur: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cardinals win their final game, in Atlanta, against a Falcon team whose 
playoff chances ended last week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dallas Cowboys defeat the overmatched New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The San Francisco 49ers defeat the Minnesota Vikings, who will probably be 
without quarterback Warren Moon, or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeat the Green 
Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the Cardinals (8-7) have assured themselves of their first .500 or 
better record in a decade. They are seeking their first playoff spot in a 
non-strike season in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think Ryan's 27th-ranked offense might have someone who can pass. OK, 
so it's running back Garrison Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the NFC outlook remains a mess, so much that by midnight EST 
Sunday, the league office still had not entirely figured it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the obvious facts that San Francisco and Dallas will each draw 
first-round byes -- with the 49ers remaining at home as long as they are alive 
in the NFC portion of the playoffs -- only a couple of things are known. 
</P>
<P>
 If all four NFC Central teams win next weekend, all four qualify for the 
playoffs. The only other two eligible teams, the Cardinals and New York Giants, 
would be out. 
</P>
<P>
 In those four games, Green Bay visits Tampa Bay, Chicago plays host to New 
England, Detroit visits Miami on Christmas night and Minnesota plays host to 
San Francisco in the season's final Monday night game. 
</P>
<P>
 The other truth is that the only chance the Giants have is to beat Dallas 
while the Packers lose to the Buccaneers. Which gives them almost no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Examining opponents and current situations, a list of NFC candidates in order 
of probability: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arizona earns a wild-card spot. Buddy's defense will stifle an Atlanta team 
that no longer cares, and Dallas and San Francisco will easily do their part. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Green Bay earns a wild-card spot. The streaking Buccaneers will finally 
show their true colors in a big game. And after Brett Favre's game-winning run 
in Milwaukee on Sunday, the Packers are feeling destined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Detroit wins Central Division championship. Miami is playing only for a 
first-round bye. Wayne Fontes will have the Lions -- 18-9 in December under his 
stewardship -- believing they are playing for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chicago will lose to New England -- the AFC's best team this month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vikings will lose an ugly finale against the 49ers in Minneapolis, but 
still make the playoffs because they defeated the Bears twice in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFC picture is far simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Patriots win in the early game on Sunday, then they will qualify, 
either as the AFC East champion if the Dolphins lose, or as a wild-card team if 
the Dolphins win. 
</P>
<P>
 The other wild-card spot in that scenario would be the winner of the 
Raider-Kansas City game in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Patriots lose the early game, then they must await the outcome of the 
Raider game, which could change dramatically with that news because the Raiders 
would then have already automatically qualified as a wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs must win to qualify, no matter what happens in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 What all of this means to the AFC first-round pairings is more obscure. The 
Pittsburgh Steelers have already clinched a first-round bye, and San Diego 
could join them with a victory over the Steelers or a loss by the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the Raiders could either be host to the Cleveland Browns or visit 
them in the first round, depending on the Browns' finale against visiting 
Seattle. In the other first-round game, the Patriots could meet the Dolphins 
for the third time this season. The Dolphins won their first two meetings by a 
combined 24 points.

HOSTETLER, BROWN CONCOCT GAME-WINNING PLAY ON THE FLY; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER 
DUO'S SHREWD EXPLOITATION OF MINOR LAPSE RESULTS IN WINNING SCORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With nearly nine minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and Seattle ahead by 
six points before an excited, noisy crowd at the Kingdome on Sunday night, the 
Raiders knew they needed a big play on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler knew it. So did wide receiver Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 So on the sideline after a field goal by John Kasay had given the Seahawks a 
16-10 lead, Brown talked to Hostetler about a play on the Raiders' previous 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mentioned to (Hostetler) that their safety was not getting over fast enough 
on this certain play and when we run it again for him to give me a look," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the play, Hostetler takes a quick three-step drop and has the choice of 
throwing to either Alexander Wright or Brown, who both run five-yard stop 
patterns on opposite sides of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a two-deep zone defense, however, the play changes as Wright and Brown 
adjust their routes into deep sideline patterns in between the Seahawks' 
cornerbacks and safeties. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down from their own 28-yard line, the Raiders were penalized for a 
false start by guard Steve Wisniewski. Now, faced with first and 15, the 
Raiders called on The Play . 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who had only three catches for 30 yards and had dropped two passes 
earlier, lined up on the right with Alexander flanked left. Seattle, which had 
a makeshift secondary because of injuries to three starters, called for the 
basic first-down defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The two key players for Hostetler were Seattle left cornerback Robert 
Blackmon, who had started the game at strong safety, and strong safety Rafael 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler knew that Blackmon's responsibility was to try to slow Brown and 
cover the right flat. He also knew that Robinson's job was to cover the right 
half of the field deep. 
</P>
<P>
 On his drop, however, Hostetler looked away from Brown and faked a pass to 
trick Robinson into thinking he was throwing to the left side or down the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The move gave Brown enough time to separate from Blackmon and get distance 
away from a late-charging Robinson down the right sideline in front of the 
Seattle bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a short drop and they were in a two-deep zone," said Hostetler, who 
completed 17 of 29 passes for 235 yards. "I made sure that I froze the strong 
safety (Robinson)." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of lofting a deep pass, Hostetler threw a bullet that caught Brown in 
stride behind Blackmon. Brown then shook off a desperation arm tackle by 
Robinson and sprinted into the end zone to give the Raiders a game-winning 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hostetler threw a jet in there to (Brown)," Robinson said. "He pump-faked me 
and then threw the ball right on the money on a fade route. I tried to get over 
there to at least stop the play, but I was a little too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "Jeff's fake must have really worked because the guy who came over 
just got an arm on me. The throw was just perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Seahawks' secondary, the play typified their season. 
</P>
<P>
 During the off-season, Seattle appeared loaded with talented defensive backs 
with cornerbacks Nate Odomes, Kirby Jackson, Patrick Hunter and Carlton Gray, 
and safeties Eugene Robinson, Blackmon and Rafael Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before the injury-bug hit. From Odomes' season-ending knee injury 
suffered in a pickup basketball game before training camp to Eugene Robinson's 
Achilles' tendon injury suffered last week at Houston, the Seahawks' once-proud 
secondary turned into an injury ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our secondary has had a rough time this season," Rafael Robinson said. "From 
one thing to another, we've just had our problems with injuries. At times, we 
were kind of mixed up out there tonight, but we made the adjustments we needed 
to make." 
</P>
<P>
 A point that was not lost to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime, I was a little frustrated," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew their secondary was down a little bit and I felt that we could have 
broken them a lot earlier."

SOCCER'S FIRST CITY?; ONEONTA, N.Y., TRIES TO BECOME SPORT'S COOPERSTOWN WITH 
HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Highway 28 twists and turns through the Catskills -- not mountains, really, 
merely hills -- crossing a stream here, skirting a forest there. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time of the year, the villages and farms along the way have a lonely 
look. The trees are bare, their leaves long gone. Snow dusts the surrounding 
hilltops. A gray, threatening sky and a cold wind complete the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, it wasn't this way. Then, there still was color in the 
landscape. The orange of jack-o'-lanterns set on front lawns and porch railings 
by local children. The reds and greens of painted folk art on sale at roadside 
stalls. A cold yellow sun in a pale blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's another season. Winter is almost here. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling west toward Oneonta late one afternoon, with dusk drawing in all too 
quickly, it was easy to be aware of the passage of time -- not simply the 
minutes and hours on the dashboard clock, but the seasons, the years, the 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Past, present and future. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is as fitting an introduction to this journey as any. Time travel, after 
all, is what it's about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ball sits in a glass display case. It is black -- but whether due to age 
or design is not readily apparent. And it is not quite round, more of a 
squished oval. 
</P>
<P>
 Painted in white characters on its surface is a date: Nov. 7th 1863. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the oldest soccer ball in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away, there is the photograph of a rather stern-looking young man, 
alongside another picture of the same man decades later. Gerrit Smith Miller 
was his name. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the founder and captain of the first soccer club in the United States 
-- Oneida F.C. of Boston, formed in 1862. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the distant past. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner is the not-so-distant past, a display honoring the 
late-lamented Cosmos of the North American Soccer League and, in particular, 
their star attraction, Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 On a nearby wall, color photographs and banners celebrate America's first 
world championship victory -- by the U.S. women's national team in China in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foyer is the future. 
</P>
<P>
 There, under a glass dome, is the architect's scale model of the future home 
of the $18-million Wright National Soccer Campus and its centerpiece 
attraction, the National Soccer Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oneonta, a town of about 19,000, has seen better days. It bills itself as "The 
City of the Hills," which indicates that there isn't much else there. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of months before last summer's World Cup, an English writer visited 
the town, drawn out of curiosity to see what, if anything, could possibly be in 
a United States Soccer Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The very idea, he wrote, "may sound to some like a cross between an oxymoron 
and wishful thinking. . . . Surely, fame and U.S. soccer are strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 It only goes to show how little is known -- inside and outside the United 
States -- about a sport that has been played here ever since Smith and his 
Oneida teammates kicked around on Boston Common 132 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As an aside, the players on America's first team wore a "uniform" consisting 
of a red scarf knotted Indian-style around their heads. The club lasted three 
years and was unbeaten. Its exploits are commemorated by a monument on Boston 
Common, near the Spring Street Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sort of trivia fans of the sport can find in Oneonta, which is a 
little less than 200 miles northwest of New York, or 250 miles from Boston or 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 But it might be better to postpone the trip for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Hall of Fame is a single-story, red-brick building that shares 
a parking lot with a bank and law offices. Its exhibits can be viewed quite 
comfortably in an hour or two. 
</P>
<P>
 And, interesting as most of the items on display undoubtedly are, there is a 
wealth of material stored, awaiting the day when the dream moves from the 
drawing board to reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five years have passed since the Wright National Soccer Campus was dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 61-acre site in Oneonta has four soccer fields and not much more. 
Plans for the sports/museum complex, however, are ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 They call for construction of a 27,000-square-foot museum, which is where the 
Soccer Hall of Fame will be housed; a 10,000-seat soccer stadium; training 
facilities; additional soccer fields, as well as housing for teams and 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Oneonta plays host to several soccer tournaments each year, including the 
annual Oneonta Mayor's Cup, the longest-running NCAA men's Division I-A 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The town has tied its future to the sport, hoping soccer will do for Oneonta 
what baseball did for Cooperstown, a few miles farther west on Highway 28. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, the 15,000 visitors who come to the interim Hall of Fame 
each year must make do with a glimpse of the past, a sampling of what was and 
what is to come. 
</P>
<P>
 They can marvel, for example, at Charlie Colombo's gloves -- the trademark 
leather mittens he wore in every game he played, including the United States' 
historic 1-0 victory over England in the 1950 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other mementos of that famous match, played at Independencia Stadium 
in Belo Horizonte, Brazil on June 29, 1950, including the jersey worn by Walter 
Bahr. 
</P>
<P>
 By today's standards, the woolen relic looks particularly dated. The United 
States took the field in those days in white jerseys with a diagonal red stripe 
and blue trim on the collar and cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another display features a jersey from the U.S. 1934 World Cup team, as well 
as a participant's medal awarded to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exhibits on American teams from the Olympic Games and the Pan 
American Games. There are sections devoted to the NASL, including the contract 
signed by Pele in 1975 with the Gotham Soccer Club, Inc., otherwise known as 
the Cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 There are old programs and posters, magazines and media guides, banners and 
bric-a-brac from clubs and leagues that have come and gone over the last 
century or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But 90% of the material donated to the Hall of Fame, including the huge and 
as-yet-unsorted World Cup '94 collection, will remain hidden until the new 
museum is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there will be entire floors of exhibits, audio and video records of the 
past, a theater for screening famous matches, a reference library and 
state-of-the-art interactive exhibits. That will be the time to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 And it won't matter whether it's spring or fall, summer or winter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oneonta, it will always be soccer season.

SURVIVAL IN THE BULGE; FIFTY YEARS AGO, HOUK EARNED SILVER STAR IN WORLD WAR II 
BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The citation with the Silver Star said Lt. Ralph Houk deliberately exposed 
himself to "the withering fire" and "calmly moved from one position to another 
directing his men. . . ." It doesn't say how scared he was, or how cold he was 
or how much he felt for the men beside him -- just as scared and cold -- with 
the Tiger tanks looming out of the fog. 
</P>
<P>
 They were in the Ardennes Forest region that stretched across Belgium and 
Luxembourg, with Allied forces moving well toward Germany when the devastating 
Runstedt counter-offensive we now call the Battle of the Bulge burst on them. 
It was Dec. 16, 1944. Houk earned his Silver Star on Dec. 21. Fifty years ago. 
At Bastogne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about the Bulge for a long time afterward," Houk reflected last 
week from his home in Winter Haven, Fla. "It seems like a dream now, the things 
you did because you had to do them. If we couldn't hold them back that day, 
we'd all (have) been killed. It's amazing what you'll do." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the German offensive was stopped it was the first week in February, and 
the Allies had suffered 81,000 casualties. Houk was 22 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 He was nicknamed The Major when he managed the championship Yankees in the 
early '60s. Whitey Ford changed the name of his dog from Casey to Major. Houk 
got that rank at his discharge, and he was made a captain late in the war. He 
got his reputation as a lieutenant. All the while he never thought about 
baseball. "I just wanted to get out of the war alive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was attached to Gen. Patton's 3rd Army on occasion. "I never did like it," 
Houk said. "He always moved so fast, with men getting killed. The 1st Army had 
fewer casualties. I'm not a Patton man." Maybe that experience was reflected in 
Houk's managing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember those little bitty villages there with homes demolished and the 
towns demolished and the smell -- it was hard to believe," Houk said. "We did 
those things, more than anything, because we believed if we didn't win the war, 
they'd come to America and to our homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were frightened for your life, and you did what you were trained for. The 
first time I saw dead Germans they looked just like Americans, except for the 
uniform. And then you started to think of them as animals. I had this Jeep 
driver out of New York, and I was sitting next to him and he was driving and a 
shell hit him. It used to come back to me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 What he recalls first now is the terrible unrelenting cold, trying to get warm 
by a fire in the cellar of a destroyed farmhouse or huddled in a foxhole. "I 
look back and I can't believe it; you never took your clothes off. The snow 
never left the ground. We stayed in the open those nights in the foxhole and we 
kept digging; if we coulda, we'da dug to China. Scared." 
</P>
<P>
 They ate K rations, packed with calories enough, except for the times the 
rations got mixed up and he'd get one with nothing but cheese. "We drank a lot 
of wine," Houk said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't all combat every day. The reconnaissance platoon he was commanding 
stayed for a time in an elegant hunting lodge near the town of Waldbillig, a 
beautiful lodge with a fine wine cellar. "But then the big push came and they 
ran us out of there," Houk said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was commanding 60 men because the two adjacent platoon leaders had been 
killed. From behind the rubble Houk could see 200 Germans behind six huge Tiger 
tanks emerging from the fog and advancing along the road toward him and his 
men, and a breakthrough. "Their Tiger tanks were better than our Shermans," 
Houk said. "They had better machine guns too. They fed bullets with metal 
links; we had web belts that froze with the mud and ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Tigers, Houk's guns were popguns, so he commandeered anti-tank 
weapons from an adjacent unit and directed fire. He took a bazooka, scrambled 
into a ditch and took aim at the lead Tiger. The lead Tiger was knocked out, 
blocking the road and stalling the attack long enough for the American troops 
to move back. "To this day I'm not sure I hit it," Houk said. "I was so close 
and I shot and I saw the explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 When his platoon collected itself, Houk saw his trench coat had seven bullet 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
 On one mission he took a platoon across the Auer River to check for 
minefields, and while they were on the German side, the bridge was destroyed. 
Three days later, they found some small boats and he led them back across to 
the unit. The closeness of a team in competition is often likened to that of a 
small unit in combat, but that's really only a literary allusion. "You felt 
very close to people in the unit, and I lost a lot of men there," Houk said. "I 
had gotten to know them pretty well. Some were kids I had trained with, and I 
saw a lot of them go out of their minds. And some tried to get hit so they 
could go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You almost hoped you did get hit in a minor way -- lose a finger or something 
-- to get out. But as scared as you are, you've been taught and you learn to 
say, 'I got to do this.' You think, 'we got to take a hill' because you've been 
told to. In a recon unit you're told to get to a certain place, so you'd go 
there. That's the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
 There were laughs in combat too -- nervous laughter in the dark. Houk was 
leading the unit near Waldbillig when they spotted a German soldier who looked 
as if he was digging in, leaning on his shovel in the haze. "We opened fire 
with all kind of stuff. It must have cost a lot in taxes," Houk said. "When we 
got there we saw that he had frozen, and the Germans had propped him up there 
as a trick to see where we were firing from. We laughed. There were a lot of 
those things." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Runstedt offensive was blunted, there was still war to be finished. 
Houk was at the Remagen Bridge too, carrying a heavy automatic rifle across his 
lap because it made so much noise that even if he missed, it scared the 
Germans. They were searching for snipers when a sniper found them. Houk slumped 
in his seat, a bullet hole in his helmet. The driver skidded the Jeep to a stop 
behind a barn and Houk lifted his head. The sniper's bullet had penetrated the 
front of his helmet, run around the liner inside and exited in back. Houk 
wasn't scratched. "My guys captured the sniper too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fighting because we believed they'd come to America, and when the war 
ended, it was the damnedest thing to see the German soldiers who survived 
walking in the streets, out of what was left of their homes; here's the guys 
who'd been trying to kill us, and we couldn't get home." 
</P>
<P>
 He never did get to Berlin; he did get to Paris on leave after the Bulge, "and 
that's another story," he said. "I won't get into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it seems that Houk's recon squadron went through the town where Leica 
cameras were made. "When they found out I had leave to go to Paris, the guys 
brought me bags of Leicas," he said. "You could sell them to the Air Force guys 
for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sold them, and had a hell of a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he thought about getting back to baseball.

SHOP TALK: DON'T USE OFFICE E-MAIL IF PRIVACY IS A CONSIDERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I work for a company of less than 50 employees. We regularly send 
mail to each other through e-mail, and we have access to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it legal for my employer to review messages sent out on the Internet that 
may be personal in nature? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.B., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The privacy issue that you raise is a hot topic in the legal 
community, but no clear rules have emerged from the courts yet. On the one 
hand, California privacy law provides some protection for an employee's 
reasonable expectations of privacy in the workplace. Moreover, statutory 
prohibitions on eavesdropping and wiretapping provide some privacy protection 
for electronic communications. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, employers exercise substantial control over equipment and 
communications at their places of business. Eventually, some clear rules may be 
established. Until that happens, you should assume that electronic messages 
generated or received at your office -- including voice-mail -- are not 
confidential and may be reviewed by your employer. (Government investigators 
and parties involved in litigation with your employer may also be able to 
obtain your messages.) 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest you find other ways to exchange private messages. For example, use 
your home computer to access the Internet via an on-line service, such as 
America Online, CompuServe or Prodigy. Communicate with your fellow employees 
in person or by written notes.

 Question: I work for a grocery company, and mine is a union job. On the annual 
bid, there are a few floating positions. During the course of the year, 
schedules for the positions fluctuate and the employees could end up working 
seven to nine consecutive days. Also, by mutual consent, employees will trade 
days off and will also end up working seven to nine consecutive days. My 
question is: How much overtime pay, if any, is the company responsible for? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.W., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are many exceptions to the overtime rules. In most situations, a 
union worker is not subject to the state or federal overtime rules if the 
collective bargaining agreement provides 1) cash straight time wage rate of at 
least $1 an hour above the state minimum rate and 2) premium rates for overtime 
work. The premium rates can be a set figure or a multiple of the straight time 
rate as similar to the state or federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
 You should review your collective bargaining agreement to see if it has these 
requirements. If it does not, the state or federal rules would apply. Even if 
you are not subject to the state or federal overtime rules, you still may be 
subject to other state or federal wage and employment laws.

 Question: I'm a certified nursing assistant who provides home care for the 
elderly. I work 12 hours a day, five days a week and I don't receive overtime, 
just straight time for the 60 hours. I was told the reason is that it's not 
mandatory for health care agencies to provide overtime pay. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.C., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. Both state and federal wage and hour laws provide overtime 
exemptions for home-care workers who assist the elderly or disabled. The 
exemption does not apply, however, where the home-care worker spends more than 
20% of his or her time doing work, such as general housework, not directly 
related to care for the elderly or disabled person. 
</P>
<P>
 The exemption also does not apply to trained health care personnel, such as 
nurses who administer medications or monitor vital signs. But a recent court 
case has held that certified nursing assistants do not constitute "trained 
health care personnel," for the purposes of this rule.

 Question: I work for a security company and have found out that they are 
charging their customers for overtime (holiday pay) for the officers' time, yet 
not paying these officers the holiday pay. In addition, they don't pay the 
officer for the actual time spent on post. Example: If the employee has to work 
to 5:21 p.m., he or she gets paid for only a quarter of an hour of overtime. 
The employee has to work to 5:30 p.m. in order to get half an hour overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any rules as to how parts of an hour are accounted for or can the 
employer make their own rules? Is this in violation of labor laws? Is there any 
recourse I can follow for myself and other employees? 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.B., Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: As to your first question, what your employer is doing is probably 
appropriate. What your employer charges its customers for the services it 
provides is a matter of contract between your employer and its customers. There 
is no labor law requirement that the employer pay its employees in exactly the 
same manner as it charges its customers for the employees' time. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the holiday wages paid by your employer, that too is a matter of 
contract between you and your employer. Therefore, if your employer has a 
policy that certain holidays are paid, and you work on one of those holidays, 
you perhaps should be receiving additional pay for the time worked on the 
holiday. If you believe you are not being paid appropriately, you may contact 
the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement to pursue a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 As to your second question, the general rule is that employers must pay for 
all hours worked, even very small fractions. However, there is an 
administrative enforcement exception that allows employers when paying overtime 
to round off to the nearest five-, 10- or 15-minute period, but only if in so 
doing the employees tend to receive overtime compensation for all hours worked. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears from your description that your employer is relying on this 
exception and rounding to the nearest quarter-hour in paying overtime. That is 
acceptable only if your employer also allows its employees to benefit by 
rounding off, Thus, using your example, to be allowed to rely on this 
exception, your employer would have to pay a half-hour of overtime to any 
employee who worked from 5:23 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. If your employer is not doing 
that, it may have liability under federal and state labor laws. Contact the 
Division of Labor Standards Enforcement if you believe that you have a valid 
claim.

 The recent annual report for Playboy Enterprises isn't exactly the kind of 
thing one reads for the articles, let alone the financial footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report, which outlines a bleak financial performance for the year 
ended June 30 for the publisher of Playboy magazine, includes information 
showing that one of the financial hits taken by the company came from a 
documentary film. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie: "Hugh Hefner: Once Upon a Time," about the perpetually pajama-clad 
founder of the Playboy empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage: a $1.2-million write-down in Playboy's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't the only problem listed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included is another $355,000 write-off for photos that will never be 
published in Playboy. Bad Timing Award

 Fresh on the heels of Merrill Lynch's public skewering over its role in Orange 
County's financial mess comes a just-published survey of senior banking 
executives done by the Towers Perrin consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, the bank officers hail the Wall Street firm as "their most 
respected non-bank competitor" out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merrill Lynch has earned the respect of these senior bankers because it has 
accomplished what most banks are still trying to do," a press release for the 
survey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, the reference is to selling financial products to individuals 
rather than to entire counties. Giant Battle 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle of the briefs over the right to sell James Dean brand 
underwear continues between a South Korean firm and the company representing 
the actor's estate and family. 
</P>
<P>
 As mentioned here last month, Curtis Management has sued Korean comedian and 
businessman Buyng Jin Joo and his J. Enterprise for selling the underwear in 
Korea, arguing that he is infringing on a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis last week was hit with a $1-million libel suit by J. Enterprise, 
alleging that Curtis is saying nasty things about the firm and its owner in 
claiming they are infringing on a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Enterprise registered James Dean products eight years ago and argues that 
it does not need Curtis' permission. 
</P>

 Janine Steck Swan, general counsel for Curtis, said she hasn't seen the suit 
but that Curtis will fight it vigorously. Comeback Kid

 Former real estate boy wonder Mike Glickman -- who was forced into personal 
bankruptcy nearly five years ago when his San Fernando Valley real estate chain 
collapsed -- this year is letting people know he has something to stuff 
stockings with -- or living rooms, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman, who now works for the Jon Douglas real estate firm, is proclaiming 
that he's giving away Christmas trees and other items to home sellers who list 
with him, and even to those who merely "interview" Glickman about giving him 
their business.

HOT JOBS: DECORATING WINDOWS MEANT FOR PEEPING INTO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some would consider decorating an entire home for Christmas a daunting task. 
But imagine decorating a three-floor department store. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Pamela Fry, visual display manager at Nordstrom's South Coast 
Plaza store, does every year. From windows to tables, she is in charge of 
creating ambience inside and out of one of the county's largest retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 From 7 p.m. until 7 a.m., Fry directs her six-member staff and 100 assistants 
in hanging Yuletide banners, Christmas trees and ornaments the day before 
Thanksgiving. The 12 hours they spend decorating is not a typical day. But 
according to Fry, there is no typical day. That's one thing she likes most 
about her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The variation on a daily basis is very appealing," says Fry, 39. "One day I 
might be up to my elbows in paint and another day I'm dressing a mannequin or 
working with mangers doing fixtures and lighting. You never know what you'll be 
doing next." 
</P>
<P>
 Fry started at Nordstrom four years ago after working for other major 
department stores in Southern California. A keen sense of color and style 
helped propel her through the ranks and she was promoted after working for the 
company only six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Fry creates and decorates seven of the store's windows. Each display can take 
as long as six weeks to assemble and is displayed for three weeks to a month, 
with a fashion change in between.

VALLEY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: CHRISTMAS SALES

<P>
 HOLIDAY SPIRITS: Santa may like milk and cookies, but Mom and Dad prefer a 
bottle of Cabernet. Wine and liquor sales soar during the holidays. Paul Smith, 
owner of Northridge Hills Liquor and Wine Warehouse, expects sales of $100,000 
the week before Christmas -- more than the store typically sells in a month. 
"When they back up the Mercedes," Smith said, "that's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 GHOST OF BASEBALL PAST: Baseball card shops give this year's Scrooge award to 
Major League Baseball owners and players. Card sales were flying this summer. 
But when the players struck in August, "it shut sales down to a crawl," said 
Michael Harris, co-owner of the Baseball Card Co. in Granada Hills. Christmas 
usually boosts card sales by 25%, but since the strike sales have slumped 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCKING STUFFERS: Put off your shopping until the last minute? Ogner 
Motorcars in Woodland Hills will deliver a ribbon-wrapped Ferrari 456 on 
Christmas morning for $207,000. Ogner typically sells two or three Ferraris a 
month, but sold five last month as the holidays approached. General manager 
Robert Reilly (above) said he can be paged any time, even on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 SALES POWER: Amid karate shrieks of " hiya! " the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 
have seized the toy sales crown. The hyperkinetic Rangers are the super-hero 
stars of a children's TV show produced by Saban Entertainment of Burbank. 
Saban, which licenses Rangers merchandising, won't disclose its royalties, but 
said at least 1,000 Rangers products, and more than $1 billion in merchandise, 
have been produced this year. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT TOYS R US: Christmas is the busiest time of year for most retailers, but 
not Salvation Army thrift stores. November and December are lean, said Maj. Don 
Mowery of the Salvation Army's Los Angeles office. "There's still an aversion 
to giving something used as a gift." Their Canoga Park thrift store expects to 
sell about $50,000 worth of donated items this month, compared to $70,000 in 
October. Greg Miller

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazilian troops will patrol the beaches here throughout the summer as part of 
a larger campaign to crack down on crime, Globo newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-crime operation, ordered by President Itamar Franco on Oct. 31, is 
mainly directed against drug trafficking in the city's shantytowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past month, troops have occupied a number of slums for up to several 
days, confiscating both drugs and arms and reportedly reducing drug dealing in 
those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 soldiers withdrew Saturday from two shantytowns in Copacabana and 
Ipanema that they had occupied for 72 hours after confiscating the largest 
number of arms since the crackdown began, newspapers said.

 Zookeepers helped hatch the first saddled-billed stork born in captivity.The 
chick, which was born Thursday, weighed about 3.5 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been impossible to breed saddle-billed storks in zoos because the 
clipped wings that kept them in open aviaries also prevented successful mating, 
officials said. Nets put on the aviaries now keep the birds in and allow 
breeding.

LAPD LINGO; SLANG: LOS ANGELES POLICE SPEAK A UNIQUE, SALTY DIALECT. IF IT 
SOUNDS LIKE A TV COP SHOW -- WELL, TV IS ALWAYS COPYING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The computer message between cops on the streets of Los Angeles was short and 
to the point: One officer said he planned to "kick" a suspect when he got back 
to the station. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't suggesting violence, though -- just communicating in the esoteric 
language of the Los Angeles Police Department. Indeed, the "kicking" was a good 
thing for the suspect -- it meant he would be "kicked loose," released from 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 And how do some cops describe the condition of a traffic victim who is near 
death? 
</P>
<P>
 "Circling the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the LAPD's "copspeak," a language unique even by law 
enforcement standards, a hybrid of street slang, military terms and mordant 
usages passed on through generations -- and easy for outsiders to 
misunderstand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out here and took a test, they asked me what a '211' was, or a 
'459,' " said Lt. Nick Zingo, who came to the department from Detroit in 1975, 
where police did not use penal code sections as shorthand for crimes. "I really 
thought they were joking. These guys sound just like Jack Webb or Adam-12." 
</P>
<P>
 Zingo failed the test the first time, but quickly learned the LAPD wasn't 
kidding. If he wanted to work there, he was going to have to learn to talk the 
way cops talk on TV -- because TV writers get that stuff from studying the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly 20 years later, Zingo can explain why you will get a room at the 
Gray Bar Motel for a G-ride. And thank your lucky stars that you didn't have a 
gimme and they didn't break out the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 A "gimme" is a pistol -- because they're often seen in the hands of somebody 
saying "gimme your money." And "the tube" is a police shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kalk, a former police officer and founder of the LAPD Historical 
Society, says many terms and phrases have been coined since he began his career 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Center in Downtown Los Angeles was dubbed "the Glass House" by those 
who wound up there under arrest, and the nickname found its way into copspeak. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "Gray Bar Motel" was the name for the old Lincoln Heights station 
house, Kalk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worked at that station, but I did check in a couple of guests at the 
motel," Kalk laughed. These days, the Gray Bar Motel is a synonym for "the 
bucket," which means jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms used to describe police equipment and services differ from agency to 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Francisco Police Department, for instance, a shotgun is called "the 
gauge," explained Officer Phil Lee, who is assigned to that city's Mission 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Lee arrests someone, they don't check into the Gray Bar but make a 
little visit to the "company," he said. In San Francisco, traffic tickets are 
referred to as "tags." In Los Angeles, they are known as "greenies," after the 
color of the copy of the citation that the officer keeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the department, various divisions have different names for the same 
crimes. Other phrases, confined to a single division, describe wardrobe or 
conflicts with the boss, or have double meanings for officers who work special 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Andy Voge, an eight-year officer assigned to the Van Nuys station, said 
that when he worked at the 77th Street Division, a stolen car was most often 
called a "G-ride," but in the Valley, the common expression is a "hot roller." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know the codes and you have to know those words and phrases 
because they are part of our language," Voge said. There are drawbacks, he 
noted. "You sometimes have trouble (communicating) when you have to deal with 
other agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD's Metro Division is considered an elite detail, a fact not lost on those 
from other divisions. Fittingly, there is a clothing ensemble named after the 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Metro Tux" is an outfit worn by Metro officers who visit the bar at the 
training academy on Wednesday night -- payday for cops. It is simple garb, 
consisting of a white T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up or tightened to 
accentuate the biceps, dark blue uniform pants and black patent leather shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what they wear when they're on the make," looking for female cadets, 
officers or guests, said one female officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Paul Lewallen, who heads the unit, says the "tux" is popular only 
because officers in uniform cannot drink, but removing the uniform shirt clears 
the way for them to hoist a glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only way the guys can have a beer after work, but others say it's 
because they are too cheap to buy a real tuxedo," Lewallen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another Metro Division expression is the notion of being "in the biz bag," 
which somehow translates into an officer in the doghouse with management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been there a couple of times," said one officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the LAPD's Mounted Unit, which is under the administrative control 
of the Metro Division, transfer words they use to describe their mounts to mean 
different things for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a horse is excited, we say he is 'on the muscle,' " explained Lt. Earl 
Paysinger. "We use the same term to describe a suspect who seems hyperactive." 
</P>
<P>

DISTURBED MAN SLAIN BY OFFICERS; SHOOTING: MENTAL PATIENT IS SHOT TO DEATH IN 
MONTROSE AFTER THREATENING DEPUTIES AND PASSERSBY WITH A BROKEN CRUTCH, 
AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies shot and killed a mentally troubled Montrose man early 
Sunday after he lunged at them with a broken metal crutch he had been using to 
threaten drivers and pedestrians, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics pronounced Aaron Cease, 30, dead shortly after midnight. He was 
shot several times after he threatened deputies who repeatedly ordered him to 
drop the crutch, said Deputy Britta Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's mother said her son had been seeing a psychiatrist every month 
for the past 12 years for "major depression," and was using the single crutch 
for a weak ankle he had broken earlier this year. "He has never been 
threatening on the street like that before," said Doreen Cease. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies had responded to a call of a man standing in Montrose Avenue and 
threatening motorists and pedestrians with the sharp, jagged end of the broken 
crutch, Tubbs said. Deputies told Cease to drop the crutch, but he refused and 
threatened to kill them, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was yelling that the deputies would have to kill him or he would kill 
them," said Deputy Matthew Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the two deputies, whose names were not released Sunday, tried 
to calm Cease for several minutes. But Cease kept swinging the crutch at the 
deputies, following them closely as they tried to back away, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 After shadowing the officers for about 120 feet, Cease lunged at them with the 
crutch, Tubbs said. The officers fired at Cease. It was unclear Sunday how many 
shots were fired or how many struck Cease. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting outraged Cease's mother, who questioned why the deputies did not 
use less than deadly force to subdue her son. "Why didn't they use Mace or a 
stun gun?" she asked. "We just don't understand why they had to use such 
measures." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodriguez said the deputies shot Cease only when they feared he would hurt 
them. "The deputies didn't shoot him when he was 20 feet away or only 10 feet 
away. They shot him when they thought they were going to be stabbed," Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cease saw her son for the last time Saturday when she took his dinner to his 
apartment, about a half-mile from her La Crescenta home. He had lived alone for 
five years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she intends to look into law enforcement's handling of people with 
mental illnesses. "I've heard a lot of stories about the police shooting mental 
patients, but I never thought it would happen to my son," Cease said.

STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON: SOUTHLAND'S BRIDGES SPAN A CENTURY OF REGION'S 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brooklyn and San Francisco may have their world-renowned bridges, but Los 
Angeles, its concrete river channels notwithstanding, also has its 
masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 They are barely noticed by harried commuters -- the tendency is to look out 
over bridges instead of at them -- and they're sometimes desecrated by taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, the Colorado Street Bridge -- Suicide Bridge, as it is 
still widely known -- with its nine arches that span elegantly across the 
Arroyo Seco. And the Los Angeles River bridges east of Downtown, ranging from 
the Spanish-style Macy Street Viaduct to the Washington Boulevard Bridge, 
graced with panels depicting stages in the design and construction of a bridge. 
And the Shakespeare Bridge in the Los Feliz area, distinguished by its 
decorative, steeple-like Gothic turrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles River bridges were designed, according to a 1923 city 
engineer's report, to "excite comment from visitors who enter and leave the 
city by railways" and "to raise the status of Los Angeles as an enterprising, 
properly developed city." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the bridges have been designated historic cultural monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 "So ingrained is our modern perception of the bridge as a strictly functional 
structure that the Los Angeles River bridges themselves seem strange," Stephen 
D. Mikesell wrote in the Historical Society of Southern California journal. 
"They are like artifacts of a distant culture." 
</P>
<P>
 "The river is nothing," said architectural historian Robert Winter. "But the 
bridges are sensational." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark Robins, a city structural engineer who oversees the condition of nearly 
800 Los Angeles city bridges, singled out as a favorite the 7th Street Bridge, 
or should we say bridges. The first bridge was built in 1908 to extend over the 
river. When railroad tracks were placed alongside the river, a second bridge 
was built in 1927 -- about 30 feet above the original one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of a kind as far as I know," Robins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins thinks the city's old bridges are "real achievements that have been 
forgotten." He said the city is trying to restore the old bridges while making 
them earthquake safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest Los Angeles River bridge is the North Broadway, built in 1910; most 
of the bridges were constructed in the 1920s and '30s to accommodate the 
growing population to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 The fancy bridge work eventually was overshadowed by another project -- the 
freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's bridge designers were assigned to the early planning of the 
Pasadena and Hollywood freeways. As a result, a sharp eye can detect their work 
on bridges along the routes -- Avenue 26, Avenue 43 and Avenue 60 on the 
Pasadena Freeway; Mulholland, Barham and Pilgrimage along the Hollywood -- 
according to historian Mikesell. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more modern freeway bridges can be spectacular, too, Winter said. 
The four-level interchange in Downtown, built in 1954, has been designated a 
"civil engineering landmark" by the local chapter of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the historic bridges: 
</P>
<P>
 * Colorado Street Bridge -- Dedicated in 1913 as the highest concrete span in 
the world, the 160-foot-high and 1,468-foot-long bridge became known as 
"Suicide Bridge" after a series of fatal leaps from it in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 * Glendale-Hyperion Viaduct -- Built in 1927, the span over the Los Angeles 
River and Golden State Freeway in the Los Feliz area features graceful arches 
and octagonal pylons. It was built as a memorial to World War I veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Macy Street Viaduct -- The 1926 bridge on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue was built 
in Spanish Colonial style with Ionic and Doric columns and street lights 
inscribed with the city seal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4th and Lorena Street Bridge -- Built in 1928, it is one of the few 
remaining catenary, or curved, arch bridges in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fletcher Drive Bridge -- Completed in 1928, this bridge is a reinforced 
concrete structure in Classical style. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge -- Extending above the Pasadena 
Freeway, this bridge, circa 1895, is the highest such structure in Los Angeles 
County and probably the oldest one in use, according to the Los Angeles 
Cultural Affairs Department, which declared it a city landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 * Franklin Avenue Bridge, also known as the Shakespeare Bridge -- Built in 
1925, the 262-foot-long bridge spans a ravine between St. George Street and 
Myra Avenue. Legend has it that it was built by Cecil B. DeMille or Walt 
Disney, both nearby residents, for some cinematic purpose. Actually, it was the 
work of a city engineer, J. C. Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunset Boulevard Bridge -- Constructed in 1934 across Silver Lake Boulevard, 
this city landmark features Romanesque arches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vincent Thomas Bridge -- Dedicated in 1963, Southern California's longest 
suspension bridge -- with twin green towers thrusting into the sky over Los 
Angeles Harbor -- extends 6,060-feet from San Pedro to Terminal Island.

GEORGE RAMOS: DISNEY BOYCOTT: WRONG TARGET, WRONG REASONS

 When the Dodgers got rid of pitching sensation and local folk hero Fernando 
Valenzuela back in 1991, some Chicano activists screamed bloody murder. They 
said the action was the final straw in a long line of anti-Mexican behavior, 
stretching back to the days when the city forcibly removed Mexican American 
residents from Chavez Ravine to make way for Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 With the release of No. 34, the Chicano hotheads called for a boycott of the 
Dodgers. But as much as I hate the Dodgers, I knew the boycott was a bad idea. 
Fernando no longer had the dazzling stuff that had made him a Cy Young Award 
winner, and the Dodgers wanted only the best on their pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott went nowhere that season as 3,348,170 fans went to see the 
Dodgers, who won 93 games and finished second in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 I was reminded of that Dodgers boycott because another bad idea has surfaced. 
Some Latino activists, upset that some companies gave money to Gov. Pete Wilson 
and other politicians who supported Proposition 187, have called for a boycott 
of those firms. At the top of the list is the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 I say it's a bad idea because it's based on misplaced emotion, not on the type 
of facts that fueled the justifiable moral outrage behind successful boycotts. 
It also diverts energy away from the real battle: Getting Proposition 187 
declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for many Latinos to hate Disney and the Magic Kingdom, located in 
conservative Orange County, where the leaders of the pro-187 effort live. It 
can do some stupid things. Remember when it prohibited persons of the same sex 
from dancing together at Disneyland? Or when it forbade employees from wearing 
facial hair? 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't liked Disney since the 1950s' TV serialization of the exploits of 
Davy Crockett. I can remember the day when my father smacked me for rooting for 
Crockett to "kill all the Mexicans" at the climactic battle for the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the last time this 8-year-old kid from East L.A. wore his Davy 
Crockett T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a group of Latino activists showed up at the Magic Kingdom's entrance 
to call for a boycott because the parent company gave money to the governor and 
other pro-187 candidates, I concluded that these Latinos have picked an 
unwinnable fight with a conglomerate for the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists argue that Disney needs to be sympathetic and sensitive to the 
paying public, including Latinos, that flocks to its amusement parks, buys its 
toys and goes to see its movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reasoning, however, uses a broad brush to paint Disney as pro-187 
because it gave money to Wilson. That's guilt by association and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, in fact, did not take a position on the controversial proposition. If 
it had done so, it would have deserved whatever happened to it as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials acknowledge that they contributed to Wilson's campaign, but 
they also gave money to his opponent, Democrat Kathleen Brown, who opposed 187. 
They saw their financial support as part of doing business in California, whose 
tourist industry they have a stake in encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Boycotting a company because it gave money to a particular candidate, or in 
this case both major candidates, in a gubernatorial campaign is not going to 
persuade consumers to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 What the proposed Disney action lacks, more than anything else, is the moral 
outrage that has marked the successful boycotts of grapes and Coors beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Migrant farm workers led by Cesar Chavez worked for ridiculously low pay, 
lived in substandard housing and enjoyed none of the benefits extended to 
others working in the United States. The grape boycott changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boycott against Coors, the brewery was blindsided by the outrage 
Latinos expressed over discriminatory practices at its Golden, Colo., brewery. 
Over the years, Coors has tried to make peace with various Latino groups, 
offering scholarships and hiring community people for grass-roots efforts to 
undo the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But to this day, many Latinos still don't drink Coors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Proposition 187, some friends of mine have made decisions to stay 
away from certain businesses. Henry Mendoza, for example, decided to stop going 
to his hair stylist because of her desire to have the measure, which she voted 
for, enforced against anyone who may look foreign, regardless of the person's 
citizenship. Another friend, Anthony Ramirez, has done the same thing with his 
butcher. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, those are reasonable choices. But as with the fizzled Dodgers boycott, 
the proposed action against Disney doesn't make much sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though I still hate the guy with the coonskin cap.

 Here is a sampling of Los Angeles' best-dressed neighborhoods and spectacular 
light displays: 1. AGOURA HILLS 
</P>
<P>
 * 5831 Grey Rock Road 
</P>
<P>
 The Kaplans' theatrical 15th Christmas wonderland explodes with 225,000 
lights, three video screens showing how the spectacular display was erected, a 
300-watt stereo system, a laser show, animation and more. The Tudor mansion is 
a collection center for the Marine Corps Toys for Tots campaign. Spectators 
donating a $5-$20 unwrapped toy will receive a limited-edition Christmas card 
enclosing a debit phone card for three free minutes of long-distance calling. 
2. WOODLAND HILLS  
</P>
<P>
 * Oakdale Avenue 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Cane Lane, a four-block neighborhood of ranch-style homes, is tucked 
away like a magical world, lighting up the community as it has for almost half 
a century. Its dazzling salutes using Yuletide ornaments can be found within 
the boundaries of Oxnard Street, Corbin and Winnetka avenues, and the Ventura 
Freeway. 3. BURBANK 
</P>
<P>
 * 513 N. Florence St. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year for almost a quarter-century, Dick Norton -- a frequent winner in 
Burbank's annual Holiday Outdoor Decorating Contest -- takes three weeks to 
assemble his Christmas array of snowmen, trains, Ferris wheel with dolls, teddy 
bears on flying swings, and merry-go-round. But his neighbors haven't given up 
trying to outdo him. For a list of addresses of this year's other contestants, 
contact Burbank's public information office at (818) 953-8727. Some homes that 
will be judged are at 2001 Richard St., 529 N. Florence St., 730 Clybourn Ave., 
1415 Morningside Dr., 1625 N. Brighton St. and 1421 N. Naomi St. 4. EAGLE ROCK 
</P>
<P>
 * 4364 York Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 For 35 years, the Meltons, now in their 70s, have kept the holiday magic alive 
in their front yard with thousands of lights, Santa riding an old-fashioned 
bike with a big front wheel, a 10-foot angel and a Nativity scene. Several 
viewers have offered to pay the electric bill so the Meltons won't have to turn 
the lights off at 10 p.m., but the Meltons declined, so it's lights out at 10. 
5. LA CANADA-FLINTRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 * 4951 Indianola Way  
</P>
<P>
 Every Christmas for the past four years, 13-year-old Robert Illian has plugged 
in thousands of lights, a 15-foot Ferris wheel, a gondola that transports 
stuffed animals to the roof and back, a merry-go-round and a sleigh that 
teeters on the edge of the roof. Meanwhile, his parents stand by, watching 
their electric meter spin. Robert constructed everything himself, including the 
fake-snow couple, the cutout ice skaters, the gondola and the seesaw. 6. 
ALTADENA 
</P>
<P>
 * 1960 Mendocino Lane 
</P>
<P>
 Like a community castle, the Mediterranean-style 1922 mansion owned by ice 
cream magnate George Balian sits majestically aglow with thousands of lights at 
the fork of Mendocino Lane and Glenview Terrace during the holidays. The lights 
will be turned on Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * Christmas Tree Lane 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of visitors' cars -- with their headlights off -- drive through what 
looks like an electrically enchanted forest of 110-year-old cedars, towering 
100 feet high along a one-mile stretch of Santa Rosa Avenue between Woodbury 
Road and Altadena Drive. 7. PASADENA 
</P>
<P>
 * Upper Hastings Ranch 
</P>
<P>
 For 38 years, residents have put together showy Christmas displays to adorn 
their houses and yards, competing for prizes awarded by the neighborhood 
association. More than 1,100 homes in a 44-block area north of Sierra Madre 
Boulevard and west of Michillinda Avenue take part. 8. CERRITOS 
</P>
<P>
 * Castle Place and Kings Row Avenue 
</P>
<P>
 The Patterson and Kamppila homes are among the 30 households on this 
cul-de-sac caught up in a decorating frenzy. Between them, the two houses have 
a life-size Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle in a rooftop sleigh, Nativity scenes, 
lights, reindeer and angels. Even the trees that line the street are wrapped 
with aluminum foil and spirals of plastic ribbon. 9. NAPLES 
</P>
<P>
 * Bay Shore Walk  
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, waterfront homes are elaborately decorated on one side and 
Christmas trees formed by strands of lights shimmer from water-borne platforms 
on the other side. 10. LONG BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 * Daisy Avenue 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas Tree Lane," a four-block stretch between 20th Street and Pacific 
Coast Highway in the Wrigley district, boasts artistic scenes, including 
hand-painted wooden cut-outs of skaters on a plywood pond. The displays, 
primarily scaled-down Christmas cottages, have been erected between stately 
cedar trees wreathed in Christmas lights. Caroling and dance performances take 
place on an outdoor stage between 7 and 9 p.m., Fridays through Sundays. 11. 
TORRANCE 
</P>
<P>
 * Doris Way, Robert and Reese roads, Carol and Linda drives and Sharynne Lane 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 homes in the Seaside Ranchos neighborhood sport unusually large 
displays of lights and decorations. This Sleepy Hollow area comes alive as 
neighbor vies with neighbor to display the most elaborate decorations. Flocks 
of children and carolers traditionally stop by the houses in the area bounded 
by Pacific Coast Highway, Calle Mayor, Anza Avenue and Sepulveda and Palos 
Verdes boulevards. PCH is closed from 6 to 10 p.m. nightly through Christmas to 
accommodate spectators. Enter Linda Drive by car from Palos Verdes Boulevard or 
enter Calle Mayor from Carlow and Vanderhill roads. 12. HAWTHORNE 
</P>
<P>
 * 4117 W. 138th St. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and Dottie Williams are the talk of the town with the nine-foot Ferris 
wheel on their front lawn. A three-foot Santa turns the light-covered wheel, 
whose passengers are stuffed animals. Also positioned in the yard is a six-foot 
Santa and his workshop, a model train, lighted sleighs and reindeer and 11,000 
lights. A 22-foot Christmas tree stands atop a two-story garage. 13. INGLEWOOD 
</P>
<P>
 * 3rd, 4th, 5th and Hardy streets 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty arches of metal and plastic piping, decorated with red and silver 
garlands entwined with lights, span South 5th Avenue between Century Boulevard 
and Arbor Vitae Street. Most residents have sprayed their yards with fake snow 
and put up decorations, including Nativity scenes and life-sized Santas and 
reindeer. 14. HANCOCK PARK 
</P>
<P>
 * 276 Windsor Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 An invitingly chaotic display includes two full-sized sleighs filled with 
oversized gift boxes. Larger-than-life figurines of children, dogs, deer 
rabbits and other creatures decorate the northeast corner of Windsor and 3rd 
Street, as do Christmas trees and a small creche. 
</P>
<P>
 * 301 Rimpau Blvd.  
</P>
<P>
 About seven blocks farther west along 3rd Street, sightseers come upon two 
giant Nativity scenes, Christmas trees, deer, candy canes and figures of Santa, 
carolers and snowmen. 15. BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
<P>
 * 9463 Sunset Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have for 12 years, residents here create a monument as they outline 
the contours of the mansion with single strands of lights. They plant poles in 
their yard and turn them into pyramids of lights to mimic a forest of 
glittering Christmas trees. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES; MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
BRINGING CULTURES TOGETHER, KID-STYLE

 Fifth and sixth graders in Room 34 at Elizabeth Street School's Los Angeles 
Learning Center were asked to think of ways they could help to create tolerance 
in their neighborhood. The students live in the southeast Los Angeles community 
of Cudahy, where more than 90% of the residents are Latino.But it's also a 
community of longtime residents mixed with newcomers who are grappling with a 
different culture and surroundings. Teacher Deborah Kagan explains that her 
students wanted the list published "so that Angelenos can reach out and get to 
know, and not fear, new immigrants in their neighborhood." Here are their 
suggestions: * 
</P>
<P>
 Ask people questions about themselves and their culture. * 
</P>
<P>
 Have a pet show. * 
</P>
<P>
 Share things people don't have, like clothes, toys and shoes. * 
</P>
<P>
 Help people learn language, money, how to get around, where to go and live. * 
</P>
<P>
 Teach people games, how to read, speak and write English, how to drive. * 
</P>
<P>
 Invite them to party or picnic. * 
</P>
<P>
 Introduce people to your friends, and show them around. * 
</P>
<P>
 Babysit people's children. * 
</P>
<P>
 Share taking care of community / environment. * 
</P>
<P>
 Share food and exchange recipes. * 
</P>
<P>
 Teach people different ways of dancing. * 
</P>
<P>
 Care for and take care of each other.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: IDEALISM MAY YET WIN THE FIGHT FOR HEARTS OF STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a bit of holiday cheer for those San Fernando Valley residents who 
sometimes feel as if their home turf has been taken over by gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one pocket of Pacoima the good guys are fighting, on the education 
front, what looks to be a winning campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Rommel Hilario, field deputy to Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alarcon, who suggested checking up on what's going on at Maclay Middle School, 
where Principal Cecilia Costas and her staff are fighting for the futures of 
the 12- to 15-year-old students enrolled there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can't keep all the students from dropping out of school or getting 
into trouble, but we see each as an individual and do our best for everyone," 
Costas says. 
</P>
<P>
 This thought resonates throughout the school as teachers and administrators 
tell about their day-in-and-day-out battle to keep the kids focused on school 
and a positive future. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an easy job. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-grade science teacher Mario Santa Cruz returned to the classroom this 
year after a 15-year-hiatus. He says he was totally unprepared for the changes 
he found there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids paid no attention to me and were running around during class, hitting 
each other," according to Santa Cruz, who grew up on the mean streets of 
South-Central Los Angeles and spent four years in the Navy before following up 
on his dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was idealistic. I thought I could make a difference to the kids who were 
under so much peer pressure to join gangs," Santa Cruz says, adding that the 
chaos of the classroom really was a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 He had given up a high-paying job in engineering to teach at Maclay and could 
have decided, after those first grueling days, to dump the dream and go back to 
the safety and comfort of the business world.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, like others at Maclay, he decided to take a stand and fight. He says 
the bottom line is a principal who doesn't understand the concept of surrender. 
"She will do whatever it takes to turn this school around," Santa Cruz says of 
Costas. 
</P>
<P>
 His thoughts are echoed by the dean of attendance, Harry Talbot, who is a 
soft-spoken lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserves at Edwards Air Force 
Base. Talbot, a 6-foot, 2-inch, 230-pounder has never seen a confrontation he 
felt inclined to back away from. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot and Santa Cruz, both brought onto the staff by Costas in January, were 
valuable to the principal, she says, because their military training gave them 
an air of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 She says both Talbot and Santa Cruz are teachers who understand the value of 
instilling self-discipline and healthy attitudes in students. In addition to 
their classroom and administrative duties, the pair work with the school's 
fledgling Cadet Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps, currently 1,200 members strong, is a sort of junior ROTC. It is 
another tool to keep students in school and out of trouble, Costas said.  
</P>
<P>
 Talbot uses his good offices at Edwards to help get the Cadet Corps uniforms 
and other materials. He also arranges a number of field trips for the cadets, 
such as the recent one to see the Edwards Air Force Base air show, which Talbot 
and Santa Cruz helped to chaperon on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Santa Cruz, being willing to give a lot of volunteer time is a 
personal covenant many teachers make at Maclay to help in the effort to turn 
the school back into an institution where life-enhancing learning takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbot says many of the students who opt to join the Cadet Corps are under 
tremendous harassment by gang members who see their peer pressure being eroded 
by this other entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of guts for the cadets to put on the uniform once a week and 
wear it to school," says Talbot. But the percentage of students willing to make 
the effort is growing every semester among both boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many programs at the school under way in the effort to wrest control 
from gangs, and they seem to be working. According to Talbot, attendance seems 
to be improving, and first-period tardiness has been cut from an average of 200 
per day to about 30.  
</P>
<P>
 While both Talbot and Santa Cruz say that much of the innovation at the school 
and improvement in the classrooms is a direct result of the Costas leadership, 
the principal insists it is a group effort. "People in our program are willing 
to give more than 100%," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas came to Maclay from Van Nuys Middle School and says she brought with 
her a determination to do whatever it takes to keep the students out of the 
clutches of gangs and other negative influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I found is that meant I had to have a willing staff and a personal 
commitment to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, if need be. That 
was OK with me," Costas says. 
</P>
<P>
 When she is not doing administrative or motivational work with her staff and 
students, she is out in the community getting parents and merchants involved 
with what is happening at Maclay.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think people want to know that good things are happening at this school and 
we want them to be a part of it," Costas says. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not above putting the arm on the newly enlightened. "We have needs for 
supplies and money for special programs, and once the community is aware of 
those needs, people are willing to help us meet our goals," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas says the positive results, which have to be earned one kid and one 
situation at a time, are helped by involving parents in what is going on.  
</P>
<P>
 One chief benefit she has in that effort is the multilingual abilities of many 
of her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 It is something she has come to take for granted, she says. Then she laughs 
and gives an example of how true that reliance has been. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a group of adults coming to school from other areas for a meeting. I 
asked one of our mothers to take over at the reception desk, and she agreed," 
says Costas, adding that there was initially some confusion when the guests, 
who didn't speak any Spanish, tried to make themselves understood to the 
parent, who spoke only Spanish. Eventually, everything was sorted out. 
</P>
<P>
 Costas says she knows her battle for the hearts and minds of her students will 
be an ongoing one, but she says she's in it for the long haul, and her staff 
seems to concur. Returning From the Wilderness 
</P>
<P>
 For a New, Urban Challenge 
</P>
<P>
 During a long career with the National Park Service, Scott Erickson has done 
time in some of the country's garden spots, like Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings 
Canyon national parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the University of Maryland graduate, who was born in Northern California, 
has agreed to become the deputy superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area, headquartered in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would anyone leave the scenic wilderness for a few thousand acres of brush 
in the middle of a metropolis? 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenges are for me, as a conservationist, to help preserve the area 
where people in the city can enjoy getting out in nature. I'm interested in 
strengthening the partnerships the service has with other conservation 
organizations, and in setting up ways to teach restorative ecology here," says 
Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome aboard. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "It really ticks me off when my wife makes fun of me when I put on my Santa 
suit at Christmas. I say it gets tighter every year because of the rotten 
cleaners. She says it has something to do with my daily intake of Coors Light."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES; COMMENTARIES ON 
EDUCATION; THE PARENT GAP; IS LOCAL ACTIVISM 'PRIVATIZING' SOME PUBLIC 
CLASSROOMS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California constitution guarantees a public education to any school-age 
pupilliving in the state and public funds are paid out on a per-pupil basis. 
But there the equality ends.In two public schools in Los Angeles 
County-Paradise Canyon Elementary School in affluent La Canada and Normandie 
Avenue Elementary School in an urban, low-income Los Angeles neighborhood-the 
focus for each principal is very different. 
</P>
<P>
 Both receive state funds based on each student's average daily attendance. But 
Charles Proctor, principal at Normandie for the past five years, relies on 
various government programs to supplement his budget while Sydney Pringle, 
principal at Paradise Canyon for the past three years, enjoys a very active PTA 
and another parent group that fund a wide range of curriculum-enhancing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both principals told interviewer ROBIN GREENE that the key to any school's 
success is a dedicated teaching staff. But the presence of parents who can 
donate considerable time and money to an individual school is , according to 
some analysts, creating a widening gulf that allows wealthier districts to 
ignore the overall needs of public education.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHERE THERE ARE LOSERS, THERE ARE WINNERS 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County's doomed investment fund will probably end up being liquidated 
in its entirety over the next few weeks, ending one chapter in what will 
undoubtedly be a long saga. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the fund's final losses should be in the neighborhood of $2 billion 
-- a mere drop in the bucket in the many-trillion-dollar global financial 
system -- this crisis has, of course, already reverberated far beyond the 
borders of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But where there are big losers in an investment debacle, by definition there 
should also be big winners. Tough as it may be for Orange Countians to swallow, 
their pain has indeed been others' gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a tally of some of the major winners and losers so far in O.C.'s 
Fundgate: 
</P>
<P>
 * Winner: Investors who took a contrarian stance on interest rates in 1994. 
Former Orange County Treasurer Bob Citron ruined his once-$20-billion fund by 
continuing to load it up with long-term bonds this year, betting that market 
interest rates would fall again. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, rates have rocketed far higher than almost anyone on Wall Street 
anticipated a year ago, as the economy has boomed. So the smart investors were 
those who began to build up their cash reserves early in the year, and 
continued to do so all along -- despite the chorus of "experts" predicting 
lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the O.C. fund is liquidated, the investors buying the fund's 
discounted bonds are locking in 8%-plus annualized yields, in some cases double 
the yield Citron was earning on the securities. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where the fund's $2-billion loss went: It's essentially a wealth 
transfer to investors who were savvy enough to wait for better returns on 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loser: Municipal investment funds everywhere. Most local treasurers won't 
necessarily lose money on their current investments, but they'll all be hurt in 
the long run if state or local lawmakers force such funds to limit their 
portfolios to plain-vanilla, no-risk securities. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Citron's strategy of borrowing massively short-term to buy 
long-term bonds and brain-scrambling "derivatives" was absurd. But what has 
been forgotten is that Citron's excesses were late in the game; from 1990 
through 1993, his bet on falling interest rates was correct, highly profitable 
and seemingly well-managed. 
</P>
<P>
 Point is, there's no excuse for taking public money to Las Vegas. But if 
lawmakers now force municipal investment funds to bail out of anything that 
isn't risk-free, the funds' returns will be condemned to the cellar -- and 
needlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember what happened when many public pension funds dumped their high-yield 
"junk" bonds in 1990? They sold at the market bottom, missing out on the 
three-year rally that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loser: The mutual fund industry. The fund industry should have been a 
beneficiary of Orange County's mess. After all, many owners of individual 
municipal bonds issued by the county's entities are probably now wishing they 
had invested in a diversified muni fund instead. 
</P>
<P>
 But because many muni funds themselves owned Orange County-issued bonds -- 
even though in very small quantities, for the most part -- fund investors have 
been spooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer-term bond mutual funds, which have been suffering shareholder 
redemptions all year, saw another $1 billion flow out (industrywide) in the 
week ended Wednesday, according to figures compiled by AMG Data Services in 
Arcata, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 And short-term California muni money market funds alone lost nearly 7% of 
their assets last week, AMG says -- even though most fund parent companies 
assured money-fund shareholders that they wouldn't lose a penny, because the 
parents will spend their own cash to buy out questionable Orange County-issued 
debt held by the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes the funds two-time losers in this debacle: More shareholders are 
cashing out, and the parent companies are stuck picking up the tab for any 
defaults on Orange County bonds they own. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that three-time losers -- because fund companies risk long-range trouble 
by continuing to send shareholders the message that they will be protected from 
credit-related losses.  
</P>
<P>
 * Winner: Salomon Bros. By most accounts, the Wall Street brokerage has done a 
slick job so far in launching the county fund's liquidation, which Salomon was 
picked to handle in part because most other major brokerages had been lenders 
to the over-leveraged fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many Wall Streeters scoffed last week when Salomon said it believed 
it could get 73 cents on the dollar for the doomed fund's bond holdings, the 
sale of $1.49 billion in securities on Thursday and Friday garnered prices that 
were surprisingly high. 
</P>
<P>
 A Salomon executive said Friday that the entire batch of securities sold 
Thursday and Friday brought prices "consistent with or slightly ahead of" the 
firm's recovery estimate made last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salomon was very organized," one Wall Street bond trader remarked on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the firm's biggest challenge lies ahead -- unloading the derivative 
bonds that make up the bulk of the county's portfolio -- Salomon has already 
cemented its image as a "white knight" in this crisis, which can't but help its 
business worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loser: Merrill Lynch & Co. The nation's biggest brokerage (by most measures) 
is trying hard to spin-control its way out of this mess, but it's not 
succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Merrill abet Bob Citron's borrowing to buy longer-term bonds, it 
also sold him many of those bonds. Rumors flew last week that Merrill had 
offered to buy the entire portfolio back from the fund -- at a market price, of 
course -- if the county would agree not to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill has declined to comment officially on any purchase offer it may have 
made, but the possibility of Salomon's selling the whole enchilada to Merrill 
seemed ridiculous from the start: Why would Salomon let Merrill walk away a 
seeming hero when Merrill surely would only buy the portfolio if it could make 
money selling the pieces for more than it paid? 
</P>
<P>
 * Winner and loser: The U.S. government agencies that issued most of the bonds 
owned by the fund. By allowing Wall Street to fashion their securities into 
high-risk derivative bonds -- high risk to the un-hedged buyer, that is -- 
agencies such as the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Student Loan 
Marketing Assn. saved 0.10 to 0.15 percentage points in interest versus what 
they'd pay to issue less complicated debt. 
</P>
<P>
 For agencies that need to raise tens of billions of dollars each year to 
fulfill their congressionally mandated duties, such as funding federal student 
loans, that apparent small savings in interest costs means a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 While the agencies can argue they were only doing their jobs -- trying to 
secure the lowest-cost funding available -- they are being made into villains 
by critics who believe that investment pros like Citron were somehow snookered 
into buying agency derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some critics erroneously believe that Citron's loss on a specific 
type of derivative -- agency bonds that are designed to pay less in interest as 
market rates go up -- is the agencies' direct gain. In fact, the derivatives 
are structured so that the agencies' funding costs are fixed; they didn't take 
the other side of Citron's bet. Instead, that risk was "swapped" to other 
investors, mainly major banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the agencies are working with Salomon on transactions that could 
result in an agency-sponsored "unwinding" of the county fund's derivatives. 
Such transactions wouldn't bail out the fund, but they could save it a small 
amount of money versus selling the bonds on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk to the agencies is that other investors with similar derivative 
problems could form a long line in back of Orange County, demanding that they, 
too, be unwound from bond bets they may now claim they didn't understand.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; SUCCESS IS CHILD'S PLAY IN THE PINATA BUSINESS; 
MANUFACTURING: SANTA ANA COMPANY FINDS A NICHE WITH THE PRODUCT PEOPLE LOVE TO 
HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an increasingly high-tech world, Oscar Vargas is succeeding with a 
decidedly low-tech product: He makes pinatas. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, owner of Pinata Party in Santa Ana, has an electronics degree and 
worked for years in the computer industry, but he had always wanted to run his 
own business. He got the inspiration for Pinata Party from his sister, who made 
pinatas as a hobby and always had a backlog of orders from friends and 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "High tech is so expensive to get into, and the products change so fast, 
almost every year," said Vargas, 41. "I saw what my sister was doing and 
realized right away that there was a wide-open area where somebody could do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 When Vargas opened his shop in 1985 in City of Industry, most of his business 
was generated by summer birthday parties. But now, he says, holiday sales of 
Santa Claus likenesses, oversized Hershey's Kisses -- sold under license from 
the Pennsylvania-based chocolate manufacturer -- and other year-end specialties 
are bringing in revenue from the Latino community and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar has the Cadillac of the business," says David Nadel, owner of the Party 
City store in Santa Ana. "They're very special pieces, a unique product to be 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, pinatas are finding a market for use as home decorations, not 
just as targets for stick-wielding youngsters eager for the toys and sweets 
inside. And if people do buy them for the customary use, Vargas said, that's 
even better. "I like it when they get broken," he said, "because then you have 
to buy a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the holidays used to be the slowest time for Vargas' business, 
"Christmas has really been a good blessing for us," he said. "We used to have 
to pretty much shut down in the wintertime because, once it got colder and 
rainy, we sold less pinatas. Winter doesn't lend itself to outdoor birthday 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the mainstays of his winter business are pinatas used in Las Posadas, a 
series of processions held between Dec. 16 and Dec. 24. According to Mexican 
tradition, Las Posadas depicts the biblical story of Joseph and Mary's search 
for a room at an inn before the birth of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 In observances of Las Posadas, the pinatas on hand for children at the end of 
the processions resemble satellites -- spheres with six to 12 arms that 
originally represented the months of the year, according to folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vargas started his business, he knew he could not compete on price with 
low-cost papier-mache pinatas imported from Mexico. He searched for a way to 
replicate the more expensive pinatas made of hardened clay, eventually hitting 
on a solution that blended traditional pinata designs with modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with some secrets from an aunt in Panama who had been making pinatas for 
40 years, Vargas began looking for a molding company that could mass-produce 
pinatas from polystyrene, a low-cost material that shatters just like clay. 
</P>
<P>
 He searched more than a year before he found a manufacturer with the right 
production equipment. "I'd tell them I wanted a hollow sphere that could break 
pretty easily," Vargas said. "They thought I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas first set up shop in the City of Industry but moved to Santa Ana five 
years ago. During the busy summer months, about a dozen employees apply paint 
and decorations by hand to the thousands of pinatas that Vargas has molded at 
plants in Anaheim and Gardena. During the slower winter months, hours are 
scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Having the pinatas mass-produced offers another benefit besides low cost: They 
are of uniform weight and size, an attractive feature for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a store is selling dinosaur pinatas, they want them the same size," said 
Vargas, whose pinatas retail for between $20 and $30 apiece. "Otherwise, 
customers see all the different sizes on the shelf and say, 'That one's 
smaller, so it should cost less.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas now sells most of his pinatas through party stores but is hoping 
eventually to land a contract to produce them for Disney and other well-known 
entertainment companies. Having a license to manufacture giant Hershey's 
Kisses, Vargas said, is the first step in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadel of Party City said he thinks Vargas has the potential to sell pinatas 
nationwide: "When we showed them to our franchiser's people back East, they 
loved them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vargas said he is leery of expanding too rapidly, preferring a slow and 
steady pace. "We've created a track record," Vargas said. "And little by 
little, we'll grow." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Some facts about the festive containers: 
</P>
<P>
 * The first pinatas, which originated in Italy, were shaped like stars and 
used in Christmas celebrations. They represented the Star of Bethlehem and 
gifts that the Three Kings brought to the baby Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 * After pinatas were introduced into the Western Hemisphere by Columbus, they 
gradually changed in shape and significance. Today, they are colored containers 
typically made from papier-mache or clay in the shapes of animals, flowers or 
stars. They are covered with crepe paper, then filled with candy, fruit or 
toys. 
</P>
<P>
 * In modern celebrations, the pinata is suspended from the ceiling and 
children use a stick to hit it until it breaks, spilling its treasures. Pinatas 
have become traditional in Mexico for birthdays, Christmas and other 
celebrations.

325 DREAMS SHATTERED BY PLANT CLOSING; SHUTDOWN OF GLASS FACTORY DEALS POMONA 
ANOTHER BLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For almost 50 years, the Owens-Brockway glass factory in a gritty section of 
Pomona has kept 325 workers in skilled manufacturing jobs paying between $11 
and $20 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Families were reared on those wages. They put children through college. Bought 
suburban homes and lived the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But that dream dies on Thursday when the workers will hang up their hats for 
the last time and the plant will close. It is the latest of a string of 
economic jolts to Pomona, a city that stands as an exception to the general 
prosperity of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-income, mainly minority city of 150,000 people has already been hit 
hard by the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Hughes Missile Systems Co. left Pomona for Tucson, Ariz., taking with 
it 2,000 aerospace jobs. The year before that, FMC Sweepers, which made 
street-cleaning vehicles, closed its aging Pomona factory and eliminated more 
than 100 skilled manufacturing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a blow in a series of continuing blows," said Todd Hooks, project 
manager with Pomona's Economic Development Department. "We're a poorer 
community that has an older industrial base, and this is shocking and 
disheartening." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the disappearing jobs are being replaced by low-wage spots 
in services and warehouse distribution, say city officials, who have had little 
luck at attracting new businesses to boost the manufacturing base and stimulate 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials predict that ripples from the Pomona plant closure will be felt 
throughout the region. Workers plowed much of the factory's $13-million annual 
payroll back into the local economy. Now, some laid-off employees may be forced 
to sell their homes and see new cars repossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Local trucking firms, restaurants and ancillary businesses that served the 
plant, which was open around the clock, are also bracing for a decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that closes around here is going to hurt us," said Chris Halkidis, 
who manages Tom's No. 18 hamburger stand, where Owens-Brockway employees 
frequently dined. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooks says the city was caught off guard by the plant closure and must do a 
better job communicating with business if it intends to remain economically 
viable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooks says he worries that the glass plant closure will only reinforce 
Pomona's "negative image" as a decaying, crime-infested suburb. The 
fourth-largest city in Los Angeles County, Pomona had 40 murders last year. Its 
crime rate is the highest in the San Gabriel Valley. Almost 12% of its 
residents are unemployed -- among the highest jobless rates in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the San Gabriel Valley has weathered the recession better than the 
rest of Los Angeles County and stands to outperform it in the years to come. 
The region has fewer aerospace and defense-related industries and has a large 
concentration of industries expected to do well in the future: health care, 
services, construction, retail and light manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pomona remains a stubborn pocket of social and economic woes, and urban 
experts say the glass plant's closure will only exacerbate its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pomona situation is a very acute one because there's a historic 
interaction between plant closures and neighborhood decline . . .," said Mike 
Davis, author of "City of Quartz," a socioeconomic study of Los Angeles. 
"There's no way Pomona's going to get out of that situation if its industrial 
base continues to erode." 
</P>
<P>
 An influx of Latinos and Asians into Pomona in recent years has sparked a 
mini-boom in small ethnic and family-run businesses, but they operate on tight 
margins and do not begin to replace the unionized jobs of a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, although there are hopeful pockets of revitalization, downtown 
Pomona is studded with empty lots and boarded-up storefronts. Large swatches of 
the industrial area near railroad tracks are vacant. Along these desolate 
strips, teen-age girls push baby carriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Strapped for cash and facing a $4.5 million budget deficit, the city is 
pursuing controversial plans to open two card club casinos, which could bring 
$10 million a year in tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic situation is so dire that the city is starting up its own version 
of a micro-enterprise loan fund popular in the Third World. The cooperative 
will give Pomona women small loans of up to $500 to start businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a far cry from 1947, when the glass plant opened in Pomona. Then it was 
a mostly white community known as "Queen of the Citrus Belt" because of its 
many orchards. The community was flush with post-war prosperity, peace and 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 For generations, the plant boomed, with up to 700 workers during peak seasons 
who earned union wages, wide-ranging benefits and generous pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heyday of glass in the late 1970s, there were 150 glass container 
plants scattered throughout the United States. But about that time, plastics 
arrived in a big way: The plastics industry introduced a two-liter soft-drink 
bottle that began competing with glass. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout in the glass industry was swift and catastrophic. As food and 
beverage manufacturers switched to plastic, which is lighter, less breakable 
and easier to handle, plants were forced to close. Today about 70 glass 
container plants remain, and some of those may be teetering. In short order, 
analysts expect, plastic will eat further into the small-container soft-drink 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are scared," says Ron Clipper, a 26-year-veteran of the Pomona plant. 
"I'm 49 years old and I make almost $20 an hour. I'm willing to move anywhere 
in the country. But the jobs just aren't there. This is a dinosaur, a dying 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 325 Pomona employees who will be on the street come Christmas, placing 
the blame comes second to finding work. A union representative estimates that 
only 15 of the 325 workers will find comparable employment, and those will be 
highly skilled employees such as journeymen electricians and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 24 plant supervisors, only five will transfer to other Owens-Brockway 
plants around the country. Production manager Jim Woolstenhulme will be one of 
them, transferring to the company's plant in Vernon southeast of Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolstenhulme lives with his family in Victorville, 86 miles from Vernon. With 
three daughters in school, the 42-year-old says it would be too difficult to 
uproot his family. So he may rent an apartment in Los Angeles during the work 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife's very understanding," Woolstenhulme said. "She realizes I have to go 
where the employment is." 
</P>
<P>
 When Owens-Brockway announced the Pomona plant closure in October, it gave 
workers 90 days notice and explained that they would receive 25 hours pay for 
every year of employment, with a $15,000 cap. Workers took the news badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cried. Others got angry. Ron Clipper was supposed to buy a new car the 
night he got notification and says he was lucky to be able to back out of the 
deal. Leonard Gayles, 24, had just finished a 4,000-hour apprenticeship to 
become a journeyman machine operator when the news came. His skills won't 
transfer easily to another industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with just days to go before the plant shuts down, workers still retain 
pride in their craft. They boast to a visitor that the plant has met all its 
production quotas for this year. At the supermarket, they try to buy glass 
products, even though it's getting harder to find. 
</P>
<P>
 They say there is something mesmerizing about a glass factory, where red-hot 
furnaces that burn at 2,800 degrees melt down silica sand, soda ash, recycled 
glass and limestone to create new glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Rows of synchronized machines pump the molten liquid into molds, which form a 
variety of food and beverage containers that chug along conveyor belts for 
quality control tests: Miller beer long-necked bottles (300 produced per 
minute), Snapple Iced Tea bottles (370 a minute) and others. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an enterprise that paid the bills for generations of families, including 
that of Essie Poole, who has been a glass packer at Owens for 15 years and got 
her son a job there as well. Poole, a 42-year-old single mother, just bought a 
car and wonders how she will make payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my job. I raised my kids in this job. It's part of my life and I 
wanted to retire here. But all I can do now is pray I'll find a good job."

 Tilting at Windmills: The California Public Utilities Commission could resolve 
a highly public fight between Southern California Edison Co. and independent 
power producers at its scheduled hearing Wednesday in San Francisco. The 
utility is contesting a PUC-mandated auction in which Edison would be required 
to enter long-term contracts to buy electricity from independents that include 
wind energy, geothermal and other renewable-fuel sources.In full-page newspaper 
ads and other venues, Edison has argued that it does not need the additional 
power and that signing the contracts would unnecessarily raise ratepayer costs 
by more than $1 billion from 1997 through the year 2003 alone. The 
independents, led by the Independent Energy Producers Assn., contend in their 
own ad campaign that while Edison may not need more electricity right away, 
theirs is cheaper than power now being made by some older Edison-owned 
facilities, which should be retired. The auction is a legacy of the 1970s oil 
shocks, when state agencies forged support of renewable and domestic energy 
sources. The auction also predates the PUC's proposal last spring to deregulate 
the electric utility industry. Edison says signing now would burden the utility 
with a new set of long-term financial obligations just as it enters the 
uncharted world of competition. Last week, the utility asked commissioners to 
hold off their decision until it completes less expensive deals to option, not 
buy, power from the independents.

 Telephone Line: State regulators are expected to set the ground rules 
Wednesday for competition in local telephone markets, which are now monopolies 
for Pacific Bell and General Telephone Co. of California. This is part of the 
Public Utilities Commission's plan to revamp the state's telecommunications 
industry to introduce competition in all markets.Among other issues, the 
commissioners will look at changing the definition of basic phone service and 
how to pay for universal service for low-income and elderly customers. The rule 
changes will let such giants as AT&T and MCI compete for strictly local phone 
business. The PUC, which has already opened up the market for so-called local 
long-distance as of Jan. 1, hopes to deregulate the rest of the industry within 
two years.

 Bond Crisis Panel: Orange County's bond crisis -- from which losses have so 
far reached $2.02 billion -- continues to draw attention throughout the 
state.The state Senate Special Committee on Local Government Investment 
Practices, a special panel set up to investigate the fiasco, meets Monday at 
the State Capitol in Sacramento. The committee will review how the debacle 
occurred and whether other California local governments face similar crises. It 
will also look at tightening local investment rules, consider legislation to 
tighten state oversight, examine whether a bailout is advisable and consider 
new laws restricting ties between securities firms and local investment 
officials.

 Big Park: A private property owner's desire to contribute 80 acres of land 
toward a massive and controversial new San Diego County regional park by Dec. 
31 -- in time to qualify for a tax write-off -- comes under scrutiny this week. 
Landowner Perrin & American wants to donate land in the San Pasqual Valley area 
southeast of Escondido.The proposed San Dieguito Regional Park would stretch 
for 55 miles along the San Dieguito River from the Pacific Ocean at Del Mar 
eastward to Ramona. The issue comes before the San Dieguito River Valley Joint 
Powers Authority at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday at 1500 State St. in San Diego. The 
authority, formed in 1989 by six county governmental bodies with a mandate to 
create the regional park, has faced opposition from a group of landowners, 
Citizens for Private Property Rights. The landowners want their property 
eliminated from the area in which the JPA exercises condemnation powers.

 Kerkorian Cleared to Buy More Chrysler Stock: Billionaire investor Kirk 
Kerkorian, Chrysler Corp.'s largest shareholder, has received clearance from 
federal regulators to increase his stake in the auto maker. He now owns 9%, 
about 32 million shares, and has indicated in filings with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission that he intends to increase his stake to 15%.On Dec. 1, 
responding to a demand from Kerkorian, Chrysler directors revised their 
shareholder rights plan to allow a stockholder to own up to 15% of the company 
without triggering anti-takeover defenses. At the same board meeting, Chrysler 
increased its dividend 60% and said it would buy back $1 billion in stock next 
year. Both measures were proposed by Kerkorian to push up the price of Chrysler 
stock.

CLEANUP TIME ON THE BANKRUPTCY DETAIL; FINANCES: WILLIAM RIFKIN HEADS A SALOMON 
BROS. TEAM TRYING TO SORT OUT THE MESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 16 years at Salomon Bros., William D. Rifkin has had a front-row seat to 
some of the best-known corporate takeovers and massive bankruptcies of the past 
decade. But being called in to help straighten out Orange County's 
multibillion-dollar financial mess was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am used to looking at the balance and income sheets of a corporation. The 
finances of a municipality are completely different," Rifkin said in a recent 
telephone interview. "You have one source of revenue over which you have little 
control . . . taxes. It's hard to know what flexibility you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfamiliar with municipal finance or not, Rifkin, 41, is the self-described 
coordinator of a 30-member team from the New York investment banking firm hired 
to assess Orange County's troubled portfolio and to help market its remaining 
securities. He is a managing director in Salomon's mergers and acquisitions 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkin's team of executives and technicians worked throughout last weekend 
evaluating the county's deteriorating bond fund, which sparked the largest 
municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Rifkin gave his initial verdict to the county Board of Supervisors and 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan: The 187 cities, school boards and special 
districts participating in the pool had lost $2.02 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday and Friday, Salomon Bros. was involved in selling off more 
than $1 billion of the estimated $5.4-billion portfolio to try to stabilize the 
county's fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rifkin has no experience handling a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy, he 
notes that few others do, either, because a municipal filing is so rare. And 
Orange County's is the largest by far. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rifkin is well-traveled on the bankruptcy and high-finance circuits. His 
credentials include the Federated Department Stores and Circle K Corp. 
bankruptcies as well as some of the biggest takeover battles of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very smart and he is very decent," said Bruce Bennett, Orange County's 
bankruptcy lawyer, "and I have a great deal of confidence in his advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he gained his respect for Rifkin from working with him on the 
bankruptcy of Federated, which operates retail chains like Bloomingdale's, 
Jordan Marsh and Burdines. Federated filed for bankruptcy in the late 1980s, a 
victim of the debt-financed merger and acquisitions craze. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the takeover target of R. H. Macy & Co., Federated emerged from 
bankruptcy and turned the tables, purchasing a $449-million bankruptcy claim 
that gave it the leverage to arrange for a takeover of Macy later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkin was also involved in the bankruptcy of Circle K Corp., the nation's 
second-largest convenience store chain, which is to be acquired by CK 
Acquisitions, an investment group whose holdings include Saks Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkin's role as an adviser to takeover artists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 
in its takeover of Beatrice Cos. was described in the 1992 book, "Merchants of 
Debt: KKR and the Mortgaging of American Business." 
</P>
<P>
 The book tells of a climactic scene in May, 1988, when Beatrice Chief 
Executive Don Kelly claimed that someone had fiddled with Salomon's analysis of 
the deal, triggering a confrontation with KKR partner Don Kravis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The room went deadly quiet for a moment. Then, quivering inside, Salomon's 
Rifkin got up and began running through his formal presentation," the book 
related. Kelly agreed to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Nebraska, Rifkin has been with Salomon Bros. since graduation from 
Harvard Business School in 1978. He is married, the father of two boys and 
lives in Brooklyn Heights, N.Y.

BURLINGTON NORTHERN MAKES NEW BID FOR SANTA FE PACIFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burlington Northern Inc., trying to deal a knockout blow to a rival bidder, 
announced Sunday that it has reached a new agreement to buy the Santa Fe 
Pacific Corp. That raises the railroad company's purchase price to $3.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-step deal, which would create the nation's largest railroad, was 
designed to defeat a hostile $3-billion-plus offer for Sante Fe Pacific by 
Union Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific spokesman Gary Schuster said Sunday night that his company, 
currently the nation's biggest railroad concern, will study the new Santa 
Fe-Burlington Northern merger pact. He said Union Pacific, based in Bethlehem, 
Pa., remains interested in acquiring Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 James Valentine, a railroad industry analyst for Smith Barney Inic. in New 
York, predicted that Union Pacific would come back with another offer for Sante 
Fe Pacific. "Union Pacific has a tremendous amount of resources, and there's no 
reason to believe it won't use them to try to acquire Santa Fe." Under the 
first part of the new Burlington Northern-Santa Fe agreement, Santa Fe will 
conduct a cash tender offer for 38 million of its own shares at $20 each, or a 
total of $760 million. That represents about 20% of Santa Fe's outstanding 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Burlington Northern will launch a tender offer for 25 
million Santa Fe shares at $20 each, or a total of $500 million. That offer 
represents about 13% of Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the tender offers, the companies would await approval of their 
merger plans by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which they said is expected 
in mid-1996. The merger would then be completed through a stock swap at a ratio 
of 0.40 share of Burlington Northern for each remaining Santa Fe share. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the deal is being valued by the companies at $3.8 billion, up from a 
previous agreement valued at around $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boards of directors of BN and Santa Fe have unanimously reaffirmed their 
commitment to bring together our two great railroads in a win-win transaction 
for everyone concerned," Gerald Grinstein, chairman and chief executive of 
Burlington Northern, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern and Santa Fe initially agreed on a $2.5-billion deal in 
July, but that agreement later was derailed by a Union Pacific offer that has 
been valued at as high as $3.8 billion. The companies said the tender offers 
will begin Thursday and should be completed in late January.

 Chrysler Faces Minivan Class-Action Suit: The suit charges that the rear doors 
on the auto maker's popular Voyager, Caravan and Town and Country minivans are 
prone to flying open in collisions. The rear lift gates on 1984 through 1994 
models have opened in 51 accidents, with 74 passengers being thrown out and 25 
people killed, according to reports submitted to the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration.The suit seeks unspecified damages for alleged fraud, 
violations of consumer protection laws, breach of warranty and negligence. It 
does not seek money for personal injuries. The suit, filed Monday in San Mateo 
County Superior Court, is the first to seek damages for the estimated 4 million 
U.S. owners of Chrysler minivans, plaintiffs' attorney Michael F. Ram said.

INDIVIDUALS COME BACK TO UNCLE SAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frightened by municipal bonds and wary of mutual funds, many yield-hungry 
small investors have been going back to basics: buying shorter-term bills and 
notes issued directly by Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, investors get another chance to buy: The Treasury will auction 
$17.25 billion in two-year notes on Wednesday and $11 billion in five-year 
notes on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors can bid for the notes -- that is, they can try to finagle 
the best potential yield out of Uncle Sam -- but competitive bidding is a game 
for professional institutional investors. Instead, most individuals make 
"non-competitive" purchase offers, meaning that they agree to take the average 
yield bid on the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 And current yields are arguably attractive: If rates stay near today's levels, 
buyers of the two-year note can expect an annualized yield of about 7.6%; the 
five-year note may yield about 7.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Minimum bids are $5,000 for the two-year notes and $1,000 for the five-year. 
If you don't have an order form in hand by now, you'll probably have to go to 
the Federal Reserve Bank in Downtown Los Angeles to pick up a form, then 
deliver it back there by 9 a.m. auction day (for information: (213) 624-7398). 
Or you can buy through discount or full-service brokers for a small fee. TOM

 Trade Barriers Cost Consumers, Study Says: According to a study by the 
Institute for International Economics, the trade barriers that keep foreign 
goods out of Japan cost consumers as much as $110 billion in 1989 (or as much 
as $150 billion at current exchange rates) but enrich Japanese companies, 
making it politically difficult to dismantle them. The study says that Japanese 
consumers are starting to realize that food and clothing are far more expensive 
in Tokyo than in New York and that they are beginning to complain about 
practices that keep less-expensive imports off the shelves.

IN THE U.S., IT'S A HOT TOY; IN THAILAND, A $5-A-DAY JOB; LABOR: THE FACTORY 
MAKING POWER RANGERS FIGURES HAS ADDED WORKERS AND NOW RUNS AT CAPACITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no shortage of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers for Lamduan Chatsomboon. 
She's surrounded by them as she works 13 hours a day assembling pieces of 
molded plastic, trying to meet the insatiable worldwide demand for the toys. 
</P>
<P>
 She could never afford one for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Thai earns $5 a day and 84 cents an hour for overtime. In the 
race to put the toys under Christmas trees in Europe and the United States, she 
may attach shoulder shields to as many as 500 Power Rangers heroes in one hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers cost $13.50 on average in the United States, but here the asking 
price is $88 apiece, far out of Lamduan's range. 
</P>
<P>
 She works while speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too much, but I can do it if I don't stop," Lamduan says. "I cannot 
smile, I cannot talk, I cannot make a sound." 
</P>
<P>
 When it became clear the Power Rangers were going to be the ultimate prize of 
the U.S. holiday season, the Japanese-owned Bandai factory here added 600 new 
hires to bring its work force to 2,000. It started producing around the clock 
and raised its output to 725,000 toys a month from 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us should feel like Santa Claus," said Tawatchai Pingsuthiwong, deputy 
manager of the factory. "Our production now is at maximum capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 It still isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores in the United States have limited the number of Power Rangers one 
customer may buy. Some desperate shoppers reportedly scuffled over dwindling 
supplies of the 8-inch-tall Rangers, their dinosauresque Power Zords and 
Thunderzord battle machines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mary Woodworth of Bandai America, Power Rangers toys are being 
made at nine plants in China, three in Thailand, two in Japan and one each in 
Taiwan and Mexico. She said four other plants in China will begin production 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandai says it expects sales in the United States alone to top $300 million 
for the year ending next March, 10 times more than in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the factory outside Bangkok, hundreds of workers flank rows of conveyor 
belts to snap together body parts and shoulder armor and insert screws and 
springs. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room, workers don surgical masks to paint eyes and noses on the 
characters -- five teen-agers chosen to rescue the planet from evil space 
invaders led by the villain Rita Repulsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving along the assembly lines, the plastic pieces "morph" into the 
characters, from the Sabertooth Tiger Dinozord to Titanus, the Carrier Zord 
that totes the other zords. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quiet except for the hum of machines stamping out Power Rangers parts and 
the whir of drilling into molded plastic. The factory is clean, air conditioned 
and brightly lit; workers get an hour off for lunch and two 10-minute breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions are superior to those in many factories in Thailand, where some 
sweatshops are known to lock in their laborers and sometimes chain or beat 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the workers don't get any special deals on the toys. The "Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers" show has been on Thai television about a year and the 
toys are popular, but they're even scarcer in stores here than in ones 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of all the Rangers toys rushed off the assembly lines go into 
shipping containers bound for the United States. The rest go to Europe or 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 At Robinson's in Bangkok, clerk Nurak Thamuangthai says the toy department has 
received no more than six Power Rangers in a month, and none at all for the 
last two months. The Rangers are the store's most expensive toys, but they 
nevertheless don't stay on the shelves long. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried to order more, but there are no supplies," she says. "Yesterday 
alone, three or four customers came to ask for them." She said the inquiries 
are mostly from foreigners, usually Japanese or Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rangers are in stock, factory worker Sawai Kannarong, 30, sometimes 
takes her 3-year-old son to look at the toys she produces. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar pride is voiced by other workers who, despite the grueling hours, seem 
happy to be turning out the hottest gift item of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family is proud that I make such a modern, popular, amazing toy," says 
Varaporn Polsawat, 27, who says she puts in about 11 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamduan says she's just happy for the overtime pay. She usually earns $5.40 
for an eight-hour shift -- 40 cents of which goes to the agent who got her the 
job -- bringing her earnings under Thailand's official daily minimum wage of 
$5.20. 
</P>
<P>
 She works three to five hours of overtime a day to earn an extra $2.50 to 
$4.20. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was no overtime, how could I afford food?" she asks over the simple 
meal of rice and salad she buys at a stall across the highway from the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to buy a Power Ranger," she adds, "but even if they were sold here, I 
couldn't buy one. They're too expensive."

 Indonesia Revokes Forest Concessions: In an action seen as a move toward 
curbing excessive logging and bad management of its tropical forests, the 
country has revoked 75 forest concessions of an unknown number of firms, the 
Antara news agency said.Warsito, secretary of the directorate-general of Forest 
Exploitation, said Forestry Minister Djamaluddin Soeryohadikusumo made the 
decision after 135 concessions expired. Most of those had run for 20 years. 
Warsito was quoted as saying state companies would take equity in another 33 
concessions. Antara said a total of 580 forest concessions had been issued 
since 1970.

 Seoul to Deregulate Petroleum Prices: The country said it will phase out the 
regulations and take other measures soon to lift controls over the petroleum 
industry. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said companies will be 
able to set prices as soon as the second half of next year. The petroleum 
import and export business, now open only to refiners, will soon be open to 
other companies, including foreign ones, the ministry said.

a flood of imports. More than two-thirds of Philippine exports go to the United

 Some Foreign Investments Restricted: The rules are aimed at protecting 
domestic producers in two of Vietnam's fastest-growing economic sectors -- 
hotels, and garments and shoes -- said Ngo Van Diem, a director of the State 
Committee for Cooperation and Investment.Foreign joint ventures making garments 
and shoes must now export at least 80% of their production. Firms in those 
industries owned completely by foreigners must export 90% of their goods, Ngo 
said. The rules limit foreign investors to building hotels of at least a 
three-star international standard.

A CALMING PLACE FOR KIDS IN NEED; SHELTER: CASA PACIFICA IS THE ONLY COUNTY 
FACILITY THAT CONSOLIDATES BASIC SERVICES FOR FOSTER CARE UNDER ONE ROOF. 
</P>

<P>
 Lessons go smoothly most days in Kathy McAndrews' classroom at Casa Pacifica, 
Ventura County's shelter for abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been trying times since the shelter opened five months ago, 
McAndrews said. Like the day a 9-year-old boy started crying, saying he missed 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the child next to him started sniffling. Before long, all 10 students 
were sobbing, she said. Continuing with the lesson would be futile, McAndrews 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 So she stopped academics and encouraged the children to instead make colorful 
cards for the person they missed the most. That diversion helped restore order 
and allowed the children to funnel their fears and sadness in a positive way, 
McAndrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such flexibility is necessary in a place where children are often overwhelmed 
by emotions brought on by years of physical abuse and neglect in the home, 
McAndrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the chaos at home, many children want to stay with parents rather 
than be placed in a shelter where they do not know anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, their lives are in turmoil," she said. "And I want this classroom 
to feel safe, to be a place that is all for them." 
</P>
<P>
 From the time a child enters Casa Pacifica -- often in the middle of the 
night, scared and alone -- a team of psychologists, nurses, teachers and 
administrators works to make the child feel cared for and safe, spokeswoman 
Tanya Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica's staff has embraced that philosophy since the shelter opened 
July 18 in a park-like campus near southern Camarillo, Gonzales said. Already, 
the center averages 50 children in residence, approaching its capacity of 74, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica is the only facility in the county for children that 
consolidates all basic services -- food, shelter, medical screenings, 
counseling and schooling -- in one place, said Frank Ferratta, director of 
protective services for the county's social welfare department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, foster children in Ventura County were shuttled from one home to 
another as they awaited the outcome of custody decisions made by the courts and 
social workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point of this place is to reduce the number of foster homes a child 
has to go through when they are taken from their parents," Ferratta said. 
</P>
<P>
 A special family meeting room, which is gated and closely monitored by Casa 
Pacifica staff, also makes it easier to arrange meetings between parents and 
their children, Ferratta said. 
</P>
<P>
 To give the center a homey feel, children sleep in four spacious redwood 
buildings outfitted with single beds, toys, games, beanbag chairs and a common 
eating area. Staffers call the buildings cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter also has its own classrooms, a medical clinic, gymnasium and pool. 
A cheerful nursery houses infants. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the kids, Casa Pacifica will be their home this Christmas. Staff 
members said they plan to decorate the cottages, prepare special meals and give 
gifts to children who cannot leave the campus over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a home, but the staff tries its best to make it a homelike setting," 
said Jerome Smith, who oversees the children's daily schedules and education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter operates two programs. Children who are removed from their homes 
due to abuse, neglect or abandonment are placed in the emergency shelter 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Children, ages infant to 17, remain in the shelter program up to 45 days. 
During that time, the extent of their physical and emotional damage is 
assessed. Therapists also work with the child and their parents in the hope of 
reuniting the family. 
</P>
<P>
 If the child cannot safely be returned home, the child is placed with a foster 
family for long-term care, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The residential treatment program is designed for youths ages 11 to 17 who 
have already exhausted the foster care system. Children in residential care 
stay up to 18 months and receive intensive therapy because many of them suffer 
severe emotional problems or learning disabilities, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter which program they are in, the children follow roughly the same 
daily schedule, Smith said. They rise at 6:30 a.m., take turns showering, clean 
their rooms and eat breakfast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning meal is followed by a brief meeting where the children and their 
therapists discuss what they are going to do for the day. At 8:30, school-age 
children report to their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica operates two schools, one funded by the county superintendent of 
schools office and one by the shelter itself. The first is for kindergarten 
through sixth grade. The Casa Pacifica school is for upper grades. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:30 p.m., school lets out and the children take part in activities -- from 
dance and exercise classes to cooking lessons and other home arts classes, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have several kids who are learning needlepoint," he said. "It's a very 
calming, relaxing activity." 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, children can go on outings accompanied by a counselor or choose 
to attend other evening activities arranged by the staff, Smith said. 
Therapists are always on hand to answer the children's questions, from when 
they will be allowed to return home to the proper way to eat a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised how many kids have not eaten off a tablecloth," Smith 
said. "They don't have the social skills. It's been either McDonald's or 
nothing at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Security is a top concern at Casa Pacifica. Locked steel fences surround the 
campus. Visitors are issued badges and are closely monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica also imposes a set of house rules for the children: no long 
phone calls, no physical contact with the opposite sex, no smoking, no leaving 
the shelter without a chaperon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a difficult adjustment for some, particularly older children who have 
had little or no parental supervision before arriving at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael, 16, who has been in and out of foster care since he was 4, has been 
at Casa Pacifica since it opened. He doesn't like the rules, Michael said, but 
acknowledges they are necessary to keep order. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have rules, this place would go nuts," he said one recent day in 
a library at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael said he has trouble controlling his temper, but therapists at the 
center are helping him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm about to get angry, I take a walk or go to my room," the teen-ager 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael recently told counselors that he wanted to get rid of some 
gang-related tattoos on his body. And he said he hopes to eventually return to 
his foster family in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 While older children tend to chafe at the restrictions placed on them, many of 
the younger ones welcome the structure, McAndrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Troy is one who said he likes living at Casa Pacifica. He and 
his 10-year-old brother, Jimmy, were removed from their Ventura County home 
after authorities suspected that they had been beaten, McAndrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy sat hunched over his desk one recent day, using a small calculator to 
work mathematics problems. Beside his desk sat a colorful yarn weaving the boy 
had made in an earlier art class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kinda like it here," Troy said. "I can make things that my mom can't throw 
away."

STREET SMART: SLUGGISH CARS A PROBLEM IN FAST LANE ON CONEJO GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 During the nearly three years I've lived in Ventura County, I've noticed that 
almost every time I drive up the Conejo Grade on the Ventura Freeway, there are 
always slow drivers who remain in the left lane. 
</P>
<P>
 These cars stay left even though their speed drops below 55 m.p.h. as they 
ascend the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 It is extremely dangerous for such drivers to be impeding the fast lane this 
way. They are apparently oblivious to the problems they cause by forcing 
drivers whose cars can mount the hill at a normal speed to try to negotiate 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if those signs that say "Slower Traffic Merge Right" do any good, 
but a few couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Highway Patrol enforcement of the proper use of the left lane would also 
seem appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for your column, and for your attention to this observation. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, posting signs directing slower traffic to move right could 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the far right lane leads directly to the truck scales at 
the top of the grade. 
</P>
<P>
 So considerate drivers of sluggish cars could find themselves stuck among a 
bunch of diesel-belching semis. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid this very problem, signs are posted along the grade directing 
"Through Traffic Merge Left." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding signs telling slow traffic to move right could be rather confusing, 
state Department of Transportation Traffic Engineer Ali Peykanu says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart:

<P>
 I live in Camarillo on Pleasant Valley Road between the railroad tracks and 
Las Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city installed the sewer lines, it tore up the road quite badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are a lot of ruts and many dangerous potholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans to resurface this road? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are in the works to resurface Las Posas, Camarillo Traffic Engineer Tom 
Fox says. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which is slated to begin in early summer, should take about six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Many mornings as I drive east on the Simi Valley Freeway, the traffic backs up 
at Tapo Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 It usually stays slow until the Kuehner Drive exit. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem seems to be caused by cars entering the freeway from the on-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 This problem could be solved if the flow of traffic onto the freeway was 
controlled by ramp entry lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Such lights are installed at the Tapo Canyon Road and Sycamore Drive on-ramps, 
but for some reason, they are not in use. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar signals that are in use at the Stearns Street and Yosemite Avenue 
on-ramps seem to be working well. Why are the other signals not in use?

 Dear Reader:

 Patience, please, says Manny Mendoza, Caltrans traffic investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic signals appearing at on-ramps along the Simi Valley Freeway are 
part of a project to install the meters at every ramp to the freeway, Mendoza 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a meter appears, it takes time to hook up all the wires and get the thing 
up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 By July, all the meters along the Simi Valley Freeway should be operating, he 
says.

VENTURA COUNCIL MAY FUND EXTENDED LIBRARY HOURS; BOOKS: MONEY FROM THE CITY 
WOULD ENABLE TWO LOCAL COUNTY BRANCHES TO STAY OPEN LONGER EACH WEEK FROM 
JANUARY TO AUGUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with mounting public pressure, the Ventura City Council tonight will 
consider whether to spend $145,000 to keep local libraries open longer. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would keep two local branches open a total of 13 additional hours 
weekly between January and August and pay for an automatic checkout machine at 
the mid-town branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, neither the H. P. Wright Library on Day Road nor the E. P. Foster 
Library downtown operates more than 20 hours a week. A staff of 10 shuttles 
between the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither branch is open Fridays, as Ventura resident Randy Davis, pulling up to 
Wright library just as the sun set over its empty parking lot, learned to his 
chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just assume a public library is going to be open," said Davis, owner of a 
charter boat company. 
</P>
<P>
 He gestured at the darkened building. "This is a waste of taxpayer money right 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Like those who have crowded city meetings and mailed impassioned letters to 
the council and local newspapers, Davis said the city should do whatever it can 
to keep the libraries open more hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is hardly a new one at City Hall. Only five months ago, many of the 
same council members said they would not pick up the tab for what has 
traditionally been a county responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 But with county finances remaining tight and residents clamoring ever louder 
for more hours at their neighborhood branches, the council's Finance Committee 
agreed earlier this month to recommend the expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal now has strong support among the council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson said in July that he would wait for the county to 
ante up the money. But earlier this month, at a Finance Committee meeting 
jammed with restive residents, he quickly agreed to spend city money at the two 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Jim Monahan, Gary Tuttle and Steve Bennett also say they support 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom, who has railed against the county in the past for 
its miserly attitude toward the libraries, said Friday that he might spend some 
city money if he thought that library officials had a solid, long-term plan for 
funding the city's branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mayor Tom Buford, who admits that he has "serious reservations" about 
allotting the libraries money when the city itself is in tight financial 
straits, said he may vote for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The libraries have overwhelming support, as far as I can tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and library officials have also discussed putting a $10 to $35 
annual parcel tax on the ballot, saying that would ensure permanent and ample 
funding for the library branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is now open from 2 to 8 p.m. Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Wednesdays and 1 
to 5 p.m. Saturdays. Foster is open from noon to 8 p.m. Tuesdays, 10 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Thursdays and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent library fund-raising drive raised $7,677 from residents, allowing 
Wright, beginning in January, to stay open two hours later Wednesdays and 
Foster to begin operating two hours earlier Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent fund-raising efforts also paid for the Avenue Library, the city's 
smallest branch, to open at 1 p.m. instead of 2 p.m. Mondays. The Avenue branch 
nearly closed two years ago, but a city telethon collected enough money to keep 
it open until June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Many city and library officials agree that the present recommendation to spend 
$145,000 through August is only a temporary panacea. In the long term, they 
say, the city must find a new home to house its entire library collection. 
</P>
<P>
 One site mentioned repeatedly at the Finance Committee meeting is a vacant 
furniture store at the Buenaventura Mall. Carson, however, said the building 
would need extensive and costly retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council committee's recommendation came in response to a library board 
vote last month to ask the city for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, some board members wanted to shut Wright, at least temporarily, 
and move all its books to Foster so it could operate 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal, however, met with fierce resistance from other board members as 
well as many eastside residents, and it was shelved.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright is far more popular with readers than Foster, circulating nearly 
225,000 books a year to Foster's 107,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foster is the county's main reference library, with a collection of 
133,000 volumes. Wright, by contrast, only has 97,000 books.

 Once a meter appears, it takes time to hook up all the wires and get the thing 
up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 By July, all the meters along the Simi Valley Freeway should be operating, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 During the nearly three years I've lived in Ventura County, I've noticed that 
almost every time I drive up the Conejo Grade on the Ventura Freeway, there are 
always slow drivers who remain in the left lane. 
</P>
<P>
 These cars stay left even though their speed drops below 55 m.p.h. as they 
ascend the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 It is extremely dangerous for such drivers to be impeding the fast lane this 
way. They are apparently oblivious to the problems they cause by forcing 
drivers whose cars can mount the hill at a normal speed to try to negotiate 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if those signs that say "Slower Traffic Merge Right" do any good, 
but a few couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Highway Patrol enforcement of the proper use of the left lane would also 
seem appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for your column, and for your attention to this observation. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, posting signs directing slower traffic to move right could 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the far right lane leads directly to the truck scales at 
the top of the grade. 
</P>
<P>
 So considerate drivers of sluggish cars could find themselves stuck among a 
bunch of diesel-belching semis. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid this very problem, signs are posted along the grade directing 
"Through Traffic Merge Left." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding signs telling slow traffic to move right could be rather confusing, 
Caltrans Traffic Engineer Ali Peykanu says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Camarillo on Pleasant Valley Road between the railroad tracks and 
Las Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city installed the sewer lines, it tore up the road quite badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are a lot of ruts and many dangerous potholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans to resurface this road? 
</P>
<P>

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are in the works to resurface Las Posas, Camarillo Traffic Engineer Tom 
Fox says. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which is slated to begin in early summer, should take about six 
months.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; NEIGHBORHOOD PARTY CELEBRATES MANY CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Giselle Partida, 14, enjoys sharing aspects of her Mexican heritage with other 
people, and she loves to learn about cultures different from her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, she had a chance to do both. 
</P>
<P>
 A violinist in a mariachi band, Giselle played Mexican music for an audience 
at Oxnard's Lemonwood School. And after she was finished, she watched a group 
of Filipino dancers perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't know about each other's culture," Giselle said. "I feel 
kind of honored that I can educate people about Mexican culture by playing in a 
band like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Giselle was one of about 30 musicians, dancers and singers who performed at 
the school during a holiday celebration organized by the Lemonwood Neighborhood 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 adults and children crowded the school's cafeteria over the weekend 
for the pageant, called "A Multicultural Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 The program included African-Americans performing traditional Nigerian dance, 
and youngsters performing an Indian dance from Mexico in honor of the Virgin of 
Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
 And a group of white residents danced a country-Western two-step. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents decided to hold a neighborhood Christmas party as a way to 
increase ethnic understanding and create a strong sense of community, council 
President Charles Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Mexicans, Filipinos, African-Americans and whites, the 
Lemonwood area includes Koreans and Japanese residents, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a melting-pot neighborhood, and one of our goals is to share with 
each other our culture and heritage," Olson said. "We want be examples to our 
children. We want them to witness that regardless of how much ethnic diversity 
we have, we can build a community that is united and works together." 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of an entry fee for the performance, audience members were required to 
bring cans of food, which will be distributed to Oxnard organizations that 
provide help for the homeless, Olson said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DECORATED FLOTILLA LIGHTS UP HARBOR 
</P>

 Tom and Julie Rush of Ventura transformed their 40-foot harbor cruise boat, 
Bay Queen, into a covered wagon, stringing sheets and other material from stern 
to bow. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort paid off over the weekend, with the Bay Queen being honored for 
best decorations on a commercial vessel in the 18th annual Parade of Lights, 
which floated through Ventura Harbor late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a country-Western theme, so we were a covered wagon," said Tom Rush, 
who has won the award so many years in a row he can't keep track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been five or six years running," said Rush, 55. "We always go all out 
every year to decorate. It's a lot of hard work and a lot of imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty vessels -- from sailing ships to pedal boats -- entered the holiday 
event. The floating parade drew thousands of spectators, with Ventura police 
reporting no problems except some irate visitors who had to park a long way 
from the event.  
</P>
<P>
 Parade of Lights organizers offered first-place awards in several categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners included the National Park Service, which won the grand sweepstakes 
with the Surf Ranger; Diane Shankwiler and Doug Farrell, who won best sailboat 
under 30 feet with the vessel Too Much Fun; Gary Olson, who won best powerboat 
under 25 feet with the Aluminum Pie; Robert Seward, who took top prize among 
sailboats longer than 31 feet with the Robin Marie, and James and Tamara Muro, 
whose Carpe Diem won best powerboat over 26 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners were Chris Jensen, whose Passe Partout took the best nonprofit 
award; Denny Clayton, best overall pedal boat; Evan Clayton, who won best 
lights among pedal boats, and Nancy Nazario, who was honored for best theme 
among pedal boats. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY CUTS SPENDING 18% IN FISCAL YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura cut general government spending by 18% between June, 1993, and June of 
this year, according to the city's annual financial report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report reviews the city's finances for the 1993-94 fiscal year, which 
began July 1, 1993, and ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also states that the city's sales-tax revenue rose 1% from the 
prior fiscal year. Although that is a good indicator of a strengthening 
economy, officials say, it still falls short of the 8% increases of the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, city revenues dropped by 9% in the last fiscal year. City officials 
attributed this, in part, to declining returns on investments and decreases in 
some development-related fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the spending cuts, the report states, the city still began this 
fiscal year with more than $2 million in reserves -- above and beyond the 
amount the city usually keeps in its savings as a cushion against emergencies.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOLIDAY BUS HOURS EXTENDED, FARES CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to nudge holiday shoppers out of their cars and into public 
transportation, Thousand Oaks officials have boosted bus hours and cut fees 
through Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 The red, white and blue Thousand Oaks Transit buses will run Saturdays and 
Sundays from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. And on weekdays, the buses will run an extra 
hour and a half until 8 p.m. As an added incentive, council members agreed to 
cut fares to 25 cents a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who really, really love to shop, a shuttle will run between The Oaks 
mall and Janss Mall every hour the centers are open through Dec. 26 -- for a 
fee of 15 cents a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the city's subsidized taxi service will extend its hours to 6:30 p.m. on 
weekdays through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last holiday season, the extended shuttle hours served 788 passengers, 
according to transportation analyst Roy Myers. He predicted that subsidizing 
the extra hours this year will cost the city about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the plus side, the move would free up parking space, cut air pollution, 
reduce driver stress and introduce more residents to the city's transportation 
service, he said. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 A December hearing date for the American Civil Liberties Union's federal 
lawsuit against Simi Valley school officials has been postponed until Jan. 9, 
lawyers representing the school district said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for both sides have suggested a Jan. 17 trial date, but U.S. 
District Court Judge Irving Hill has not set a date. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against Simi Valley school officials in 
September, claiming a violation of a 14-year-old Valley View Junior High School 
student's constitutional rights to express himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-grader John Spindler was sent home from school for wearing patriotic 
T-shirts that violated the school's strict dress code. The policy bans shirts 
with writing or pictures as an effort to curb campus disputes and promote a 
disciplined school atmosphere. TRACY WILSON

<P>
 State Department of Fish and Game officials have warned the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors that two golf courses proposed for Happy Camp Regional 
Park could harm the wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department urges the board to seriously consider conserving the sensitive 
and irreplaceable resources of Happy Camp Regional Park by maintaining the area 
in its natural state," department official Fred Worthley wrote in a recent 
letter to the supervisors.

 The board on Tuesday will hear developer Ralph Mahan's proposal to build two 
18-hole golf courses on the county-owned park north of Moorpark. Mahan says a 
two-year lease agreement with the county would enable him to raise the money to 
build the golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The courses would be developed on the lower 700 acres of the park, while the 
upper 3,000 acres would remain a wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Worthley pointed out in his letter that the lower canyon supports a 
variety of habitats and grasslands that such animals as the golden eagle, 
black-shouldered kites and other raptors are dependent upon for their food 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park represents one of the best remaining examples of an entire watershed 
system, supporting . . . habitats and wildlife species that are in decline 
throughout the east county," Worthley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 With other developments already planned nearby, preserving Happy Camp Regional 
Park is "all the more essential to wildlife and to the local public as a 
scenic, natural open space." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, however, have said they do not believe that the golf courses 
would cause significant harm to the environment. They also have noted that the 
golf courses could generate $250,000 to $500,000 annually for the county.

JUDGE TO HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER UNDERGROUND WATER PLAN; COURTS: CALLEGUAS DISTRICT 
WANTS TO STORE MILLIONS OF GALLONS FOR EMERGENCY USE. BUT THE MOORPARK-AREA 
LANDOWNERS ARE OPPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge will hear arguments today on whether a 
project to store millions of gallons of drinking water underground violates 
state environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The case pits a Moorpark-area farm family against the Calleguas Municipal 
Water District. The district wants to install wells on the farm, to pump water 
underground and save it for use during a drought or an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the water district say they are simply trying to make sure 
that their customers have a reliable water supply. The district serves Simi 
Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Oxnard, Camarillo and surrounding 
unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glen M. Reiser, an attorney representing landowners Joseph and Mary 
Viramontez, said Calleguas "very effectively excluded . . . the general public 
from any meaningful scrutiny of a significant public project -- a project with 
tremendous population growth implications in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser will ask Judge Barbara A. Lane to rule that the water district violated 
the California Environmental Quality Act by failing to notify the landowners of 
the project and failing to prepare a full report on the project's environmental 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viramontezes said they first heard about the plan in January, almost a 
year after Calleguas first identified their land as a site for the project. 
They contend that that was too late to stop the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say the project would encourage development and should therefore be 
subject to a full environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Viramontezes are not opposed to all development. They had planned to 
divide their 20 acres for development into four "orchard home" sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Environmental Quality Act requires preparation of an 
environmental impact report for all projects that will have a substantial 
effect on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, however, the Viramontezes and Calleguas disagree over the scope 
of the project and what its impact will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viramontezes say they are fighting a massive $20-million project to 
install 25 wells and create 300,000 acre-feet of underground storage capacity 
for water. There are 326,000 gallons in one acre-foot, enough to supply a 
family of five for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas now delivers about 100,000 acre-feet of water each year, serving 
about three-quarters of Ventura County's 700,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser argues that the additional water storage capacity will greatly increase 
the likelihood "that Ventura County could ever become another Orange County, or 
some other suburban extension of Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas defines the contested project differently, saying it is only a 
$2-million project to build four wells with 30,000 acre-feet of storage 
capacity. Although the district has plans to build at least 20 more wells, they 
are not on the Viramontez property and constitute a separate and distinct 
project that will be subject to a full environmental impact review, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser says Calleguas is illegally trying to divide the project into 
"environmentally insignificant segments." 
</P>
<P>
 But Calleguas General Manager Donald R. Kendall argues that, even if the 
storage project is taken as a whole, the effect is not to encourage growth, but 
to accommodate current residents and development that is already projected. He 
said the ground-water storage is needed to protect 500,000 county residents 
from going thirsty if their primary source of water -- from a mile-long, 
eight-foot-diameter tunnel -- is sheared in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time there's an aftershock, my mind gets going," Kendall said. "We're 
trying to take care of the people who are already here." 
</P>
<P>
 The 300,000 acre-feet of water, Kendall said, would be stored for emergencies 
rather than used each year to serve additional residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the final result of the underground storage project is 
drought-proofing or development, both sides agree that the approval process is 
riddled with illogic. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser wrote in a legal brief that it is wrong that responsibility for such 
important decisions rests with Calleguas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, the agency deciding that it will facilitate the tripling of the current 
population of Ventura County and the related traffic, congestion, smog, noise, 
residential and commercial development, and loss of open space is not the 
County Board of Supervisors," he wrote. "The lead agency is, in fact, a 
parochial special district, which is concerned only with meeting water service 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 He also argued in the brief that the only notification the public received 
about the project were two "meaningless" newspaper ads "with no reference to 
the purpose and intended scope of Calleguas Municipal Water District's 
multimillion-dollar ground-water project." 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall, for his part, said it is ironic that the strongest environmental 
opposition to the project on anti-development grounds comes from landowner 
Joseph Viramontez. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Viramontez said he has no objection to Calleguas' installing 
as many noisy wells as it pleases, as long as they are not on the property he 
wants to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Viramontez: "My initial hope would be that they would just leave me alone 
and put their wells anywhere else."

 Orange Coast scored only eight points in the final 10 minutes but hung on for 
a 67-66 victory over Los Angeles Trade Tech on Sunday in the consolation 
championship of the Coast women's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC led, 67-66, with 23 seconds left and had a chance to increase the lead, 
but Flo Luppani missed the front end of a one-and-one situation. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC's America Robledo then stole a pass and teammate Tina Afan got the ball 
and started to drive toward the basket. She was fouled with five seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Afan miss her free throw, and Trade Tech (7-5) got the rebound and tried 
to get the ball past half court before calling a timeout. But the clock ran out 
as several Trade Tech players and both coaches were frantically screaming for a 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates (13-3) opened a 61-55 lead when Robledo made a layup with 9:46, 
left but didn't score again for close to five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates' next points came when Luppani (11 points) made a three-pointer 
with 4:51 left to put OCC ahead, 64-57. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Kelly had a team-high 19 for Orange Coast, including scoring the 
first six points of the second half to put the Pirates ahead, 52-41. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Shine had 14 points and nine rebounds and Robledo had 12 points for OCC. 
</P>

STREET SMART: COSTA MESA FREEWAY CAR-POOLERS MUST PLAN AHEAD TO EXIT AT 17TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have two questions about the car-pool lane on the northbound Costa Mesa 
Freeway. When will the potholes between MacArthur and Warner be repaired? They 
have been there since last rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, there used to be a car-pool exit for 17th Street. Are there any plans 
to stripe it and add it back? 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Lissner Santa Ana Car-pool lanes on both sides of the Costa Mesa Freeway 
in the area between MacArthur Boulevard and Warner Avenue are slated for a 
long-term rehabilitation project, said Rose Orem, a Caltrans spokeswoman. On 
Dec. 5, as a quick fix, potholes were patched through that segment northbound 
and southbound. The larger project will begin next year as funds become 
available, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To answer your second question, the car-pool lane on northbound Costa Mesa 
Freeway at 4th Street used to open to let traffic leave the car-pool lane, 
merge into the regular lanes and have enough room to exit at 17th Street. But 
reconfiguring this area was necessary to accommodate construction of the Santa 
Ana Freeway connectors, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the connectors are finished in mid-1995, they should provide car-poolers 
with a smoother transition from the Santa Ana Freeway to the Costa Mesa 
Freeway, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to access the 17th Street exit, car-poolers need to get out of the 
car-pool lane at the Santa Ana Freeway / Costa Mesa Freeway interchange and 
enter the regular flow of traffic, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have been in many traffic jams on Interstate 5 from San Clemente to the El 
Toro "Y." When there is an accident and traffic is barely moving, why do they 
leave the on-ramps open to add to the congestion? 
</P>
<P>
 In November, there was a three-car accident on northbound Interstate 5 at the 
La Paz exit. The traffic jam started at the Avery Parkway exit and was 
literally stopped. All of the on-ramps remained open with cars pouring onto the 
freeway, trapped! 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't the "powers that be" either close the on-ramps or at least warn the 
drivers of the traffic jam so they can take alternate routes? 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret C. Bucher San Clemente The California Highway Patrol typically closes 
on-ramps only when there is police activity, an investigation, a chemical spill 
or an emergency in which all lanes are closed, said Officer Rick Soto of the 
CHP in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans does use changeable message signs to alert drivers to upcoming 
freeway conditions, Orem said. The problem with closing an on-ramp, and the 
reason it's not standard practice, she said, is that traffic could start to 
back up onto city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to avoid frustration is to tune to any of a number of radio traffic 
reports before entering the freeway, she said. Most radio stations broadcast 
traffic information on freeway congestion via the Caltrans Traffic Management 
Center's bulletin board listing all SigAlerts in effect. News radio station 
KFWB-AM also provides up-to-the-minute traffic information. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Costa Mesa at the end of the Costa Mesa Freeway and I feel that I am 
being punished when I try to get on the darn thing. When the extended freeway 
opened, everything was fine. Now when I try to make a right turn from 19th 
Street to northbound Newport Boulevard, I must wait for a green light (there is 
no turn on red). 
</P>
<P>
 These signs were put up recently and the right-turn lane backs up constantly. 
When it does turn green, it doesn't stay green long enough to accommodate more 
than three or four vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people are turning down residential streets or cutting through a gas 
station on the corner to avoid waiting for two signal changes. We don't even 
get a green arrow when the Newport traffic is turning left onto 19th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Please ask Caltrans if they have plans to alleviate this situation or if they 
will continue to punish us for using 19th Street to get on the freeway. After 
all, they built it and they knew we would come. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they could restrict the right turn prohibition to certain peak hours 
and at least let us turn right when there is no cross traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard T. Hoffman Costa Mesa Caltrans won't consider changing the "no right 
turn on red" at 19th Street and Newport Boulevard, Orem said. The sign was 
installed to avoid conflict between east and westbound 19th Street drivers 
turning onto northbound Newport Boulevard, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastbound 19th Street traffic has three left-turn lanes that flow into the 
three lanes of northbound Newport Boulevard. It would not be safe for westbound 
19th Street motorists to turn right onto Newport Boulevard at the same time, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Extending the green time for westbound 19th Street right-turners also is not 
going to happen. Orem said Newport Boulevard has more traffic than 19th Street 
and needs a longer green light.

TROUBLED MAN KILLED BY DEPUTIES; SHOOTING: OFFICERS SAY THE MONTROSE RESIDENT, 
30, LUNGED AT THEM WITH THE JAGGED EDGE OF A BROKEN CRUTCH AFTER THREATENING 
PEDESTRIANS AND DRIVERS.

<P>
 Two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies shot and killed a mentally troubled 
man early Sunday after he lunged at them with a broken crutch he had been using 
to threaten motorists and pedestrians, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics pronounced Aaron Cease, 30, of Montrose dead in the 2700 block of 
Montrose Avenue shortly after midnight. He was shot several times after he 
threatened deputies who repeatedly ordered him to drop the crutch, said Deputy 
Britta Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's mother, Doreen Cease, said her son was under a doctor's care 
for the past 12 years for "major depression" and used the single crutch to help 
support a weak ankle broken less than a year ago. "He has never been 
threatening on the street like that before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies responded to a call of a man standing in the road threatening 
motorists and pedestrians with the sharp, jagged end of a broken metal crutch, 
Tubbs said. Deputies reportedly told Cease to drop the crutch, but he refused 
and threatened to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was yelling that the deputies would have to kill him or he would kill 
them," Deputy Matthew Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two deputies, whose names were not released Sunday, tried to calm Cease 
for several minutes. But Cease continued to swing the crutch at the deputies, 
following them closely as they tried to back away, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 After shadowing the officers for 120 feet, Cease lunged at them with the 
crutch, Tubbs said. The officers fired several shots at Cease. It was unclear 
Sunday how many shots were fired or how many struck Cease. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting outraged Cease's mother, who asked why the deputies did not use 
less than deadly force to subdue her son.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't they use Mace or a stun gun?" she asked. "We just don't understand 
why they had to use such measures." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rodriguez said the deputies shot Cease only when they feared he would hurt 
them. "The deputies didn't shoot him when he was 20 feet away or only 10 feet 
away. They shot him when they thought they were going to be stabbed," Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cease saw her son for the last time Saturday when she took his dinner to his 
apartment -- about half a mile from her home in La Crescenta. He had lived 
alone for the past five years, Cease said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cease said she thought her son was on his way to a convenience store when he 
was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 As family and friends comforted Cease, she vowed to look into how law 
enforcement officers handle people with mental illnesses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard a lot of stories about the police shooting mental patients, but I 
never thought it would happen to my son," Cease said.

 About 100 homeless children and their families frolicked in man-made snow, 
received gifts from Santa Claus and watched an exotic bird show at the sixth 
annual Winter Wonderland Christmas party Sunday at the Trudy and Norman Louis 
Valley Shelter in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The party was hosted by Continential Coin of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The company supplied an ice blower that produced 13 tons of snow. An employee 
dressed as Santa distributed dolls, toy trucks and computer sets for the 
children, ranging in age from 2 to 16, said Nat Hutton, the shelter's executive 
director.

DECODING LAPD LINGO A CASE FOR THE DETECTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The computer message between cops on the street was short and to the point: 
One officer said he planned to "kick" a suspect when he got back to the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't suggesting violence, just communicating in the esoteric language of 
the Los Angeles Police Department. "Kicking" a suspect is a good thing from the 
suspect's point of view -- it means that he will be "kicked loose," released 
from custody. 
</P>
<P>
 And how do some cops describe the condition of a suspect or traffic victim who 
is near death? 
</P>
<P>
 "Circling the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's "cop-speak" is unique even by law enforcement standards, a hybrid 
of street slang and military terms mixed with mordant usages passed on through 
generations of police work -- and easy for outsiders to misunderstand. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came out here and took a test, they asked me what a '211' was, or a 
'459,' " said Lt. Nick Zingo, who came to the department from Detroit in 1975. 
"I really thought they were joking. These guys sound just like Jack Webb or 
'Adam-12.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zingo failed the test the first time, but quickly learned the LAPD wasn't 
kidding. If he wanted to work there, he was going to have to learn to talk the 
way cops talk on TV -- because TV writers get that stuff from studying how the 
LAPD talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly 20 years later, Zingo can explain why you will get a room at the 
Gray Bar Motel for a G-ride. And thank your lucky stars that you didn't have a 
gimme and they didn't break out the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 A "gimme" is a pistol -- because they're often seen in the hands of somebody 
saying, "Gimme your money" -- and "the tube" is a police shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kalk, a former police officer and founder of the LAPD Historical 
Society, says many terms and phrases have been coined since he began his career 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Center in Downtown Los Angeles was dubbed the "Glass House" by those 
who wound up there under arrest and the nickname found its way into cop-speak. 
Another slang word common in the 1970s was "honky," a denigrating term for 
white people, which Kalk says was first used by African-American prostitutes to 
describe white customers who honked their car horns to get the women's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "Gray Bar Motel" was the name for the old Lincoln Heights station 
house, Kalk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worked at that station, but I did check in a couple of guests at the 
motel," he laughed. These days, the Gray Bar Motel is a synonym for "the 
bucket," which means jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms used to describe the equipment and services differ from agency to 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Francisco Police Department, for instance, a shotgun is called "the 
gauge," explained Officer Phil Lee, who is assigned to that city's Mission 
Division.  
</P>
<P>
 And when Lee arrests someone, they don't check into the Gray Bar but make a 
little visit to the "company," he said. In San Francisco, traffic tickets are 
referred to as "tags." In Los Angeles, they are known as "greenies," because 
the copy of a traffic citation that the officer keeps is green. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the department, various divisions have different names for the same 
crimes. Other phrases, confined to a single division, describe wardrobe, 
conflicts with the boss or have double meanings for officers who work special 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Andy Voge, an eight-year officer assigned to the Van Nuys station, said 
that when he worked at the 77th Street Division, a stolen car was most often 
called a "G-ride," but in the Valley, the common expression is "hot roller." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to know the codes and you have to know those words and phrases 
because they are part of our language," Voge said. There are drawbacks, he 
noted. "You sometimes have trouble (communicating) when you have to deal with 
other agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD's Metro Division is considered an elite detail made up of some of the 
best and brightest officers on the force, a distinction not lost on those from 
other divisions. Fittingly, there is a clothing ensemble named after the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Metro Tux" is an outfit worn by Metro police officers who visit the bar at 
the training academy on Wednesday night -- payday for cops. It is simple garb, 
consisting of a white T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up or tightened to 
accentuate the biceps, dark blue uniform pants and black patent leather shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what they wear when they're on the make," looking for female cadets, 
officers or guests, said one female officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Paul Lewallen, who heads the unit, says the "tux" is popular only 
because officers in uniform cannot drink, but removing the uniform shirt clears 
the way for them to hoist a glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only way the guys can have a beer after work, but others say it's 
because they are too cheap to buy a real tuxedo," Lewallen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Metro Division expression is the notion of being "in the biz bag," 
which somehow translates into an officer being in the doghouse with management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been there a couple of times," said one officer. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD's Mounted Unit, which is also under the administrative control of the 
Metro Division, transfers words they use to describe their mounts to mean 
different things for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a horse is excited, we say he is 'on the muscle,' " explained Lt. Earl 
Paysinger of the Mounted Unit. "We use the same term to describe a suspect who 
seems hyperactive." 
</P>

LOSING GROUND IN WATER FIGHT; LAS VIRGENES-AREA FARMERS SAY HIGH RATES MAY MEAN 
FALLOW FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just three years ago, George Rosenthal appeared to be on the verge of 
achieving his longtime dream of creating a commercially successful vineyard in 
the rugged Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 His first usable grape crop was in, and Rosenthal envisioned a time when he 
would be able to produce 1,500 cases a year of his Rosenthal The Malibu Estate 
Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
 High on his prospects, he planned to add seven acres to his 12-acre vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, water rates -- which have been steadily increasing over the 
years -- have reached a point where it appears Rosenthal's grape farm will 
never be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he introduced his wine to the market this year, the high water 
costs have dampened his optimism of 1991. And now, instead of expanding the 
200-acre Rancho Escondido, which he manages for Raleigh Enterprises Corp., he 
is cutting back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, to cut water costs, he shut off water to about 500 avocado trees, 
also grown on the land. And he has canceled his plans to expand the vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point you have to look at the economics of this and say, 'This is a 
losing business,' and you have to stop your losses," said Rosenthal, Raleigh 
Enterprises' chief executive officer and president. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of water for agricultural users has become a hot-button issue in 
recent years among growers throughout Southern California. In one area of San 
Diego County, water rates doubled in a three-year period to about $1,000 per 
acre-foot -- or 326,000 gallons -- prompting growers to shut off water to about 
4,000 acres of avocado trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers in the Agoura Hills-Malibu area -- the last farmers left in this part 
of Los Angeles County -- say it's only a matter of time before they, too, are 
put out of business by the high cost of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, according to Rosenthal and other growers, water rates have more 
than doubled for the growers served by the Las Virgenes Municipal Water 
District, a small water retailer in the northwestern portion of Los Angeles 
County. Don Reeder, chairman of the Southern California Agricultural Water 
Team, a growers' lobbying group, said Las Virgenes' agricultural water rates 
are the highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Las Virgenes officials, the agency buys water from its supplier, 
the Metropolitan Water District, for $412 per acre-foot. It sells that same 
water to its half-dozen or so agricultural customers for $1,300 per acre-foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers in eastern Ventura County, by comparison, pay about $380 per 
acre-foot, Rosenthal said.  
</P>
<P>
 The handful of growers served by Las Virgenes are urging the district to do 
away with its four-tier billing system, in which those who use the most water 
are charged significantly more than those who use less. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not looking for subsidies, or free water," said Lewis Rose, office 
administrator for Raleigh Enterprises. "We are just looking for a fair price 
for the water we use." 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of the four-tier system, water district officials argue that it is 
designed to conserve water, not discriminate against growers. Under the method, 
any customer who used that much water would be charged the same rate as the 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials say they sympathize with the growers, but that the growers 
should have considered the scarcity of water before they settled in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The growers argue that, if anything, they should pay less for water because 
they buy it in such large volume. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being penalized for using more water, and that's not fair," said Tami 
Semler, whose family operates a 350-acre avocado ranch on Mulholland Highway, 
just south of Agoura Hills. Last year, the Semlers shut off water to 10% of 
their trees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make a decision at some point in time, whether we let all our 
trees die, or pay $100,000 in water bills to generate $125,000 worth of fruit 
-- and that's not counting labor and other costs," said her father, Ron Semler. 
</P>
<P>
 To help lower the growers' water costs, the district has joined an MWD program 
that offers a $137-per-acre-foot discount for agricultural users. Las Virgenes 
officials stress that this subsidy comes from the MWD, and that they are just 
passing it along. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from that, Las Virgenes officials say there is little else they can do 
to help the growers. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Macneil Stelle, vice president of Las Virgenes' board of directors, said 
that in order to subsidize the growers, the district would have to pass the 
costs along to non-agricultural customers, Stelle said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another problem, Stelle said, is that if growers are subsidized, other 
entities would also want subsidies. The district recently passed an ordinance 
that gives discounts to the Las Virgenes Unified School District in exchange 
for allowing the water district to use classrooms to promote its conservation 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you draw the line?" Stelle said. "It's a lot better not to get into 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Peterson, another water board member, said the district is already 
indirectly subsidizing growers in other parts of the state. "The MWD has to 
charge us more in order to give the growers in San Diego a deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, who also sits on the MWD's board of directors, voted against the 
discount program when it came to a vote. He said he opposes the program because 
it would benefit so few of Las Virgenes' customers. He changed his vote later 
when the matter came before the Las Virgenes board, saying that he would abide 
by the MWD's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he incurred the wrath of area growers when he suggested at a Las Virgenes 
board meeting last summer that he would prefer to see the district offer 
subsidies to golf courses rather than growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all in jest," said Peterson, an avid golfer. "What I really meant 
was, in our area, we have golf courses, and those are viable economic 
enterprises. You really have to look at your priorities. What do you want to 
subsidize? In L. A., they are subsidizing factories, because they provide 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The growers argue that they too provide jobs and stimulate the economy. 
Moreover, they say that they aren't sure that they want the $137 discount, 
because of a stipulation that would require growers to pay substantially more 
for water in drought years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like a real crapshoot," Rose said. "You're taking a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 And even in good years, the discount won't really help, because the cost of 
water will still be prohibitive, said Reeder of the Agricultural Water Team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, $137 off on your $1,300 bill is not that big a deal," he said. 
"You're still in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego-area growers, fed up with high water costs, organized to put 
pressure on the MWD to lower rates to its retailers, said David Owen, executive 
director of the San Diego Farm Bureau, an organization representing growers. 
They were the ones, he said, who persuaded the MWD to offer the $137 discount. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the fourth-largest industry in San Diego County, so we've got lots of 
clout," said Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers in the Agoura Hills / Malibu area -- who represent the few 
agricultural enterprises left in this part of Los Angeles County -- argue that 
if they are put out of business by the high cost of water, it would pave the 
way for development and suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just Las Virgenes, it's a collective thing that's happening 
statewide, and people are very concerned about it," Owen said. "Once you lose 
it, it's gone for good."

SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think teachers have it hard controlling a classroom of rowdy 
teen-agers, consider Alise Cayen. Several Sundays each fall, Cayen vies for the 
attention of 56,000 black-clad, frenzied football fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cayen, a Reseda High School teacher and Los Angeles Raiderette, would not 
have it any other way -- even though she has to juggle schedules and battle 
twin stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers aren't looked at with high regard, but cheerleaders are," said the 
26-year-old Cayen. "It's ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 To balance her dual career, Cayen rises at the crack of dawn to make the trek 
from her South Bay home to Reseda High, where she teaches English, dance and 
career planning. 
</P>
<P>
 After school, she often stays late to work with students. Then, three 
afternoons a week, she dashes from school to Raider headquarters in El Segundo, 
where she spends three grueling hours making the grade in cheerleading practice 
with 42 other Raiderettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I come home from practice at 9:30 or 10 at night and I've got to 
finish grading their homework," said Cayen, who often wears a sweat suit to 
school to make a quicker change to cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 For Raider home games, Cayen reports for duty by 10 a.m. Sundays at the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. After a quick warm-up, she dashes into a makeshift 
dressing room in one of two trailers, emerging in the Raiderettes' trademark 
silver-and-black uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next three hours, Cayen will entertain thousands of fans with 
cheerleading routines she helps lead as co-captain of her 11-woman squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have over 30 routines," said Cayen, whose $60-per-game wage is but a 
fraction of the six-figure salaries commanded by the Raiders themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a routine for everything: touchdown, first down, fumbles, you name 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cayen endures this autumn regimen because of her love of cheerleading, a 
pastime she began in junior high school and continued at Cal State Northridge. 
It was at CSUN that she pursued her other passion, teaching, and earned her 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the Raiderettes in 1988, before graduating. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though all the other Raiderettes have second careers ranging from 
modeling to wine making, Cayen says her biggest challenge on the field and in 
the classroom is battling the "bimbo" stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to get rid of that superficial, shallow cheerleader image, so I 
do my best by letting people know what I do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lesson many of her students have already learned. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought like all the other guys, 'Whoa, I'm going to have a 
cheerleader for a teacher,' " said Patrick Fitzgerald, 15, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of a troublemaker for other teachers, Fitzgerald said a few days in 
Cayen's career-planning class changed his mind and his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other teachers don't care the way she does," Fitzgerald said. "She acts 
cool to me and I'm cool to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Cayen said she's extremely careful about the way she conducts herself around 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them think I'm untouchable because I'm a cheerleader. But teachers 
have to be there for them; that's the hardest part of teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Cayen's balancing act also teaches hope to students from troubled, 
poverty-stricken homes who worry about just making it through school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing she's a cheerleader and a teacher has inspired me," said Cherice 
Wilson, 15, a sophomore from Canoga Park who is considering cheerleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says, 'If you want it, go for it.' "

3 HURT AS CAR STRIKES POLE, CYCLIST HITS DOWNED LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A motorcyclist was injured Sunday in the aftermath of a traffic accident in 
which a car ran off the road and knocked down a telephone pole, authorities 
said. Two people in the car were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 8:22 a.m. when the auto went off the west side of 
Bouquet Canyon Road and sheared off the pole, said Capt. Mike Flocks of the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, one of two motorcycle riders coming from the opposite direction 
was knocked off his bike when he ran into the power lines across the road, 
Flocks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both people in the car were airlifted to area hospitals, said Jeff Ziegler, a 
fire dispatcher. One victim was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills. The other was transported to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle rider was taken to Newhall Memorial by ambulance, Flocks said.

<P>
 Two Compton men were killed and a third escaped uninjured in a car crash early 
Sunday on the Antelope Valley Freeway east of Agua Dulce, California Highway 
Patrol officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldo Lujan, 22, and Eliazar Quintero, 22, were killed when Lujan lost control 
of their vehicle about 3 a.m. while driving south on the freeway near Escondido 
Canyon Road, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car hit the center divider, overturned and rolled, ejecting Lujan and 
Quintero, who was a passenger in the back seat. Raymundo Morales, also 22, from 
Compton, was riding in the front seat and was not hurt, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three men in the car were wearing seat belts, officers said.

CARJACKER FREES GIRL, 13, DURING WILD RIDE; CRIME: GUNMAN STEALS TWO CARS, 
CRASHES INTO PARKED VEHICLES AND FIRES AT TWO PEOPLE BEFORE ESCAPING ON FOOT IN

 A 13-year-old girl was released uninjured after a short but wild ride with a 
carjacker who stole her family's car as she sat in the back seat, Los Angeles 
police said Sunday.

the girl in tow -- the carjacker wrecked several cars and shot at two people 
before he fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started at 11 p.m. Saturday when the gunman shot out the right 
front window of the car parked in the 12800 block of Filmore Street as the girl 
was waiting inside the car for family members visiting a nearby residence, 
Police Sgt. Al Yarbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't look at me," the gunman reportedly told her as he pointed a 
small-caliber revolver and demanded the keys, Yarbrough said.  
</P>
<P>
 The gunman -- believed to be in his 20s with a shaved head and wearing a 
Raiders football jacket -- drove off with the girl in the car. But less than 
two blocks away, he crashed into a parked car, Yarbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacker got out to check for damage and fired several shots that missed 
a man who had witnessed the accident from his front yard, Yarbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then pointed the gun at the girl, demanded her jewelry and let her go. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarbrough said the gunman got back into the car and sped away, only to smash 
into another parked car a few blocks away. He fled on foot from the accident to 
Woodcock Avenue near Davenport Street in Pacoima and jumped into another car 
parked in the driveway of a home. 
</P>
<P>
 When the owner heard the engine start, she ran outside. The gunman fired six 
shots at her, but missed. He damaged the carport as he backed out of the 
driveway, Yarbrough said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spree ended when the vehicle's transmission failed, Yarbrough said. The 
gunman, who was still at large Sunday, abandoned the car and fled on foot, he 
said.

RACING AHEAD; SHELLEY BEATTIE USES TRUE GRIT TO LAND SPOT ON FIRST ALL-FEMALE 
AMERICA'S CUP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Viewers of the "American Gladiators" television show probably look on Shelley 
Beattie with envy. As "Siren," one of the show's muscular competitors who 
battle contestants in feats of strength and skill, she seemingly has it all -- 
the physique of a champion bodybuilder, the looks to attract an audience and 
the determination to be a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Beattie, a Malibu resident, is turning heads on the sailing circuit. 
Despite having no previous sailing experience, she has secured a spot on the 
first all-female sailing team to compete for yacht racing's pinnacle -- the 
144-year-old America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 She will be aboard America3, one of three U.S. yachts entered in the 
competition, which gets under way Jan. 12 in San Diego. She has been designated 
one of five "grinders" -- crew members who use muscle power to raise, lower and 
change the direction of sails that measure 4,500 square feet and develop 
several thousand pounds of pressure in strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie's achievements are impressive in themselves, but her background makes 
them remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 6, doctors found she had a hearing problem. Now, at 26, she's 
nearly 100% hearing-impaired. Her parents, unable to cope with her difficult 
teen-age years, put her in foster care, where she languished in three homes 
with no special provisions for her disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Though often confused and alone during those years, Beattie emerged from a 
shell of shyness and began using her disability as a motivation for winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get put down so much growing up that you acquire a survival instinct," 
she says. "Don't tell me I can't, because I will show you I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie has exhibited such grit from an early age. Blessed as a natural 
athlete who found security in sports, she excelled in track in high school and 
later developed an interest in weightlifting. She wound up on the professional 
bodybuilding circuit and in 1990 won the USA Champion contest. She went on to 
earn titles in the Ms. International and Ms. Olympia competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 That led in 1992 to her most visible role -- that of the muscular, 
supercharged "Siren" on "American Gladiators." Typically dressed in a 
red-white- and-blue spandex outfit that reveals every sinewy line on her 
5-foot-7, 150-pound body, she competes against both genders -- effortlessly, it 
seems -- climbing a 35-foot wall, suspended 20 feet in the air from a harness 
or sparring with a pugil stick from a seven-foot-high platform. 
</P>
<P>
 During her third season of taping "American Gladiators," Beattie's husband and 
manager, Jon Romano, heard about openings for America's Cup crew members and 
encouraged her to apply, despite her lack of yachting experience. "He believes 
in me probably more than I do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With an open slot in her schedule -- after completing the "American 
Gladiators" season and before promoting her new Gold's Gym facility in Puerto 
Vallarta, Mexico, which is under construction -- she decided to take her 
husband's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nowhere near what I thought I'd be doing next," Beattie said of the 
America's Cup competition. "It just came up and I grabbed the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as easy at that, however. Beattie was merely one of 600 women 
athletes who applied for a chance to participate in sailing's greatest event. 
She knew it was a long shot, akin to a second-string running back trying out 
for a spot in the backfield of a Super Bowl team. But she made it into the 
group of 50 invited to three grueling, weeklong tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 When the team lineup was announced last June, Beattie's name was on the list 
with 25 others whose backgrounds included sailing, weightlifting and rowing. 
Sixteen team members are on the yacht at any one time, with 10 reserves. As a 
grinder, Beattie will always be on board. 
</P>
<P>
 After taping the final "American Gladiators" segment for the 1994 season, she 
left Malibu for training camp in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 As taxing as the tryouts were, the struggle in many respects had just begun 
when Beattie arrived at camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie first had to learn the basics of seamanship. A native of rural 
Monmouth, Ore., her exposure to the sea was limited before she moved to 
Southern California after graduating from Western Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned yachting skills and was coached in the mechanics of being a 
grinder. That job revolves around a pedestal winch, which provides the 
mechanical power needed to pull in a series of boa constrictor-sized lines used 
to control the sails. With arms rotating like a bicyclist's legs, she may 
perform the task more than 100 times during a tacking duel against an opposing 
yacht. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort is comparable to sprinting 50 meters on a track 30 times, with 20 
seconds' rest between each sprint," said grinder Stephanie Armitage Johnson, a 
world-class weightlifter and assistant strength coach for the University of 
Washington football team. Armitage Johnson is one of Beattie's grinding 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that doesn't include the daily gym workouts, beginning at 6:30 a.m., to 
improve strength and endurance. Then there are the long days on the water, the 
labor-intensive chores that include stripping the $5-million, 75-foot racing 
machine of its electronic gear and enormous sails -- it requires at least eight 
women to carry a sail -- and the seemingly endless team meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The team aspect proved most difficult for Beattie. From her early days as a 
bodybuilder, she had been a solo competitor, depending only on herself for 
success. Though she earns points for a team during "American Gladiators" shows, 
she, like the other gladiators, takes on opponents one-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
 For a hearing person who has never been on a team, suddenly becoming part of a 
group effort is difficult enough. For a hearing-impaired person it is still 
harder, because teamwork involves communication among the group's members. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated because her hearing impairment made it difficult to understand the 
game plan, Beattie nearly quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going crazy holding in so much anger -- I want to like people and want 
them to help me understand what's going on," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she found ways to cope. She asked the coaching staff to provide her with a 
sign language translator for team meetings. She has also begun teaching 
teammates to communicate with her through touching and gestures -- especially 
her grinding partners, who help Beattie respond at the appropriate time with 
hand signals and facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie's efforts and attitude have not gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said teammate Amy Baltzell, who has become Beattie's close friend: "It is such 
an honor to work with someone who not only has to struggle with a hearing 
impairment but is an incredible athlete with such love in her heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Beattie has contributed to the success of the team, which in 
November placed second in the 1994 International America's Cup Class World 
Championship. Along with the winning team from Australia, the regatta attracted 
all-male teams from the United States, Japan and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant than placing second, America3 beat the other two U.S. cup 
contenders, including the Stars and Stripes, skippered by three-time America's 
Cup winner Dennis Conner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Worlds gave us confidence," said Beattie, who now considers herself a 
sailor after having logged hundreds of hours on waters off San Diego Bay. "The 
guys have more respect for us now." 
</P>
<P>
 So do her fans. 
</P>
<P>
 One day recently two friends, also deaf, arrived from Los Angeles to watch 
Beattie train with the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fortunate that there are deaf people like Shelley," says Jennifer 
Thompson, who relies on sign language to communicate. She met Beattie four 
years ago while in-line skating at Venice Beach and considers her "a great role 
model." 
</P>
<P>
 With the trials just weeks away, the team is now training 12 hours a day, 
seven days a week to prepare for the 1995 America's Cup race. Bodies are tired 
and nerves are frayed, but Beattie and her teammates say they are determined to 
win the America's Cup, especially for Bill Koch, the multimillionaire and 
former America's Cup winner who founded the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know he believes in us -- we're his family," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch, who won the cup in 1992, is proud of Beattie and calls her impact on the 
team a "net plus." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has some sort of disadvantage; it's just not as obvious as being 
deaf or blind," he said. "Shelley's deafness is offset by her determination, 
physical ability and good attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Beattie says, she finds it rewarding to break new ground for 
women, for the hearing-impaired -- and for herself. Said Beattie: "I feel that 
I'm growing as a person and learning for the first time to accept myself in 
front of others."

MALIBU SEEKS BEACH UPKEEP FUNDS; RECREATION: CITY MAY TURN TO PRIVATE 
BUSINESSES OR THE STATE. THE PLAN IS PART OF A DEAL WHEREBY THE COUNTY WOULD 
PAY $2.9 MILLION TO RENOVATE THE DETERIORATED PIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Malibu officials are exploring ways to raise $125,000 a year for maintenance 
of Surfrider Beach as part of a deal under which the city would receive $2.9 
million in county funds for renovation of the Malibu Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu City Council last month rejected a proposal by former County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman to use city funds to cover the yearly $125,000 
maintenance cost. Malibu city staff was subsequently directed to initiate 
negotiations with the state and county to seek alternative sources for the 
funds. The council plans to revisit the issue in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do everything we can do to find a way to get that $3 million 
to the pier," said Mayor Jeffrey W. Kramer. "It is one of our most visible 
landmarks. We do know that we can't take money from our ($7 million) General 
Fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the alternatives under consideration are soliciting the business 
community for the maintenance cost or attempting to raise the amount through 
private donations, Kramer said. Another possibility is forging a deal with the 
state to channel a percentage of the pier's revenues from concessionaires and 
parking to cover beach maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The details are still being worked out," said Malibu City Manager David N. 
Carmany. "It's like a forward pass in football; there are a number of potential 
different outcomes. Word I hear from my colleagues in other cities is that 
piers cost money, they don't make money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu Township Council, a community group that spearheaded Malibu's 
cityhood movement more than three years ago, has advocated culling the money 
from rents generated by businesses on the state-owned pier. The group also has 
proposed creating a nonprofit organization to raise funds to maintain the 
dilapidated pier and establish a marine museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Current stores on the pier are a bait-and-tackle shop, a sport-fishing 
business and Alice's Restaurant. The state tried to evict Alice's Restaurant, a 
Malibu dining institution since 1972 and the pier's main concessionaire, for 
unpaid back rent, but the restaurant failed to vacate. The state, in turn, sued 
Japedemy Inc., the restaurant's owner. A trial is scheduled for Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Yuro, a co-owner of the restaurant, has claimed in the past that he has 
withheld rent because the state reneged on a promise to apply rents to renovate 
the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to provide $2.9 million to renovate the pier was part of a 
complicated deal brokered by Edelman during his final County Board of 
Supervisors meeting on Dec. 1. Edelman ushered through three proposals, 
estimated at more than $7 million, to improve Westside beaches, all within his 
Third District. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition A funds, approved by voters two years ago for the improvement of 
county parks and open spaces, will be used to pay for the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining funds, an estimated $1.5 million will go for construction and 
repair of facilities at Venice Beach, and about $3 million will be used for 
renovation and construction of facilities at Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the Malibu Pier is owned by the state, Edelman had to find a legal 
way to get around a requirement that county funds be spent only on county 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman proposed a deal in which the state would lease the 89-year-old pier to 
the county, and the pier would be maintained by the city of Malibu.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PILOT RECALLS BLACKBIRD'S 1ST FLIGHT; 
AVIATION: HUNDREDS HONOR 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HISTORIC EVENT OVER PALMDALE. 
THE AIRPLANE WILL BE REVIVED IN NEW DEFENSE BUDGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In his mind's eye, Robert Gilliland can still see the sky above Palmdale that 
day 30 years ago, clear but for one little cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers too that he was only slightly nervous. After all, he had flown 
fighter jets during the Korean War and was a test pilot for years before he 
ever sat in the cockpit of this new plane, a Blackbird. 
</P>
<P>
 If worse came to worst, he would simply eject and parachute to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Dec. 22, 1964, Gilliland was alone in an SR-71 Blackbird and piloted the 
then-secret plane on its maiden flight, which began and ended at Air Force 
Plant 42 in Palmdale and saw Gilliland pilot the craft at 1 1/2 times the speed 
of sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky to be here, lucky to be alive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, hundreds of people converged on Blackbird Airpark at Plant 42 to 
mark the 30th anniversary of the first flight of the SR-71 and another, lesser 
known reconnaissance craft, the M-21/D-21 combination, built by Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing it for pilots, crew members, people associated with the program," 
Blackbird Airpark Manager Doug Nelson said of the celebration. "The only time 
they get any recognition is among themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 "The SR-71's an amazing airplane," said Greg Welsh, a Burbank resident who was 
visiting Blackbird Airpark for the first time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 20 years, the SR-71 gathered "vital intelligence information," 
said Tom Pugh, a retired Air Force colonel who lives in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information they provided was used by our national authorities to develop 
the Cold War strategy," he said. "The airplane and its capability was a very 
significant contributor to ending the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Blackbird was retired, a move Gilliland at the time called an 
"egregious error." But the 1995 defense bill provides $100 million to revive 
the program and return three of the planes to the Air Force's operational 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Pete Drinkwater, commander of Plant 42, said Lockheed will begin next 
month to prepare three SR-71s for a return to service. The Air Force, he said, 
will use them for reconnaissance work as well as research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherm Mullin, who recently retired as president of Lockheed Advanced 
Development Co., said the SR-71 remains the "highest performance airplane in 
the history of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "It still holds three of the most important absolute records in aviation 
history," he said. The Blackbird holds an altitude record of 85,069 feet and 
speed records on closed and open courses that exceed 2,000 mph. 
</P>
<P>
 The D-21, on the other hand, holds no such records. It was an unmanned, 
disposable drone designed to gather reconnaissance information after being 
released at a high speed and high altitude by another aircraft, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret program, he said, was canceled after a fatal mishap during one of 
the test launches: The drone crashed into the mother ship just after release 
and one of the two crewmen was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the D-21 was reconfigured to be dropped from a B-52 bomber, but even 
then it was not widely used before the program was abandoned in 1970, Pugh 
said.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: MCGRAW, CHATMAN STILL JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These should be the best of times for Brendan McGraw and Charles Chatman. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the two running backs terrorized Pacific Coast League opponents all 
season, piling up numbers virtually unmatched in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, of Laguna Hills High, rushed for a county-best 2,511 yards (7.7 yards 
per carry) and scored 42 touchdowns. He had 277 yards and six touchdowns in the 
season opener against Sonora, then gained 265 yards and six touchdowns in the 
first half of the Laguna Beach game. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Chatman averaged 9.5 yards per carry in amassing 2,500 yards and 
29 touchdowns. Included in that total was his 43-carry, 414-yard performance 
against Aliso Niguel, four yards short of the county single-game record. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, neither McGraw (6-1, 187) nor Chatman (5-10, 175) played running 
back full-time as juniors -- both were wide receivers, and Chatman started at 
cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies part of the reason the phones are silent in the McGraw and 
Chatman homes. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no preseason recognition and questions looming about each 
player's speed, major college recruiters have all but ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
 Major college coaches put a premium on speed for their skill-position players. 
McGraw and Chatman are considered in the 4.6 range over 40 yards, short of the 
preferred 4.4 and 4.5 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, McGraw's two scholarship offers so far are from Division I-AA schools 
Boston University -- where former Laguna Hills quarterback Justin Vedder 
recently finished his freshman season as a redshirt -- and Villanova. Army also 
is interested, as are are California and San Diego State, though neither has 
offered a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman, also an outstanding baseball player who could be drafted in June, has 
had some contact from Oregon. Others showing interest include San Diego State, 
New Mexico, San Diego, St. Mary's and Villanova. Amazingly, all of the schools 
are recruiting him as a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep hearing questions about Charles' speed, but I never saw anyone catch 
him from behind," Costa Mesa Coach Myron Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan believe their star players will 
receive scholarships, though the firm offers might not come till next month as 
colleges await word from their "first-choice" prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brendan has as good a pair of hands as any kid I've coached," says Bresnahan, 
a former assistant at Long Beach State who has been in the business 23 years. 
"The right place for him is a school that will use him both as a running back 
and a receiver coming out of the backfield. He's only reached about 60% of his 
potential." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Coach Myron Miller says running back-outside linebacker Dwayne 
Crenshaw (6-1, 200), who missed part of his senior season because of injuries 
but still rushed for 879 yards (8.7 yards per carry), is a can't-miss college 
prospect. Crenshaw, who needs to improve his grades, could wind up at Golden 
West, where former Costa Mesa defensive coordinator Alex Henderson has taken 
over as head coach. Crenshaw has 4.5 speed and is a dedicated weightlifter. 
Before his senior year, he had drawn interest from every school in the Pac-10. 
Miller expects him to be a 220-pound outside linebacker in college. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA update: Having already received an oral commitment from tackle Gene 
Waters (6-7, 295) of Walla Walla (Wash.) Community College, the Bruins are 
hoping to sign another highly recruited community college player: tight end 
Greg Clark (6-5, 250), a first-team J.C. Grid-Wire All-American from Ricks 
College in Rexburg, Idaho. Clark, 22, who spent two years on a Mormon church 
mission, has narrowed his choices to UCLA and Stanford. He also visited Arizona 
State and Ohio State, and canceled a trip to Brigham Young. UCLA Coach Terry 
Donahue visited Clark, a punishing blocker who also caught 40 passes last 
season, at his parents' home in Bountiful, Utah, during the weekend. Wednesday 
is the first day community college players can sign letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has commitments from two high school standouts: Los Alamitos wide 
receiver Brad Melsby (6-1, 183) and Santa Margarita tackle Kris Farris (6-9, 
275), both first-team All-Orange County selections by The Times. The Bruins are 
awaiting word from Brock Huard (6-5, 215) of Puyallup, Wash., rated the premier 
quarterback prospect in the country by most college coaches and talent 
evaluators. Huard, a straight-A student and standout basketball player, has 
taken recruiting trips to UCLA, Pittsburgh, Stanford and Washington, where he 
spent last weekend. He has eliminated Pitt and, from all indications, is now 
trying to decide between the hometown Huskies and UCLA. How does Huard feel 
about in-state expectations that he should follow the lead of his brother, 
Washington junior quarterback Damon Huard? "I'm not going to run away from the 
idea," he says, "but I'm also not going to fulfill other people's expectations 
for me. I'll go with what my heart says. It'll be my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Add UCLA: The Bruins are heavy favorites to sign inside linebacker Mike Wiley 
(6-3, 230) of Gardena Serra. Wiley was credited with 176 total tackles last 
season. He visited Arizona last weekend and is scheduled to take a trip to 
Colorado State in January, but says he will "most likely" sign with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Williams (6-3, 240) of Hawthorne Leuzinger, one of the top linebacker 
prospects in the country, also visited Arizona last weekend. He has January 
trips planned to USC (the favorite), Notre Dame and Nebraska, and says his 
fifth visit will be to UCLA, Michigan or Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 More USC: The Trojans, preparing for the Jan. 2 Cotton Bowl, played host to 
some top high school prospects over the weekend. Among those making recruiting 
visits were highly touted running back Ricky Williams (6-1, 200) of San Diego 
Patrick Henry; linebacker-fullback Lester Towns (6-3, 235) of Pasadena High; 
wide receiver Windrell Hayes (5-11, 185) of Stockton, and Dallas Carter 
cornerback Damian Hill (6-3, 180), a cousin of former Texas A&M and current 
Kansas City Chiefs' running back Greg Hill. In addition, several community 
college standouts were on campus -- honorable-mention All-American linebacker 
Jason Nevadomsky (6-2, 230) of Fullerton; Rashee Johnson (6-0, 180), a 
first-team All-American from City College of San Francisco, and wide receiver 
Chris Miller (5-11, 180) of West L.A. Miller, who played at Dorsey High and is 
a cousin of Trojan wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, probably will sign with USC 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous weekend, USC's lone recruit was quarterback Mike Bastianelli 
(6-1, 180) of Concord De LaSalle, which finished the season ranked second in 
the country by a national panel of sportswriters (Mater Dei was third). Cal is 
recruiting Bastianelli as a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Southland's top offensive line prospects, guard James Sherman (6-3, 
260) of Whittier High, has committed to Nebraska. He had been high on USC's 
wish list. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, desperate for a tight end who can play next season, has received a 
commitment from Derek Hubbard (6-3, 215) of Fresno City College, a second-team 
All-American. The Cardinal also has commitments from cornerback Greg Hairston 
of Glendale (Ariz.) College; guard Mike McLaughlin (6-5, 260) of San Jose, 
considered one of the premier offensive line prospects in the state, and 
linebacker Sharcus Steen (6-1, 240) of Etiwanda High. In addition, Stanford 
will add a talented transfer, fullback Jon Ritchie (6-2, 235), who played his 
first two seasons at Michigan after being heavily recruited out of 
Mechanicsburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the state's top community college quarterback prospects -- Jim 
Arellanes (6-4, 210) of L.A. Valley, Cody Smith (6-3, 235) of Mt. San Antonio 
and Steve Sarkisian (6-2, 200) of El Camino -- have each made oral commitments 
to Western Athletic Conference schools. Arellanes, who passed for 426 yards and 
five touchdowns in his team's 36-28 Green Bowl victory over Rancho Santiago, 
will attend Fresno State; Smith, who started his college career at Pacific, 
plans to sign with San Diego State, and Sarkisian, who passed for an astounding 
637 yards and four touchdowns in a 59-48 loss to College of the Desert in the 
SoCal Bowl, committed to Brigham Young last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 news: Rose Bowl-bound Oregon, which received a commitment from 
offensive lineman Josh Beckett (6-5, 305) of Santa Margarita last week, is 
hoping lightning will strike twice in Orange County. The Ducks were host over 
the weekend to Times all-county lineman Jason Grain (6-5, 270) of Sonora. Grain 
also has visited Arizona State, and has trips planned to USC and UCLA in 
January. One Pac-10 assistant called Grain the top offensive line prospect in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes' favorite receiver, first-team All-American Brian Comer (5-11, 180), 
has committed to Cal. The Bears also have commitments from guard John Romero 
(6-3, 275) of Berkeley and safety Pete Destafano (6-3, 200) of San Jose. A Cal 
assistant noticed Destafano only recently while scouting another player on 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Cal: The Bears are the favorites to sign one of the state's top high 
school quarterbacks, Tom Brady (6-4, 200) of San Mateo. Brady visited Cal last 
weekend, and has a trip scheduled to UCLA in January. He has also been to 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Isaiah Mustafa (6-3, 210) of Moorpark College, who had been 
recruited by UCLA before the Bruins decided not to offer a scholarship, has 
committed to Arizona State.

JACK SMITH: ADVICE FROM THE HOME(SPUN) FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, the women of the Pasadena Art Alliance created a little book 
called "All Things Wise and Wonderful." It was a collection of quaint remedies 
for such household problems as how to revive lettuce or crisp celery. 
</P>
<P>
 Its homespun advice was interspersed with sometimes cynical aphorisms such as 
Cornelia Otis Skinner's remark that women's virtue is man's greatest invention, 
and Dorothy Parker's, "There was nothing more fun than a man." 
</P>
<P>
 The book sold 150,000 copies. Now a sequel called "More Things Wise and 
Wonderful" sprinkles advice from how to remove stains from suede shoes (rub 
with white bread) to how to keep vases and urns from falling over (fill with 
dried beans or buckshot). 
</P>
<P>
 Houses that have been lived in for 10 years or more will have most of the 
required remedies somewhere in the backs of cupboards. For example, use hair 
spray to stabilize pastel and pencil drawings; to preserve a cherished 
newspaper clipping, dissolve a milk of magnesia tablet in a quart of club soda 
overnight. (It doesn't say what to do next or whether you have to drink the 
mixture.) 
</P>
<P>
 One piece of advice that I will never try is: "Use dental floss and a darning 
needle to sew up a turkey." 
</P>
<P>
 A slightly offbeat tip is that dill steeped in wine breaks the spell of 
witches and is an ancient aphrodisiac. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an easy one: "To make scrambled eggs fluffy, add a little carbonated 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one that sounds as if it might lead to carnage: "For red wine stain, 
stretch soiled area of tablecloth or napkin over sink and pour boiling water 
through from a height of a least two or three feet, the more force the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one that sounds rather impractical, but I would certainly like to see 
it done: "To avoid holes in the toes of your sandal-foot pantyhose, put on 
carefully, step onto a paper towel, and spray the feet with hair spray." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of useful philosophy is offered by Judith Viorst: "Strength is the 
capacity to break a chocolate bar into four pieces in your bare hands and then 
just eat one of the pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Here and there through the book are warnings against overindulging. "Many a 
man has gone to his sarcophagus by what he put down his esophagus" -- 
Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 "A full belly makes a dull brain" -- Ben Franklin. (Pictures of Ben seem to 
dispute his aphorism.) 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wish to grow thinner diminish your dinner" -- H.S. Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an easy one I've never heard of: "Sharpen scissors by cutting a piece 
of sandpaper two or three times." What do you do with leftover strips of 
sandpaper? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one I don't understand at all: "If you have lost the cork to a 
partially full champagne bottle, hang a spoon upside down in the bottle. (The 
spoon doesn't have to touch the liquid.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Then what? 
</P>
<P>
 My advice on losing the cork to a champagne bottle: Drink the champagne before 
it gets warm. A much more difficult problem is how to get the cork out of a 
champagne bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cynical quote, with perhaps some truth in it: "Rembrandt painted about 
700 works of art; of these 3,000 are in existence" -- Wilhelm Bode. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous tips on how to preserve cut flowers: "Sprinkle gardenias 
with table salt and refrigerate. Don't touch petals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosebuds will open faster if a lump of sugar is placed in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 "A piece of charcoal placed in the water of an arrangement will keep it 
sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 An obvious truth is expressed in a quote from Samuel Johnson: "A man is in 
general better pleased when he has a good dinner on his table than when his 
wife talks Greek." 
</P>
<P>
 Scratches on dark wood may be camouflaged by covering with iodine or shoe 
polish. For light wood, use the meat of a walnut or pecan. 
</P>
<P>
 I was especially pleased to read that sticky zippers will slide easily if 
rubbed with a lead pencil. To avoid embarrassment, one must remember to carry a 
lead pencil at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an interesting piece of advice, but one I probably won't use: "Do not 
buy more than six to eight weeks supply of snail bait. Change brand from time 
to time for better effect." Oh, I'll use part of the tip. I won't buy more than 
six to eight weeks of snail bait. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one I'm sure my wife can try: 'Water hanging pots inside house by 
placing a few ice cubes in pot. Melts slowly and does not drip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beer, particularly ale, is excellent food for flower beds." If I catch my 
wife pouring my beer on her flower beds, it won't do her any good to "talk 
Greek." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is $10, Visa or Mastercard OK. Send to Pasadena Art Alliance, 145 N. 
Raymond Avenue, Pasadena, Calif. 91103. The alliance is a nonprofit 
organization to promote the arts.

 Meanwhile, go easy on the snail bait. Jack Smith's column is published

IT'S NOT A TABOO TOPIC IN SOME SCHOOLS; SEX EDUCATION: DESPITE THE CONTROVERSY 
OVER JOYCELYN ELDERS, SOME TEACHERS ALREADY TALK ABOUT MASTURBATION. AND 
ABSTINENCE. AND ABORTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Joycelyn Elders should have come to California before she opened her 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon general was fired earlier this month, ostensibly because she said 
masturbation is "something that perhaps should be taught" in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, it often is. 
</P>
<P>
 State guidelines for sex education suggest that teachers talk about 
masturbation "in such a way as to dispel common myths associated with it . . . 
sterility, blindness, or feeble-mindedness." 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of the more controversial subjects students are exposed to when they 
go to sex education class in some Southern California schools these days. The 
courses cover everything from abstinence to zygotes. At some schools there are 
lectures about abortion, condoms and relationships. Under state law, however, 
public schools must stress abstinence as the best defense against HIV, 
pregnancy and tangled relations. "Abstinence," says a Laguna Beach 
middle-school teacher, "is the first and foremost thing we teach." 
</P>
<P>
 The state guidelines are optional, but many schools in Southern California 
deal with masturbation because students ask about it. And the answer is often 
that masturbation is normal -- and it won't kill you. But educators stop short 
of including masturbation as part of the formal curriculum -- or encouraging it 
as a form of abstinence. "There is no physical harm, but there should be no 
judgment about it really," says Ruth Rich, health adviser at the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of lurid talk or scare-charged black-and-white reels, sex ed today is 
a journey into biology, chemistry and illustrations of human innards. At Walter 
Reed Middle School in North Hollywood, seventh-graders recently reiterated the 
rules of sex ed class: "There's no dumb question," says one. "Use scientific 
terms instead of slang," says another. Teacher Cathy Golliher, who helped write 
the districtwide guidelines for sex ed, adds another rule: "We're going to stay 
away from the personal level." 
</P>
<P>
 According to SIECUS, the Sex Information and Education Council of the United 
States, 47 states require or recommend sex education. And at least 10 states, 
SIECUS says, have guidelines asking schools to address masturbation during sex 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, the private Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences teaches 
older students about masturbation ("that it's not going to kill them and that 
most people do it," an administrator says), homosexuality and intimate 
relationships. "We do it all," says Tom Nolan, dean of students. "We encourage 
kids to wait, but we also teach contraception." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several middle schools across Southern California are home to ENABL (Education 
Now and Babies Later), a state-funded class for seventh-graders that includes 
role-playing aimed to deflate sexual peer pressure. "Postponing sexual 
involvement is really the intent," says Gail Sass Buckley, head of a pregnancy 
counseling center charged with teaching ENABL classes in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many sex education programs in Southern California are part of science, health 
and modern living courses, and start at the middle-school level, about the time 
preteens reach puberty. Many -- including those at L.A. city schools -- also 
require parental consent; without it, students sit out the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 State guidelines recommend that serious sex talk start somewhere between 
grades six and nine. In L.A. city schools, birds-and-bees instruction -- 
including abstinence and contraception -- starts in grade seven with about 
three weeks' worth. More instruction comes in the 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Diego Unified School District, the eighth-largest in the nation, 
teachers start talking about sex to sixth-graders. Girls get the menstruation 
speech in the fifth. And from then until high school graduation, students get 
taught about AIDS for one hour a year. And when sex is the topic from eighth 
grade on up, San Diego schools don't ask parents for permission. "We do not 
need permission," says district sex ed expert Marge Kleinsmith. She adds: "All 
sex ed materials are approved by an advisory committee of parents, educators 
and physicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of sex education -- many of whom agree with Elders -- say more 
classroom time is better. Private researcher Marvin Eisen tracked 1,500 
teen-agers in California and Texas during the late '80s and found that the more 
sex education students had, the more likely they were to abstain or use 
contraception. "Good sex education programs," he says, "can have a good 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Educators argue that sex education is important in an era when more students 
are having sex. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a sexuality research 
group in New York City, teen birth rates have stopped growing but are still 
high. But more than 1 million teen-agers become pregnant each year -- and those 
who do have babies are very likely to be poor and unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, educators complain that they don't have enough time to teach 
reproductive basics. The community piles on extra helpings of curricula every 
year -- from the back-to-basics movement to computer science -- and sex ed 
suffers, says Rich of L.A. Unified. "We're seeing less and less time for it," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich says the district's sex education now has to be bolstered by special 
grants from the state -- grants for special programs such as ENABL that don't 
reach all the city's schoolchildren. In San Diego, sex ed -- with the exception 
of elementary school courses and AIDS education -- was cut two years ago. Now 
some eighth-graders have a private grant to thank for their sex education. 
"Much of the cuts are due to politics, as you're well aware," says San Diego's 
Kleinsmith. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she argues, "kids are not taking care of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say schools should stay out of sex ed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religion, sex education -- all these controversial things should be taught by 
the mom and dad," says Susan Carpenter McMillan, president of a conservative 
group called the Woman's Coalition. "Masturbation is for mommy and daddy to 
teach about." 
</P>
<P>
 But experts say parents don't like sex talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "If parents talked to kids, then these issues wouldn't be so powerful and 
their kids would be getting the message they want and they wouldn't have to go 
to school to get it," says psychologist Gail L. Zellman, a youth specialist at 
Rand, the Santa Monica research institute. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the reason sex in schools is such a controversial topic -- why 
surgeon generals get fired and school boards get booted -- is that "we're a 
culture that's based in puritanical precepts with the belief that we should 
keep our feelings in check."

FOR TWO SMITHSONIAN CURATORS, THE ENOLA GAY'S MISSION LAUNCHED THE NIGHTMARE OF 
THE NUCLEAR AGE. TO WWII VETERANS, DROPPING THE BOMB SAVED U.S. LIVES. THEIR 
CONFLICT OVER A COMMEMORATIVE EXHIBIT SPARKED THE MUSEUM'S RETREAT AND A 
BITTER...; WAR OF WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shrink-wrapped, wingless and with its tail section missing, the Enola Gay lies 
silently amid the debris of museum construction, like a beached whale awaiting 
its fate. 
</P>
<P>
 When fully assembled, the most famous bomber aircraft of World War II is 99 
feet long and has a 144-foot wingspan. It is simply too big and too heavy to be 
displayed in one piece in a museum. Even one as cavernous as the Smithsonian 
Institution's Air and Space Museum on the Mall here. 
</P>
<P>
 So only the front fuselage of the Enola Gay sits behind locked and guarded 
doors in a closed-off museum gallery, while curators slowly -- and now 
cautiously -- build an exhibit around the B-29 to tell its story. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have cleared an entire area of the main hall and just had room 
enough to display the Enola Gay with its wings on, but it's so heavy it still 
would have gone right through the floor into the parking garage below," says 
museum spokesman Mike Fetters. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a nice bit of symbolism for the implosion that's hit the Enola Gay's 
exhibit as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months before the scheduled May, 1995, opening of the most controversial 
exhibit ever staged at America's most popular museum, the emotion-soaked debate 
over the plane and its display has already become so politically charged and so 
weighted down by personal recriminations that the Smithsonian has been forced 
into retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Under unprecedented public pressure, the museum has drastically altered its 
original plans for its exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of the Enola Gay's 
only mission: the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, on 
Aug. 6, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a victory for American heritage over the forces of political 
correctness and revisionism. Or call it the triumph of uneducated censorship 
over legitimate historical inquiry. No matter your point of view, one thing is 
clear: The Smithsonian has all but surrendered to the veterans groups and other 
critics who loudly opposed the museum's initial exhibit plans on the grounds 
that they were wildly anti-American and laden with the scent of political 
correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after five revisions and a series of arduous, line-by-line editing 
sessions between the museum staff and representatives of leading veterans 
groups, the museum has produced a final script for the proposed Enola Gay 
exhibit, "The Last Act: The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II," that has 
been cleansed of most of its controversy. The language that had tarred it as 
being a product of political correctness run amok has been thoroughly excised 
from the script. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian's about-face has been so complete, in fact, that the greatest 
outcry against the exhibit now comes from liberal historians sickened by what 
they see as the triumph of the personal memory and nostalgia of American 
veterans over clear-eyed history of the U.S. decision to drop the atom bomb.  
</P>
<P>
 "The museum has caved in to right-wing political pressure," argues Kai Bird, a 
World War II historian. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing victory, meanwhile, veterans groups continue to press for even further 
changes to the organization of the exhibit, arguing that the curators still 
hope to play "emotional tricks" on museum visitors by linking the display of 
the Enola Gay to depictions of Hiroshima bomb victims and survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The curators are still retreating, but they are doing so grudgingly, word by 
word, line by line, and it's not because they believe they are wrong, it's 
because of the outside pressure," says John T. Correll, editor of Air Force 
Magazine, the journal of the Air Force Assn., a veterans organization that has 
campaigned successfully for changes to the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the exhibit's original planners -- curator Michael Neufeld and Tom 
Crouch, director of the Air and Space Museum's division of aeronautics -- are 
so frustrated that they no longer are willing to discuss the exhibit with the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they happy with the current exhibit? Happy isn't the word I would use," 
acknowledges Fetters, the museum spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, perhaps it is fitting that in this new conservative era, the backlash 
against PC -- real or imagined -- would achieve its greatest triumph here in 
Washington, within sight of the Capitol building and a Congress now firmly 
under Republican control. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, in fact, the story behind the Smithsonian's struggle over the 
Enola Gay has much more to do with 1990s cultural politics than it does with 
the history of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The American decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, 
and on Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 9, brought World War II to a shattering and 
troubling end. President Harry Truman had moved decisively to use the bomb to 
end the war quickly and to save thousands of American lives by averting a 
planned invasion of a recalcitrant Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the process the United States had also ushered in the nuclear age, and 
with it gradually came a new sense of ambivalence about the uses of American 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start of their planning for the 50th anniversary of the Enola Gay's 
mission to Hiroshima, Neufeld and Crouch were convinced that they had to 
explore that larger history of the nuclear age, and what Hiroshima meant for 
the modern world. Unlike the Spirit of St. Louis, the Wright Brothers' Flyer or 
Chuck Yeager's X-1, the Enola Gay would not be displayed on its own, but would 
rather serve as the centerpiece for a political history of the dawn of the 
nuclear threat and the onset of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 As Washington Post columnist Jonathan Yardley argues, the decision not to 
simply display the bomber on its own, but to place it in a historical context 
of the curators' choosing, was at heart a political act. Neufeld and Crouch 
wanted to use the Enola Gay to "address the significance, necessity and 
morality of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because the question 
of whether it was necessary and right to drop the bombs continues to perplex 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet almost by definition, that meant they would be looking at the history of 
the Enola Gay through a 1990s lens -- and given Crouch and Neufeld's own views, 
a critical one at that -- and fail to grasp its 1945 context. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly became clear that this approach was meant to convey an anti-nuclear 
perspective for the exhibit, one that seemed to suggest that the United States 
had committed an immoral and racist act by dropping the bomb on Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 For a museum staff that recognizes that many of its visitors are young 
children or teen-agers who are almost wholly ignorant of the history of World 
War II, that was a cavalier step to take. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch and Neufeld seemed to dismiss the controversy as essentially a 
generational dispute, pitting the veterans of World War II against their 
children, who grew up under the threat of nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 But the exhibit's flaws ran much deeper than that. Its anti-nuclear message 
was overlaid on a script that took astonishing liberties with the history of 
World War II leading up to the Enola Gay's mission. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the first version of the script, written last January by 
Crouch and Neufeld, they described the War in the Pacific as an American "war 
of vengeance," while insisting that for "most Japanese, it was a war to defend 
their unique culture against Western imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, they planned to begin the chronology of the exhibit with the final 
land battles of the Pacific on Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. That gave the 
exhibit the sense that the United States was easily rolling over an already 
defeated enemy, leading to the central historical point that the curators hoped 
to make: that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not necessary to end 
the war, and that Truman and his advisers knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The script gives the impression that President Truman, in making his decision 
to drop the bomb, did it to impress the Soviet Union rather than to save 
American lives in any potential invasion of Japan," wrote Richard Hallion, 
chief historian of the Air Force, who reviewed the script as a member of the 
museum's advisory board. "The script also conveys the idea that Truman was 
motivated by racism and that dropping the bomb was unjustified." 
</P>
<P>
 The original show would conclude with a gut-wrenching display called "Ground 
Zero," which Crouch and Neufeld called the "emotional heart of the exhibit." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, "photos of victims, enlarged to life-size, will stare out at the 
visitor." The photos would be supplemented with artifacts from victims, 
including a young girl's carbonized school lunch box, as well as religious 
artifacts melted and misshapen by the atomic blast. And, so that no one would 
miss the connection, a replica of the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped on 
Hiroshima would be positioned right underneath the fuselage of the Enola Gay. 
</P>
<P>
 For American veterans of World War II -- many of whom had sent small donations 
to the Smithsonian over the years urging the museum to restore and display the 
plane that they believed had saved their lives -- the initial reports of the 
Smithsonian's plans came as a horrific shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those whose business it is to create, mold, manipulate and utilize public 
opinion have done so as a matter of self-serving interest," complained Brig. 
Gen. Paul Tibbets, the now-retired commander of the Enola Gay on its Hiroshima 
mission; he has refused to cooperate with the museum's curators. "Consequently, 
history has been denigrated, the Enola Gay has been miscast, and a group of 
valiant Americans have had their role in history treated shamefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans groups mobilized early this year, and eventually got Congress 
involved as well. The Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Sen. Nancy 
Kassebaum (R-Kansas) that decried the Enola Gay script as "revisionist and 
offensive" to World War II veterans. And, once the national media discovered 
the controversy, the coverage was almost universally critical of the 
Smithsonian's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the onslaught of criticism, Crouch and Neufeld wanted to tough it out 
and go ahead with their original exhibit plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Smithsonian's upper management, including Air and Space Museum 
Director Martin Harwit, soon figured out which way the political winds were 
blowing and recognized the need for compromise.  
</P>
<P>
 By April, Harwit was backtracking and mounting a rather disingenuous defense 
of his earlier approval of the January script. "I evidently paid greater 
attention to accuracy than to balance," he said. "Accuracy is somewhat easier 
to check, at least for the aspects of the exhibition that are familiar. Balance 
is more difficult to assess, since it requires an overview that allows one to 
see the script as a whole."  
</P>
<P>
 So on a second reading, Harwit said he found that "we do have a lack of 
balance, and that much of the criticism that has been leveled against us is 
understandable."  
</P>
<P>
 "Most strikingly . . . we show terrible pictures of human suffering in 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki without earlier showing pictures of the suffering the 
Japanese had inflicted in China, in the camps they set up for Dutch and British 
civilians and military, and U.S. prisoners of war. . . . We show virtually no 
pictures of Allied dead or wounded, while (the Ground Zero display) has any 
number of heart-wrenching, tragic stories of suffering on the ground. Where are 
the corresponding tragedies in China, in the Philippines, in Singapore, in the 
former Dutch possessions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harwit established an internal review process to revise the script, but that 
failed to mollify the veterans groups, who demanded more involvement in the 
exhibit rewrites. Eventually, both the Air Force Assn. and the American Legion 
forced the museum to negotiate with them in a series of semantic skirmishes 
over script wording. As the controversy swelled and public opinion sided with 
the veterans, they tended to win most of those battles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a close reading of the final exhibit script, published in 
October, shows that it bears little resemblance to the earlier efforts. Not 
only has the controversial language and "anti-American slant" been excised, the 
portion of the exhibit dealing with the Cold War and the nuclear age has been 
all but eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 No longer does the exhibit focus on the decision-making process in Washington 
over whether to drop the bomb. Instead, the museum has almost doubled the 
exhibit space to add an entire new section on the origins and history of the 
entire War in the Pacific. The number of photographs and artifacts from 
Hiroshima bomb victims has been reduced, the number of photographs of American 
casualties increased, and a video of the recollections of bomber crews added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that new approach prompted a group of 62 authors and academics to issue a 
letter to the Smithsonian in November, protesting its willingness to give in to 
the veterans' demands. Recent historical research had uncovered many of the 
nuances and subtleties behind Truman's decision to drop the bomb, and yet now 
the museum was abandoning its efforts to address that issue, the group argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, a group of religious leaders and peace activists met with 
Harwit to present similar concerns, arguing that the exhibit now fails to 
explain the long-term consequences of the Enola Gay's mission. The bombings of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, "were not just the final acts of World War II . 
. . they were the opening acts of the nuclear age, and all its dangers," said 
Dr. Robert K. Musil, director of policy and programs for Physicians for Social 
Responsibility. And the new exhibit plan, Musil said, "does not present the 
continuing consequences for the world in which we now live."  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the changes made to the exhibit also may prevent the Smithsonian 
from gaining access to the Hiroshima artifacts that it has been counting on to 
fill out its "Ground Zero" section. Those artifacts are now held by Japanese 
museums, and museum spokesman Fetters says the controversy here has made them 
reluctant to lend them to the Air and Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the debate rages on, Fetters worries that the real loser will be the 
Air and Space Museum. With 8.2 million visitors last year, it is the most 
popular museum in the world, and until now, has been largely free of 
controversy. It is always a gee-whiz hit with families touring the nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a shrine to American technology," Fetters says. "We just had our 25th 
anniversary for the Apollo moon landings, and we are already getting excited 
about 2003 and the centennial of flight. But when we do something like this 
that doesn't fit with our image, it surprises and disappoints people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid we're going to have to win a lot of people back."

COMMITMENTS; MISSING: ONE IDENTITY LEFT BEHIND IN PREVIOUS CAR; AGING: WE

<P>
 A woman I work with, who's about my age, is in the market for a new car. The 
last time she bought a car was 10 years ago. At the time, her children were 
small, so she went shopping for a safe, sturdy, celibate four-door . . . and 
had a mid-life crisis inside the dealership, which caused her to drive off in a 
spiffy convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked her why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," she said, shaking her shoulders like Charo doing cuchi-cuchi, "you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years, the "you know" has been exorcised. "I just wouldn't feel 
comfortable buying a sports car again," she said. "And this is because, I'm, uh 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 An old bag? I volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, an old bag," she said. "So what does an old bag buy?" 
</P>
<P>
 A 1973 Nova always worked for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me caution you right away: This is not a man-woman thing. This is not 
about how women buy cars as opposed to men. This is not about how women are old 
bags. I am an old bag too. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a middle-age thing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is about finding your identity through what you drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, you bought cramped cars with low fuel-consumption to do your 
part to help protect the environment. Ten years ago, you bought bulky cars with 
childproof door locks so you could protect your kids. Now your kids are driving 
their own cars, and you couldn't care less what gas costs as long as you don't 
have to wait in line for it. This next car is for you -- if only you knew who 
you were. 
</P>
<P>
 I am past the convertible stage now. A couple of years ago, I coveted a Mazda 
Miata. I went to test-drive it, and it felt as if I were sitting in a shoe box; 
I thought about my chances of surviving an accident, and not even with another 
car -- if my Miata got hit by a large dog, they'd have to scrape me off the 
road with a spatula. Then, when my test drive ended, I couldn't get out of the 
car. My center of gravity was too low. I had no push-off. I had to sort of roll 
out onto one knee. If you're going to buy a car, at least you ought to be able 
to get out of it without risking arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of Jeeps and small trucks, which everybody seems to want now, 
as if paved roads were going out of style. Am I missing something here? Are we 
preparing to occupy Switzerland and this is the way we're crossing the Alps? 
Riding in a Jeep is like riding in a tin can. Half the time, you feel as if 
you're in a Cuisinart and somebody hit the "pulse" button. 
</P>
<P>
 And you're sitting so high you can get vertigo. A friend of mine shelled out 
$27,000 for a Chevy Blazer and asked for the step-ladder option so he could 
drive it home. I'll bet the highest incidence of broken legs among middle-aged 
men is caused by dismounting from a Ford Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting back to my friend: She stares at cars all the time now, trying to 
figure out which one is her. She goes to the supermarket, but doesn't actually 
buy food -- which hasn't endeared her at home -- because she spends all her 
time walking through the parking lot casing cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, she was out jogging and spotted a car she liked stopped at a light. 
She yelled out to the driver, "What've you got under the hood?" The terrified 
man -- obviously thinking that a woman in jogging shorts who approached him in 
his car to ask him what he had under the hood must be a prostitute -- quickly 
shut his window and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an Altima," she remembered. "Who makes Altima?" 
</P>
<P>
 Who makes Altima? Who makes Avalon? Millenia? Infiniti? Cirrus? Aurora? They 
all look like fat Faberge eggs. Are they Japanese? Are they American? (Hint: 
They're not European. European cars don't have names, just letters and numbers. 
850, J30, C-280, E-400, 325i. Anybody out there got bingo?) 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when it was simpler, when cars had rules? You were a Ford man or a GM 
man. If you were a GM man, you started with a Chevy, you bought an Olds when 
you got married, and if you got a promotion -- whoa, here comes Mr. Buick! You 
moved up within the known order. The kind of car you owned reflected your spot 
in the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's so confusing. Nobody's a Ford man anymore, nobody sticks with a 
company his whole life; if Henry Ford were alive today, he'd probably drive a 
Lexus! Madison Avenue has made us a nation of car-buying Sybils. How can your 
car tell you who you are when every year 300 new cars come out, each one 
promising a sleeker, safer, more roomy you? Whatever happened to Plymouth 
Furys, which didn't promise you anything but a radio and a heater? 
</P>
<P>
 I feel sorry for my friend, trying to discover which car is her.  
</P>
<P>
 You can't find yourself in the rearview mirror anymore.

COMMITMENTS; FAMILY FEUD -- CHRISTMAS STYLE; EVERYONE YEARNS FOR THE PERFECT

TO PUT A DAMPER ON THINGS. STAY LOOSE. STAY CALM. AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T 
GET SUCKED IN THE FRAY.

<P>
 You've flown halfway across the country to spend the holidays with your 
family. Your head is spinning with nostalgia. Your heart is bursting with 
holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 But your treasured Christmas Eve turns into the nightmare before Christmas -- 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Your mother complains her children are "selfish and ungrateful." Your 
grandmother embarrasses everyone with a racial slur. Dear brother rudely 
announces that he plans to return the pricey gift you spent hours selecting. 
And your bonehead cousin needles you with sexist jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, as you board the plane to head home, you feel as if you've 
been through the holiday from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 It happens every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Holidays, with their speeded-up pace and extra obligations, always bring 
increased stress. But when you spend them with relatives who have radically 
different notions of behavior, humor or taste, holiday gatherings can drive you 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Feelings get hurt, old feuds are resurrected and relatives leave the affair no 
longer speaking to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a major problem for many families, and not just those with a history of 
distant or volatile relationships, says Los Angeles therapist Marcia Lasswell, 
president-elect of the American Assn. of Marriage and Family Therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? 
</P>
<P>
 When relatives or close family friends drink too much, offend others or act 
like fools, she says, you have three options: 
</P>
<P>
 "You can confront the person. Or leave. Or grin and bear it." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, how to handle it depends on whether you are the host. "When you are 
having the party at your home and this person has a history of that, then I 
would lay down some rules," she advises. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the party, tell the person: "You've ruined a number of Christmases 
before and if you want to come to this party, I don't want you to drink. There 
will be no alcohol served to you in my home." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just dealing with in-laws, different lifestyles and blended families" can be 
trying during this season, says Cynthia Whitham of UCLA's Neuropsychiatric 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 A gay partnership or mixed marriage -- ethnic, racial, religious or 
intergenerational -- can be tough for some relatives to deal with, and after a 
few rounds of spiked eggnog, the veneer of politeness can wear thin. 
</P>
<P>
 A display of bigotry at a family gathering can be unbearable. Laura, a Chicago 
writer, says she usually spends most of Thanksgiving and Christmas biting her 
tongue as she endures the racist remarks of elderly family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could make an ugly scene. But I'm a guest at their house. And I figure they 
are going to die soon anyway and then I won't have to listen to it again," 
Laura says. "Sometimes I'll make comments to counter the bigoted remarks. It 
annoys me that my children have to listen to this." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are in a mixed marriage and a relative has made offensive remarks in 
the past, Lasswell advises that you firmly, yet cordially, tell them at first 
mention of the invitation that "I don't want you to do it again. It makes us 
unhappy and it ruins the festive nature of the party. If you do it, I'm going 
to ask you to stop. I don't want to embarrass you and I don't want to be 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 If you anticipate some ill-mannered comments, Orange County clinical 
psychologist Lois Nightingale suggests you decide ahead of time how you will 
handle them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask your partner what is going to make him or her the most comfortable. Your 
partner might be mortified if you confront the offender. Or, he or she might 
feel vulnerable and unprotected if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are you aren't going to "enlighten or change" someone who is "hateful 
and bigoted," Nightingale says. Confronting the person sometimes only deepens 
the feelings and "makes them feel justified." 
</P>
<P>
 If you expect things to get rocky at a family party but don't want to confront 
anyone or bail out in a hurry, prepare yourself to ignore tactless remarks or 
plan ways to escape those who annoy you the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picture someone saying something nasty and either respond with a compliment . 
. . or excuse yourself" and go help in the kitchen, Nightingale says. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if someone asks you an embarrassing personal question, say: "It's 
nice to have people be so concerned about my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then change the subject or walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone yearns for the perfect holiday, the kind of enchanted time they may 
remember from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make it as good or even better than it used to be," says UCLA's 
Whitham. "But it is probably impossible to recreate what you did as a child (at 
Christmas), or what your fuzzy memory of it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Agrees Lasswell: "If we didn't have great Christmases in the past, we want to 
make them great now. And if we did have great ones, we want them to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Divorce and remarriage, disputes over parenting styles, and tension over money 
and gifts can all disrupt family harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday festivities can be ruined -- especially for children -- when battling 
parents let their personal hostilities spoil a gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "If parents aren't speaking to each other or hate each other, it is really 
difficult," Lasswell says. "If you want to let your children have a good 
Christmas, the parents really need to put some of their feelings aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was divorced several years ago and made up my mind that I was never going 
to put my children in the position of having to choose one of us over the other 
or to be uncomfortable if we were all together. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result, we've managed very nicely to have lovely Christmases as a family 
. . . without kidding ourselves that it's the same way" it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes these family squabbles and melodramas can be rather entertaining. 
The sort of thing you'll look back and laugh at someday. Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what one Los Angeles woman does. For years, she was infuriated by her 
mother-in-law's refusal to accept gifts graciously. She ridiculed and returned 
nearly every gift she received -- even holiday flowers delivered by a florist. 
Other times, she gave away gifts right in front of the family members who had 
just given them to her. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Christmas her behavior backfired. She received a Louis Vuitton purse 
she'd asked for from Mexico. Dissatisfied with the style, she took it to Saks 
Fifth Avenue and tried to exchange it. She was horrified when the sales clerk 
refused, informing her that it was a fake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That funny incident has become legendary in the family," says her 
daughter-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Nightingale offers this advice: "If you have a dysfunctional 
family, spend a lot of time with good friends around the holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, you can't choose your relatives but you can choose your friends.

WIFE EXPRESSES SHOCK AT OFFICER'S ARREST IN SLAYING OF CORONA MAN; CRIME: HER 
MARRIAGE TO ANAHEIM POLICEMAN MINN WAS OVER, SHE SAYS, AND HER DEAD LOVER AND 
THE SUSPECT WERE FRIENDS. 
</P>

<P>
 An anguished Elian Schonberger said Sunday that her husband, Anaheim police 
Officer Thomas A. Minn, seemed to accept that she was having a love affair with 
his neighborhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did she suspect that her husband of six years would ultimately be 
accused of turning his own .45-caliber service pistol on her lover, Paul R. 
Hangen, and fatally shooting him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in complete shock," Schonberger said during an interview at her Corona 
home. "I want my Paul back." 
</P>
<P>
 Minn, 36, was arrested about 19 hours after he allegedly shot 28-year-old 
Hangen at least twice on Friday night. Hangen's body was discovered slumped in 
the cab of his Chevy pickup truck on the 2800 block of 2nd Street in Norco, 
about a mile away from Minn's house. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year veteran of the Anaheim Police Department, Minn shot Hangen with his 
semiautomatic service weapon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Tom loved me a lot and didn't want to let go of me, but I didn't love 
him," Schonberger said. "I haven't loved him for a long time."  
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Sheriff's Investigator Mark Lohman said Sunday that Minn, a 
motorcycle officer, is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail at the Robert 
Pressley Detention Center in 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Minn awaits arraignment on Monday or Tuesday, authorities said. Anaheim police 
said he was placed on administrative leave until his case is resolved.  
</P>
<P>
 Minn's parents, who live in Anaheim, said they have not talked to their son 
since his arrest and refused further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schonberger recalled Sunday how Minn had introduced her to Hangen about three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul was my friend and Tom's friend," said Schonberger, a grocery checkout 
clerk at a Garden Grove supermarket. "The three of us always did things 
together."  
</P>
<P>
 Hangen, a welder at Foothill Engineering in Corona, even moved in with the 
couple in February, she said, and the pair allowed Hangen's parents to stay 
with them for a few months as well.  
</P>
<P>
 But her marriage to Minn became strained, Schonberger said. By late summer, 
her friendship with Hangen grew into romance, she said. He called her "Sweet 
Pea," and she called him "Cowboy Pauly." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hangen moved out of the house in October, Schonberger said he kept a 
door key. 
</P>
<P>
 Hangen's grief-stricken parents, who live within a few blocks of the 
Schonberger-Minn home in Corona, refused to comment Sunday, although Hangen's 
mother did say she believed Schonberger had pursued her son.  
</P>
<P>
 Schonberger maintained she and Hangen pursued each other, and Hangen never 
told his parents about the relationship. While Minn did not like the 
arrangement, he tolerated it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul and I went out many times, and Tom accepted this fact -- that I was 
going out and doing this," she insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 She started talking about divorce about a year ago, but Minn didn't want her 
to go and would try to dissuade her, she said. The couple took separate rooms 
in their five-bedroom, two-story home and tensions mounted, Schonberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was telling everyone he was going to shoot himself because she wanted a 
divorce," said Schonberger's mother, Ria Zigman, who flew in from Arizona to 
see her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Schonberger said her husband told her she "couldn't make it" if she tried to 
live on her own, supporting her 13-year-old son from a previous marriage. But 
she was planning to file for divorce, and had just put a deposit on a nearby 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom wanted to commit suicide," Schonberger said. "He had left me letters." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, Schonberger was waiting for Hangen to pick her up to go 
dancing. He never arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 A mile away, Norco resident Rhonda Moore, 38, was watching television in her 
home on Second Street when she heard two gunshots at about 7 p.m. Moore's 
golden retriever, Bo, began barking and whining. When she went outside to look 
around, she saw a pickup truck with its engine running. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Moore discovered Hangen's body slumped in the driver's seat. She 
immediately called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing stunned residents, who said there is little crime in the 
neighborhood, which is more likely to have runaway pigs and goats than 
homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this neighborhood, nothing ever happens," Moore said Sunday. "About the 
biggest thing that happens is a cow gets loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Schonberger was packing Sunday, stuffing Minn's boots and other police gear in 
boxes. She plans to move to Arizona with her son to live with her mother.

 When she was discharged from a Long Beach hospital three years ago, Eloina 
Adame couldn't walk or feed herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Her medical insurance coverage was exhausted, and Adame owed $150,000 for her 
treatment. Continued physical therapy for her neurological condition -- 
Guillain-Barre syndrome -- was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 62-year-old Laguna Hills woman ably gets around with the aid of a 
cane and can care for herself. She credits a water exercise class at Saddleback 
College for the dramatic turnaround that has astounded her doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought I was never going to walk again," Adame said. "They call me the 
Miracle Lady. I say it's because of the pool. It has been a godsend to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-foot-deep pool at the college is a last resort for some South County 
residents whose insurance coverage for rehabilitative services has been tapped 
out or canceled. For Adame and others who have suffered strokes or other 
serious injuries and ailments, the shallow pool is like a reservoir of 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only thing I can get," said Mitzi Paul, a 24-year-old Dana Point 
woman whose health insurance company dropped her eight months after she 
suffered a serious head injury in early 1993, when a drunk driver hit her car 
head-on at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, who was working 60 hours a week in two jobs, including one for a small 
firm in Irvine, said the insurance company found a loophole and canceled her 
policy. Because she was no longer employed as an office manager, she wasn't 
entitled to further coverage, she was told by insurance officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone was $5 million in lifetime medical insurance that Paul thought she had. 
Confined to a wheelchair, the woman was in the middle of extensive therapy for 
her legs, arms and speech when the insurance safety net ripped open. Three 
hours of therapy per day cost $500. She had $300 in her savings account. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul heard about the water exercise class at Saddleback College through a 
staff member at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. A 
handful of hospital workers in the county know of the program and suggest it as 
an option to those searching for a way to rebuild or strengthen themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to walk again," Paul said. "If I don't give up, maybe no one else 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students before Paul have benefited from the water's buoyancy, said 
course instructor Ron Hastings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings said that the class, "Adaptive Water Exercise and Swimming," is not 
considered physical therapy by definition of the medical Establishment. Nor is 
it a cure-all when compared to other forms of physical therapy in a hospital 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet people continue to seek out the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The class has been offered for 12 years through the college's Special Services 
Department. It is also available at Leisure World. Swim instructors are mostly 
Saddleback College students enrolled in classes for physical therapy training. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen people use the class to supplement medical outpatient 
rehabilitation or continue a program after completing prescribed physical 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings said that water reduces a person's weight, based on how submerged 
they are in the pool. The effect: They can work on balance, strength and 
coordination with greater ease than on land, where the force of gravity pulls 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people can't walk without the aid of crutches and braces, but in the 
water, they can," said Hastings, who joked to his students last week that their 
final exam depended in part on the quality of home-baked cookies they would be 
sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Coleman, a 61-year-old San Juan Capistrano resident, started the class 
after his stepdaughter who works at the campus told him about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman suffered a brain injury when a horse fell on him in a 1987 accident in 
Temecula. He didn't have health insurance. After months of physical therapy, 
Coleman said doctors told him they could do no more to help him regain use of 
his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the class nine weeks ago, Coleman said he can notice a 
difference in his balance and gait. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing a lot better," a grinning Coleman said recently, as he held onto 
the pool deck and moved his leg in circular motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Frame has been going to the class for three years. A hip replacement and 
quadruple bypass heart surgery have kept his workout program wet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is really a marvelous experience," said Frame, a 73-year-old San 
Clemente resident. "I've seen people of all kinds come in here -- people with 
strokes, hip replacements, knee replacements, also a few people with multiple 
sclerosis." 
</P>
<P>
 For Carole Shortt, the pool is a place to "experience life." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortt, 52, of Dana Point, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1987 and 
cannot walk. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the water she can swim. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I can come and be normal," Shortt said. "This is interaction. 
It's stretching, bending and relating." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul hopes the water is a way back to a life more like the one she knew before 
the January, 1993, accident plunged her into a coma for six weeks and left her 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only thing I could afford, this class," Paul said, adding that 
doctors told her they can't say for sure if she will walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul is determined to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought I wouldn't even talk," she said. "And I blew them away with 
that."

RESIDENTS FEAR THE EFFECTS OF TOLLWAY; TRANSIT: NELLIE GAIL RANCH HOMEOWNERS 
WANT ROAD'S BUILDER TO SAFEGUARD ENCLAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Residents of the affluent Nellie Gail Ranch neighborhood have a vision of what 
life will be like when the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor opens at 
their back door in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 They see confused motorists exiting at Greenfield Drive to avoid the first 
tollbooth, then racing through their quiet streets trying to find their way 
back to Interstate 5. Further, residents fear, the off-ramp might make Nellie 
Gail an easy target for burglars and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Nellie Gail Ranch Owners Assn. has asked the road's builder, the 
Transportation Corridor Agencies, to pony up $197,000 for unlocked gates, an 
unmanned guard pavilion, patterned pavement, a monument sign and more trees at 
Greenfield to make Nellie Gail look like a gated community. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents hope that will keep out the lost, the speeders and the criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The TCA hasn't evaluated the plan yet, but with $324 million of its funds 
frozen in the county's failed investment pool, the proposal is likely to run 
into some opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to see what their proposal is," said TCA spokeswoman Lisa Telles. 
"But the time to have things included in the project is usually part of the 
environmental studies, and that's long past." 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-mile, $800-million San Joaquin Hills tollway will extend the Corona del 
Mar Freeway through Irvine, Laguna Canyon, Aliso Viejo and Laguna Hills, ending 
at Interstate 5 south of Avery Parkway. A one-way trip will cost $2. The TCA, a 
consortium of the county and 12 cities, is paying for the San Joaquin Hills, 
Foothill and Eastern toll roads mostly through bond sales that will be repaid 
with future toll revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound drivers who mistakenly get on the San Joaquin Hills toll road at 
Interstate 5 can exit at Greenfield, the first off-ramp, without being charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Nellie Gail residents say the best way to steer such drivers toward Crown 
Valley Parkway, where they can get back on Interstate 5, is to make the Nellie 
Gail Ranch entrance narrower and more imposing by putting in a three-rail 
fence, empty guard shack and turnaround area so cars don't make U-turns using 
residents' driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a fairly unique situation . . . that needs a fairly unique response," 
said Andrew Ulich, president of the Ranch Owners Assn. He urged the Laguna 
Hills City Council to ask the TCA for as much money as possible to divert 
traffic toward a Laguna Niguel shopping center just south of the toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could mitigate the problem for only $5,000, it would make us just as 
happy," he said. "To make somebody pay for landscaping and gating is not our 
goal. But it may be the only effective means" to divert traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenfield exit is the only one along the toll road that empties directly 
into a residential area. Most off-ramps are at major streets, including Moulton 
Parkway, La Paz Road and Sand Canyon Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The original tollway plans called for one on-ramp and one off-ramp at 
Greenfield. But then another pair of ramps was added, angering Nellie Gail 
residents who were worried about extra traffic. By the year 2010, 25,000 cars 
are expected to use the Greenfield ramps each day. 
</P>
<P>
 At his last council meeting Nov. 22, Nellie Gail resident and former Laguna 
Hills Councilman L. Allan Songstad Jr. said the TCA must accept responsibility 
for the potential traffic problems and solve them, even if that means paying 
for unused gates and an unused guard pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel no compunction whatsoever about throwing in everything and the kitchen 
sink and asking (the TCA) to do what's right," Songstad had urged his fellow 
council members. "They need to mitigate a bad, bad situation they've created." 
</P>
<P>
 With strong encouragement from Songstad and Councilwoman Melody Carruth, who 
also lives in Nellie Gail, the council voted unanimously to request the full 
$197,000 from the TCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he voted for the request, Councilman Randal J. Bressette, one of two 
council members who do not live in Nellie Gail, said the city's request may be 
too elaborate to receive the go-ahead from the TCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that you don't go overboard," Bressette said last week. "If 
someone threw a baseball through your window, you would want him to replace the 
glass but not the whole window frame. And you wouldn't ask him to come in and 
pick up the glass off the floor. When you ask for changes that are aesthetic in 
nature and that don't divert traffic, it may delay" funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a majority of the council members live in Nellie Gail, they said they 
would have asked for money to divert traffic from any other residential 
neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, the TCA gave Laguna Hills $5,000 to draw up its Greenfield traffic 
diversion plan. At the time, William C. Woollett Jr., the TCA's chief 
executive, said the TCA understood the plan might include community gating. 
</P>
<P>
 But by September, San Joaquin Hills corridor manager Gene W. Foster told 
Woollett in a memorandum he felt Nellie Gail was asking for too much and that 
their plan didn't fit in the corridor's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Joel T. Lautenschleger, the city's representative to the TCA who does 
not live in Nellie Gail, said he now thinks the city may have to scale back its 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the county financial crisis, this is probably not the top priority of 
the TCA, but at least some money should be set aside," he said. "I think the 
guard pavilion or shack is just an option that was thrown in. I don't know if 
it will continue to be there when we get into discussions with the TCA. As long 
as we stick to traffic mitigation, the TCA should be happy to help us."

KIDS KEEP IN TOUCH AT MUSEUM EXHIBIT; ART: BOWERS TAKES INTERACTIVE APPROACH TO 
ACTIVITIES, ATTRACTIONS FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES. 
</P>

 With a small drum clamped between his knees, a giggling Jose Urias, 13, beat 
the Native American instrument with his hands as he was accompanied by an 
entourage of other novice musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the wild rhythms of the drum, rattling maracas and crescendos of 
children's laughter, Urias, of Santa Ana, was one of hundreds of kids Sunday 
sampling the activities and attractions at the Bowers Museum's first cultural 
exhibit especially for children. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opening of the Kidseum in Santa Ana, two blocks from the Bowers' main 
Museum of Cultural Arts, families and tour groups curiously stroked furs from 
native rugs, strummed guitars and put wooden masks over their heads.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most museums, there were no "DO NOT TOUCH" warning signs. Instead, 
makeshift flyers of colorful construction paper encouraged gentle handling and 
testing of musical instruments, costumes and tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The interactive premise behind the museum, coordinator Pat Korzec said, is to 
get visitors, young and old, to absorb the different cultures by involving 
their human senses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything here is touchable. It's a normal reaction to reach out and feel 
what's in front of you, to really experience the culture," Korzec said. "I 
didn't expect to see this level of concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of Kidseum's exhibits and programs focus on the three cultural 
regions emphasized at the main museum: The Americas, the Pacific Rim and 
Africa. Most visiting children ranged from ages 2 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," said an elated David Grody, 7, of Orange. "I've just touched 
about everything. This is almost better than the L.A. Children's Museum." 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite is the rabbit fur, because it's soft," Brittany Bronagem, 5, said 
timidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the overall responses were delight and amusement, Sandra Vu, 13, of 
Santa Ana, said, "I think this is kind of boring. It's educational but it's 
more for young kids." 
</P>
<P>
 But museum organizers also expect participation from parents and educators. 
</P>
<P>
 For Victor Carfi and his son, Alex, just shy of 3 years old, the cultural 
experience was an eye opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most other children's museums are usually about science and nature. Here, we 
listened to stories about the Chumach Indians, played the guitar and tried on 
costumes," said Carfi, of Los Alamitos. "I don't know much about this kind of 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Milling through the museum's time vault, helping repair broken artifacts and 
rubbing little fingers along stone artwork brought out the archeologist and 
explorer in most children. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers were kept busy, trying to calm excited musicians and adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
 While some children fought to get their hands on bells and rabbit furs, others 
banged and jumped on such animal statues as saddled horses. Just two hours 
after museum doors opened, two maracas were already broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a high-maintenance museum, but it's worth it. I don't think 
anyone can put a price tag on learning," Korzec said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a glass room, dotted with bean bags and cushions, children and parents 
sat in a horseshoe around a storyteller recounting oral histories of indigenous 
peoples. Some alert listeners perked their ears up and engaged in the stories. 
Others fidgeted and darted toward the touchable items once the hourlong session 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room, the child archeologist would transform into a primitive 
artist, creating posters and toys with imaginative icons and designs. Children 
carried away simulated African rattles made by filling empty tennis ball 
canisters with corn kernels and covering them with symbols and icons. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids' imaginations are far more sophisticated than adults think. 
They'll come up with things well beyond the structures we teach them," said 
John Rose, a museum volunteer. "I look over their shoulders and I learn from 
them."

<P>
 People caught scavenging in somebody else's trash may be arrested, fined or 
sent to jail under a proposed ordinance the City Council tentatively approved 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the ordinance is in response to complaints from residents 
and business owners who said scavengers are scattering litter on the streets 
after removing aluminum cans, newspapers and other recyclables from trash bins. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said scavengers are sometimes looking for personal records, 
credit card receipts or bank statements that could be used to defraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a victim of garbage snoopers myself," said Councilwoman Charmayne 
S. Bohman, who said she had caught a scavenger looking for personal records in 
her trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is also intended to protect the health of scavengers and others, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Violations would be misdemeanors punishable by $500 fines, six months in jail 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the ordinance for final approval in January.BERT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL TO DISCUSS GOLF COURSE FEE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday will revisit a proposed series of fee hikes at the 
two municipal golf courses and will also again discuss ways to deal with the 
proliferation of yard sales throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the council postponed voting on the golf fee hikes, which were 
proposed to make the H.G. (Dad) Miller and Anaheim Hills golf courses more 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rates, the golf courses would charge weekend rates on Fridays 
and double weekend tournament fees to $10. Friday fees would increase from $11 
to $13 for nine holes and from $16 to $22 for 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes could raise city revenue by $160,000 annually. The 
courses now bring in about $1.5 million each year to the general fund, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council backed away from drafting an ordinance that would 
place restrictions on yard sales, which are already prohibited under the city's 
zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus, who complained that the estimated 200 sales each 
weekend are blighting the city, has requested that the subject be brought up 
again for discussion. GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: STANTON; DOTSON ELECTED MAYOR; COUNCILMEN TAKE OATH

<P>
 There's been a changing of the guard in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Dotson was elected Stanton's new mayor and Bill Estrada became the mayor 
pro tem at last week's City Council meeting. At the same session, two new 
council members took the oath of office in a packed council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new council faces a host of issues, including pressure to repeal a 6% 
utility tax, ridding Beach Boulevard of its seedy reputation and making sure 
that plans go forward for a new golf practice center and a business opportunity 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 David John Shawver, 47, a Long Beach wrestling coach and former council 
member, and Brian Donahue, 56, the director of instruction for the Regional 
Occupational Program in Whittier, officially assumed their new positions on the 
council. They replace one-termer Don Martinez and Linda Pappas Diaz, who served 
for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a whirlwind it's been, and I'm blinking, saying, 'Did it all happen?' 
Then I look at you, and I know it did," said Pappas Diaz in a departing speech. 
"I'm so pleased to see you all here. Stanton is a small and mighty place, and 
it's for you, the people, that I got involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was equally emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask that you pray for the new council members," he said. "Because once you 
become an elected official, it isn't a career change, it's a lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 The council thanked Pappas Diaz and Martinez for their hard work, then 
welcomed Shawver and Donahue, both of whom delivered short speeches. Shawver 
promised to do his best to repeal the 6% utility tax the city adopted in March, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said he ran for the council seat because he wants to help the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was time to vote on who should be the city's new mayor, Dotson, 68, a 
former planning commissioner, was immediately nominated.  
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Darlene Cordova asked if anybody opposed the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just my wife," quipped Dotson.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; VENDING PERMIT HOLD MAY BE EXTENDED

<P>
 Street vendors wanting to work in Anaheim may have to wait at least another 
six months if the City Council votes on Tuesday to extend a moratorium on 
issuing new vendor/operator permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium does not affect the approximately 150 licensed vendors who 
currently sell a variety of products including produce, groceries, cigarettes, 
clothing and furniture from the back of parked trucks and vans, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the council voted 4 to 0 to prohibit new licenses to vendors for 
90 days with the hope of drafting an ordinance during that time that might curb 
complaints about trash, noise, customer loitering and vendors staying in one 
location too long, said City Code Enforcement Manager John W. Poole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to work out a new ordinance but 90 days wasn't enough time," Poole 
said. "Right now, there are already too many vendors and we didn't want any new 
ones to add to the problem as we tried to work this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Poole said that since September, there have been some improvements but 
violations and complaints continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Barajas, an Anaheim vendor and president of the Southern California 
Street Vendors Assn., said Friday that extending the moratorium might be a good 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are already too many," Barajas said. "But the vendors working have 
tried harder and the streets are cleaner. They sometimes get blamed for trash 
that was there before they drove up." 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the matter will be held on Tuesday. City officials have 
recommended that the council continue the moratorium until June 30 because of 
continuing complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the 4th District Court of Appeal nullified a 1992 Anaheim ordinance 
that prohibited street vending in neighborhoods. GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; CITY PUTS OFF MEAD BID FOR RESTAURANT AT 
EX-CHURCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 P.J. Mead Books & Coffee wants to open a restaurant and bookstore in one of 
Old Towne's oldest churches, but the City Council last week was too concerned 
about limited parking and hostile neighbors to give its immediate approval. 
</P>
<P>
 This past summer, the council had resolved long-running complaints from 
neighbors about noise from the coffee shop by forcing Gary Mead Jr. and his 
family to build a sound wall around their Cambridge Street cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the owners want to expand the popular but cramped coffeehouse and open a 
full-scale restaurant and gift shop in what was once the Antioch Baptist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,000-square-foot church building, at Almond Avenue and Orange Street, was 
built in 1891 and as a church does not conform to current zoning, Community 
Development Director Jack McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed restaurant would not conform to the limited business district 
zone either, but McGee's office recommended giving the Meads a nonconforming 
use permit anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 It "would have no greater impact on the subject site than the previous use," 
his report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors and council members disagreed, pointing to limited parking in 
the area and the previous dispute between the original cafe and its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great problem with this," said resident Alice Clark.  
</P>
<P>
 "For 25 years, I've been saying to watch what you're doing with parking in Old 
Towne. You are creating a mess," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead said he and his family have learned "a tremendous amount" about being 
more sensitive to neighbors.  
</P>
<P>
 The family has bought a parking lot next to the proposed site that would 
provide enough parking along with the public lot across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Joanne Coontz said she is concerned that, once the project was approved, 
the city would not have any recourse should the business become a problem for 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The council continued the hearing to Jan. 10. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; DELAY TO BE ASKED ON APARTMENTS DECISION

<P>
 A seven-month delay in deciding the fate of a proposal to build 850 apartment 
units off El Toro Road will be requested by city staff at tonight's Planning 
Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a presentation of the housing project and full public testimony will 
be heard by commissioners, Community Development Director Clint Sherrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important issue and the public will have an opportunity to 
comment," Sherrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans being presented by the Mission Viejo Co., the developer, are being 
challenged on several fronts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Local environmentalists say the apartments would be more intrusive to area 
wildlife than the business park previously planned for the 50-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 * City officials say the 850 units exceed the amount of housing allowed under 
a development agreement between the city and the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orange County Airport Land Use Commission pointed out in September that 
the project lies under the flight path of military jets heading to the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, company officials say an environmental study shows a business 
park would generate more traffic than an apartment complex. FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 Despite growing concern about the city's fiscal future in the wake of the 
county's bankruptcy, Irvine will explore joining a private company to create a 
regional technology center. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted last week to continue contract negotiations with 
Business Records Corp. of Dallas to operate the city's information services 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Company representatives say the department could be expanded into a regional 
technology center that could earn income by offering services to public and 
private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina L. Shea was the only council member voting against the proposal, 
citing the uncertainties of the city's financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have total cost-containment is the only prudent thing to do," Shea said.  
</P>
<P>
 Shea wanted to know why the company believes the city's information services 
department needs major upgrading when the city spent about $4 million for new 
computers several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine Mayor Michael Ward said the one-year review of city information 
services should not be put on hold. The vote to approve contract negotiations 
does not commit the city to any expenditures, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Barry J. Hammond said the move toward privatization of public 
services is the right direction for the city and may reduce expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the promise of Business Records Corp. Vice President George Tamas, 
who proposes to hire the four city employees left in what was a 20-person 
department and invest about $7 million for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this is a potential solution," Tamas said, "and not another 
problem for you." RUSS LOAR

<P>
 Trustees of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, who have been badly 
split over ideology in the past two years, remained divided last week -- this 
time as a bare majority selected the new board president. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to elect Marcia L. Birch as president.Trustees 
also voted 3 to 2 to elect Bobbee Cline vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Debbie Hughes and Frank L. Ury tried unsuccessfully for the top two 
spots, but both votes failed 2 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair had backed two Christian conservative candidates who lost in the Nov. 
8 election while challenging Cline and Dore J. Gilbert, who was named board 
secretary after serving as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Birch was elected by her colleagues, Hughes nominated Ury for board 
president, contending that he had the most experience in financial matters as 
the district tries to deal with the county's financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ury later nominated Hughes for the post of vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Peter A. Hartman told the audience that although trustees have been 
divided in the past two years, they are united in helping the district cope 
with the county's bond crisis. JEFF BEANSADDLEBACK VALLE

 City officials are looking for merchants to help offer "rewards" as part of a 
new program in which deputies single out children who are "caught being good." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Services has developed the program to laud youths who do such things as 
wear bicycle helmets, walk their bicycles in a crosswalk or are just polite. 
</P>
<P>
 The program aims to reward children for being respectful and law-abiding. It 
is also a way for local police to show they are not just out to ticket 
wrongdoers. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who are noticed doing something good will be given a commendation 
letter from the police chief.

 Judith A. Franco, a longtime trustee of the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District, is again at the helm of the district following the swearing-in of new 
board members last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco, a 14-year board veteran and the only incumbent to run for reelection, 
was unanimously elected board president after she and three new board members 
were sworn in Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco and Edward Decker were the only two board members to vote against 
remaining in the since-failed Orange County investment pool when the district 
had an opportunity to pull out in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers James Ferryman, Wendy Leece and Serene R. Stokes each replaced 
retired members who had favored remaining in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 As each was sworn in, they acknowledged the uphill financial battle the 
district will face as it struggles to recoup the $80 million -- $47 million of 
which was borrowed -- it invested in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to challenges. I've been fortunate enough to have a few leadership 
roles in the past," Ferryman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I was ready for this one, but the district is going to come out 
in one piece," he said. "Everybody's going to get a paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferryman said district officials will put other issues aside while the fiscal 
crisis is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Leece said she will focus on the district's positive aspects as well as the 
crisis: "I, too, am looking forward to the challenge and to making what is 
already good here in Newport-Mesa better." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes said the board's new members would rise to the challenge, even though 
it was more than they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not campaign for what we are faced with," she said. "It's a big 
challenge, but I think we can meet it." HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SEISMIC TESTING OF CITY BUILDINGS ON AGENDA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will vote tonight on whether to spend $48,500 to conduct 
seismic evaluations of certain city buildings, including City Hall, the police 
station and the downtown community center. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the task would go to Brandow & Johnston Associates of Santa Ana 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a staff report written by assistant engineer Ernesto Munoz and 
public services Director William J. Morris, recent earthquakes in the Costa 
Mesa area have made it necessary to carry out the seismic studies, especially 
since the buildings are to be used "extensively in a natural disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, no analyses or determination of seismic deficiencies have been 
performed on any city facility, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 29, the city started looking for engineering firms to do the work. 
Five submitted bids, and by Oct. 28 three of the companies were named as 
finalists, with Brandow & Johnston selected to do the work, according to the 
staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also vote on whether to spend $103,417 to overhaul a Costa 
Mesa helicopter engine.  
</P>
<P>
 The job would go to National Airmotive Corp., according to staff reports. TOM

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PLAN TO CURB LOUD PARTIES GAINS SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents appear to be in support of the city's impending party ordinance, 
which would use fines to curtail loud parties in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six residents attended an informational meeting last week to discuss the 
measure and all of them favored the new controls, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Andy Gonis acknowledged that the ordinance is being discussed 
during the city's off-season, when visitors who rent homes are not yet in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who are renting at this time of year are long-term 
leases," he said, adding the ordinance is designed precisely to protect those 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to deter those (renters) who come down here simply to take 
advantage of others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, tentatively approved by the City Council last week, is expected 
to get final approval in January.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city bills the tenants of "party houses" $150 if police have to 
go to the same address more than once in 30 days to quiet loud parties. Under 
the new ordinance, fines would rise to $250 for the second party call within a 
year, to $500 for the third call and $750 for the fourth and any subsequent 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the stiff fines, police maintained they are not looking at the measure 
as way to raise revenue.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not hoping to generate money," Gonis said. "What we're hoping to do is 
end the party problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of west Newport, where police traditionally have had to answer the 
bulk of complaints about loud parties, requested the controls to curtail 
rowdiness and noise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police have enlisted the aid of rental agents and property management 
agencies to inform tenants, especially week-to-week renters who visit between 
Memorial Day and Labor Day, of the penalties if parties get out of hand, Gonis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would also gives officers some discretion in applying the 
penalties when answering party-call complaints, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What one person calls just having a good time may be a tremendous irritant to 
someone else," Gonis said. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 If approved, the suggestions will be sent to the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, which is working with the California Department of Transportation on 
the freeway art project that will include other cities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbols, which represent the history and essence of Costa Mesa and the 
outlying region, will be part of a fiberglass mural that will, in different 
places, line the Costa Mesa Freeway from Fairview Road to 19th Street and the 
Corona del Mar Freeway from Bear Street to the San Diego Freeway, according to 
a committee report. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is developing art concepts, according to the report, for various 
freeways in the county and the project is federally funded.  
</P>
<P>
 The art will consist of a double row of three-foot-square panels depicting 
local symbols and stretching for blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea; it's an effort to make the freeways more pleasant," 
said Libby Cowan, a planning commissioner who sat on the committee. TOM RAGAN

 Oil drilling figured prominently in the history of Brea, a city that's name 
comes from the Spanish word for tar or oil. In the foothills above Brea, tar 
could be seen oozing out of cracks in the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 This seepage was duly noted by Edward L. Doheny, who drilled a number of 
successful oil wells in the foothills in 1897. Doheny soon started a 
partnership with Santa Fe Railway Co., which was investigating the possibility 
of using oil as a locomotive fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of oil production in the 1920s, about 500 people worked the 
fields. However, the population dropped sharply due to the Great Depression and 
the development of oil drilling methods that were less labor intensive. Today

SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER ARRESTED IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>

 A 34-year-old Brea woman died when a suspected drunk driver rear-ended her 
car, slamming it into a power pole, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna G. Davis is believed to have died instantly when her car went over a 
curb and into the pole shortly before 7 p.m. Saturday, according to Huntington 
Beach Police Sgt. William Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Michael P. Rooney, 29, of Huntington Beach on suspicion of 
vehicular manslaughter and felony driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the mother of two young children, was driving east on Adams Avenue past 
Magnolia Street when Rooney drove up from behind, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said witnesses reported that Rooney appeared to be driving more than 70 
m.p.h. when he rear-ended Davis' car, sending her vehicle onto the sidewalk and 
into a power pole. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he underwent 
surgery for internal injuries suffered in the crash, Martin said. After 
treatment, he was moved to the hospital's jail ward. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified male passenger in Davis' car also was hurt and was taken to 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with undisclosed injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Rooney could face up to six years in prison on the vehicular 
manslaughter charge alone, authorities said.

'DUMB' LAUGHS = A SMART PAYOFF; BOX OFFICE: JIM CARREY VEHICLE PULLS A 'GUMP,' 
TAKING IN $16.2 MILLION ON AN OTHERWISE SLOW FILM-GOING WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 By never underestimating the American public, the puerile comedy "Dumb and 
Dumber," starring Jim Carrey, found prosperity through stupidity on its opening 
weekend. As was demonstrated by "Forrest Gump," dumb sells, and "Dumb" sold a 
numbing $16.2 million in tickets at 2,447 movie screens.  
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, film attendance was about par with last year, as theaters struggled 
valiantly to break out of the post-Thanksgiving stupor. The weekend's only 
other nationwide debut, "Speechless," a romantic comedy starring Geena Davis 
and Michael Keaton, had little to shout about with only $4.1 million on 1,404 
screens and a fourth-place finish, according to preliminary estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other limited releases, Jodie Foster's star turn in "Nell" and Gary Oldman 
trading in his Dracula duds for Beethoven's cutaway in "Immortal Beloved," both 
got off to only OK starts, doing about $30,000 a theater. "Nell" was on two 
screens, "Beloved" on four. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey, who apart from Tom Hanks must be 1994's biggest star, made it 
three-for-three this year. "Dumb," for which he received a smart $7 million, 
follows on the heels of "Ace Ventura" and "The Mask." 
</P>
<P>
 New Line distribution head Mitch Goldman couldn't help crowing that the 
sophomoric exercise's freshman weekend took in almost as much as "Dumb" cost to 
make (only $18 million, despite the big bucks for Carrey). And his 
$16.2-million estimate is conservative, Goldman said, which gives the film a 
shot at being the biggest Christmas opening ever, a spot currently held by "The 
Pelican Brief" which debuted to $16.8 million over the same weekend last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young males and families made up the bulk of the weekend's theater audiences. 
"The Santa Clause" held on to second place with $8.6 million, helped greatly by 
being piggy-backed with sneak previews for "Jungle Book" on Friday and 
Saturday. Tim Allen and his reindeer have rustled up $107.1 million and should 
continue to keep audiences amused through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's other hearty performer, "The Lion King," added another $1.9 million 
and is now at$291 million with a holiday business boost around the corner. Even 
the disappointing "Miracle on 34th Street" had enough seasonal appeal to round 
out the Top 10 with $1.3 million over the weekend, although it's grossed only 
$14.1 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Most adult-oriented films were less popular over the weekend. Though it's 
expected to rebound, the sexual harassment drama "Disclosure" doesn't look to 
be another "Fatal Attraction" or "Basic Instinct," despite the star pairing of 
Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. After a lower-than-expected $10-million debut a 
week earlier, second-weekend business dropped 27% to about $7.3 million and 
third place at the box office. Industry pundits are already doing the 20/20 
hindsight bit with "Disclosure," claiming Warner Bros. opened it at the wrong 
time of year, when adults are not going to movies, overlooking the 
aforementioned record-breaking debut of "Pelican Brief" last year. Still, when 
adults do return to the movies after the holidays, this might be the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe not. It's shaping into a peculiar end to an otherwise great 
year for ticket sales. The big commercial titles that had opened around 
Thanksgiving, such as "Interview With the Vampire" and "Junior," were expected 
to tide things over until Christmas Day. They're not. "Interview" dropped to 
11th place with $1.2 million over the weekend, although it has already grossed 
$97 million. "Junior," which captured another $1.6 million and eighth place at 
the box office, has only $26.4 million to its name and will have to struggle to 
get to $35 million, a major disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Star Trek: Generations" is not over yet, but early indications that it might 
reach $100 million have evanesced. Nonetheless, with $1.75 million over the 
weekend and in seventh place, "Trek" is now at $65 million and will rank as one 
of the season's hits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the action front, Wesley Snipes' "Drop Zone" fell to $3.8 million (fifth 
place) in its second weekend for only $12 million to date. The lower-budgeted 
"Low Down Dirty Shame" will end up in the respectable column with $1.4 million 
over the weekend (ninth place) and $23 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight new films enter the already crowded fray over the next week. To make 
matters worse at the box office, Christmas and New Year's fall on Sundays, 
eating into what are otherwise two strong holiday movie-going weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Handicappers expect "Dumb" to fend off the competition, since it's the only 
youth film (over 12 years old ) around, except for the coming action-adventure 
"Streetfighter" with Jean-Claude Van Damme. "Santa Clause" should also have a 
Merry Christmas, though other family choices will be nipping at its nose, 
including "Lion King," the upcoming live-action version of "Jungle Book," 
"Little Women" and Macaulay Culkin in "Richie Rich." Adults may finally get out 
to see "Disclosure" or instead opt for the national debut of "Nell."  
</P>
<P>
 And "Speechless" will have to fend off another romantic comedy, "I.Q." 
starring Meg Ryan, Robert Altman's fashion fluff "Ready to Wear" and Steve 
Martin in the antic "Mixed Nuts."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: ISOLATIONIST TV: VIEWERS PAY THE PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's curious the things that pique your interest when you have a videotape 
universe at your fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, for example, is a video that former NBC foreign correspondent Arthur 
Kent mailed a short time ago. Available only in video stores, his 30-minute 
documentary is titled "Return to Afghanistan." 
</P>
<P>
 Long a preferred invasion route for outsiders, Afghanistan is where violent 
history plays out again and again. Network newscasts paid relatively close 
attention from time to time when occupation forces from the former Soviet Union 
and U.S.-backed guerrillas battled it out there during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the battered Soviets withdrew from the land they and their Afghan 
allies had ravaged, "the world turned away, distracted by other wars and 
disasters," Kent says from a serene village that was aflame with war when he 
last visited in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, when did you last see anything about Afghanistan on ABC, 
CBS or NBC? Did the Afghans topple into China? Slashed budgets and narrowed 
ambitions have gripped the once-nightly network news divisions in a bear hug of 
provincialism. When it comes to international news, these days it's hard 
getting them to venture beyond Trafalgar Square. 
</P>
<P>
 So are the Kents of TV journalism a future lane of the information 
superhighway? One that will lead directly to the video store for the only 
electronic source of news (with the exception of occasional pieces on CNN and 
"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour") about hot spots and even lukewarm ones that have 
since vanished from regular newscasts like blips from a radar screen? 
</P>
<P>
 Will privately bankrolled independents like the Canadian Kent, working via the 
home-video market, be the only alternative for in-depth global perspective on 
TV as the networks largely preoccupy themselves with all the news that's fit to 
sensationalize and reduce to headlines? 
</P>
<P>
 And putting aside Kent's highly worthy documentary for the moment, what is 
this? The face, the voice . Like a trusted ghost of Yule past, it's Wooly 
Walter filling the screen in "The Cronkite Report," Wednesday's 60-minute 
documentary on the Discovery Channel exploring "Christianity Reborn: Prayer and 
Politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Cronkite has worked on TV sporadically since ending his long reign as the Mt. 
Rushmore of CBS News. He has been doing these quarterly programs for The 
Discovery Channel since May, 1993, and getting even this small whiff of him 
turns you into an instant nostalgianik. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, however, is the deep imprint of fairness and civility he puts on 
this hour as narrator and reporter, just as Kent does on his documentary. The 
program is somehow meticulously balanced without being wimpy, as Cronkite 
visits numerous venues of Christianity, from the user-friendly WillowCreek 
Community Church -- a vast edifice of soft-sell evangelism -- to the First 
Iconium Baptist Church, where hard-preaching Rev. Tim McDonald rails against 
the "family values" of "right-wing religious folk."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No agenda is favored here, and even when Cronkite gathers some of these 
polar-opposite Christians around a table for a brief chat, the debate is calm 
and free of the emotional "Crossfire" harangue that we've come to expect from 
such televised disagreements about religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christianity," Cronkite says early in the program, "is thriving and as 
prosperous as it's ever been in the United States." He adds that "religion is 
alive and well in America." If he's right on both counts, then shame on 
mainstream TV for virtually ignoring Christianity and just about all religion 
outside of Sunday mornings, except for the anti-abortion screamers and 
hard-right political ideologues who regularly capture the attention of 
newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 And shame on mainstream TV news for playing the role of isolationist and doing 
so little to widen its landscape beyond the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Christianity Reborn," Kent's documentary is also about renewal, at least 
in the rebuilding community that he initially revisits, a now-quiet village 
just 50 miles from bloody civil strife still raging in the Afghan capital of 
Kabul -- a lingering torture, featuring competing warlords, that probably few 
Americans are aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent juxtaposes his footage from 1986 with his latest pictures. He finds 
familiar faces, including a man who embodies the spirit of the surviving 
guerrillas who resisted the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time you took our picture after the jets bombed us," the man says through 
an interpreter, "we came back to rebuild. And then they bombed us again. Again 
we went to the mountains and returned, only to have our houses bombed again."  
</P>
<P>
 No quitter, the man recalls this standing in front of his new house. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kabul, though, death and suffering cover the city like a shroud. Kent 
revisits the now-barren killing fields where a thriving bazaar once stood. And 
"the avenue with style" that he shot in 1986 is now an unrecognizable ruin. At 
a Kabul hospital, foreign aid workers in a crowded operating room face the same 
dangers as their patients, evidenced by the rocket attack that forces them into 
a basement shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenes recall the Bosnia-Herzogovina massacres on today's slender network 
news agenda. "The fighting is just for power," Kent is told by a gritty and 
determined young man who is head of his family despite being only 19. His body 
a stump, he has lost his legs in the explosion of a mine left behind by the 
departed Soviets. Members of his family help him into his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Christianity Reborn: Prayer and Politics" airs at 10 p.m. Wednesday on the 
Discovery Channel.

'NELL': NOT ALONE IN THE WILDS; CHILDREN RAISED IN ISOLATION IS FAMILIAR FILM 
THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARIN LIPSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her feral crouch, her wild screams, her eerie crooning in a language all 
her own, she seems at first more an animal than a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Nell -- the title role played by Jodie Foster in the film that opened 
last week -- is an admittedly offbeat character, she's hardly unique. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this tale of a young woman hidden from birth in a backwoods cabin by 
her mother is part of a long tradition of books, plays and films with an oddly 
compelling, shared subject: Call it the feral child, the "wolf" child, the wild 
child -- it's the child raised, by accident or design, without normal human 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Think, for openers, of Kipling's "Mowgli," raised as a wolf (also resurfacing 
this season in Disney's new live-action "Jungle Book"). Or of Edgar Rice 
Burroughs' "Tarzan of the Apes": A British nobleman by birth, he becomes a son 
of the jungle after his true parents die. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a more contemporary vein, think of Francois Truffaut's haunting 1970 film, 
"The Wild Child," based on a true story; the 1984 movie "Greystoke" ("Tarzan" 
for grown-ups), or this year's Alice Hoffman novel, "Second Nature." It seems 
as though creative types have hardly lagged behind scientists in their 
fascination with these wild and mysterious beings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a romantic notion, really. We have this image of wildness being somehow 
pristine and wonderful," says Mark Handley, who wrote the play on which "Nell" 
is based and gets co-screenwriting credit with William Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when wildness is a lot less than wonderful (remember the young, 
unreachable Helen Keller in "The Miracle Worker"?), it intrigues us, suggesting 
what's locked beneath the lid of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 As one character in "Nell" -- part of the battalion of psychologists eager to 
study her -- puts it: "How is the personality formed? We don't know. What is 
innate? We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Because, as he explains, "You can't take a baby and have it grow up in a lab." 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of a "wild child," then, offers unique opportunities for study 
-- but not necessarily for change. (In fact, modern research suggests that such 
children often have permanent learning and language problems.) 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, disappointment was the outcome of the most famous such case: the 
"wild child of Aveyron," whose story was popularized by Truffaut. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy appeared one day in 1800, naked and covered with scars, on the edge of 
a forest in France. News of the young "savage" who made only meaningless cries 
intrigued a Paris doctor, Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard, who decided to teach him to 
be human. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Itard's journal, Truffaut's "The Wild Child" (with the director as 
Itard) recounts the doctor's partly successful efforts to educate and socialize 
"Victor," as he's called. While the movie ends on an ambiguous note, the real 
story ended more sadly: Discouraged by his failure to teach the boy language, 
which he considered the key to human identity, Itard ultimately abandoned his 
effort and his charge, who was left in the care of a kindly old woman. Victor 
died in 1828, forgotten by all and belonging nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar case in Germany, involving an abused teen-ager, helped inspire the 
Mark Handley play on which "Nell" is based. In fact, the sad tale of Kaspar 
Hauser -- an emaciated, mute 16-year-old who mysteriously showed up in 1828 in 
the town square of Nuremberg -- has also inspired no fewer than two German 
films, by Werner Herzog and Peter Sehr, and a play by Austrian writer Peter 
Handke. It has even given rise to a psychological term for a special kind of 
child abuse: "soul murder." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other than his name, which was written on a note attached to his clothes, 
Kaspar Hauser's origins always remained a mystery. His unfolding memory, 
though, suggested a horrific life among unnamed captors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently, the people who took care of Kaspar (later) decided he had been 
locked in a closet for the first years of his life," Handley says. "How do you 
survive something like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was reading Handke's play, which explores how the acquisition of language 
affects Kaspar Hauser, that "planted the seed" of his own work, Handley says. 
</P>
<P>
 The seed blossomed into the play "Idioglossia" -- a term for speech so 
idiosyncratic that it seems to be a language of its own -- after Handley read a 
news account of 6-year-old San Diego twins who did, indeed, speak a language 
only they could understand. The story of their "twinspeak" eventually gave rise 
to "Nellish," as Nell's almost impenetrable speech is dubbed by her handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Language is the most precisely human trait we have," suggests Handley, and 
adults such as Nell "offer a glimpse at a stage of development that we 
associate so much with childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of written language figures in Alice Hoffman's bestseller "Second 
Nature," a novel that has been described as part "Pygmalion" story, part wild 
child comes to Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The only survivor of a plane crash in Michigan, Hoffman's wild child is 
brought up from age 3 by wolves. The Wolf Man, as the doctors call him, is 
brought as an adult to an island off Nassau County by a well-meaning woman who 
believes that "once he could read and write he could decide his own fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Life, of course, is more complicated than that, and the Wolf Man feels "as 
though he were losing something" every time he writes a word. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he is. It is one of the messages of "Nell" that the world's 
well-meaning civilizers risk obliterating the very traits they most admire in 
the wild child: The link with nature and an unclouded sense of self. With each 
superimposed bit of civilization, Handley says, "they destroy the gift."

STRAIGHT-AHEAD JAZZ IN AN OFFBEAT SETTING; KIKUYA RESTAURANT IN HUNTINGTON 
BEACH OFFERS A STEADY MENU OF TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's the kind of up-close and personal jazz gig music fans like best: 
</P>
<P>
 * The respected pianist with a host of big-name credits -- including a spot in 
arguably the most-famous television house band of all time -- joins the venue's 
regular trio for a night of standards. The setting is so intimate that when the 
keyboardist cracks one of his trademark smiles you can literally count his 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Or the saxophonist/flutist with historic ties to such late greats as Charles 
Mingus and Eric Dolphy, as well as being a West Coast legend in his own right, 
stands toe-to-toe with the audience. When he picks up his flute, the assembled 
can literally see his lip quiver as he sustains a bright, clear tone. 
</P>
<P>
 The house trio that backs these guests is no slouch, either. The 
guitarist-leader has a couple of fine CDs out, one of which includes the likes 
of bassist Ray Brown and drummer Jake Hanna. The bassist is a swell composer, 
lyricist and leader who can pull a big sound out of his upright. The drummer 
has a list of credits you can't beat with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look now, but straight-ahead jazz, all but extinct in Orange County this 
year, is staging a small but important comeback. The setting is an unlikely 
one: the lounge of Kikuya Japanese Restaurant in Huntington Beach. But there, 
three nights each week, wafting through the air along with the smells of frying 
tempura and chicken teriyaki, is the sound of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The place has a real nightclub feel with its black walls and spotlighted 
bandstand. Behind the musicians, the wall is lined with mirrors that throw 
reflections into the adjoining bar. A booth along the back wall is elevated so 
patrons can see over those sitting in front. A glossy black grand piano 
separates the band from the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 General manager Wayne Y. Chin has been looking to increase business at the 
restaurant with entertainment since it opened in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the piano from the beginning, but it took us a while to get the 
entertainment license. I started putting jazz in right away (after getting the 
entertainment license) in March. I tried (house band leader) Doug MacDonald out 
after (singer) Jack Wood introduced us last spring, then used him again in 
August. He's been doing the weekends since the first of October, as long as 
he's not previously engaged. And Jack does the Thursdays." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald has brought in the biggest names, including the aforementioned 
former "Tonight Show" pianist Ross Tompkins and saxophonist Buddy Collette. 
Other headliners include singer Stephanie Haynes and saxophonist-flutist Sam 
Most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to bring in some of the better-known L.A. musicians," MacDonald 
said, "as well as some of the talented locals from the Orange County area. It's 
a balancing act, but I just want to make sure we're representing good jazz 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood modeled his Thursday night jazz party after the one Larry Ober holds 
weekly at the Laguna Niguel Holiday Inn.  
</P>
<P>
 "But in my case, I rotate the piano players and let the trio do a short set. 
Then, after a break, I come out and do a set, all standards, straight-ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood adds to the room's atmosphere Thursdays by bringing in his own sound 
system and lighting. Then, after his set, he welcomes guests in a jam session 
atmosphere ("all professionals," he emphasizes). 
</P>
<P>
 Pianists have included Joe Massimino, Mike Jordan and Marc LeBrun. Vocalist 
Micki Rhyne, who makes frequent appearances at Merv Griffin's Resorts 
International Hotel in Atlantic City, was in earlier this month, and local 
favorite Shelley Moore has also dropped by. Most weeks, local favorite Josie 
Courreges is a guest. (She spent the years around 1970 appearing with guitarist 
Hayden Causey's group at Don Jose's restaurant, just down the street from 
Kikuya.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other nights of the week at Kikuya have belonged to karaoke (Tuesday), classic 
rock and top 40 (Wednesday) and a Hawaiian night with Polynesian dancers and 
music (Sunday), but the restaurant is looking to turn both Wednesdays and 
Sundays over to jazz in January. Mondays are the only nights without 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chin says he's been looking for the right mix since he began to hire 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a blend (of entertainment) so I can cater to a wide group of 
customers. I want to bring in some contemporary music, some Latin, some fusion. 
The younger customers aren't always into straight-ahead music. So I'm still 
trying to figure out what really works in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Prather, the bassist in MacDonald's trio and leader of the popular 
Southern California band Bopsicle, which appeared there recently says it's hard 
for any venue to get a jazz program established. He recently saw Bopsicle's 
regular Sunday engagement at the Capo Beach Steak House canceled, though two 
recent tributes to songwriters George Gershwin and Cole Porter, both organized 
with singer Dewey Erney and held at DeMario's, were moderately successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that jazz in Orange County, because of the rising economic situation, 
is just a micro-smidgen better than it was last year at this time," he said, 
"but I don't see any great changes. Club owners really have to get behind 
promotion, and take advantage of the local media and get the word out." 
</P>
<P>
 Prather, and other musicians interviewed for this article, stressed that 
restaurant owners must show patience while the music policy is established.  
</P>
<P>
 "These things don't catch on overnight," say Prather. "It takes time to build 
an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds MacDonald: "I'd like to see Kikuya become a neighborhood kind of place, a 
place where people in the local Huntington Beach area can show up on any 
weekend night and know that, no matter who is working there, they're going to 
see first-rate jazz. If we have to draw people from all over Orange County to 
fill the room, we're not going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Chin reports only mixed success at Kikuya. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had singer Carol Rogers (from the Sergio Mendes band) one weekend and it 
was empty. It was also very quiet when Sam Most and Buddy Collette were here. 
But things seem to be getting better now that we've had some notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Chin is looking forward to having in saxophonist Jeff Kashiwa (from fusion 
band The Rippingtons) on Dec. 29 with Wood and pianist Mike Jordan, hoping that 
Kashiwa's appearance will attract a younger audience to join his regulars.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the younger listeners know who people like Buddy Collette and 
Sam Most are. I'm going to stick with it, but I have to do something to make up 
the difference. Maybe we'll consider charging a cover. But not for now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, bookings look promising. MacDonald plans to lead a nine-piece brass 
ensemble with tuba, French horn, trombone and two trumpets in both jazz and 
seasonal music this Friday and Saturday. And Alan Broadbent, known for his work 
in Charlie Haden's Quartet West, has agreed to a date in January, a rare treat 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Booking jazz into a restaurant has always been a risky business, and the past 
few years have seen more than a few venues either close their doors to jazz or 
just plain close. The last 18 months have seen the closing the of Cafe Lido in 
Newport Beach as well as the discontinuation of jazz at Vinnie's Restaurant in 
Costa Mesa and Maxwell's in Huntington Beach. Even Chin, who doesn't levy a 
cover charge, isn't overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm not breaking even (on the music). Some people think they can 
come in and listen to jazz and just have a glass of water. That's fine, but it 
doesn't pay for it. I'm still keeping an eye on things to see how it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 * Kikuya is at 8052 Adams Ave., Huntington Beach. Jazz begins 
Thursday-Saturday at 8 p.m. No cover. (714) 536-6665.

'HOME IMPROVEMENT' GIVES ABC TOP BLOC ON THE BLOCK; TELEVISION: NETWORK HAS THE 
HIGHEST-RATED TWO-HOUR VIEWING PERIOD AND TOP TWO OVERALL SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The TV season is nearly at the halfway mark, and viewers have registered their 
likes and dislikes -- loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ratings, where the so-called official season runs from September to 
April, ABC's two-hour Tuesday night block of "Home Improvement," "Grace Under 
Fire" and "NYPD Blue" has firmly established itself as network TV's favorite 
viewing period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home Improvement," which NBC challenged with "Frasier" in the key matchup of 
the fall, is still the nation's No. 1 show in season-to-date ratings. "Grace 
Under Fire" is close behind at No. 2 -- and recently displaced "Home 
Improvement" for several weeks at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue," meanwhile, is a solid No. 5 and, in fact, is performing 
spectacularly in audience pull with its new leading man, Jimmy Smits, who 
replaced David Caruso when he decided to pursue a film career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso's farewell episode last month drew a whopping audience, as expected, 
but Smits has moved in easily, and nervousness over the show's future following 
Caruso's departure seems to have evaporated quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frasier," meanwhile, has more than held its own as NBC's anchor show in 
establishing a Tuesday lineup. It is No. 11 for the season, and there is no 
more finely crafted weekly comedy series on network television. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, "Frasier" has helped raise the sitcom that follows it, 
"The John Larroquette Show," from 88th place last season to 39th this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the momentum provided by "Frasier" has clearly carried over to 
the show that follows "Larroquette" as well, "Dateline NBC," which was 54th 
during last season but now is in 33rd place. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to ABC's Tuesday trio of blockbusters, viewers' other favorite 
programming block is "Seinfeld" and "ER," the sensationally successful new 
medical series, on NBC Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seinfeld" and "ER" are No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, this season. But the 
show that has linked them, the new sitcom "Madman of the People," is ho-hum 
despite its No. 14 ranking, which is only attributable to being sandwiched 
between the two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking of "NYPD Blue" and "ER" in the top five is a pleasant sight for 
fans of good TV dramas, which are regaining their popularity with viewers 
following a slump in which cheaper, tabloid-tinged newsmagazines began taking 
their place and infecting prime time with sleaze and sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, re-enacted reality shows are also showing signs of popularity 
loss. CBS' "Rescue 911," which was No. 21 last season, is No. 43 since the 
1994-95 competition began in September. And NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries," which 
was No. 33 last season, currently is No. 78. 
</P>
<P>
 The newsmagazine drop-off has also been highly noticeable. In a key matchup, 
"ER" all but destroyed one of ABC's mainstay magazines, "PrimeTime Live," in 
the ratings, forcing it to be moved from Thursdays to Wednesdays next month. 
</P>
<P>
 While "ER" is No. 4 in the ratings, "PrimeTime Live" has plummeted to 57th 
place. Last season, it was a powerful No. 19 for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 And although "Dateline NBC" is No. 33, it still is no match for its head-on 
competition of "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "ER" has also made mincemeat out of another competing newsmagazine, CBS' "Eye 
to Eye With Connie Chung." And on Wednesdays, yet another first-rate drama, 
NBC's "Law & Order," walloped CBS' "48 Hours" for most of the season, although 
the magazine turned in stronger numbers recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, in its overall matchup, "Law & Order" is doing better than ever 
in 22nd place -- a vast improvement over its No. 49 finish last season. "48 
Hours," meanwhile, has slipped from 46th place last season to 62nd since 
autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 What with crime-heavy local news, syndicated tabloid series and freak-show 
talk programs, it is likely that viewers are simply tiring of even more such 
stuff in newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
 How many programs on the O.J. Simpson case can viewers swallow without gagging 
at the repetition, the stretching for angles, the analysis that goes poof in 
the air? How many sordid crimes and sob stories can viewers stomach? The 
occasional positive tale of heroism cannot reverse the nightly overall impact. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There can never be a shortage of stories, but it's all in the telling and 
especially in the attitude. And after a while, a kind of boredom and/or 
revulsion sets in as the relentless pounding of the underside of life makes 
voyeurs of us all, insensitive to just more slimy twists on what we seem to 
have seen a thousand times. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the fall season, 10 newsmagazines were either on or planned 
for 1994-95. Fox had already canceled "Front Page" and then ditched plans for a 
newsmagazine called "Full Disclosure." CBS had also canceled "America Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the leaders of the pack, "60 Minutes" and "20/20," are still 
doing well. But ABC's "Turning Point," even with such names as Barbara Walters 
and Diane Sawyer, was switched from a weekly show to specials. And other 
newsmagazines either are or may be in a state of flux, with the networks sizing 
up new time slots in hopes of reviving them. 
</P>
<P>
 When the season began, the TV industry was wondering whether "60 Minutes" 
would lose ground because it no longer had the lead-in, in much of the country, 
of National Football League games, which CBS had lost to the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
 "60 Minutes" is still in 6th place among all shows, but it has slipped in its 
share of the audience. Last season, it averaged 34% of viewers, higher than any 
other prime-time series. This season, it is averaging 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 Drama viewers, meanwhile, are giving more of a look to CBS' "Picket Fences," 
probably in part because of its two consecutive Emmy Awards as best show. Last 
season, it was No. 66. Now it is No. 51. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fox's cult favorite, "The X-Files," which was No. 111 last season, 
has climbed to 69th place. 
</P>
<P>
 But two of the most-praised dramas on the air simply can't seem to make a dent 
in the ratings. ABC's "My So-Called Life," an incisive work about a teen-age 
girl, is 93rd among 103 series thus far. And NBC's police show, "Homicide: Life 
on the Street," is 85th. A pity. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch of ABC's "Roseanne" from Tuesday to Wednesdays, against weaker 
competition, may well have prolonged the run of the show. Before the move, the 
other networks clearly felt it was becoming vulnerable with age, despite 
admiration for the show. Now, after the move, it remains a valuable weapon for 
ABC, ranking No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC is the No. 1 network as midseason approaches, averaging a 12.2 rating in 
prime time (each point represents 954,000 homes). Although it remains the 
favorite, less than one rating point separates the Big Three networks. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, helped by such specials as the revivals of "The Rockford Files" and 
"Cagney & Lacey," is second with an 11.9 rating. But it has failed to develop 
prime-time series that generate excitement. And the lower-than-expected ratings 
for the miniseries "Scarlett" was a blow to its chances for a quick, dramatic 
move into first place. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, with an 11.5 rating and two great big new hits since last season -- "ER" 
and "Frasier" -- is third but has bounced back and is giving ABC a run for its 
money with the 18-to-49-year-old audience favored by sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the ratings race of the networks' three evening news shows, it's still 
all ABC. The network's "World News Tonight With Peter Jennings" has finished 
first for 118 of the past 119 weeks. CBS' relatively new anchor team of Dan 
Rather and Connie Chung is second but not even within shouting distance.

FRENCH AUTEUR TAKES A CUT FROM HOLLYWOOD EDITORS; FILMS: PATRICE CHEREAU'S 
'QUEEN MARGOT' WAS LONG AND TURGID. BUT 190 SNIPS LATER, THE MOVIE IS READY FOR 
THE AMERICAN MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES BREMNER, THE TIMES OF LONDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To put it mildly, the French film industry does not like taking lessons from 
Hollywood, so there was much spluttering when it was learned that the Americans 
had been allowed to wield their scissors on "La Reine Margot." ("Queen Margot" 
opened last week in Los Angeles.) The film was the year's Gallic flagship, 
which means it conformed to the profile of being a very long, very expensive, 
over-wrought epic of the costume variety starring Gerard Depardieu or Isabelle 
Adjani or preferably both. 
</P>
<P>
 The official film carries the flag at Cannes; patriotic duty drives the 
citizens to see it and the critics have the task of struggling to find ways to 
avoid the word boring.  
</P>
<P>
 When it came out in the spring of this year, "La Reine Margot," a 
17-million-pound melodrama of lust, blood and poison starring Adjani, was so 
turgid that it made "Germinal," the gruesome coal-mine opera of last year, look 
like a romantic comedy. In addition, it lasts nearly three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbound by political correctness, Variety damned it at Cannes with a simple 
headline: "Bloody Margot Fails to Fascinate." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Margot" has lost money and the heavily subsidized French industry is 
desperate to export, Claude Berri, the producer, accepted the demand by 
Miramax, the American distributors, for a total re-edit. American screenings 
had simply put the audience to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "How dare they!" was the first reaction among the auteurs of the Left Bank, a 
breed that does not even let its own producers touch its offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the result of the 190 cuts and added music has been so impressive that 
Berri and Patrice Chereau, the director, have swallowed their pride and are now 
singing the praises of Yankee know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no shame in listening to the Americans," Chereau said. "It is true 
they push hard . . . But their cinema works and we have things to learn from 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the notoriously difficult Adjani, who makes a film only every few years, 
is full of praise, saying that "Margot" is now "much more romantic." To crown 
it all, the slimmed-down Margot is about to be relaunched on the French public. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, it has the extremely rare task of competing with another French 
film, Luc Besson's "The Professional." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jacques Toubon, the Gaullist culture minister, is not crowing over 
Besson's hit because the film is not only made in English and set in New York, 
but it is also a gore-sodden tale of serial murder that makes "Natural Born 
Killers" look like "Howards End."

O.C. AGENCIES RELIEVED BY FUND NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At Hope House, the news lent a bit of extra cheer to the annual potluck 
Christmas dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 At Phoenix House, a senior counselor could only say, "Whoopee!" There were 
deep sighs of relief Sunday at relief agencies throughout Orange County as news 
spread that a council managing Orange County's dwindled funds had authorized 
emergency payments to 108 desperate nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll help us survive," said Marc Corradini, executive director of Hope 
House, a long-term residential drug abuse program with 40 beds in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner said Sunday that nonprofit groups in dire 
straits will get $2.9 million in emergency aid later this week, payment for 
services the nonprofit agencies performed before the county declared 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole host of organizations and contractors that are an extension 
of county government, that provide vital services to all kinds of people," 
Steiner said. The money will help a vast network of such groups, which help the 
needy, the addicted and the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, Steiner said, checks should be delivered to emergency homes for 
foster children, shelters for battered women and agencies that prevent child 
abuse. The list is long, full of nonprofit groups that feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Corradini, for instance, said Hope House might have folded soon without the 
$79,000 owed it by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was going to be real close," he said. "We might have been able to live 
hand-to-mouth. . . . But I didn't want to be on the short end." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their personal troubles, residents at the treatment center were 
distracted by the crisis, Corradini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what's going on and they were reading the papers and asking me, so 
I pretty much let them know what our status was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corradini said he lived in fear of being forced to turn people away for lack 
of a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We literally were turning out lights in our therapy room and trying to get 
food donated, because there's not much fat in our budget." 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute reprieve came as Hope House residents were sitting down to a 
potluck supper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families brought in (food) to celebrate Christmas," Corradini said. "So (the 
news) comes at a very nice time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Haden, program director at Costa Mesa's Heritage House, to which the 
county owes $39,672, almost burst into song when she heard the county would be 
able to pay her center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, thank God!" she said. "Yeah, we've really been sweating it. We were told 
our fund had been frozen. Oh, wonderful. Oh, that's so great." 
</P>
<P>
 Haden was spending Sunday afternoon baking Christmas cookies with 16 mothers, 
four pregnant women and 17 children who live at the center, a drug and alcohol 
recovery shelter for women and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the women and children were preparing for a Christmas that had been 
looking bleak because of the county's sudden financial swoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for the center was so dim before Sunday's good news, in fact, that 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle clubs were rallying to collect toys for the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been extremely anxious," Haden said. "We've all been really kind of down 
over the whole thing. We weren't sure what was going to happen to us. We were 
told by our supervisor that funds had been frozen and they were going to do the 
best they could to keep (our) doors open. This is just great news." 
</P>
<P>
 At Phoenix House, a substance abuse program in Santa Ana, the staff was 
overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can really just say, 'Whoopee!' " said senior counselor Lena Lindsey Stern. 
"I'm in a very good mood. Very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said it had been an anxious week, not knowing if the county would be 
able to pay the $92,034 it owes Phoenix House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little worried and frightened," she said. "I'm glad because we do 
have a lot of people that need help."

CRASH IN N. KOREA KILLED U.S. PILOT; ASIA: CLINTON PRESSES PYONGYANG FOR PROMPT

 One of two pilots aboard a U.S. Army helicopter that went down after straying 
into North Korean airspace over the weekend was killed, the White House 
reported Sunday, and President Clinton pressed the Communist government in 
Pyongyang for the prompt return of the surviving pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon, 29, of Clarksville, Tenn., was killed in 
the Saturday crash, Clinton said in a statement. The President said Hilemon's 
death was confirmed by U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who is in the North 
Korean capital as part of a congressional visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The second pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall of Brooksville, Fla., is 
alive and apparently uninjured, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that Richardson will continue to relay information to 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and that Washington is "using all 
available channels to press for an early resolution of this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson has asked the North Korean government to grant him prompt access to 
Hall and to allow him to transport Hilemon's remains to a U.S. military 
facility, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tragic loss of life was unnecessary. Our primary concern now is the 
welfare of Chief Warrant Officer Hall and his return, along with the body of 
Chief Warrant Officer Hilemon," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of both of these dedicated 
aviators," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Hall, wife of the surviving aviator, wept when contacted by the 
Associated Press at their home in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated that my husband is safe, but my heart goes out to the family of 
the other man," Hall said, crying what she described as "tears of joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilemon's widow, Berit, issued a statement in Tennessee saying: "I can find 
comfort in the fact that David died doing something he loved -- flying and 
defending our country. He was a dedicated and loving husband, who enjoyed 
flying and his life as an Army aviator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask that everyone honor my wishes and respect my privacy and the privacy of 
the rest of David's family during our time of grief." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military officials were scheduled to meet today with North Korean 
counterparts at the truce village of Panmunjom to begin working out preliminary 
arrangements for the return of Hall and the remains of Hilemon. If the North 
Koreans agree, the negotiations will move to a higher level involving a meeting 
between North Korean Col. Park Im Soo and U.S. Col. Mark Shoemaker, secretaries 
of the U.N. Military Armistice Commission, to make the actual arrangements. The 
most optimistic scenario envisions the repatriation occurring in the next few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily Panmunjom meetings are the channel of contact for involved parties 
to manage all armistice violations, including the recent incident in which the 
OH-58C helicopter -- a light reconnaissance craft -- went down Saturday after 
taking off from Camp Page, 20 miles south of the DMZ. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials still have not confirmed whether the craft was shot down, as 
Pyongyang said, or made an emergency landing after developing mechanical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But South Korean army observation teams near the eastern end of the DMZ said 
they saw the craft flying at a low altitude in a valley and that it looked like 
it was having difficulty regaining a proper flying route, according to Seoul 
Broadcasting Service reports. They said the helicopter disappeared from view 
and radar about five minutes after it crossed the DMZ. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean army officers told the newspaper Dong-A Ilbo that they saw the 
helicopter disappear into North Korea but heard no gunshots and saw no signs of 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in Seoul speculated that the pilots may have gotten disoriented amid 
the mountainous, rough terrain and a recent snowfall that had covered the 
markers delineating the DMZ boundary. Although South Korean army officers 
quoted by the press in Seoul speculated that the pilots either crashed or 
bungled their landing, the possibility that they were shot down has not been 
ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean soldiers are stationed in guard posts every few hundred yards 
along the 151-mile demarcation line zigzagging from the Sea of Japan on the 
east to the Yellow Sea on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heightened war of words, North Korea accused the United States and South 
Korea of staging a major war exercise involving 560 planes on the southern side 
of the border Thursday and Friday. A U.S. military spokesman denied that and 
reiterated that the helicopter was on a "routine training mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang routinely accuses the United States of staging war exercises as 
propaganda for domestic consumption. The latest accusation is not believed to 
be connected to the helicopter incident, experts on North Korea in Seoul said. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's disclosure of the two pilots' condition raised hopes that the 
incident would be swiftly resolved in the next few days. In 1977, the last time 
a U.S. helicopter drifted into North Korean airspace -- and was shot down -- 
Pyongyang returned the surviving crew member and the bodies of three others who 
were killed three days later. Officials hope for a quick resolution of the 
current incident in light of warmer relations amid serious U.S.-North Korean 
negotiations over the North's nuclear arms program and economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In an agreement earlier this year, North Korea pledged to halt its nuclear 
development program. The United States, in return, pledged to help provide 
Pyongyang with alternative nuclear energy plants that do not readily yield 
plutonium that could be used for nuclear weapons, and to move toward 
normalization of diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea is aware that the new Republican-controlled Congress is more 
skeptical about the nuclear agreement than the Democrats. The North may try to 
score points by quickly repatriating the surviving pilot, Hall, and the remains 
of Hilemon, billing it as "the most magnanimous of gestures," said William 
Taylor, an expert on the military and U.S.-Korean relations with the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee Dong Bok, an expert on North Korea in Seoul, said Pyongyang may still 
try to use the incident as leverage to press for two of its longstanding 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, Lee said, is Pyongyang's desire to eliminate the U.N. Military 
Armistice Commission and negotiate directly with the United States on all 
military-related matters. The commission is charged with supervising the 
armistice that halted the 1950-1953 war between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The North has boycotted high-level meetings of the commission ever since the 
U.S.-led U.N. Command appointed a South Korean general to head it in 1991 and 
Pyongyang recently persuaded the Chinese to walk away as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a good chance North Korea will take advantage of the seizure of the 
servicemen and the downing of the helicopter as an opportunity to beat the 
drums for a separate arrangement with the United States," said Lee, a senior 
visiting lecturer with the Research Institute for National Unification. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said Pyongyang may also try to create a sense of "military tension" over 
the incident to stir up American support to withdraw U.S. troops from South 
Korea -- or to expedite negotiations to normalize relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "North Korea has alternated between looking reasonable and brinkmanship, 
scaring the U.S. public with renewed military conflict," Lee said. "So it would 
be all too logical to come up with this kind of incident to convey that this 
kind of incident takes place because Americans are there (in South Korea) in a 
hostile stance toward North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. Richardson met Sunday with Foreign Minister Kim Yong Nam, 
Supreme People's Assembly Chairman Yang Hyong Sop and Hwang Jang Yop of the 
assembly's Foreign Affairs Commission, according to the Korean Central News 
Agency. There were no details of the talks.

 I lost a beautiful lady to a bitch. . . . That bitch took my lady . . . to 
sell her body for smoke. . . . Stole her heart and body and soul . A once 
beautiful body looks like a bag of bones. . . . I pray she will break that 
chain. To get away and stay away from that bitch cocaine.

</P>
<P>
 Out in abandoned bungalows and broken-down cars, out under the cardboard 
lean-tos of the city's homeless camps and in the clattering halls of 
drug-recovery houses, the addicts talk in metaphors. It is a bitch, a devil, a 
god, a Svengali. It is a lover, an only friend, a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a curse unlike anything that came before. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have it no matter what, and you'll go to any lengths to get 
it," said Sharon Hayes, who remembers times when for five straight days she 
smoked crack cocaine, times when she went without eating, times when she 
engaged in sex for the sole purpose of affording her next high. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Marble lost his job, his family, his home and everything he owned. He 
said he first fully understood the seductive power of the drug the second time 
he used it -- in bed with a woman in a hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I took a drag off the cocaine pipe, I didn't want the sex," Marble said. 
"I just wanted the cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 A lust for crack cocaine is a thread that unites untold thousands of the 
homeless in Los Angeles -- from the garages and back alleys of Boyle Heights to 
the rooftops and beaches of Venice; from the parking lots of Long Beach to the 
wooded parks and railroad tracks of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack is everywhere, a fiercely dominating drug that has eroded much of the 
city's beleaguered core while scattering "mini Skid Rows" throughout poorer 
outlying neighborhoods. Not only has crack substantially added to the number of 
people on the streets, it also has changed very dramatically the nature of 
those streets, making them far rougher, more desperate places. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of a hit, guns blaze, people die, apartments are ransacked, 
windows are smashed. Those who have gone so far as to neglect bills or 
mortgages, giving up beds and refrigerators and indoor plumbing, find it not so 
difficult to make further reckless choices: to prey upon fellow transients and 
the mentally ill, to break into garages and vending machines, to hijack cars 
and hold up liquor stores, to usurp parks and street corners to buy and sell 
and get high. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crass street ethic of the drug, all other rules and priorities submit 
to a single overriding aim: to obtain that next rock. The consequences do not 
always make headlines; far more often, crack merely chisels away, day in, day 
out, at the elaborate underlying framework of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by their cravings, men steal from their families. Young mothers forsake 
baby food and diapers. Teen-agers drop out of school. Employees quit their jobs 
-- or get fired for theft and absenteeism. Institutions such as marriage and 
religion, the axis on which so many moral values revolve, weaken and give way. 
There are husbands who disappear for days or weeks at a time -- the 
intermittent homeless, some still spiraling downward. There are wives and 
girlfriends walking the streets as prostitutes or "strawberries" -- women who 
trade sex for cocaine -- one more route to what addicts call "the curb." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're disadvantaged and you throw crack into that, you absolutely can't 
make it," said Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a family 
service agency on Skid Row. "Crack just crumbles you. It pins you to the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabulating crack's impact on homelessness is, of course, difficult; the 
experts cannot even agree on how many people reside on the nation's streets. 
Certainly, a substantial share of the homeless do not use crack, and crack 
smokers do not inevitably wind up poor, or commit crimes. The roots of poverty 
and lawlessness run deep; some connect, some reach back for decades, some are 
entirely unrelated to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, activists acknowledge that the relationship between the drug and 
homelessness is more closely entwined than many of them would have admitted a 
few years ago. In a vacuum of statistics and hard data, one fact stands out as 
if etched in neon: During crack's 10-year siege, Los Angeles County's estimated 
homeless population has doubled, reaching 75,000 on any given night. 
</P>
<P>
 What alcohol can do over 10 or 20 years, crack can do in a year, or less. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone living paycheck to paycheck, it allows scant time to see the danger 
and regain equilibrium. For someone already homeless, turning to crack for 
escape, the drug becomes a Sisyphean burden. The rock does not permit escape, 
not easily. It is there day and night, on nearly any block, a crushing obstacle 
for those who might otherwise climb out of the depths. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack has thus wrought upon the city a soundless explosion: The shock waves 
were felt, the victims now lie in rows on the sidewalks, but no one really 
heard the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Few communities, if any, have escaped the damage. Homeless crack addicts are 
part of the reason that, in South-Central, 62-year-old Esquine Pettie has had 
to change the time of her Neighborhood Watch meetings to 5 p.m., before dark, 
because it has become so much scarier to go outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sleep in the daytime and rambles at night," Pettie said of the transient 
rock smokers who congregate in parks and abandoned houses, moving every time 
the police flush them out. "They just go from one house to another house. The 
senior citizens say they can't walk to the market, can't go to the bus stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Crack dealers have taken over entire apartment houses in Van Nuys. Dan Faller, 
president of an apartment owners group, remembers one landlord whose tenants 
fled as the dealers moved in, bringing with them the addicts and transients who 
helped to strip the fixtures and render the building uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owner had to walk away and leave it," Faller said. "It's hard. You're 
dealing with somebody who can kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the stages on which crack and homelessness have played as high drama, 
perhaps no town in the nation has offered more compelling theater than Santa 
Monica, a liberal, upscale beach city that once embraced the homeless by 
opening parks to overnight camping and initiating aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before crack addicts began taking the blame for worsening crime and 
turning public opinion against the homeless. In a city of 87,000 residents, 
about 1,000 people living on the streets now account for one-third of police 
calls and up to 45% of bookings in jail, said Police Chief James T. Butts Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Car break-ins have escalated. Apartment tenants have complained of transients 
camping in carports, even setting fires. Despite a citizens' campaign that led 
to the parks being closed again at night, the battle still rages, and many 
residents fear their town is forever changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when -- when your kids got to be about 10 -- you could let 
them walk to the park and play," said Jean Sedillos, who joined a group called 
Save Our City to try to clean up the parks. "You can't do that anymore. At some 
parks, they've taken the doors off the bathrooms because of drugs. You never 
know if a drug deal's going on in the bathrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, police ran sting operations directed at transient cocaine dealers 
in Palisades Park along the bluff-top between the beach and some of the city's 
most opulent hotels. Even after $400,000 in police overtime, the problem 
persisted. Ultimately, City Councilman Kelly Olsen won approval for a 
six-month, $540,000 program establishing a full-time police patrol in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in June, the patrol has won praise, but the money is about to end. 
Many residents do not know what to do. Many feel intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll find that all of the seniors start going home at 4 o'clock," said 
90-year-old Florence Cardine, who considered Santa Monica one of the world's 
beautiful places when she first moved to town 50 years ago. "It isn't safe to 
be out on the streets anymore. I would never think of going out alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Fear creates a variety of hardships. Jess Markey has been hurt financially. 
Outside his print shop in Downtown Los Angeles, Markey sees homeless crack 
smokers every day, all day long. They break into cars and steal briefcases, 
tapes, anything they can sell. They panhandle. They scavenge for the drug in 
the cracks of the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Markey said, he has been looking to hire new employees. No one 
seems willing to work on 7th Street. One woman a year ago never even got 
through the door, calling later to say she just didn't feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just light up right in front of you," Markey said of the users, mostly 
lean, restless men who have in common one horrific fact: They are among the 
drug's most pitiable victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The suffering of the homeless addicts is a living hell. No one can know the 
depth of it, they will tell you, without tumbling down that same chasm. The 
addicts tell stories, and those stories take on an aspect of caricature -- so 
filled with anguish and irrational acts that they would defy belief, except 
that they unfold time and again, along roughly similar plot lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloyisous Anderson, now 31, a former forklift operator from Norwalk, was a 
crack user. He owed $6,000 in payments on his Ford Escort when he sold it to 
the dope dealer for $200 in rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just watched the guy drive off in my car and I didn't really care," he 
said, "because I had dope in my hand. I just went on in the house and I smoked. 
. . . I used to smoke in a walk-in closet. I had a reclining chair in there, 
and I wouldn't come out. I stayed up in there all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Chavers was renting a home with his girlfriend and training to operate 
construction equipment when he first inhaled the vapors in a lot behind a pool 
hall in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hooked right then . . . that first hit," Chavers, 42, said outside a 
Skid Row rehabilitation house. Within 24 hours he had spent $100. By the end of 
four months, the drug was a complete obsession, costing him $300 a day -- even 
more if he had it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavers quit school, sold everything -- stereo, clothes, rings, lamps, 
telephone. He got $45 for a 19-inch color TV and faked a break-in to account 
for the loss. He parted with a '76 Mercury that he figured was worth $700. The 
crack dealer got the pink slip for $150 in rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he'd have told me $75," Chavers said, "then he'd have got the car for 
$75." 
</P>
<P>
 From there it got worse -- a breakup with his girlfriend, a series of cheap 
apartments, living without lights, without gas, refusing to pay rent, cashing 
food stamps to buy crack, losing weight, committing burglaries and armed 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavers ended up on Skid Row, then in prison, then back on Skid Row, where one 
day, just before he sought treatment, he tried to hang his girlfriend by her 
belt from the 12th story of the Frontier Hotel -- because she took a few 
dollars, or stayed out too late, he doesn't quite remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug and alcohol, mixed together, just sent me off into a rage," he said. 
"My life was unmanageable. You want it so much you're willing to take a chance 
on losing your life to go out here and get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crack's destructive punch, its power to send lives crashing to the sidewalk, 
reaches across all racial and economic lines. Joe Shulkin, a 43-year-old 
television writer from West Hollywood, lost a six-figure income and found 
himself living in a string of dilapidated motels. He and his wife, Cheryl, came 
to see the drug as a disembodied voice, guiding their steps, at once soothing 
and insatiable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug takes on a personality all its own," Shulkin said. "It just gets to 
the point where, if you can afford it, you don't even want to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not everyone hears its siren call. For complex social reasons, the drug 
has burned its greatest swath through low-income, mostly minority 
neighborhoods, where for only $5 or $10 it offers, in concentrated form, a high 
once available only to those who could afford costly powder cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the minds of those who welcomed crack into their dens and bedrooms, the new 
drug held a certain cachet. It connoted sex, caviar, the ultimate in 
self-indulgence. Depressants such as alcohol or heroin might bring serenity; 
crack, it turned out, emboldened the smoker with energy, a colossal sense of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "You immediately feel like you can handle the world, no problem," said Marble, 
41, who now beds down in a Skid Row recovery house after living on the streets 
and in abandoned homes in Compton. "Let's say I'm depressed and concerned about 
the job and the wife nagging me about the money that's gone. One blast off the 
cocaine and I start to feel the sensation where my head gets light. I start to 
get kind of excitable. Where I was depressed and low, now I'm up and standing 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then my thoughts are saying, 'I can manipulate my wife, I can manipulate my 
job, I can manipulate the Internal Revenue Service. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 To many smokers, there came to exist a wide gap between the euphoria of the 
high and the trials of life in communities marred by chronic unemployment, 
crime, despair, domestic strife, drug abuse and other social problems. The two 
opposite poles create an almost electrical force -- "the magnetic pull of 
confusion," addict Linwood Brown calls it -- which seizes users and rapidly 
propels them downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack use on the streets varies by age group and by neighborhood. Though most 
statistics are rough guesses, at best, some experts put the percentage of the 
homeless who use cocaine at about 15% -- or half of those believed to regularly 
use drugs. On Skid Row and in its lesser spin-offs -- among them, dense 
encampments at MacArthur and Lafayette parks -- the proportion is thought to be 
far higher. Former addict Mike Neely, who now runs an outreach program on Skid 
Row, estimates that at least half of the homeless population there uses crack, 
while some addicts insist the percentage is more like 70% or 80%, even counting 
those in missions and hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Skid Row is the bottom of the abyss. A nether world of Darwinian laws and 
grotesque horrors, it is crack's kingdom, the one place in Los Angeles where 
every facet of life has been tainted. The changes in Skid Row over the past 
decade offer by far the clearest window onto crack's domination of other drugs 
and the dark spell it casts over users: How it has grabbed hold, warping 
attitudes, turning what has always been a bleak, trouble-marred corner of the 
city into a pit even more grim and unforgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you walk down through there, you'll smell something, and most people will 
say it's the stench of the street," said Chavers. "And it ain't. It's death. A 
lot of people are simply dying, and either they don't know they're dying or 
they don't care, because it takes away everything. It takes away the will to 
live. All you want to do is smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-core addicts who become homeless tend to gravitate to Skid Row because of 
the proximity of welfare offices and a cornucopia of free-meal programs and 
clothing giveaways. They share the streets, shelters and hotels with 
alcoholics, heroin addicts, multi-drug users, the mentally ill and other 
transients, taking part in a brisk street economy in which crack is both 
currency and commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocks even as small as a quarter of an aspirin sell on nearly any corner -- $1 
hits. The hustle to afford them goes on day and night. There are handouts to 
sell: A hamburger provided by a homeless mission might bring $1, or a worn 
shirt 50 cents. Stolen goods account for much of the trade: onions and grapes 
from the produce markets, toys, flowers, camping tents, shoes, electronic 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Addicts make regular assaults at night on warehouses crowned in razor wire. 
Some deal drugs, smoking up their profits; some run errands or obtain crack for 
other users in exchange for hits, or trundle shopping carts of recyclable cans 
and bottles. The most deeply afflicted say they can spend a $212 welfare check 
on crack in 24 hours, and in the long intervening days they hustle from dawn 
till dark -- going without food, showers, clean clothing or shelter, pausing 
when they can savor a $1 or $5 or $10 rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Many addicts seem resigned to bitter hardship. Outside a ramshackle lean-to on 
Ceres Avenue, a man known to his friends as Black scrapes up dope or cash by 
fixing bicycles. In September, he and his girlfriend, Theresa, became parents 
of a baby boy -- 5 pounds, 9 ounces, born in good health at County-USC Medical 
Center, but in foster care because Theresa was found to have cocaine in her 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents grieve for their baby; they are going to court to try to win him 
back. Yet at every crossroads they seem to turn toward crack. 
</P>
<P>
 For Theresa, 30, it is the third time she has been forced to give up a child. 
The second time, five years ago, she went eight months of her pregnancy without 
using, she said. She even saved a little money to buy Christmas toys for her 
daughter in Dallas. But before she mailed them, she said, her boyfriend at the 
time sold them for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa said she was so upset that she left their rented room and bought a 
rock on Crenshaw Boulevard. Soon they were broke, lost the room and ended up 
Downtown, where one night the boyfriend slammed her body to the pavement. Two 
days later, she went into labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a pipe full of dope," Theresa said, remembering how she tried to get 
someone to call the paramedics, but the only man near her insisted on first 
having a hit off the pipe. In a rage, she said, she shattered the glass tube in 
the street, screaming at him, "F--- the pipe, this baby is on the way!" 
</P>
<P>
 The man answered, "F--- the baby, I'm going to buy me a pipe." Then he hurried 
off, leaving her to crawl to a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the pregnancy was much easier, Theresa said. Black looked out for 
her and forbid her to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 But she found ways to outwit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use," she said, "any time I can get it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the decade since crack arrived on Skid Row, the street population has 
become, by most accounts, larger, younger and more violent. Though murder rates 
are not as high Downtown as in some areas overrun by street gangs, the Skid Row 
homeless now regularly carry knives, lead pipes, even handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-core users have pushed some of the more docile addicts and alcoholics 
into East Los Angeles, into MacArthur and Lafayette parks, into Pasadena and 
elsewhere. Rip-offs and assaults motivated by crack are common. Skid Row loan 
sharks expect a $2 or $3 return on the dollar, and delinquent addicts sometimes 
are killed. Occasionally the overdue debtors stop in at Las Familias on Seventh 
Street in tears, said director Callaghan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some end up boarding a bus out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 crack-related arrests were made last year on Skid Row, not 
counting assaults and burglaries in which no crack was confiscated. Despite 
running regular drug raids, police concede they are overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cocaine is a particularly difficult drug for us," said Detective Ed Auerbach 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's narcotics group Downtown. Partly because 
it is such a stimulant, it creates "the kind of emotional states that tend to 
produce erratic or violent behavior. It causes people to get very agitated and 
nervous and paranoid and defensive and to act out in a very aggressive manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavers said he used to wait outside a check-cashing office and bludgeon 
people with an ax handle to get money to feed his cravings. Remorse was never 
part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you laid there and bled to death, it wasn't on me," Chavers said. "I got 
what I wanted. (Cocaine) hardens you. It turns you into something that you're 
not. . . . You've got your drugs; nine times out of 10 you've got a 
'strawberry.' And you and her, you don't care about that guy you left in that 
alley. If he makes it, he makes it. And if he don't, he don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The promiscuity of many addicts has become a deadly new means of transmission 
of the virus that causes AIDS. Men with cash often celebrate by finding a 
woman, a hotel room and a supply of cocaine. The room being optional, cocaine 
is also traded for sex in alleys, cars and cardboard shacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of the sex-for-crack phenomenon, UCLA researchers Kathleen Boyle 
and Douglas Anglin learned that the buyers' market heavily favored men, who, 
having crack, had little difficulty finding partners. "Strawberries" were 
reluctant to insist on using condoms for fear of losing the chance to get high. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS reaches ever deeper into Skid Row, spread by both intercourse and 
intravenous injection. The infection rate among those who get tested is about 
20%, according to one clinical group that gives free exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The roll call of the sick includes Rochelle Davis, 37, a tiny woman with 
large, expressive eyes who has been hospitalized eight times since her first 
collapse early last year. She was introduced to cocaine in 1979; a man she 
dated showed her how to smoke it by free-basing -- in which the drug is burned 
with a makeshift torch. Seeing it sizzle, she grew alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Damn, what is that? I'm scared of that,' " Davis recalled. "He said, 
'Nothing to be afraid of.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But that same man later forced her into prostitution on South Figueroa Street 
to support their habits. Eventually, she said, he went to prison and she 
drifted Downtown, where for seven years she lived on the streets, weighing her 
craving for crack against her own fragile values. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women consented to sex for as little as $5; Davis felt she preserved a 
measure of pride by insisting on $20. "I said I wasn't no cheap 'strawberry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now, because of AIDS, she yearns to stay clean. This fall, social worker 
Callaghan found a $240-a-month room for Davis and her boyfriend at the Pershing 
Hotel. In the lobby there one afternoon, Davis boasted of being sober seven 
days, feeling just great. But the stress hangs on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dying slowly but surely, and I know it," she said. "I think about the 
HIV, and I get scared. . . . And my old man, he gets to drinking his beer and 
he might say stuff, and I just get me some money and just break out of here and 
get high." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was, a few weeks later: Davis, alone among crowds on the 
trash-strewn sidewalks of 5th and Crocker streets, the city's crack hub; back 
to a place where she could find a brand of solace. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitterness of AIDS abets its own lethal spread among addicts. On Seventh 
Street, where transvestite bars foster heavy prostitution among gays, Alan 
Jackson, 49, looked back on a life laid waste. Crack made him homeless. He was 
diagnosed with AIDS four years ago. He spoke through several missing teeth and 
a bloody sore on his lip about the brutality of life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are times, Jackson said, when he gets his $671 Social Security 
check, buys a quarter ounce of crack for $150, and finds another man from the 
streets to join him in a hotel room. He uses condoms, Jackson said. That is as 
far as he goes in trying to ensure that he does not pass along the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the Lord's going to punish me for," he said. "I'm only concerned 
about me." 
</P>
<P>
 In their study, which began in 1989, the UCLA researchers reported one 
surprise finding that had nothing to do with sex: How frequently the addicts 
attributed their homelessness to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our subjects, though heavy users of other drugs, had fairly stable 
lives before heavy crack use," the scholars wrote. "For all, the quick 
escalation of their need for the drug seemed to catch them by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 It also caught much of America by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack hit the streets in the early 1980s. Homelessness became a national issue 
during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the connection between the two went unnoticed by most so-called experts 
for many years. In 1984, when homelessness first made the cover of Newsweek 
magazine, drugs were not even mentioned in accounting for the crowds that were 
taking to the streets in Los Angeles, New York, St. Louis, Atlanta, Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, advocates for the homeless were blaming Reagan-era cuts to 
housing, welfare and mental-health programs, coupled with a general breakdown 
in family bonds. New York attorney Robert M. Hayes, who was emerging as one of 
the nation's leading activists on homelessness, told the media that the plight 
of the displaced could be summed up in three words: "Housing, housing, 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
 There was much truth in all the outcry, but it told only part of the story. 
Activists considered it a given that a certain percentage of the homeless were 
substance abusers -- mainly alcoholics. Tactically, there was no point in 
harping on drugs when it risked destroying political support for those who 
needed aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an effort, in some ways, to homogenize the (homeless) population 
and make it look as mainstream as possible," said USC professor Jennifer Wolch, 
co-author of a book about Los Angeles called "Malign Neglect: Homelessness in 
an American City." "If you are arguing for programs and money . . . (drug 
addiction) is not particularly popular. A lot of people believe drug addicts 
got themselves into it, and why should we help them out?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, there just wasn't much data. No one was charting trends in crack 
consumption among the homeless and looking at the fallout. The first warnings 
were sounded far below the level of public debate, by voices from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more eloquent were members of the Homeless Writers Coalition -- 
street poets who began meeting in Los Angeles at a quirky Skid Row cultural 
center named Another Planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Writers were like a teardrop from the eye of God; out of suffering, they 
emerged as a gift, eager to help the downtrodden, said co-founder Alexander 
Anderson, now 40. Anderson wrote with passion in the mid-1980s about the evils 
of crack, comparing the eyes of a coked-up user to the high beams of a car: 
</P>
<P>
 "He got his high beams on/ And it won't be long/ Before he sells his Cadillac 
and his three big homes;/ He said he needed a hit,/ That led to 15 more;/ Now 
that sucker has to crawl around on his bedroom floor;/ Around and around and 
around . . . trying to find some more."  
</P>
<P>
 His friend, Charles Walker, a.k.a., Southern Comfort, also wrote about the 
drug; eventually, he emblazoned some of the verse on what addicts call the 
"Berlin Wall" on Fifth Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the Writers achieved success -- city funding, performances at 
schools and churches, their own compact disc. But they, too, were battered by 
crack. At one time, Comfort estimated, there were 20 members, a dozen of them 
smoking the drug. Eventually, he said, the group split, with one high-ranking 
member accused of embezzling and smoking up $12,000 in proceeds. Two members 
were later killed over cocaine -- one, a performer known as Pops, in July of 
1993, because of a $15 debt. By Comfort's account, Pops repaid the money to a 
dealer's girlfriend, who spent it on crack. In the end, the dealer took her 
word over his and shot Pops in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears and deaths out on the crowded streets of urban America were not enough 
to put a political spotlight on what was happening to the homeless because of 
crack cocaine. But, one by one, other voices were coming forth, people who had 
seen it, people directly familiar with the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Neely, the founder of Los Angeles' nonprofit Homeless Outreach 
Program, who had plumbed the depths of addiction by parting with about $90,000 
over six years. He had lost an aerospace job, a home, a family and had done 
what many addicts do -- slept in the rain, booked rooms only to check out when 
the money and crack were gone. The $5 deposit on a hotel key was good for a $5 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, living on an upper floor of a $90-a-week Downtown hotel, Neely 
grew so paranoid that he imagined there were thieves in the room above, 
lowering a string and chewing gum through the window to try to heist those 
precious nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cocaine cost me everything," he said. "It cost me everything that I ever had, 
everything I was, everything I ever wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Neely turned the nightmare into activism, traveling in the late 1980s to 
homelessness conferences in Miami, New Orleans, San Francisco and elsewhere. He 
kept talking about crack, he said, and people kept rolling their eyes and 
turning the discussions back to housing and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly frustrated was Donald Burnes, who ran an emergency-assistance 
program for the poor in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnes and his wife, Alice Baum, an alcohol and drug counselor, began work in 
1986 on a book they published this year, "A Nation in Denial: The Truth About 
Homelessness." In it, they argue that untreated drug addiction, alcoholism and 
mental illness are more to blame than poverty and lack of housing. The tragedy, 
they say, is that by failing to acknowledge the root problems, America allowed 
homelessness to gain unintended momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has brought a deeper understanding. Today, in Los Angeles, low-cost 
housing is more available than in decades. Through redevelopment, $206 million 
in public funds was spent to refurbish 40 of the 73 hotels on and around Skid 
Row. Every night, especially during summer months, many of those rooms sit 
empty. Vacancy rates in traditional bachelor and single apartments in central 
Los Angeles have climbed to 21%, according to a survey by the Apartment Owners 
Assn. of Southern California. Emptiest of all are apartments in the lower rent 
ranges, starting at $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the trouble is enduring poverty. And part of it is the continuing 
drain of crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crack is a problem that we, as a society, ignored for a long period of time," 
Neely said. "We're still in the infancy of addressing the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Addicts lament that there are too few places to turn. Treatment programs, by 
most accounts, are sorely underfunded; the wait for county-sponsored beds is 17 
days at most facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Addicts who have surrendered to the power of the drug rarely wait that long -- 
not when, as they point out, the dope man is open 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 There are hints of better days ahead. In parts of town, the crack epidemic has 
shown signs of slowing, even receding. The quality of the drug on the street 
has dropped significantly in recent years -- the result, apparently, of dealers 
trying to maximize profits. Teen-age drug users in Hollywood, Venice and 
outlying parts of the Valley have turned, instead, to marijuana and 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 A certain number of crack addicts do get help, many through hospitals and 
recovery centers that stress 12-step programs modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous. 
Chavers, Marble and Sharon Hayes are among them. Anderson, the street poet, is 
now clean and sharing a sober-living apartment. Southern Comfort lost one 
girlfriend to the drug -- her whereabouts are unknown -- but he rescued another 
woman from crack addiction. They have two children and an apartment in 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, success stories seem to be the exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort's best friend, Paul Johnson, still lives with his dog Punchie on Skid 
Row, cooking for other addicts, hustling and using. On a recent sun-filled 
morning, he lay nearly incoherent at Fifth and Crocker, his bare feet jutting 
from a crumpled box. He cradled fragments of rock while he sucked on his glass 
pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Down every adjoining street were others like him, hanging out, scheming for 
money, going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where would I like to be in the year 2000?" Edwin Broome, 51, mused on a 
stretch of Towne Avenue lined in steel gates and cinder block. "I'd like to be 
on my property, enjoying my grandkids and just kicking back. . . . I ask God 
all the time, 'Why are you putting me through this misery?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Slim, as they call him, has no answer. He rarely hears from his two grown 
children and three grandchildren. His days are devoted to shooting heroin, 
smoking crack and gossiping with other addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the curb is a stunted tree, its limbs cut, naked of leaves. Slim has 
written on its trunk the names of many of his friends, those who share the time 
here. He calls it the Tree of Salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been dead for years.

MEXICO'S MIGRANT POLICY CALLED A HARSHER PROP. 187; LATIN AMERICA: CRITICS

<P>
 They call them los indocumentados . They work in boiler-room factories, 
sweatshops and street markets in the capital, or scrape a living in the fields 
of rich ranchers in the south, barely surviving on wages far below the legal 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 They hide from immigration authorities, and many live in fear, moving often 
from shanty to shanty. They are victimized by: corrupt business people; local 
officials; police; smugglers known as "coyotes" who bring them over the border 
for a fee, and even border guards who are supposed to keep them out. 
</P>
<P>
 And every year, Mexico quietly deports thousands of them, illegal immigrants 
from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and other Central American nations who 
have penetrated its porous southern border in search of a better life in the 
North. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound ironic? All too familiar, perhaps? It is a flip side of Proposition 187 
and tops the list of Mexico's most sensitive foreign policy issues. Especially 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of Mexico's torrent of criticism of the California 
initiative -- crowned by President Ernesto Zedillo's resounding condemnation a 
week ago at the Summit of the Americas of Proposition 187 as a violation of 
Mexican human rights -- critics here have charged hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's immigration laws, they say, are even stricter and their enforcement 
far harsher than California's initiative to deny public services to 
undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a double standard here," said Luis Gonzalez Souza, a social sciences 
professor at Mexico City's National Autonomous University of Mexico and author 
of two books on U.S.-Mexican relations. "We are not respecting the human rights 
of these undocumented immigrants in the same way we are demanding the U.S. 
respect the human rights of Mexicans. We are losing credibility, and we are 
losing the negotiating power to demand such rights for Mexicans in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior government officials concede that their strict immigration policies 
have left them open to criticism and quandaries. They confirmed Friday that 
Zedillo has created a high-level committee to conduct a sweeping review and 
overhaul of Mexico's immigration policies and enforcement. "We understand we 
have a problem. We accept we have a problem, and we are trying very thoroughly 
to solve these problems," one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But those officials also stressed that the issue goes deeper. Many of the 
undocumented immigrants are merely crossing Mexico toward the U.S. border, they 
said, and the Mexican government actually has been forced to do the job of U.S. 
immigration authorities by "turning the U.S. border downward." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even those officials acknowledged that Mexico's harsh immigration policy 
has a domestic dimension. It is based on intense competition for jobs in a 
nation with soaring unemployment and crushing poverty of its own: Most of the 
undocumented Central Americans never make it to the U.S. border. Others never 
intended to. In both cases, officials here said, migrants believe they can find 
a better life in Mexico than at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, the immigration issue remains so sensitive that no government 
official would speak on the record about it. It is so sensitive that the 
government has declared all statistics on deportations or detentions of 
undocumented Central Americans -- data on the tens or perhaps hundreds of 
thousands of illegal immigrants -- off limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures that are available, the magnitude of the illegal 
immigration problem pales in comparison with that in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Institute of Migration, a quasi-official body, reported last 
Monday, in figures later denied as unofficial by immigration authorities, that 
Mexico expelled 3,651 undocumented immigrants, 40% of them Guatemalan, in the 
first 11 months of this year; the United States, in contrast, deported about 1 
million Mexicans and others during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 But that number is grossly low, said the dozens of human rights groups and 
non-governmental agencies that have worked for years to help undocumented 
migrants in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Mexican authorities have been coloring the real figures because 
they don't want to expose the dimension of the issue," Gonzalez said. "I'm 
afraid this is one of the issues in which we have to start from the beginning 
in determining just how high the numbers really are." 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Macin, whose Center for the Coordination of Ecumenical Projects has four 
support centers for illegal immigrants in rural Mexico, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many undocumenteds in Mexico who theoretically don't exist," Macin 
said. "There are many ways to be undocumented in Mexico, because the official 
policy is very ambiguous. And I think it is intentionally ambiguous. We cannot 
have an idea of the magnitude of the problem, but it is serious. And the flow 
is increasing." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Macin said, Mexico's immigration laws permit Salvadorans to 
obtain visas that are valid only as far north as Mexico City. When they go 
north of the capital, they become illegal. Other Central American migrants are 
given visas that bar them from working. If they try to earn a living, they 
become illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 To further illustrate the ambiguity in the numbers, Macin cited the large 
population of Guatemalans in Mexico. The government estimates it at 40,000, he 
said. But the Roman Catholic archdiocese in the southern Mexican town of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, which deals with the Guatemalan community daily, puts 
the number at 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout most of the 20th Century, Mexico has been a haven for immigrants 
and refugees. It admitted tens of thousands of Spaniards during the Spanish 
Civil War. Thousands of Cubans fleeing the Communist regime have established 
new homes and new lives here. And, until it reached saturation in the early 
1980s, Mexico threw its doors wide open to its troubled Central American 
neighbors, bringing hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants fleeing 
the many civil wars to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the migrants were political refugees from repressive regimes in 
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Macin and other human-rights workers said, the undocumented immigrants 
are mostly economic refugees -- a condition all too familiar to U.S. 
policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen such things that even I cannot believe at first," Macin said of 
his many visits to Mexico City's Ciudad Neza, a neighborhood of crushing 
poverty that is known to house a large number of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen in Ciudad Neza places where two or three families live in one 
room," he said. "And I have asked them, 'To live like this, you have left your 
country?' They say: 'Here, I have this -- a place to sleep, a roof over my 
head. There, we didn't even have this.' It's not a life we would perceive as 
better, but for them it is. And that's what makes the risks of being an illegal 
immigrant here worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is this saying I often hear when we ask them, 'What are you looking 
for?' " Macin said. "They all say, 'We're looking for life.' They're looking 
for a road to survival." 
</P>
<P>
 But the risks along that road are profound, Macin and others said. Routinely, 
they said, border guards and the "coyotes" rob the migrants before allowing 
them to pass or turning them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest risk is to fall into the hands of the authorities, who are 
totally and absolutely corrupt," Macin said. "The corruption is from the top 
down. They can be arbitrarily detained and their possessions stolen. Invariably 
. . . everything of value is taken. They are vulnerable, and if they don't have 
someone to help them, they can be deported." 
</P>
<P>
 It is just such corruption that Mexico's new president has vowed to end. 
Zedillo has appointed an opposition party member as attorney general, the 
office that enforces Mexican immigration laws at the border and throughout the 
country. And the chief prosecutor's principal task, Zedillo vowed, will be to 
root out bad agents and create "a new rule of law" in a society plagued by 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, besides harshly criticizing Proposition 187 in Miami, the 
president called on all nations of the Americas to formulate a comprehensive, 
humane immigration policy to restore justice to a system overwhelmed by people 
and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those most affected here, the immigration nightmare looms as large as 
it does for the undocumented Mexicans in California who feel threatened by 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercedes Ramirez knows. She is secretary general of the 19th of September 
Seamstress Union, named for the date of the 1985 earthquake that racked Mexico 
City and crushed 3,000 seamstresses to death in illegal sweatshops throughout 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez tried several times to arrange interviews with undocumented 
immigrants. They never showed up. "There is a lot of fear," she said. "Their 
lives are synonymous with fear. Usually a long time passes before someone like 
this will tell you where they're from, even after you get to know them very 
well. They're just afraid of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the two Guatemalan migrants her union discovered living as prisoners 
in a sweatshop. "They had no papers allowing them to work, so the padron 
(owner) of the factory told them: 'You can work here, but you can never leave. 
They'll catch you and send you back to Guatemala,' " she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, Ramirez said she learned only after years of dealing with him 
that one of her contacts in the Mexican Labor Ministry was an illegal. One day, 
she said, he finally admitted he was from Guatemala, illegally in Mexico, but 
had managed to get his job by buying falsified immigration papers. "Here in 
Mexico," she said, "one can get any papers one wants for a price." 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma for most, though, is that they cannot afford the documents. "I 
think the majority of them do want to go to the United States," Ramirez said. 
"But by the time they get here, their money is gone -- stolen or spent. So they 
have to stay here to make some money to continue the journey. And many get 
stuck here for a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who cannot afford documents for a real job," she said, "are forced to 
find work in the underground -- informal or illegal markets or factories. That

CORPORATE O.C. DISTANCES ITSELF FROM FISCAL CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As cities and schools have grappled with layoffs and service cuts in the wake 
of Orange County's bankruptcy, local business leaders have largely sat and 
watched behind the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 In interview after interview, officials of major corporations in the county 
made no apologies, instead saying that there is too little information 
available and that the situation is too fluid for them to get involved or make 
public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's simply too many unknowns at this point," said a spokeswoman for Les 
McCraw, chairman of Fluor Corp., the multibillion-dollar engineering services 
firm in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say that it is now -- in the middle of the largest municipal 
bankruptcy in U.S. history -- that the Orange County business community's ample 
business acumen and clout is vital and perhaps essential to a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that in New York and other cities that faced bankruptcy, top 
business executives moved swiftly and played a leading role in their recovery 
-- themselves serving in government agencies or providing executives on loan as 
well as other resources to raise money and help administer municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They responded immediately and quickly," recalled Felix Rohatyn, Lazard 
Freres & Co. investment firm senior partner, who played a key part in New York 
City's recovery after its financial collapse in the mid-1970s. While the roots 
of New York's fiscal crisis were different, Rohatyn added, the problems Orange 
County now confronts are essentially the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to allocate sacrifices, how do you deal with service cuts and how do you 
deal with revenue reductions" are questions that businesses can help answer, 
Rohatyn said. "I think they can make a real contribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger W. Johnson, administrator of the federal General Services Administration 
and former chairman and chief executive of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine, 
agreed: "Business leaders have a major responsibility because they have 
enormous skills." And for those senior executives who haven't come forth in 
Orange County, he said in an interview Friday: "It's time to get your butts in 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, local business leaders say they want to help. Many of them have had 
private, informal talks with county officials, they say. And some accountants 
and bankers have offered free services to county officials, such as giving a 
second opinion on advice from outside consultants and providing instruction on 
complex subjects, such as derivatives, which were blamed for much of the 
$2.02-billion loss suffered by the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 A few business leaders have taken steps behind the scenes. Henry Segerstrom, a 
major Costa Mesa landowner and the developer of the South Coast Plaza shopping 
mall, contacted top Bank of America executives on Orange County's behalf, said 
County Supervisor William G. Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what Segerstrom hoped to accomplish, although two days after 
Segerstrom placed his call, a dozen Bank of America officials met with county 
officials to talk about a possible line of credit. Segerstrom declined to 
comment for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people yet know what steps should be taken," said Buck Johns, a 
Newport Beach developer and a prominent Republican activist. "We've had a 
colossal train wreck the magnitude of which we're still not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the more than two weeks since the county's financial troubles became 
apparent, business leaders as a group have yet to meet formally with local 
government officials. And, though they are now starting to form a task force to 
focus on the fiscal problems, there has been no public word from the county's 
heavyweight corporate players. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the 
Industrial League of Orange County hope that senior executives from Taco Bell 
Corp., Rockwell International Corp., Fluor and the Irvine Co. will head a 
special task force to meet with county officials and, among other things, send 
a delegation to the East Coast to lobby Washington legislators and New York 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 But to date, each of the top executives from those firms, as well as some 
others, has refused to make a public commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't stepped up to the counter to help, have they," said Carl N. 
Karcher, chairman emeritus of CKE Enterprises, the company that operates Carl's 
Jr. restaurants. Karcher, who narrowly avoided bankruptcy himself last year, 
added that he would remain in the background. "I'm too busy myself." 
</P>
<P>
 John Martin, the chief executive of Taco Bell, declined numerous requests for 
comment. Donald R. Beall and Donald Bren, the respective chairmen of Rockwell 
and Irvine Co., said through their spokesmen that, at this time, they could not 
offer any specific plan of action in regard to the county's financial problems. 
"We're very confident that the county will weather this storm," said Bren's 
spokeswoman, Dawn McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, company officials admit that there is little to gain by getting 
involved in a financial fiasco in which there is a lot of finger-pointing, 
federal investigations and public ire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses also say they are really stymied as to what they can do now. 
Orange County's financial disaster, they maintain, is less tangible than, say, 
the Northridge earthquake or the Laguna Beach fire last year, when there was an 
immediate outpouring of help from businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A few companies have attempted a quick fix. For example, Broadway Stores Inc. 
offered to let all Orange County government workers, along with those in the 
county's cities and school districts, defer their Broadway charge-card payments 
for 90 days on purchases through Christmas. And Consumer Credit Counseling 
Service of Orange County in Tustin offered emergency financial planning to 
those struggling as a result of the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Nicholson, president of the Orange County Industrial League, remains 
confident that business leaders will spring into action soon with a long-term 
strategy. "Business has the expertise needed to respond, and once the facts are 
known, I think you'll see its willingness to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 But others aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is that no one has emerged as a coalescing force in Orange County, 
as Gov. Hugh Carey did in New York's crisis, when he called senior executives 
from Macy's, Metropolitan Life and other companies, as well as union leaders, 
to join forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be the power people in Orange County doing it," said Dennis J. 
Aigner, dean of UC Irvine's Graduate School of Management. Without them, 
analysts said, it will be tougher to bring business, government and labor in 
Orange County together to work on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fogarty, head of the Orange County Central Labor Council, whose 
membership includes several thousand county workers, said he has been trying to 
get a meeting with the board of supervisors for the last two weeks. "They have 
ignored us," he said, adding that unions have had experience working with 
bankrupt cities and as such, "have the resources to help the county out." 
However, the board has met with the Orange County Employees Assn., an 
independent organization that represents 11,000 county workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Takashi Kiuchi, chairman of Mitsubishi Electric America Inc. in Cypress, says 
Orange County needs to embrace the business community as Mayor Richard Riordan 
has done in Los Angeles. "We should do exactly what he's trying to do," Kiuchi 
said. "He's talking jobs, cops and efficiency. Mayor Riordan is visible to us. 
When he talks, we can raise questions. We like the responses we get from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Some elected officials in the county say they have received offers of help 
from individual business executives. "I intend to take them up," said County 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. But she could not cite any long-term or 
concerted help proposed by the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think government has to be willing to accept some of the help," said Peer 
Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water District. But from the business 
community as a whole, he said, "I don't think it's been offered or rejected." 
</P>
<P>
 Those with experience say part of the business community's reluctance reflects 
a change in times. 
</P>
<P>
 During New York's crisis, for example, Rohatyn said companies gave some senior 
executives leaves of absence or freed them up otherwise, so they could take on 
full-time volunteer work as deputy mayor for finance and as budget director, 
among other positions. 
</P>
<P>
 But consultant Jacob Ukeles, who helped New York City as well as Bridgeport, 
Conn., which filed for bankruptcy in the late 1980s, believes it will be harder 
for Orange County to enlist the assistance of major corporations, because big 
companies have laid off multiple layers of management in recent years. "That 
means you have to do more with (fewer people) after hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, said Don Murray, a partner at the Costa Mesa office of Deloitte & 
Touche: "Most private businesses are trying to survive." Though Murray says his 
accounting firm and others have privately offered their services to county 
government officials, he said of the business community's involvement: "No, I 
honestly don't think it's going to happen on a large scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Some business executives candidly say that the county's financial woes are a 
failure of government, not theirs to get involved in. "This is the county's 
problem, they created it," snapped one top corporate executive, who spoke only 
on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified. But he also 
acknowledged that traditionally businesses in Orange County have not adequately 
participated in civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do is provide housing," said an employee of Santa Margarita Co., a 
big developer in South County, when asked what the builder planned to do in 
response to the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet campaign records show that Santa Margarita Co., as well as many other 
major companies, have been big contributors to the Board of Supervisors -- and 
over the years some of these businesses have benefited from the decisions of 
the board and from the county's boom in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business community provides the majority of funds for (elections) of the 
Board of Supervisors," said Rob Kling, a professor at UC Irvine and co-author 
of the book, "Post-Suburban California: The Transformation of Orange County 
Since World War II." But Kling believes that businesses here, while themselves 
very sophisticated, have not encouraged astute political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's anything the business community could learn from this venture, 
it's that, if you select people who think in the short-term, sooner or later, 
they're going to make bad business decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior associate at the Center for Politics and 
Economics at Claremont's Graduate School, said that businesses like Fluor and 
Irvine Co. "have had an important and powerful role in the county's politics." 
Fluor has donated more than $50,000 and Irvine Co. about $40,000 to various 
members of the Board of Supervisors since the late 1970s, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody watched (the county's investments) -- not the supervisors, not the 
business leaders who have been active in choosing who's elected," Jeffe said, 
adding that the business task force that is being formed is "clearly a positive 
move. Business has to become involved in government, not just in politics." 
</P>
<P>
 George L. Argyros, a leading Orange County real estate executive and head of 
Arnel & Affiliates in Costa Mesa, vehemently denied that businesses have any 
responsibility in the county's bankruptcy. Nonetheless, he said the fiscal 
crisis provides an opportunity for businesses to participate and suggest 
reforms in government that would put in place oversight organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Argyros said he may push for Orange County to adopt a charter, 
which would give county government greater leeway in managing its affairs. "We 
need better representation and we should have some form of county executive," 
he said, echoing a view shared by others, including Johnson, the GSA 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Argyros said he knew of nothing he could do to help the county. 
"There's no method to participate," Argyros said, adding that his advice or 
assistance has not been sought by county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros said part of the business-government divide in Orange County is 
structural. The boards of various county and municipal agencies and districts 
are made up of other elected county officials -- not private citizens and 
business leaders. "It's kind of crazy," Argyros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan, who is also treasurer of Pacific Scientific Co. in Newport Beach, is one 
of a small number of full-time business executives who is involved closely in 
government operations. To Swan, the general absence of business involvement in 
government is understandable. "It's an ugly place where anything goes," he said 
of elected offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are rewards as well. "It gave me enormous satisfaction," said 
Rohatyn in New York, adding that the Municipal Assistance Corp. that he chaired 
raised $10-billion through bond issues for the city between 1975 and 1985. "We 
live here, and it would have been a terrible thing for New York. . . . The city 
has been very good to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many others, Swan is hoping that the joint Chamber-Industrial League 
business task force being formed will make a difference. With business 
expertise behind them, Swan says, the county and the municipalities can help 
make up the losses by re-examining how government operates. "I think they need 
help in understanding how to run a business," Swan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukeles, the New York consultant, put it this way: "You have to recognize that 
there is a crisis and that it's everyone's crisis. It's not someone else's 
crisis, it's our crisis."

'3 STRIKES' LEADS TO MORE EARLY O.C. JAIL RELEASES; CORRECTIONS: INMATES ASKING 
FOR TRIALS TO AVOID ANOTHER CONVICTION CROWD PRISONS, PUSHING OTHER CRIMINALS 
OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The "three strikes" law aimed at cracking down on repeat offenders is 
benefiting criminals in Orange County, where jail overcrowding linked to the 
new legislation is leading to less time behind bars for some already convicted 
of crimes, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Orange County inmates who have nothing to lose are demanding 
trials in the hope of avoiding another "strike" on their rap sheets. The Orange 
County Sheriff's Department is making room for the new defendants by granting 
unusually early releases for convicted criminals -- who typically serve just 
one-third of their court-ordered sentences anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly not the kind of impact we want to have," said Ron Coley, 
who oversees criminal justice issues at the Orange County administrative 
office. "This is a direct effect of 'three strikes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In an Oct. 28 letter to the U.S. Justice Department on a related matter, 
County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider decried early jail releases as an 
"emergency" situation that poses a "substantial threat" to county residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, 55,000 convicted criminals who were released early 
from the Orange County Men's Jail, the Women's Jail, or Theo Lacy and James A. 
Musick branch jails were arrested again before their original sentences 
expired, according to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people should have been behind bars or were on probation when they were 
allegedly out committing new crimes, according to Schneider's letter, which 
seeks federal reimbursement for the cost of housing illegal immigrants in 
county jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner said it is a "common, 
daily" occurrence to see a defendant coming back into court on a new trial 
before the probation term on his previous case has ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "You usually see these guys back before the first year of their probation 
ends," Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 A breakdown of the crimes committed by inmates granted early release is 
unavailable, but offenders can range from first-timers to repeat felons. Their 
crimes can range from burglaries and child molestations to assaults and petty 
thefts -- serious offenses, but crimes that a prosecutor or judge determined 
did not warrant prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 The early release issue and the startling demand for criminal trials stem from 
the "three strikes" law, which gained its nickname because defendants with two 
or more convictions for violent or serious felonies "strike out" when convicted 
of a third felony. They face sentences of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office has filed "three strikes" cases 
against more than 100 defendants since the law took effect in March, and all 
the defendants facing the maximum punishment are expected to demand a trial. 
But hundreds of other defendants are also refusing to plead guilty for fear of 
racking up even one or two "strikes" on their record, Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of guys figure, 'I'll take my chance on a trial. Why not?' " 
Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recently released report, the Orange County Criminal Justice Coordination 
Council, an advisory body made up of law enforcement representatives, 
documented the local impact of the new law: 
</P>
<P>
 * Early releases for inmates have more than doubled from the 466 convicts who 
were released in January before completing their court-ordered sentence, to 
1,039 inmates let out of jail early in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The October total includes 48 inmates who served just 70% of their sentences 
-- an unusually early release, said Lt. Tom Garner of the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. Reducing inmates sentences by 30% is considered a last 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's only happened once or twice before" during periods of severe 
overcrowding, Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defendants are demanding their day in court at a record rate. Prosecutors 
reported more than 700 jury trials pending in Orange County Superior Court in 
October, compared to 480 jury trials pending in January. 
</P>
<P>
 * The total number of guilty pleas in felony criminal cases has dropped 22% 
since March, indicating defendants with nothing to lose are willing to gamble 
on trials. Typically, about 95% of criminal cases are resolved with guilty 
pleas. 
</P>
<P>
 * The numbers of jail inmates awaiting trial has increased by 4% since March, 
further evidence of the impact of the new law. Now, about 55% of the jail beds 
are used for convicted criminals serving their sentences, while about 45% hold 
defendants awaiting their day in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department is under a federal court order to limit 
overcrowding at the county's detention facilities and must carefully monitor 
inmate intake on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmate advocates also keep a close eye on crowding to ensure the county does 
not violate the court's order. More than 60,000 jail bookings were recorded in 
1994, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only two options to relieve overcrowding: release defendants facing 
trial or release convicted criminals serving their jail sentence. While the 
jails often cite and release defendants on minor crimes, such as public 
intoxication, officials prefer to release convicts rather than take a chance 
that suspects will never return to face the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail does not take a defendant's crimes into consideration when granting 
early releases, Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be discrimination to say, 'We'll let him go, but we won't 
let the other go,' " Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The early releases are an added bonus for inmates, whose court-ordered 
sentences are automatically slashed by at least one-third if they do not cause 
trouble during their incarcerations. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation underscores the county's need for new jail beds, a chronic 
problem for more than 15 years, officials said. A recent report by the Orange 
County Grand Jury called for 3,000 additional jail beds. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials have long complained about the lack of funds to build a 
new jail or expand an existing facility. And there is bitter debate about where 
a new jail should go. 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking for a new jail is years away, and with the county's recent 
bankruptcy, nothing is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton led recent efforts to study 
relocating the James A. Musick Branch Jail from Irvine to the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, because the military base, which is scheduled to close in 
1999, would allow jail expansion without burdening residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus right now is the county's financial situation, but once this 
situation settles a bit, the supervisor wants the priority to remain public 
safety," said Stanton aide Rob Richardson. "He is very concerned about the 
county's jail situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, we need more jail space. I think that's clear," said 
Coley of the county administrative office. In the meantime, Orange County 
judges and prosecutors say they are also concerned about public safety and the 
message sent by early releases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned about people getting early releases, both as the chief 
assistant district attorney and a citizen of Orange County," prosecutor Maury 
Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel when people are released early from jail it erodes not only public 
confidence and safety but also allows a person who commits a crime not to be 
concerned about the possible sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Municipal Judge Donna L. Crandall in Santa Ana said judges are 
also in a bind. They do not want to worsen the overcrowding situation, she 
said, but must make sure defendants are punished for their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very difficult situation," she said, adding that municipal court 
judges must begin looking into expanding alternative sentencing options for the 
nonviolent offender. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles in Laguna Niguel and others agree 
the situation is a difficult one, but she warned against labeling the "three 
strikes" law as bad for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles lamented early releases but said the public is ultimately safer with 
"three strikes" defendants behind bars -- even if that means early releases for 
defendants convicted of less serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Three strikes' is aimed at the recidivist offender, the sociopath who 
commits crimes again and again and again," said Iles, who is also a member of 
the county's new criminal justice coordination panel. "We've got a problem with 
jail overcrowding, but if you have to choose between who to release and who to 
let go, generally we're keeping the right people behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Early Out 
</P>
<P>
 Early releases from county jails more than doubled between January and 
October. They typically involve sentence reductions of 5% to 20%. A chronic 
shortage of jail space has been aggravated by an influx of prisoners charged 
under the "three strikes" law. The number of early releases: OCT.: 991* * An 
additional 48 who had served just 70% of their sentences were also released.

HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY SPANS MAGIC AND MIGHT OF L.A.; CULTURE: ROUTE LINKING 
DOWNTOWN, TINSELTOWN AND SUBURBIA TURNS 40. SOME CALL IT CITY'S ULTIMATE 
FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena was the first and the Santa Monica is the busiest, but the 
Hollywood Freeway, which turned 40 this year, has always been the most L.A. -- 
a telegenic mix of glamour, grit and gridlock. Just its route -- through the 
movie capital of the world -- assured it fame. So too did the old movies and TV 
shows that featured the freeway with City Hall, then the tallest building in 
town, in the background. And nary a foreign car, freeway call box or Botts' dot 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway helped shape how others saw Los Angeles. At home, it shaped the 
way we saw ourselves, creating a new urban nexus, accelerating development of 
the San Fernando Valley, delivering the promise of Downtown jobs and rustic 
homesteads to suburbanites of the growing city. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway also has provided two generations of commuters with a chronicle of 
the changing metropolis. Motorists have seen the old Downtown give way to the 
new -- the once towering City Hall dwarfed by the emerging skyline of Bunker 
Hill. They've seen the Hollywood of legend with the Capitol Records building 
and the Hollywood sign looming from on high, and they've seen the New Hollywood 
of Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of the Hollywood Freeway as being the ultimate L.A. urban freeway," 
said Joel Kotkin, a socio-economist and Hollywood Freeway commuter. "It really 
connects three L.A.s: Downtown, the center of commerce; Hollywood, the center 
of legendary L.A.; and the San Fernando Valley, the center of suburbia. . . . 
It takes you through more worlds faster than any freeway in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The first segment of Los Angeles' second oldest freeway -- the 1 1/2-mile 
Cahuenga Pass Freeway -- opened June, 15, 1940, by an old Indian trail used by 
Don Gaspar de Portola and his expedition in 1769 to reach what was destined to 
become the West's greatest metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The last segment of the 10-mile freeway between Downtown and the Valley opened 
April 16, 1954 -- the same year that Los Angeles suffered one of its worst 
attacks of smog. The freeway -- mostly four lanes in each direction -- was 
completed during the period when the Valley was experiencing its greatest 
population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big step toward opening up the San Fernando Valley," said Guy 
Weddington McCreary, a North Hollywood businessman whose parents' home was 
acquired when the freeway was extended farther into the Valley in the 1960s. 
"It changed a way of living, some for the better and some for the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 At the dedication in 1954, Los Angeles County Supervisor John Anson Ford 
described the freeway as "a great entrance to one of the great cities of 
America" and voiced a plea that it be kept clean of rubbish and unsightly 
billboards. (He lost the battle over the billboards.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hollywood Freeway was really the result of a convergence of interests 
between developers in the Valley at the end of (World War II) and Downtown 
interests who wanted to keep the trade of Valley residents," said urban 
historian Mike Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for the dream highway to become a nightmare for commuters, 
an example of almost instant unplanned obsolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 * A year after the $55-million freeway opened, traffic engineers lamented that 
it was jammed with 183,000 vehicles a day -- "almost double the volume it was 
designed to carry" and earning it a place in Bob Hope's routine as the "biggest 
parking lot in the world." Today, the freeway -- since widened -- carries about 
273,000 vehicles a day, but it has dropped to seventh busiest in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speeding became a problem early on. In the 1950s, speeders were sentenced to 
five days in jail -- for driving 85 m.p.h. The problem was so bad that Police 
Chief William Parker announced that motor officers would cruise the freeway at 
55 m.p.h., and any motorist who passed them would be ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the mid-1950s, the City Council was urged to ban funeral processions from 
the freeway. "Needless to say the processions are certainly in no hurry," one 
driver said. The proposal died, so to speak. Also in the 1950s, the council 
considered barring trucks from the freeway -- as they are from the Pasadena. 
Petitions said the trucks pose a "traffic hazard, obstructing vision and 
spewing noxious fumes in the face of motorists for whom the freeway was 
intended." That ban too was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 * The freeway was a testing ground for the latest in highway technology. It 
featured the engineering marvel of 1954 -- the octopus-like four-level 
interchange, still called "the four level" in traffic reports, that eventually 
connected the Hollywood, Harbor, Pasadena and Santa Ana freeways. It was built 
on the former site of the town gallows. In 1967, the Hollywood Freeway became 
the first urban freeway in California to experiment with ramp meters. "We used 
to hide in the bushes and operate it by hand," said Caltrans engineer Nick 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway also has developed a lore of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 When a tanker truck loaded with explosive gas overturned in 1958, a young 
woman aspiring to become a Hollywood model ran down in a bathing suit and 
wigwagged for photographers. When told that she was standing on a bridge that 
might blow up at any moment, she finally left. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, a truckload of BBs spilled. Some motorists tried to get 
through, but they could only spin their wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the back door of a Brink's truck popped open, spilling $7,000 
worth of quarters and causing a massive traffic jam. A Brink's guard said that 
although "some cars stopped on the side of the road" -- their occupants 
apparently thinking of picking up a bit of spare change -- his presence 
dissuaded them. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there were the legendary freeway chickens: In the early 1970s, 
they fell (or jumped) off a truck where the eastbound Ventura Freeway swings 
south into the Hollywood Freeway. Most were recaptured, but some evaded 
trackers and they -- or their descendants -- are still glimpsed by drivers, 
living wild amid the freeway brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the freeway date back to 1924, when Los Angeles voters approved a 
traffic improvement proposal that included a "stop-free express highway" 
between Downtown and the then-sleepy Valley. At the time, Cahuenga Boulevard -- 
two lanes in each direction -- was the route. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, the city's Transportation Engineering Board proposed a new system of 
mass transportation that included the "Hollywood Parkway" and a subway to be 
built under Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the panel's report, the trip from Sixth and Hill streets in 
Downtown to Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street took 25 minutes on city 
streets, but with the proposed "express highway," it would take only 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel advocated charging a 10-cent toll to pay for building the freeway. 
But the tollbooths never had to be built. The state Legislature provided 
additional gas tax funds to pay for freeway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1940, the city opened the Cahuenga Pass Freeway with the Pacific Electric 
trolley running down the middle. (When the trolleys stopped running in 1952, 
Caltrans bought the 48-foot-wide strip and used it to widen the freeway. The 
bolts that held the trolley wires are still visible on the Barham Boulevard 
bridge.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the dedication, Ann Begue Packman, secretary of the Historical Society of 
Southern California, remarked, "Until the late 1890s, this road, except in a 
few spots, was so narrow that two vehicles could not pass, and we used to sing 
at the top of our voices to let folks know we were coming as we swung up the 
pass behind a pair of high-stepping bays." 
</P>
<P>
 "When Gene Autry, as the honorary mayor of North Hollywood, helped to open the 
first section of the Cahuenga Freeway, Angelenos could at last experience a 
sample of the new world to come," wrote David Gebhard and Harriette Von Breton 
in "L.A. in the Thirties." "The design of the bridges, retaining walls, and 
other features was functional and utilitarian in feeling with just a slight 
hint of the Streamline Moderne." 
</P>
<P>
 Work was delayed by World War II labor and material shortages, but 
construction of the Hollywood Freeway got under way in earnest in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway became the first to be built through heavily populated 
neighborhoods, creating what would become a recurring theme of freeway 
construction even today: resistance from property owners along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an outrage to mutilate Hollywood with the freeway," read a 1946 letter 
to the Hollywood Citizen News. "Known throughout the world as a residential 
paradise, this will bring disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 A.D. Griffin, the late state highway engineer who supervised the freeway 
construction, wrote in a state publication that the freeway went through 
Whitley Heights, "one of the fine old residential sections of Hollywood, and 
many beautiful homes had to be taken," including Rudolph Valentino's house 
Falcon's Lair. Altogether, the state demolished 90 buildings, and moved 1,728 
structures, Griffin reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In clearing the path, freeway right-of-way agents got caught up in a scandal: 
They were accused of conspiring with real estate firms to sell property at 
inflated prices. Two agents were sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The route was influenced by a number of factors. The alignment had to be 
skewed at Sunset Boulevard to avoid the new studio installed by television 
station KTTV. It had to be curved around Hollywood Presbyterian Church. At the 
Hollywood Bowl, extra landscaping was provided to buffer the outdoor concerts 
from freeway noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious design problem, according to engineers, was the junction of 
the Hollywood, Pasadena and segments of the Harbor and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 What was born was the most expensive half-mile road in the world -- the 
four-level interchange, known as "the stack" and "the Mixmaster." It cost $5.5 
million -- which today would pay for 250 feet of urban freeway. Crews removed a 
large chunk of Fort Moore Hill, which, up until that point, was the largest 
excavation in city history and destroyed dozens of apartments and stores, 
forcing out about 4,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 W.L. Fahey, a state highway engineer, reported in the early 1950s that since 
the excavation began on Fort Moore Hill, site of the first U.S. flag raising in 
California, "treasure hunters with imaginations fired by the exploits of the 
conquistadores have been eagerly haunting the construction area between 
Broadway and Grand avenues. The power shovels have exposed bones and coffins at 
the site of the old French Cemetery, and bottles and utensils bearing marks of 
antiquity, but, alack and alas, no gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Trombatore, a former Caltrans director who worked as an assistant engineer 
on the Hollywood Freeway construction in the early '50s, recalled that the 
foundations of homes and other rubble removed from the path of the freeway were 
dumped in Chavez Ravine -- the present site of Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for the freeway system, Dodger Stadium wouldn't be where it is 
now," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1940s, City Council members talked about including a rail line on 
the freeway to the Valley. But after lobbying from the Downtown and Hollywood 
chambers of commerce, the Automobile Club of Southern California and the 
Downtown Business Men's Assn., the council decided to go ahead without the rail 
line, saying that efforts to incorporate rapid transit plans would delay 
construction another five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concession to rapid transit supporters, highway engineers agreed to build 
bus turnouts on the freeway -- and they are still in use. 
</P>
<P>
 In building the Hollywood Freeway, engineers applied the lessons they had 
learned from the Arroyo Seco Parkway. They lengthened the on-ramps. They 
widened the lanes. They provided shoulders for emergencies. They also 
"elevated" the lanes, banking them to account for speed. 
</P>
<P>
 And engineers learned from the Hollywood too. After observing cars weaving to 
avoid each other while trying to get on and off ramps spaced only half a mile 
apart on stretches of the Hollywood Freeway, engineers planned most ramps on 
future freeways at least a mile apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway was opened in segments. Finally, on April 15, 1954, the last 
segment was dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
 With a stretch of the Santa Ana Freeway already open, motorists could drive 
from Vineland Avenue in North Hollywood almost to the Orange County border, 
taking them within a few miles of Disneyland, which would open in 1955. (The 
Hollywood Freeway would be extended through the Valley, reaching the Golden 
State Freeway in 1968.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the April 15, 1954, ribbon cutting at the Pilgrimage Bridge, Bob Hope 
snipped a strip of movie film. He quipped that although he was glad the thing 
was finished, he was going to miss the detours he sometimes took on the way to 
his Valley home because Seattle was so nice at that time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hollywood Freeway represents a testimony to the Downtown Establishment of 
that era, which still had lively hopes of centralizing Los Angeles according to 
classic urban patterns," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and a historian. 
</P>
<P>
 And Davis noted that it was the first freeway in the sense that the Pasadena 
was something different -- a parkway. The Pasadena was "laid out purposely with 
beautiful, wide-angle curves to be driven at 45 miles an hour," he said. "The 
Hollywood Freeway was the route to work, with a minimum of scenic pretensions." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its lack of pretense, just about everybody who has driven the freeway 
has a story to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hollywood Freeway used to be a real thrill on a wet night," said Bill 
Keene, retired dean of broadcast traffic reporters. "The freeway through the 
Cahuenga Pass was sloped toward the center divider. The minute they got a 
little water on it, everybody wound up in the center divider. I speak from 
experience because I was one of the guys that wiped out the fence once." 
Caltrans finally fixed the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 And even those who tend to intellectual analysis of the urban landscape can 
wax poetic about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drive from the San Fernando Valley along the Hollywood Freeway is in 
itself an exhilarating urban experience," Starr said. "Especially to pass 
through the valley of neon that characterizes downtown Hollywood -- the Capitol 
Records building, the Musso & Franks sign. . . . And then to see the rising 
lights of Los Angeles is to experience a multilayered message about Los Angeles 
-- past, present and future."

CARTER BRINGS PEACE MISSION TO BOSNIAN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter arrived in this besieged capital Sunday on a 
controversial peace mission being conducted against a backdrop of skepticism 
and distrust -- but also faint hope. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. jet carrying Carter landed amid tight security at the bombed-out 
airport as the afternoon sun slipped behind the rugged mountains ringing 
Sarajevo, where 10,000 people have been killed in the 32-month civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a limited role," Carter said on a tarmac lined with sandbag 
fortifications. "What I would like to do, obviously, is to understand the 
situation and contribute to the alleviation of tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo's shattered residents harbor hope that the latest in a string of 
frustrated peace missions might bring an end to the most horrific European war 
in half a century. More than 250,000 people have died or are missing in the 
war, which began when Bosnian Serb separatists rebelled against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's 1992 secession from the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the capital showed few signs of the tranquillity and relative normalcy 
promised by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic when he invited the former 
President last week. It was only the second day in nearly a month that the 
rebels had granted security guarantees for U.N. aircraft to land. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before Carter reached Sarajevo, an explosive believed to be a 
rocket-propelled grenade pounded the Holiday Inn, home to many journalists and 
official visitors, destroying three unoccupied rooms. On the city's streets, 
sniper fire injured a 73-year-old woman, while an exploding rifle grenade 
wounded a French U.N. peacekeeper and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the evening, the clatter of gunfire and the pounding of explosives 
served as constant reminders that Karadzic's pledge of a cease-fire in the area 
had not been honored. U.N. Protection Force officials also reported that 
convoys of food and fuel were blocked by Bosnian Serbs, in violation of another 
Karadzic promise, while access to the airport continued to be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the same problems remain," one U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who had said he would not become involved in the peace process unless 
Karadzic honored his pledges, was apprised of the Bosnian Serb actions in 
meetings in Zagreb, Croatia, and Sarajevo on Sunday. But he decided to go 
forward with his mission anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that I have received enough assurance to go to Pale," said Carter, 
referring to the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb capital near Sarajevo where he is 
scheduled to meet Karadzic and other Bosnian Serb leaders this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving here Sunday, Carter held talks with Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic. In a brief news conference following the meeting, Carter said he 
supports the so-called Contact Group peace plan, which would divide Bosnia 
roughly in half between the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of Carter's peace effort say Karadzic hopes to manipulate the mission 
to undo the Contact Group plan, which has been accepted by all parties except 
the Bosnian Serbs. The Bosnian government and the five-nation Contact Group, 
including the United States, have insisted that any mediation effort by Carter 
start only after Karadzic agrees to the existing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, however, would not directly answer questions about whether the plan 
itself might be negotiable, saying only that "there is no other basis for 
future negotiations" and that "whatever is done within the Contact Group plan 
must be mutually decided" by the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Izetbegovic was less equivocating. He ruled out any changes to the plan and 
said Carter had assured him that the mission is aimed at securing Karadzic's 
acceptance of an unaltered document, which would require the Bosnian Serbs to 
give up about one-third of the territory they now control. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic turned down the plan in the summer, a decision that was endorsed by a 
Bosnian Serb referendum. But the Bosnian president said Carter indicated "that 
there is a readiness" on Karadzic's part to accept the plan, although Carter 
would not comment on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have very clearly pointed out that . . . the plan of the Contact Group 
would be the starting point for further negotiations, and Mr. Carter has very 
clearly confirmed that and said if he were in our shoes he would ask the same," 
Izetbegovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter appeared to be keeping his options open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the president (Izetbegovic) that I will come back here to report to 
him and that I hope my visit will be fruitful," he said. "It is too early for 
me to give any definitive answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter began his current trip in Frankfurt, Germany, where he met with U.N. 
and U.S. officials before flying to Zagreb. In the Croatian capital, he held 
talks with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman, U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi and Peter Galbraith, the U.S. 
ambassador to Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Following their meeting, Akashi expressed confidence in Carter's effort, 
saying that the former President "is too intelligent to be manipulated by 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic expressed fears that the Bosnian Serbs will use Carter's visit to 
divert attention from heavy fighting in northwest Bosnia, where Bosnian Serbs 
are trying to overrun the U.N.-declared "safe area" of Bihac. In Sarajevo, 
Izetbegovic echoed the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we have been speaking about the visit of Mr. Carter, the fighting in 
Bihac has intensified," Izetbegovic said. "So we are fearing that this might 
just be a curtain (so) that this job in the Bihac region (can) be completed 
militarily." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pale, a Bosnian Serb spokesman said Karadzic had no sinister motives in 
calling for Carter's participation in the peace process and that the Bosnian 
Serb leader hoped only to "break the deadlock in the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said Carter would spend Sunday night at the U.N. residence of 
Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander for Bosnia, who was in Italy for 
military meetings. Carter, joined by his wife, Rosalynn, and two aides, will 
tour Sarajevo this morning before traveling to Pale, the officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOLS TO GET FULL TAX SHARE; FINANCES: LEVIES ON PROPERTY WERE 
COLLECTED AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY FILING. NONPROFIT GROUPS ALSO GET GOOD NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Sunday told school officials -- many 
who feared they could not make their first post-Christmas payroll -- that they 
can have their full share of the millions in property taxes collected after the 
county filed for bankruptcy nearly two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a separate action by the county's new bankruptcy management council, 
more than 100 nonprofit groups will get $2.9 million to cover the services they 
provided before funds in the county investment pool were frozen Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 As supervisors moved Sunday to repair the financial damage caused by the 
nation's largest municipal bankruptcy case, state auditors sought to determine 
whether former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron criminally violated 
laws governing trust accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg said that attorneys from his office are looking at 
whether the agreements that Citron established with certain investors 
constituted trusts, and whether he dipped into some trust accounts to satisfy 
the needs of other investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A finding by state auditors that trust agreements existed with investors could 
not only leave Citron open to possible criminal prosecution, but also further 
financially cripple the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors found to have trust agreements might be entitled to be paid in 
full, leaving the county and other government agencies to bear the brunt of 
county investment fund losses now estimated at more than $2 billion. The trust 
agreements also may specifically limit how investors' funds can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly we will be looking to assure ourselves that local and state 
regulations were being followed," said Sjoberg, who is reviewing Citron's books 
from June 30 forward at the request of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans would not confirm whether his office 
was investigating Citron's handling of the trust accounts. "We have an ongoing 
review going on and we're working with a number of agencies, both state and 
local," he said. Separate Account 
</P>
<P>
 The best news Sunday came for county schools, when the five supervisors set up 
an account for schools separate within the beleaguered county pool. Both the 
recent property taxes and about $50 million that the state is scheduled to turn 
over at month's end will be deposited in the account. The school fund will be 
invested in conservative investments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools' separate account "will alleviate any concerns the state has that 
the (schools') money might get tied up in bankruptcy," said Ronald D. Wenkart, 
general counsel for the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors' action Sunday allows county school districts, many of which 
said they might not be able to operate past March without new funds, to breathe 
a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, school districts will receive their portion of property 
taxes that were paid after Dec. 6, when Orange County filed for protection 
under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified School District Supt. Peter A. Hartman described the 
action as a "very positive step," but just one of many needed to help school 
districts operate for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken longer than we hoped, but I'm glad it's done," he said. "This will 
give us some breathing room for the next month or two." 
</P>
<P>
 The district, one of the county's biggest, will receive about $20 million in 
recent property tax payments, about 40% to 50% of what it expects to receive 
for the year, Hartman said. That money will be used to help the district pay 
its employees at least through February, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also was necessary to calm the worries of state school officials 
that state money sent to the county would not be used solely for education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is very good news, to know that schools can expect this 
post-petition money," Wenkart said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wenkart stressed that Sunday's agreement does not free up money that 
schools deposited in the county fund before bankruptcy was filed. And Wenkart 
couldn't say how much money the schools can now expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's agreement simply guarantees that schools will be able to meet their 
immediate financial obligations, by ensuring that they will be able to write 
checks on an account that isn't embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement doesn't involve a specific amount of money, it involves the 
flow of money," said Wenkart, adding that schools still expect to get 100% of 
their pre-petition money out of the investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I would say to parents of schoolchildren in Orange County is that this 
is a good first step," Wenkart said. "Now we have to work on getting more 
money." Nonprofit Groups 
</P>
<P>
 The county's relief agencies were themselves relieved Sunday as news spread 
that the emergency council coping with Orange County's crisis had authorized 
payments to 108 desperate nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hope House, a long-term, 40-bed residential drug treatment program in 
Anaheim, the news lent a bit of extra cheer to an annual potluck Christmas 
dinner. At Phoenix House in Santa Ana, another substance abuse treatment 
program, a senior counselor could only say, "Whoopee!" 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll help us survive," said Marc Corradini, executive director of Hope 
House. He said his agency would have run out of money in February, so Sunday's 
news was not a last-minute reprieve, but something very close. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at the treatment center were aware of the crisis, Corradini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what's going on and they were reading the papers and asking me, so 
I pretty much let them know what our status was." 
</P>
<P>
 Corradini said he was determined that the center would not close its doors, 
especially not for want of $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We literally were turning out lights in our therapy room and trying to get 
food donated because there's not much fat in our budget," he said. "Today, 
we're having a potluck celebration. Families brought in (food) to celebrate 
Christmas. So (the news) comes at a very nice time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor William G. Steiner warned the county's nonprofit agencies, most 
of which rely on county funds, that they may not be able to count on public 
money in the future. The county will pay for bills it already has received from 
the groups, but future bills face more delays and uncertainty, said Steiner, 
the former director of Orange County's home for abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was alarmed at how many depend on public funds," Steiner said. "This means, 
of course, that they're at greatest risk of their programs being jeopardized, 
in contrast to those agencies . . . that are primarily relying on private 
donations." Trust Agreements 
</P>
<P>
 While the schools and relief agencies celebrated their bit of extra cash, the 
state auditor's office was trying to sort out what their status was in the 
county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditor Sjoberg said his office is looking to determine whether investors -- 
such as school districts that are required by law to invest in the county -- 
had, in essence, trust agreements with Citron. The auditors are also 
scrutinizing whether these agreements detailed how their money could be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg said auditors will be looking to see whether Citron violated trust 
agreements by using some investors' money to pay off other obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg said that if a trust fund was established by a specific agreement or 
contract or by government statute, Citron "could not dip into those funds for 
any purpose than what's spelled out in the trust agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor's legal department also is attempting to determine what the 
potential penalties would be for the violations of a trust agreement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust fund provision states that "when any public entity or public 
official . . . who is required or authorized by law to deposit funds into a 
county treasury makes a deposit, those funds shall be deemed to be held in 
trust . . . these funds shall not be deemed funds or assets of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 If investors' funds are found to be trusts, the county would be required to 
repay investing agencies in full before withdrawing any money for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument is already being made forcefully by school district attorneys, 
individuals who invested court settlements at the encouragement of local 
judges, and some government agencies that say they had received assurances and 
documentation from Citron that their money would be invested separately and 
more conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, U.S. Trustee Marcy J. K. Tiffany, who is overseeing the case for 
federal Bankruptcy Court, dismissed the idea of investors recovering their 
money from the fund first as "shortsighted" and not supported by the law. "It's 
like choking yourself with your own hand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If all other investors were repaid in full, the county could lose about 
three-quarters of the nearly $3 billion it has tied up in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors have said they have letters from Citron indicating that their 
funds were protected from risky investments and kept in a "bond pool" separate 
from the commingled county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said Saturday that it 
remains unclear whether funds in the pool were kept in separate accounts 
earning different returns. Bennett said he had discovered conflicting records 
about whether Citron -- who resigned two weeks ago -- kept segregated accounts 
for some of the 187 cities, school districts and other agencies that had money 
in the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg said the auditors would be looking at the letters that investors 
received from Citron "to see whether they create a contractual agreement or 
trust agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 News that state auditors were looking into the issue of trusts and whether 
Citron handled them properly was greeted with enthusiasm by the fund's 
investors Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "All investors, especially those school districts who were assured their 
investment was risk-free, have to certainly welcome the state auditor's 
investigation," said Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said he had never heard that Citron juggled investors' funds to meet 
other obligations, but he said, "I think we will all be very curious about 
that."

L.A. INTENSIFIES EFFORT AS HOPE FADES FOR $100 MILLION IN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Los Angeles leaders, once confident that the region would be tapped for a 
$100-million federal empowerment zone program, are worried that they will be 
shut out of the grant derby, and are now scrambling to persuade Washington that 
the area's poorer neighborhoods desperately need the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials have become so pessimistic about the chances of being selected 
this week as a federal empowerment zone -- an idea that originated in the wake 
of the Los Angeles riots -- that Mayor Richard Riordan sent President Clinton a 
letter over the weekend telling him it would be "a mistake" to leave out Los 
Angeles, officials said. Riordan asked the White House to intercede on behalf 
of the city, an aide to the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we're just fighting like hell for this designation," Deputy 
Mayor Robin Kramer said Sunday. "The lines (between Los Angeles and Washington) 
have been hopping." 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment zones combine federal money with private-sector incentives and tax 
breaks within a specific area of no more than 20,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is 
scheduled to announce the six finalists for the empowerment program from a 
nationwide list, and HUD Assistant Secretary Andrew Cuomo stressed Sunday that 
no final decisions have yet been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few days ago, local leaders appeared confident that a joint proposal 
by Los Angeles city and county would be among the six. But those sentiments 
have changed in light of mixed signals from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one Administration official said Sunday that some staff members who 
have reviewed the empowerment zone applications believe that Los Angeles's 
entry was "not as strong" as others, in part because it had not demonstrated 
the necessary commitment from the private sector. But the official added that 
"this sentiment is not overwhelming," and the local application could generate 
significant debate at a meeting today on the six finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment zones were first proposed in 1992 by the Bush Administration after 
the Los Angeles riots, and Clinton resuscitated the idea as the cornerstone of 
his own economic urban revitalization program. Local leaders see the plan as 
one of the most promising and lucrative economic development programs for Los 
Angeles in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The local proposal would create an empowerment zone out of a 20-square-mile 
area of poor neighborhoods from Pacoima through South-Central to Watts. If 
selected, the area would receive $100 million for social service programs, 
along with tax breaks for local businesses, job training grants and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, however, the feeling of anticipation began to fade last 
Wednesday, when HUD officials met with local leaders here and began discussing 
other economic options for the area if it is not selected as an empowerment 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard in the wind that L.A.'s application was, quote, 'not competitive,' " 
Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mixed signals set off a wave of second-guessing among local officials -- 
and a flurry of phone calls and letters among politicians on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians at all levels of government in Los Angeles, including Rep. Maxine 
Waters (D-Los Angeles), Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Supervisor 
Gloria Molina and Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and others, have all 
become involved in the effort, Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer said city officials are unclear as to why Los Angeles may have fallen 
out of the running. Federal officials have indicated in the past that the 
Southland's proposal was not detailed enough, but Kramer said she also believes 
that the selection formulas are weighted in favor of eastern cities, which have 
higher density rates than Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's much concern within the California delegation" about not getting the 
designation, said a Capitol Hill aide who asked not to be identified, "and much 
concern has been expressed to the White House. Los Angeles should be one of 
those chosen, but it is generally felt that the selection process may be 
flawed."

CHECHNYA SHUNS MOSCOW'S TERMS FOR PEACE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Russian warplanes and artillery pounded the perimeter of his capital, the 
president of the rebellious republic of Chechnya said Sunday that he is willing 
to resume peace talks with Moscow -- but only on his besieged home ground. His 
condition kept the conflict at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters in the flag-draped bunker beneath his presidential 
headquarters, Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev declared that he is not a lackey "who 
will go anywhere at the wiggle of a finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian forces have been bombarding scattered points in Chechnya off and on 
since thousands of troops moved into the breakaway region Dec. 11, but Dudayev 
turned down flat a proposal that he venture out of Chechnya to meet a Kremlin 
emissary in the southern Russian city of Mozdok, 60 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Dudayev said in a terse telegram dispatched to Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin on Sunday evening, "I am prepared to receive your authorized 
representatives" in Grozny, the Chechen capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev made no pretense of softening his stance on Chechnya's demand for 
independence and said, "Relations with Russia amount to a state of war." 
</P>
<P>
 A Yeltsin spokesman, Yuri Leonov, said Dudayev's message "did not answer" the 
president's proposal. "There will be no more answers to Dudayev's telegrams," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest fruitless exchange over peace talks, which collapsed Wednesday, 
came amid some of the heaviest bombing yet in Chechnya, an oil-rich republic of 
1.2 million people in the northern Caucasus Mountains. One bomb hit an electric 
power station, blacking out part of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Planes roared over Grozny minutes after a Russian ultimatum to the Muslim 
Chechens to lay down their arms expired at midnight Saturday. Dudayev said 
Russian bombs and artillery hit dozens of places just outside the city, 
including the republic's television transmission center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire is aimed at military targets, but shells hit civilian houses," said 
Sergei Kovalyov, one of five Russian lawmakers who came to Grozny to protest 
the war. "I have seen destroyed civilian houses and dead bodies of civilians 
with my own eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither he nor any other official gave casualty figures among the Chechens. 
Four more Russian soldiers were reported killed Sunday, raising the total to 20 
in the 8-day-old operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian authorities said they were hitting ammunition depots, Chechen troop 
concentrations and other strategic targets. They claimed to have struck five 
bridges over the Terek River, although no one here was able to find any that 
were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Staropromyshlovsky district on the edge of Grozny, there did not seem 
to be anything even remotely strategic about the food warehouse where watchman 
Magomed Murtazov was jolted awake by a missile attack at 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack left a crater outside his shack five feet wide and his kitchen 
dishes covered in crumbled plaster and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought this was a military base," he said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away, women and children from areas pounded heavily by artillery 
in recent days huddled in the claustrophobic confines of an aging bomb shelter. 
Unheated but warmed by the clammy breaths of its unhappy inhabitants, the 
shelter gets so full at night that there is barely room to sit, the women said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just want to destroy," said Ruslan Ushmanov, commander of a nearby 
Chechen fighter base that may have been the target of the missile. Ushmanov 
said he didn't think the Russians were necessarily aiming at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to destroy houses," he said. "They just want to destroy everything 
we have. . . . These are psychological attacks. They keep us expecting them at 
any moment." 
</P>
<P>
 If the tension of unpredictable attacks was meant to break down the Chechens' 
defiance, it appeared to be having the opposite effect among the shelter's 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubov Mutsayeva, a 68-year-old woman still recovering from a recent operation, 
vowed that if only the Russians would stop their aerial bombing and try to take 
Chechnya by land, "I swear by Allah, I will bite them through the throat with 
my teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hot Chechen blood is like Gypsy blood," she said. "One of our boys can 
kill 500 of theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Russian strikes fell on cowsheds in the village of Petropavlovskaya near 
Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 What would seem to be the most obvious target of the Russian bombing, the 
nine-story presidential headquarters from which Dudayev runs the republic, 
remained untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Soviet bomber pilot, who spent Saturday night in the building, said 
Yeltsin was afraid to attack him, because if he did, "then I'd have the right 
to bomb the Kremlin." 
</P>
<P>
 "We avenge ourselves," Dudayev said. "We're patient. One day, two, three, a 
year passes, but vengeance is inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chechens are known as a fierce people with a penchant for organized crime 
and a powerful tradition of clans and blood feuds. They have battled the 
Russians since the 18th Century. In 1991, Dudayev came to power and declared 
Chechnya's independence, beginning a new cycle of conflict with the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 On-and-off negotiations between Moscow and Grozny have repeatedly broken down, 
and the Kremlin resorted to covertly supporting a Chechen opposition group that 
tried to storm Grozny last month and failed miserably, leaving tanks and 
weapons to Dudayev's victorious forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev claimed Sunday that suicide soldiers have disabled 12 Russian tanks by 
throwing themselves beneath them and setting off grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Chechens' spirited resistance, some military specialists said they 
expected a ground assault aimed at seizing control of Grozny -- if only to 
avoid a demoralizing retreat by the Russian army from Chechnya and possibly the 
entire Caucasus region. Russian officials emphasized that no such order had 
been given. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city will be stormed, and soon," predicted Pavel Felgengauer, the 
well-informed defense correspondent of the Moscow newspaper Sevodnya. "Of 
course, they will try to act with a scalpel and not with an ax. High-precision 
weapons will be used." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei A. Filatov, Yeltsin's chief of staff, warned reporters in Moscow not to 
expect a sweeping advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to avoid words like storming , assault and combat operations ," 
he said. "What we are talking about is the suppression of gun emplacements, 
spots of resistance, military hardware depots. This is not a war. This can be 
called special operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Guarded by more than two dozen soldiers spread along the hallways that lead to 
his bunker, Dudayev looked relatively fresh for a man who had spent the 
previous night anticipating an attack -- and was still expecting one. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke in measured, dramatic tones. His jutting cheekbones, dark eyes and 
trimmed mustache gave him the look of a movie actor of the 1920s, but his words 
flirted with the bounds of sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused Russia of "blasphemy, cynicism, vandalism and barbarism" and warned 
that "if this policy of satanism continues, Russia will condemn itself to its 
own death."

WEST VALLEY SEEN AS KEY FOR BOARD RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE and HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During his last run for the Los Angeles Unified School District board, Mark 
Slavkin pined for a campaign that would generate widespread interest among 
voters, who typically turn out in excruciatingly low numbers for school board 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Slavkin's wish may come true, but, following the outline of a common 
fable, it may not be quite what he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 A recall drive has been launched against the school board president as 
retribution for his support of Los Angeles Unified's legal challenge to 
Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigrant measure approved by 59% of the 
state's voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sponsors get the recall on the ballot in the L-shaped district 
stretching from Chatsworth to Westchester, the effort threatens to draw out the 
very voters who usually ignore school board races: people without children. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this is the first clap of rolling-thunder political upsets like those 
that followed the passage of property tax-freezing Proposition 13, or merely a 
last publicity gasp from the forces behind Proposition 187, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Dave Doerr, it has a familiar and unsettling sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Doerr served as a suburban Sacramento school board member in 1978 and was the 
only one of five board members who voted not to join a suit against Proposition 
13. He also was the only one not targeted for recall by furious citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people became unglued," Doerr said. "It just went like wildfire. 
Overnight, they collected the signatures and recalled the four other members of 
my board. I was left as the sole survivor." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin prefers to point out the differences between then and now, namely that 
Proposition 13 was a pocketbook issue -- people mad about rising taxes voting 
to lower them, then lashing out at elected officials who disagreed -- while 
Proposition 187 was an attempt to stem illegal immigration and the school board 
has merely challenged its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much more indirect you can get in your focus than to attack 
the problem of illegal immigration by attempting to recall a school board 
member," Slavkin said during an interview last week. "It seems like a grand 
diversion." 
</P>
<P>
 But the leaders of the recall drive prefer to dwell on the similarities, 
saying the bottom line is the same: The use of taxpayer money to oppose a 
measure overwhelmingly approved by taxpayers, and the arrogance of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that they would use our public monies to fight something that was 
clearly the will of the people is quite outlandish, particularly because it was 
clear private parties were already pursuing legal challenges to 187," said 
Janice Bierley, a former science teacher in Granada Hills and Hollywood, and 
director of the recall committee of the Voice of Citizens Together, a San 
Fernando Valley organization. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the recall measure on the ballot, the group has to gather nearly 53,000 
signatures in the next three months. They are aiming for the June primary, but 
city elections officials say it would more likely require a special election. A 
simple majority of the turnout would push Slavkin from office. 
</P>
<P>
 The key for recall proponents, political consultants said, will be to focus 
their efforts on the West Valley, where support for Proposition 187 was high 
and where lies 40% of Slavkin's district. The other 60% is on the Westside, 
where the immigration measure lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, a Times evaluation showed the measure carried the entire district by 
the narrowest of margins -- 51% to 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 Many political pundits believe a single unknown will determine which way the 
recall will go: the ability to tap into and sustain voter anger, which they say 
will be essential both for gathering petition signatures and for raising up to 
$250,000 needed to finance the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they strike while the iron is hot, they may have a receptive audience," 
said Arnold Steinberg, a Valley-based political strategist who has worked on 
many Republican campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin's greatest strengths, consultants agreed, is that he is a good 
campaigner with a reputation for being in touch with his constituents. A main 
weakness is that he is not well-known in the West Valley because that area was 
added to his district less than two years ago through reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that if voter anger is the determining factor, Slavkin may be in 
serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 At the two recall organizing meetings held in the San Fernando Valley, 
emotions ran high, with cheers and jeers breaking out in equal measure among a 
crowd numbering in the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 And Voice of Citizens Together founder Glenn Spencer tapped into their 
frustration. "This city has been invaded," Spencer told the crowd gathered in a 
Sherman Oaks elementary school auditorium last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He blasted the Board of Education as "anti-American" for its stand on 187 and 
some of its members' pre-election vows not to comply with provisions to report 
children suspected of being here illegally. "You are to be colonized. . . . 
That's the philosophy of these Board of Education members," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The race to qualify the recall election began Friday, with city approval of 
the recall petitions' language. Though they don't have much time, supporters 
remind skeptics that they are part of the group that qualified Proposition 187 
for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin is taking the drive quite seriously too. Already he has begun 
interviewing political consultants and sending out letters seeking 
contributions from perennial supporters. And he worries that the battle is 
distracting him from the business of running the nation's second largest school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The political consultant who ran Slavkin's two successful campaigns for school 
board advised that acting slowly could be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they actually start to begin the process, he should be out there in the 
streets . . . with his troops, getting his message across," said consultant 
Rick Taylor. "While they're out there getting signatures, they're framing the 
issue in people's minds . . . and you don't want to let them frame the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' last successful recall was also of a sitting Board of Education 
president, Howard Miller, ousted in 1979 by a 57% majority, angry over his 
support of busing. Miller lost by more than 4 to 1 in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not help matters that Miller also denounced Proposition 13 on 
television, radio and in print -- and wound up debating one of the initiative's 
popular authors, Howard Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller "managed to stoke the fire of people against him -- not only the people 
who were against him on busing but people who were against him on Prop. 13," 
recalls Northridge political consultant Paul Clarke, one of the leaders of the 
recall-Miller movement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the similarities between Miller and Slavkin -- the recall drives following 
unpopular stands on a statewide ballot measure and the activism of West Valley 
residents -- end there. It is the differences between the two -- particularly 
in political backing and logistics -- that observers say could form 
insurmountable advantages for Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strikes me as a different time and a different issue," said Miller, who 
has returned to practicing law in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Under old election rules, Miller was elected citywide, so his opponents had a 
larger territory from which to garner petition signatures and support. 
</P>
<P>
 But Slavkin was elected in a smaller district. The size and the typically low 
turnout -- fewer than one-third of registered voters cast ballots in the 1993 
school board election -- means that the influence of groups such as the 
teachers union and homeowner organizations is magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has vowed to back Slavkin in the recall drive. United Teachers Los 
Angeles helped Slavkin beat an incumbent in his first election in 1989, then 
abandoned him in 1993 after he joined the board majority in voting to cut 
teacher pay by 10%. But Slavkin later helped restore 8% of that cut, winning 
back union support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a number of items where we have a lot of similarities with 
Mark," said UTLA President Helen Bernstein. "And this is not about Mark Slavkin 
personally, this is: Do you go out and punish people for carrying out their 
constitutional duties?" 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, parent-teacher associations are expected to back Slavkin. Harriet 
Sculley, president of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student Assn., which 
covers the Valley, said parents there now accept Slavkin as their 
representative, despite his political beginnings on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark has been very available to the community. It seems like at least once a 
month I hear of him having a meeting at a school, having a community meeting," 
Sculley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Valley homeowner associations and other neighborhood groups, on the other 
hand, probably will line up against Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, who was an attorney for the recall-Miller campaign and is 
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., believes the issue will appeal 
to those upset about the sorry state of the schools, regardless of their 
position on 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing in the community is very simple: 'When they can't keep the 
schools clean, when they don't have enough money for paint, why are they 
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees to overturn what the 
voters approved?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But if the recall effort results in a special election, the school district 
would have to foot that bill, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bierley, the recall director, sees no hypocrisy there. "At least it's the 
people deciding how they want the money to be spent," she said. "At least we 
would stop them and stop their misuse of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Close believes that some Valley homeowners long active in civic affairs and 
political organizing will turn out to help the recall movement, even if they 
live outside Slavkin's district. They would be ineligible to sign petitions and 
vote for a recall, but could provide money and important grass-roots support. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Valley, that kind of support is unlikely to materialize, said Bill 
Christopher, coordinator of PLAN/LA, a citywide consortium of neighborhood 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you are trying to recall a white male activist, who is a liberal, with 
strong ties to the Jewish community in West L.A.," Christopher said. "In places 
(other than the Valley), I don't know that it will translate into manpower and 
phone banks and precinct walkers."

 With McDonald's gift certificates in his pocket and a list of names on his 
clipboard, Liam Weston makes the rounds of a Venice apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a Republican foot soldier scouring the corners of the 36th Congressional 
District for evidence of illegal votes, one of dozens of volunteers knocking on 
doors and asking questions: How long have you lived at this address? Are you 
registered? Did you vote in the last election? 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-food coupons are for those willing to respond. Most do, usually 
confirming the registration information Weston has with him. But in an hour's 
time on a recent Saturday morning, he and his walking partner, Michael Davis, 
find two apartments in which the information doesn't match. The people 
registered to vote at those addresses don't live there. 
</P>
<P>
 The names will go into a file -- part of a loosely knit but intensive effort 
to gather data that could be used to challenge the November election of some 
Democrats and, more broadly, to advance attempts to tighten registration and 
voting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 From the streets of Venice to county registrar's offices, lowly volunteers and 
high-powered attorneys are toiling over voting records and analyzing precinct 
tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Small groups, such as Weston's Committee for Election Integrity, are working 
with the Voter Fraud Task Force formed by Harold Ezell, one of the architects 
of Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigrant initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign of Republican Rep. Mike Huffington, who has refused to concede 
his 163,000-vote loss to U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, has hired Patton, Boggs & 
Blow, a prominent Washington law firm, to scrutinize the election results for 
irregularities. The Federal Recount Fund, a secretive fund with Huffington 
ties, has been formed to help finance the fraud hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials say they have no evidence of ballot fraud, and Democrats 
dismiss allegations of a tainted election as the grumbling of graceless losers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Republicans are not about to let go of the issue. With it, they see 
the potential of not only contesting some Democratic victories -- such as 
Feinstein's, and Jane Harman's in the 36th Congressional District along the 
county's southern coastline -- but also of gaining momentum to revise state and 
federal voting laws that they believe favor Democratic registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an opportunity to do something. . . . This is the day," said Ezell, 
pointing to a more receptive environment created by the rise of Republicans in 
the state Legislature and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Never shy of the limelight, Ezell leaped from the victorious Proposition 187 
campaign to the voter fraud crusade. A week after the election, he started up 
the task force, which he describes as "a nonpartisan citizens' action 
organization," but most of whose dozen members are Republican, including two 
conservative GOP legislators: state Sen. Richard L. Mountjoy of Arcadia and 
Assemblyman Bill Hoge of Pasadena. The group also includes Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich and veterans of the Proposition 187 drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that made me start wondering about this," Ezell says, "was when I 
was looking at the opposition to 187. I was watching the vociferous anger 
against 187 and the hot pursuit . . . to register (people) to vote against 
187." 
</P>
<P>
 It made him wonder, he says, how many who were registered by opponents of the 
initiative were "not qualified to vote, much less qualified to register." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, which operates out of Ezell's Newport Beach consulting office, 
recently opened a toll-free telephone hot line to take tips on suspicious 
voting activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is running radio advertisements, including one on Spanish-language 
stations, publicizing the line, and buying small ads in newspapers throughout 
the state to solicit tips to the hot line. So far hundreds of calls have come 
in, ranging from insults to hearsay to reports deemed worthy of follow-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, task force workers spent days in front of computers in the Los 
Angeles County registrar's office, comparing registration and voting records 
from precincts in the 36th Congressional District, where Republican Susan 
Brooks has refused to concede defeat in her 812-vote loss to Harman, the 
Democratic incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is also using Patton, Boggs attorneys, according to Ezell, who says 
he is pouring some of his own money into the effort, which he predicts will 
cost $150,000 to $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is otherwise vague about the source of the task force's financing. 
There are plans to file for nonprofit status, but so far, Ezell says, the task 
force is "just a bunch of people" and does not have to disclose its donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed, Ezell says that some of Huffington's friends are contributing money 
and that he "has gotten some bills paid" by the Federal Recount Fund. Indeed, 
Dimitri Carapanos, listed as a task force member when the group was formed, was 
later named as the treasurer of the Federal Recount Fund on a document request 
made to the San Francisco registrar's office. Ezell said Carapanos dropped off 
the task force a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fund, John Nelson, a spokesman for Huffington, said: "The people 
behind the fund would like to remain anonymous. They have the right to remain 
anonymous. . . . Michael Huffington is not a donor. He might be in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Nelson said, Huffington is involved with the fund and gets daily 
updates on its activities. Moreover, in contacting county registrars, the fund 
has given as its address the same Costa Mesa office suite that houses 
Huffington's office. "They might be sharing office space to save money," Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund is not stinting in other ways, however. A spokeswoman for the Los 
Angeles County registrar's office said the recount fund has requested copies of 
every page of the polling rosters signed by voters in each of the county's 
6,000 or so precincts in the Nov. 8 election. The estimated bill is $25,000. 
Another fund request, for the precinct auditing sheets, will cost about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While the fund is spending money and Ezell is beating the publicity drum, it 
appears that much of the hard-core election analysis is being conducted by 
Patton, Boggs. The firm has sent several attorneys to California, including 
partner Bob Hunter, an election law specialist who usually works out of the 
firm's North Carolina offices. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those familiar with the effort, the Patton, Boggs team is 
scrutinizing a wide variety of records, including precinct tally sheets, 
registration records and postal change-of-address lists -- which registrars 
rely on to see whether voters have moved. Pinkerton Security and Investigation 
Services was even briefly employed to get some information from registrar's 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney team, which has also hired some political scientists for data 
analysis, is not just looking for deliberate fraud. It is searching as well for 
discrepancies and sloppiness that would cast doubt on election figures. Even if 
individual precinct tallies are off by only a handful of votes, if that trend 
can be proved statewide, it could, in theory, add up to the kind of numbers 
Huffington needs to question Feinstein's winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is being done against a tight deadline, because elections have to be 
challenged within a month of certification. In the case of Huffington and 
Brooks, complaints could also be filed with the Senate and House, both of which 
will be under Republican control when the new session of Congress convenes in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell also says he wants to amass evidence to try to block implementation of 
the motor-voter law, which goes into effect next month, or even get Congress to 
repeal it. Widely opposed by Republicans, the national legislation allows 
people to register by mail (long the practice in California) and at welfare and 
motor vehicle offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite suggestions by both Ezell and Huffington that there may have been 
widespread voting by non-citizens in last month's elections, the search for 
illegal balloting seems to be taking other directions. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force press release earlier this month centered on various alleged 
discrepancies in balloting figures in the 36th District, which is being closely 
examined because of the narrow margin in that race. 
</P>
<P>
 Those discrepancies included differences between polling station tallies and 
the county registrar's numbers, as well as differences between the number of 
cast ballots and the number of signatures on the polling roster signed by 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, for his part, says his group's door-to-door canvassing has uncovered 
hundreds of voters registered at an address they do not appear to live at, 
including some vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "To what degree is it fraud and to what degree is it someone who moved, I'm 
not sure," says Weston, an El Segundo city councilman who has worked for 
several GOP politicians. "But they're all illegal votes." 
</P>
<P>
 (According to election laws, people can vote in their old precinct if they 
have moved within 28 days before an election, but otherwise they are required 
to re-register at their new address.) 
</P>
<P>
 Using a list provided by Weston's group, The Times contacted seven voters who 
were registered at one address but, according to postal forwarding information, 
no longer lived there. In several cases, the voters said they had moved a short 
distance away and either did not know they had to re-register or did not think 
it was that important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I didn't think it was that big a deal. I only moved five blocks away," 
said one man who returned to his old polling precinct for last month's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, a woman said she had never moved, but simply used a post 
office box for her mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredric Woocher, an election law specialist and Harman's attorney, dismissed 
the significance of the alleged irregularities so far cited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt that occurs in every election. It is far from voter fraud," 
Woocher said. "The notion of a coherent pattern of people (who have moved) 
running back into Jane Harman's district and voting for Jane Harman and not 
Susan Brooks is absurd. How would you organize that?"

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; LIVING IN COUGAR COUNTRY; MOUNTAIN LION ATTACKS AND SIGHTINGS 
NEAR THE TOWN OF DESCANSO HAVE THE LOCALS NERVOUS AND TOURISTS HEADING 
ELSEWHERE. SOME SAY NOTHING CAN BE DONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Now that their community has become the cougar capital of California, the 
residents of this tiny mountain hamlet -- not usually given to philosophical 
musings -- are discussing the proper relationship between man and beast. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal attack on a hiker by a cougar at nearby Cuyamaca Rancho State Park 
on Dec. 10 caught few by surprise in Descanso, where the 1,500 residents have 
learned to mix fear with respect when they regard the magnificent, heavily 
muscled predator, also known as a mountain lion, puma or panther. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mountain lions kill, that's all they're designed by nature to do," said John 
Elliott, who runs a general store, a video rental business and a real estate 
firm. "The park invites people up to look at the animals like it's a zoo, but 
it's a zoo without bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, 38, said he has been awakened many a night to the sound of the 
mountain lions growling in the moonlight. He carries a pistol when he goes into 
the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Merigan, 45, who owns a cattle and horse ranch, puts it bluntly: "We have 
a saying in Descanso: 'When you enter the park, you enter the food chain, and 
you better know the risks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in a small valley of trees and rolling hills in the Cuyamaca 
Mountains, Descanso is the closest human encampment to the sprawling 
26,000-acre park and serves as its southern gateway. Only a surveyor could tell 
you where Descanso ends and the park begins. 
</P>
<P>
 With its smattering of stores and its single intersection, Descanso is less a 
town than a way of life: rustic, unhurried, unburdened by graffiti and noise, 
with plenty of open space to ride horses and breathe the mountain air at an 
elevation of 3,500 feet. The biggest business is the hay and feed store. 
</P>
<P>
 To its residents -- ranchers, blue-collar families, retirees, aging hippies, 
and high-income professionals willing to make the 80-mile round-trip daily on 
Interstate 8 to San Diego -- Descanso is nothing short of bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this Brigadoonish place -- where a three-bedroom, 1,200-square-foot home 
on a third of an acre costs around $175,000 -- has come the mountain lion. It 
is a menace that can grow to 8 feet in length from nose to tail and to a weight 
of 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any civilization, killers aren't allowed to run loose," said Earl Hammond, 
57, who, with his wife, Liz, runs Holidays on Horseback, taking tourists on 
rides from their Descanso home along the high-ridge trails of the park. "That's 
what we have now: killer-animals running loose." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other cougar sightings and cougar attacks in California as the 
animal's population has soared. A couple in Mendocino County were attacked, a 
boy was attacked in Santa Barbara County, and a woman was killed north of 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 But in terms of numbers, the Cuyamaca cougars have been the most aggressive 
and unpredictable, for reasons no one can explain. Since mid-1993, six cougars 
have been killed, with official authorization, in or near the park after being 
deemed dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The mauling death of Iris Kenna earlier this month prompted the state 
Department of Fish and Game to term the Cuyamaca area the state's "hot spot" 
for cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Abbamonte, 40, owner of the Descanso Junction Restaurant on California 
79, has seen business drop by half in the last week. He thinks things will only 
get worse for him and the other businesses in Descanso -- the three general 
stores, two video outlets, and the delicatessen -- if the hikers, campers and 
picnickers stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 He has turned to a radio talk-show host in San Diego for help. If that fails, 
he's pondering a lawsuit against the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned for the safety of my family and my neighbors and I'm also 
looking out for my livelihood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the deadly attack on Kenna, a 58-year-old high school counselor, has 
filled San Diego television stations. But residents of Descanso (which in 
Spanish translates roughly to "place of rest") have probably not seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 Television is available only by satellite, and the small satellite dishes 
rented by a San Diego cable company provide only stations from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Descanso residents are used to surviving without many conveniences. There are 
no sewers; septic tanks are the rule. There is electricity, but no gas; propane 
tanks nuzzle beside most houses. There are no sidewalks, street-lights or stop 
signs. Water is from wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the businesses of Abbamonte and Elliott, most of populated Descanso 
is set several miles west of California 79 and does not hear or see the 
year-round stream of cars to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last example of Main Street America, a real community, centered 
around church and school," said Abbamonte, a former New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the Descanso library, built in 1914, was listed in the 
Guinness Book of Records as the smallest in America at 198 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a movement to build a bigger library. A fund-raiser was held at the 
Merigan barn that featured a showing of "The Man Trailer," a 1934 cowboy movie 
starring Buck Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years the biggest local controversy was the fact the Descanso 
Hotel had been turned into a drug rehabilitation center. The center flopped, 
however, and the talk around Perkins Store (established 1875) is that the 
boarded-up hotel may become a bed-and-breakfast for flatlanders looking for a 
romantic weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel was built in 1895 to accommodate stagecoach passengers who wanted to 
rest before continuing their journey. Local legend says Descanso cowboys used 
to ride their horses into the hotel bar and loudly demand shots of whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the Christmas season is the potluck dinner at the Community 
Hall, complete with a reading of "Twas The Night Before Christmas" and the 
arrival of Santa Claus. Residents are hoping temperatures drop enough for the 
annual dusting of winter snow. 
</P>
<P>
 What do people like about living in Descanso? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything," said Ruth D'Spain, 66, a member of a local planning board that 
has successfully fought to keep the town from being carved up into ranchettes 
and second homes. In the summer, when water is scarce, mountain lions venture 
out at dusk to drink from the horse troughs at the home of D'Spain's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're delightful to watch," D'Spain said. "But you learn not to go out and 
run around and call attention to yourself when the lions are around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just what can be done about the cougars, and the worries of Descanso, is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 A ballot measure passed by voters statewide not only outlaws the hunting of 
mountain lions, but prohibits Fish and Game from relocating them, thinning down 
their numbers or otherwise managing them. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tim Leslie (R-Roseville) has introduced a bill aimed at loosening 
the reins on Fish and Game. The bill would put a measure on the 1996 ballot. 
The Mountain Lion Foundation is opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mountain lion has more protection than any animal, endangered or 
threatened, in California," grumbled a Leslie aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranchers around Descanso, it is said, have been known -- despite the threat of 
a stiff fine -- to not wait to get state permission before killing cougars that 
are menacing livestock. "It's not hard to bury a dead cougar," said one 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how many mountain lions live in the park and its 
environs. For that and other reasons, Descanso residents are being careful. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott is carrying his .38 (and selling beware-of-the-cougar T-shirts). Liz 
Hammond, who says her riding groups have encountered mountain lions on 18 
occasions, no longer rides alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mountain lion was here before people came to Descanso and he'll be here 
after we leave," said Bert Finan, 34, a house painter. "We're living in the 
mountain lion's home," said his cousin Tom Finan, 39, also a house painter. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the mauling of Iris Kenna, an anonymous full-page letter was 
posted on the bulletin board outside Perkins Store, beside notes hawking 
potbellied pigs, car parts, horseshoeing services and fence repair expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter began by noting that Kenna, an avid bird-watcher and hiker, 
apparently tried to run away from the cougar, which is at the top of the list 
of things you are not supposed to do: 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent tragedy in the State Park is a perfect example of what happens 
when you break the laws of nature . . . . These laws of nature are not unlike 
the rules of the street in any big city. There are certain things that are just 
not done."

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS FIND GAINS COME AT A COST; CAPITOL HILL: COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMANSHIPS HELD BY CALIFORNIANS DROP FROM FIVE TO ONE, WEAKENING CLOUT. SOME 
GOP LEADERS SAY THE STATE WILL BE BETTER SERVED NONETHELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the smoke clears from the Nov. 8 electoral cataclysm on Capitol Hill, 
victorious California Republican members of Congress are looking forward to a 
new era of majority party clout for the country's largest congressional 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 From a spate of subcommittee chairmanships to two key roles in Speaker-to-be 
Newt Gingrich's inner circle, California Republicans hope to forge a more 
effective relationship between the country's most populous state and the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid their celebration, they have also had to accept the cold, hard facts 
that the abrupt deposing of the state's venerable Democratic House chieftains 
-- and a cadre of junior lieutenants -- has caused the 54-member congressional 
delegation to lose power and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats hold a 27-25 seat edge in the state delegation to the House, 
after losing three seats in the November election. But Republicans nationwide 
gained overall control 230-204 (with one Independent). 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP takeover dismantles an extensive Democratic empire that included five 
committee chairmen and more than a dozen subcommittee chairmanships. Now the 
California delegation has only one chairmanship -- of the internally focused 
House Oversight Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The reelection of Dianne Feinstein reunites her with Barbara Boxer and keeps 
two California Democrats in the U.S. Senate. Both have influence with the White 
House, but presumably will have less influence in the now Republican majority 
Senate. Feinstein, the most junior Democrat on the powerful Appropriations 
Committee, almost certainly will lose her coveted position as the number of 
minority seats on the panel is trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer size of the California delegation -- nearly 12% of the House -- 
ensures that it will remain a potent voice in Congress. But the eviction of so 
many key Democrats, after so many years, is eye-opening to some veteran 
Congress-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question, there's a loss of power," said Norman J. Ornstein, resident 
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. "The 
California delegation has some of the most significant chairmen . . . and 
strategists in Congress. They are major figures and had a core of junior 
(Democratic members) who had great potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you looked at the list of (the delegation's) Republicans, there was no 
comparison. Unlike some other states, (California) doesn't go down the toilet 
because of the change in party dominance, but, let's face it, it's a loss of 
clout." 
</P>
<P>
 While multiple committee chairmanships are no absolute guarantee of clout, the 
net loss of four is notable. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how you cut it, when we lose top-level authority in policy-making 
like this, we take a step backward," said Rep. Jerry Lewis of Redlands, a 
Republican reelected to his eighth term in November. "Our chairmanships have 
shrunk and that impacts our clout." 
</P>
<P>
 In other ways, the shift in majority party has caused less dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The House subcommittee structure is still being organized, but Republicans 
will be in line for about the same number (13) of subcommittee chairmanships as 
the Democrats had. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, in the important party hierarchies, Democrats and Republicans kept 
one party leadership post each. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on those developments, other Republicans offer a more optimistic 
forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense that losing five committee chairmen is going to hurt California is 
a real stretch," said Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), a diligent party insider 
who's become a top Gingrich confidant. "People have judged (delegation) success 
in the past on bringing programs and grants back to the state. We'll certainly 
continue to help bring grants and contracts to California. But I don't think 
Californians are solely concerned about the amount of pork and bacon that's 
brought home." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier said that Republicans will focus on eliminating unfunded federal 
mandates -- laws that cost the states millions of dollars to implement -- and 
giving states more discretion over how they spend federal money. The 
reorganization of the House committee structure -- orchestrated primarily by 
Dreier -- will help by "improving the deliberative process and increasing 
(congressional) accountability," Dreier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line," Dreier said, "is that the clout of the delegation is 
enhanced, not diluted." 
</P>
<P>
 California Republicans cannot match their Democratic colleagues chairman for 
chairman, but they can point to important leverage with Gingrich, who scholars 
predict will become one of the most powerful House speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) was recently elected chairman of the 
Republican Policy Committee, the fifth rung on the House GOP leadership ladder, 
giving him an ex-officio seat on the party's new Steering Committee. That new 
panel, headed by Gingrich, doles out committee assignments and will meet 
frequently to map out the party's legislative agenda and floor schedule, giving 
Cox an opportunity to promote California issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steering Committee replaces the old Committee on Committees, which 
essentially gave states a vote in proportion to their size. But here too, 
California clout seems diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 The new committee structure vests more power in Gingrich and other top party 
leaders, but takes it away from big states like California, which had 22 votes 
under the old plan. Now the state votes are spread among nine regions 
(California being one unto itself). 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier was named the California representative, giving the state two votes out 
of 31 total. 
</P>
<P>
 (Under the complicated system, Georgia and Texas are the big winners in voting 
strength.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Having two seats on the Steering Committee is very important," said Cox. "And 
Dreier and I have good relations with the Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 The only California committee chairman will be Rep. Bill Thomas 
(R-Bakersfield) of House Oversight, an internal panel that does not control any 
of the big programs important to the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), who was in line for two full 
committee chairmanships (Energy and Commerce, and Judiciary) was passed over 
for both in favor of younger, aggressive members more in sync with Gingrich. 
(In an effort to soften the blow, Moorhead was granted a waiver, allowing him 
to retain his seats on both "exclusive" committees; he also chairs a Judiciary 
subcommittee.) 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuff to Moorhead was not totally unexpected, but it spurred delegation 
members to complain to Gingrich that their clout was ebbing. He quickly 
responded by forming a California Task Force composed of Dreier, Cox and Lewis 
to advise the leadership on key issues. The group will also focus on 
maintaining close ties with Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreier, who got high marks for his work on committee restructuring, also won 
praise for success in placing his GOP colleagues -- freshmen and veterans -- on 
the more powerful House committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one simply counts noses, California is in very good shape," said Cox. 
"We're well-represented in the leadership, on the steering committee . . . on 
the committees themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic members and staffers have a less rosy view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it depends on which agenda you think is better for California. If 
you agree with the Democrats' and the President's agenda, this is a negative 
change," said Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), one of the party's top 
strategists -- and a soon-to-be former subcommittee chairman himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman and other Democrats mourn the defrocking of the five California 
committee chairmen (Reps. Ron Dellums, Armed Services; George Miller, Natural 
Resources; Norman Y. Mineta, Public Works and Transportation; George E. Brown 
Jr., Science, Space and Technology; and Pete Stark, District of Columbia, 
abolished by the new Republican majority) along with a host of influential 
subcommittee chairmen, notably Henry Waxman of Los Angeles, who as head of the 
Energy and Commerce health and environment subcommittee humbled tobacco 
industry CEOs and enacted sweeping clean-air legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose some good people, but the news is not all bad. We get Carlos 
(Moorhead) as chairman of the courts and intellectual property subcommittee," 
said Berman. The panel oversees issues relating to high-tech industries and the 
entertainment industry, and Moorhead is expected to be sympathetic to both. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more-conservative Republican philosophy now in full throat on Capitol 
Hill has Berman worried. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of private/public partnerships, formed to help defense industries 
make the transition to commercial applications, may be at risk, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could run into some intellectual purist on the right side who doesn't 
recognize that the government should assist these industries. That could cause 
concern," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman also said that Republican control of Congress could possibly affect 
appropriations for some ongoing California projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like Metro Rail funding might be affected," said Berman. "But most of 
these potential problems will be marginal and incremental and not diminish the 
fundamental quality of life in California." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Republicans' projected savings for California as the result of a 
leaner federal government, Berman said that "the budget people in Sacramento 
may see a net gain" but feared that such cutbacks might lead to a diluting of 
safety standards and consumer-protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, say the conquering Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to bring in a new way of doing business," said Dreier. "We will 
do everything we can to bring about tax reduction and reduce the size of the 
federal government. The solution is not, for instance, bringing back defense 
spending as it was in 1985, but to find other solutions." More on Election '94

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Taking Control 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, clout is an amalgam of seniority, cronyism, luck and force of 
personality, but it boils down to raw political superiority. With Republicans 
in control of both houses of Congress, members and outside observers are busy 
handicapping how the changes wrought in November will affect California, whose 
54-member delegation is the largest in the country's history. 
</P>
<P>
 LEADERSHIP POSTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrats Now: Rep. Vic Fazio of West Sacramento is vice chairman of the 
House Democratic Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republicans Now: Rep. Duncan Hunter of El Cajon is chairman of the 
Republican Research Committee, a second-tier post that doles out task force 
chairmanships on various issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrats in January: Fazio moves up to chairman of the Democratic Caucus, 
the No. 3 spot in the minority party. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republicans in January: Newport Beach Rep. Christopher Cox becomes chairman 
of the Republican Policy Committee, the fifth-ranking GOP leadership position. 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Parties retain their balance of one leadership position each, 
after Hunter loses his bid for fourth-ranking post of chairman of Republican 
Conference. GOP's fervor to reinvent the House and enact its "Contract with 
America" lends cachet to Cox's leadership position, particularly in light of 
the old Democratic leadership's widely perceived failure to wield power 
effectively. Cox and Rep. David Dreier of San Dimas also were appointed to the 
influential Steering Committee and have Newt Gingrich's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMITTEES 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrats Now: After years of accumulated seniority, California boasts five 
chairmen of full committees: Ron Dellums (Oakland) of Armed Services; George 
Brown (San Bernardino) of Science, Space and Technology;, Norman Mineta (San 
Jose) of Public Works and Transportation; George Miller (Martinez) of Natural 
Resources, and Pete Stark (Hayward) of District of Columbia. California also 
has 13 subcommittee chairmen, most notably Henry Waxman (Los Angeles), Energy 
and Commerce health and environment subcommittee, and Stark, Ways and Means 
health subcommittee. Two others, Fazio and Dixon, are "cardinals," heading up 
Appropriations subcommittees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republicans Now: Hold 12 "ranking minority member" posts on wide range of 
committees, providing ample firepower to shepherd or attack Democratic 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Democrats in January: Loss of all full chairmanships and all subcommittee 
chairmanships. Democrats will scramble for ranking-minority slots under GOP 
committee system overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 * Republicans in January: California emerges with only one full committee 
chairman, Bill Thomas (Bakersfield), who will head the renamed House Oversight 
Committee (formerly the House Administration Committee). Ron Packard 
(Oceanside) and Jerry Lewis (Redlands) will become Appropriations "cardinals," 
overseeing legislative and VA, HUD and independent agencies' subcommittees, 
respectively. Other subcommittee chairmanships are possible and the total 
probably will come close to Democratic numbers: Hunter will be first in line 
for a National Security (formerly Armed Services) subcommittee. Robert K. 
Dornan (Garden Grove) is expected to head up another National Security 
subcommittee. Carlos Moorhead (Glendale), who was passed over for two full 
chairmanships, will chair the Judiciary intellectual property subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis: Vast Democrat power structure crumbles and in its stead, the 
state's Republican members hope to deliver the legislative goods with a more 
modest array of powerbrokers. Thomas' House Oversight Committee is focused on 
internal House matters and not on issues of importance to California. Gingrich 
has centralized more power in Speaker's office at the expense of committee 
chairmen. State retains two Appropriations "cardinals," but Packard will focus 
on downsizing congressional bureaucracy. Lewis chairs subcommittee with 
jurisdiction over a range of programs that account for the largest share of 
Congress' discretionary spending.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: A SURVIVOR'S PRIDE AND PERSEVERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What people have to remember about Willie," an admirer and ally once told me, 
"is that when he was a boy in Texas, he worked in a barbershop cleaning up. And 
the white men would tip him with quarters. They'd drop the quarters in the 
spittoons and he'd have to dig in after them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to terms with his pride and dignity because he needed the quarters. 
He learned early to mix with the grime to get what he needed. He's a survivor." 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Lewis Brown Jr. caught the first bus out of town for San Francisco the 
day after he graduated from Mineola Colored High School in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got a basement apartment that was cold," continued the ally, Assemblywoman 
Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles). "He could get by without a 
refrigerator because he could put his milk and eggs on the windowsill. He 
learned to cope." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown eventually graduated from Hastings Law School. But the legal 
establishment of 1950s San Francisco wasn't opening any doors to black kids 
from rural Texas. So he made a living defending pimps, prostitutes and drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also did legal work for a church that was a center of civil rights 
activism. And there he launched his political career, beating a white 
assemblyman in a Democratic primary -- an assemblyman backed by then-Speaker 
Jesse (Big Daddy) Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's first act in Sacramento was to refuse to vote for Unruh's reelection 
as Speaker. That landed him in Unruh's doghouse for a couple of years, but they 
ultimately became soul mates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jess Unruh taught me one thing," says Brown, now 60. "Remember -- today's 
enemy may be tomorrow's friend." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lesson pertinent to the current speakership fight, Brown says, because 
Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga never learned it. If 
he had, maverick Assemblyman Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar might not have bolted 
the GOP, become an independent and voted for Brown over Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher got in Brulte's doghouse two years ago when he defied the GOP caucus 
and accepted Brown's offer of a coveted committee vice chairmanship. After 
that, Republicans treated Horcher like a stray mutt. Brulte will argue he 
actually protected Horcher from worse wrath, but Horcher says thanks for 
nothing. So there's a 40-40 deadlock for Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 And Brown again is trying to cope and survive. 
</P>
<P>
 He is attempting to entice Republicans with a smorgasbord of power-sharing 
options, conceding the need for more cooperation and bipartisanship in a 
closely divided house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like a moving target," Brulte asserts. "One day he says one thing; the 
next day another." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte has a point. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, Brown told the San Jose Mercury News: "I don't anticipate holding 
on (as) Speaker through even 1995." In fact, he envisioned "prior to the spring 
of '95 (becoming) Speaker emeritus." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 12, Brown told me "the best way to do it would be to have Democratic 
control for '95. A Democratic Speaker and a Republican (No. 2) Speaker pro tem. 
Half the (committee) chairs Democrats, half Republicans. The vice chairs would 
be chairs in waiting. On Jan. 1, 1996, it all switches. Goes just the reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, he told the San Francisco Chronicle that if he'd been 
reelected Speaker, he would have announced his resignation effective March 20, 
his birthday. And the next day, he told Times editors that in negotiations with 
Brulte he'd promised to step down in July. Brulte disputes that, saying the 
surrender offer was for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Brown is flexible -- as long as he still is called "Speaker" for 
awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte and the Republicans are having none of it. They don't trust Brown and 
believe the voters don't either. They think the public is less interested in 
seeing the Assembly organized than Brown bounced as its leader. 
</P>
<P>
 And they're hoping moderate Democrats hear that message from constituents over 
the holidays, then return on Jan. 4 and refuse to take any more heat for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte's offer has never varied: Republican officers and narrow GOP control of 
all 25 committees, with a handful of friendly Democratic chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of who's charming," Brulte says of the fight. "It's a 
question of who's in touch with the voters. That's why Republicans will win." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown already has been Speaker 14 years, twice as long as anybody -- twice as 
long as Unruh. He has been a particularly effective leader the last two years. 
Nobody questions his ability to cope and survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In this battle, he may be judged less on whether he can cling to power than on 
how he handles himself in giving it up. This time, it's the dignity that will 
be most important.

FOURTH PATIENT OF FLORIDA DENTIST WITH HIV DIES OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A retired schoolteacher who medical experts say was infected with the AIDS 
virus by her dentist has died of the disease, a hospice reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Webb, 68, slipped into a semi-coma last week, according to the Hospice 
of Martin.She died Saturday, her 45th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was never bitter about her death," said hospice counselor Pam Jett. "She 
didn't dwell on the future, she lived in the present." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb became the fourth patient of Dr. David Acer, a Florida dentist who died 
of AIDS complications in 1990, to succumb to the disease. The first, Kimberly 
Bergalis, who died in 1991 at the age of 23, became an outspoken advocate of 
AIDS testing for medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a federal study concluded that six of Acer's patients 
contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, from him. 
Scientists are baffled as to precisely how Acer transmitted the virus. Acer, of 
Jensen Beach, Fla., is the only health professional ever known to have 
transmitted HIV to his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, a former high school English teacher and grandmother of eight, joined 
Bergalis in publicly calling for testing of health care workers. She gave 
dozens of speeches nationwide about living with AIDS. She was the teacher of 
the year in 1986-87 at Martin County High School. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her husband, Robert, and three grown children. Her family 
has asked that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the hospice or to other 
organizations that care for AIDS patients.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: NEW POPULISTS MAKING GOVERNMENT PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1; 
MOVEMENT ECHOES ITS PREDECESSOR'S FEAR OF LOST CONTROL. BUT IN THESE '90S, 
PRIVATE POWER IS SEEN AS CURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To a striking degree, the Republicans now storming into Washington take their 
inspiration from the political movements that flowered in the last decade of 
the last century. Earlier this month, likely presidential candidate Lamar 
Alexander hosted a conference that likened today's Republican reformers to the 
turn-of-the-century Progressives. Conservative strategist Paul M. Weyrich 
presents the militant movements for term limits and property rights as the 
successors to William Jennings Bryan and the angry Populists who swept across 
the South and Midwest in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
 This new populist movement turns on its head the ideology of its predecessor. 
The original Populists and Progressives sought a stronger government to control 
the excesses of the private sector. They rose on the fear that Americans were 
losing control of their destiny to ominous and unaccountable forces -- the 
giant new corporations remaking the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The new populist movement shares the fear of lost control -- but fingers 
Washington as the culprit. It posits that the best way of solving the nation's 
problems is scaling back the national government. Under that billowing banner, 
the Republicans are advancing at least three distinct arguments that too often 
get blurred into one. To debate government's role rationally, it's important 
that in the coming months each argument faces scrutiny on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Argument No. 1 has the broadest support: that government spends too much and 
performs its functions too inefficiently. In this arena, the Republican 
ascendance will make possible reforms that were unimaginable under the 
Democratic Congress -- while putting off the table any major new government 
initiatives. That was apparent in President Clinton's Oval Office speech last 
week -- not only in what he proposed (tax cuts, spending cuts, market-oriented 
reform of job training), but what he didn't (universal health care was 
conspicuously absent from his "middle-class bill of rights"). 
</P>
<P>
 There's a risk in this, of course: that the Republican Congress will go too 
far in slashing programs, and both parties will endanger the hard-won progress 
on reducing the federal budget deficit with a tax-cut bidding war. But that 
risk has to be balanced against the demonstrated record of the Democratic 
Congress in resisting the government's long-overdue re-engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the coming streamlining will be fairness -- ensuring that 
Republican constituencies bear as much of the burden as the poor. That will be 
measured mostly by the GOP's willingness to tackle corporate subsidies and 
middle-class entitlements -- targets for which they've so far displayed little 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 The second strand in the Republican argument is the belief that responsibility 
for solving problems should be devolved as much as possible -- from Washington 
to state and local governments, and from there to nonprofit groups, families 
and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In its purest form, the argument contends that government's growth through 
this century has preempted what British statesman Edmund Burke called the 
little platoons -- local religious and charitable groups -- that cared for the 
poor and the sick. With government providing the services that churches and 
charities once performed, many conservatives argue, the informal networks of 
moral suasion that once bolstered neighborhood standards have disastrously 
atrophied. In a kind of supply-side version of social policy, GOP theorists 
such as William Kristol argue that one reason for government to do less "is to 
allow for the strengthening of other institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 There's much worth debating in all of this. As a general rule, shifting 
solutions toward local governments is attractive, and Clinton may be able to 
reach agreement with the Republican Congress on consolidating dozens of 
categorical federal programs that needlessly limit local flexibility. But on 
issues from the environment to welfare, national standards play an important 
role. Without them, states would face enormous pressure for a race to the 
bottom -- slashing social benefits in the hope of driving the poor somewhere 
else, or rolling back environmental rules to attract corporate investment. In 
many cases, national rules save governors from their own worst instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 The broader argument that government overreaching is undermining private 
activities seems overstated when social need greatly exceeds the combined 
capacity of public and private efforts. But the Republican rise will move to 
the forefront intriguing ideas for how public policy can strengthen those 
private efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has praised Wall Street Journal 
editorial writer John Fund's idea to cap direct government social welfare 
spending and use the savings for tax credits that would encourage direct 
donations to charities helping the poor. Likewise, Michael S. Joyce of the 
Bradley Foundation recently proposed converting direct federal cash assistance 
to the poor into vouchers that they could use to purchase services from "local 
education and social service institutions." Experiments in that direction 
(which Clinton himself mused about while touring Los Angeles after the riots in 
1992) might prove popular: One election night survey found that Americans, by a 
2-1 margin, considered the Salvation Army more effective than government at 
providing services to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The most incongruous element in the new Republican populism is its most direct 
assault on its predecessor: the attempt to retrench government oversight of 
business. It's a somewhat unusual populist crusade in that it excites mostly 
business lobbyists -- like the dozens of trade association representatives who 
crowded into a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room last week under 
the direction of newly elected House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas. There, 
in the cavernous chamber where Democratic Reps. John D. Dingell of Michigan and 
Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles used to terrorize defense contractors and 
tobacco lawyers, representatives from the American Trucking Assn., the Business 
Roundtable and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gathered to plot their 
counterrevolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Their guillotine is the plan in the House Republican "contract with America" 
to reform government regulation: On the argument that regulation is stifling 
innovation and growth, it offers an even sharper blade than Ronald Reagan 
brandished at the federal agencies that regulate everything from the 
environment to the purity of food and drugs. Among other things, the contract 
would establish a "cap" on the regulatory costs agencies could impose on 
business and require the government to reimburse any property owner for 
regulations that produce "any reduction in the value of property" -- a sweeping 
and unprecedented mandate that could, for instance, require government to 
compensate mine owners forced to conform with strip-mining laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Government is so unpopular that any activity it undertakes is suspect, and 
regulation is no exception. In a Times Mirror survey this summer, just 41% of 
Americans said government regulation of business is necessary to protect the 
public interest; 54% said it "usually does more harm than good." But the same 
poll found that three-fourths of Americans felt "too much power is concentrated 
in the hands of a few large companies." 
</P>
<P>
 No one defends "overzealous regulators," but the real issue is who draws the 
line between red tape and life-saving protections. Individuals still lack the 
technical capacity and economic leverage to determine for themselves whether 
planes are safe to fly, pesticides safe to ingest, cars constructed to 
withstand a crash; they can only make those determinations acting collectively 
through government. Rolling back health and safety regulations is less about 
reforming government than about strengthening business. In a fundamental sense, 
it is elitist because it would diminish, not increase, the control individuals 
can exert over their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 All over the country this fall, Republicans campaigned in flannel shirts and 
pickup trucks as populists determined to take back the country from the 
Washington elite. At his news conference last week, DeLay was surrounded by an 
overflow throng of tassel-loafered lobbyists who spilled out into the hallway 
and whooped at the denunciations of "blitzing bureaucrats" and "Gestapo 
(regulatory) tactics." There wasn't a flannel shirt in the bunch.

DEBTS, DISARRAY HURT ANC'S RULE IN S. AFRICA, AIDE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing debts and organizational disarray have damaged the African National 
Congress' ability to govern South Africa, its secretary general said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC is too dependent on the personal power of President Nelson Mandela, 
who remains by far the country's most popular leader, Cyril Ramaphosa said in a 
report to the ANC's first national conference since taking power. 
</P>
<P>
 Although speaking with surprising candor about organizational difficulties, 
Ramaphosa was far from pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very happy conference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls show Mandela's support has increased since he was inaugurated in 
May as South Africa's first black president. But the ANC has struggled since 
winning more than 62% of the vote in the first all-race elections in April, 
Ramaphosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The almost 3,000 delegates applauded Ramaphosa's stinging description of the 
ANC as a debt-ridden organization that needs to improve discipline, financial 
controls and accountability, and to rebuild dying local branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only through being critical . . . will we be able to ensure that we become an 
even stronger . . . organization," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC has to delegate more responsibility outside the circle of Mandela and 
his advisers, and build up lower layers of leaders, Ramaphosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 He rejected talk of grass-roots unhappiness with the ANC and government, 
saying people supported its attempt to promote reconciliation between blacks 
and whites after apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was expected to air complaints that Mandela's government has 
failed to meet the needs of the impoverished black majority, but journalists at 
the meeting detected few signs of real dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been oppressed for 80 years and we've been in government for less than 
one year," said Churchman Adams, a delegate from Port Elizabeth. "I won't say 
even a word of complaint. . . . People still have confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela defended the government in his opening address Saturday but 
acknowledged some mistakes and pledged tangible benefits for blacks next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramaphosa, a former union leader who led ANC negotiators in years of talks 
with former white leaders on ending apartheid, said the ANC had failed to 
properly prepare as an organization for the shift from opposition movement to 
governing party. 
</P>
<P>
 Little fiscal discipline exists, with Mandela the party's only reliable 
money-raising tool, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, the black nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress reelected Clarence 
Makwetu as its leader despite its poor showing in the April vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAC, which calls for taking land from whites, is virtually powerless in 
the new government but represents a militant ideology attractive to young 
blacks and could benefit if the ANC fails to deliver on its promises.

RUSSIAN TROOPS REPORTEDLY SLAY FLEEING CHECHENS 
</P>

<P>
 Russia warned them to leave Grozny before fighting became too fierce, but for 
one group of civilians the terror came on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Drunken Russian soldiers in armored personnel carriers cut them off, opened 
fire and crushed their cars, then hunted down the wounded as they tried to 
flee, witnesses and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine people were believed killed, but there were no bodies left at the scene 
to verify that. The refugees were heading for the neighboring republic of 
Ingushetia. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of Saturday's carnage in this village about 30 miles west of the 
Chechen capital, Grozny, testified to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood-covered footprints led from three crushed cars to bushes along the road, 
and the ground was littered with spent cartridges from a machine gun. Women's 
clothes lay nearby. A half-eaten loaf of bread lay on the rear window of one 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 One investigator said a child's footprints appeared to be next to a woman's. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the traces, they chased and killed the wounded, then dragged 
them away," said an Ingush investigator at the scene, who did not give his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings underscored the breakdown in discipline in the Russian military. 
Some Russian soldiers have said they will defy orders to advance on Chechnya, 
where Moscow is trying to crush an independence movement and reassert 
authority. Morale in the armed forces is low, and the defense minister, Pavel 
S. Grachev, is unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commanders had orders to let the refugees pass, but these cars were fired 
upon and squashed," said Khamzat Bekov, emergency situations minister in 
Ingushetia. "Then they tried to conceal all the traces. We cannot find the 
bodies, the wounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials blamed Interior Ministry troops who patrol roads and guard the rear 
flank of the army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I travel around, and all I see is drunken soldiers and drunken officers 
manning the posts," said Lt. Gen. Valery Vostrotin, Russia's deputy emergency 
situations minister. "They have no discipline and they go unpunished."

GAO SAYS JOBS PLAN NOT WORKING; WELFARE: REPORT FINDS '88 REFORM LAW FAILS TO 
FOCUS ON EMPLOYMENT. POLL REVEALS PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR CHANGE BUT NOT THE GOP'S 
KEY INITIATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1988 law designed to transform the nation's welfare system from a permanent 
support system into a temporary safety net has fallen far short of its goal of 
helping recipients find jobs, the General Accounting Office reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate study, a conservative polling organization said the public 
overwhelmingly supports the concept of welfare reform, but strongly resists 
many of the key elements of the welfare initiative contained in the House GOP's 
"contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report, commissioned by the New York senator who drafted the 1988 law, 
was released just as Congress is preparing to overhaul the welfare system once 
again. It could influence the direction of the debate by identifying unintended 
flaws in the previous reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Authored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the Family Support Act 
restructured the government's principal form of welfare assistance, Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children. It created a new program, called JOBS, to 
help recipients get the training, counseling and job-placement services needed 
to leave the welfare rolls. The program was targeted at those recipients 
considered most at risk of long-term dependency on government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although annual spending on the JOBS program had grown to $1.1 billion by 
1993, its efforts "are generally not well-focused on recipients' employment as 
the ultimate goal," said the GAO, which conducts audits and investigations at 
the request of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's lack of success reflects two key weaknesses, the report said. 
First, administrators are only held accountable for the level of participation 
by welfare recipients, and not for their ability to successfully place 
recipients in jobs. In addition, most JOBS officials have done little to forge 
strong links with private-sector employers who potentially could hire welfare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 While some localities developed programs that helped recipients prepare for 
and find employment, after three years no JOBS program was able to move a 
majority of participants off welfare and into jobs, the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation has been disappointing, with roughly 11% of the 4 million 
parents receiving AFDC taking part in JOBS between 1991 and 1993, the agency 
said. Only 24% of teen-age mothers receiving AFDC participated in JOBS, even 
though they are especially prone to long-term dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the program, 
said in a prepared response that the GAO's conclusions are overly harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the report shows is what we already knew," said HHS spokeswoman Melissa 
Skofield. "When the Family Support Act was passed, it set up a goal to move 
people from welfare to work. In reality, it did not change the program as much 
as Congress intended." 
</P>
<P>
 HHS officials believe that too many AFDC recipients were exempted from 
participation in the JOBS program, which "diluted the message" that welfare is 
intended to be a temporary program, Skofield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of what we've been recommending is a much narrower range of exemptions, 
which sends a much clearer message to recipients -- and to case workers -- that 
what the welfare system is about is moving people to work as quickly as 
possible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a separate survey conducted by the Republican polling firm Public 
Opinion Strategies suggested that most middle-class voters support efforts to 
reform the existing welfare system. Commissioned by Citizens for a Sound 
Economy, a conservative think tank, the poll solicited opinions from voters 
with annual incomes from $20,000 to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three-fourths of those polled agreed "that the current welfare 
system is a failure because it encourages long-term dependency on the 
government and does little to promote self-sufficiency." Only 6% said the 
welfare system should be maintained without significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little in the survey to suggest that Americans want to totally 
junk the existing system. While just 2% of those polled endorsed spending more 
on welfare, only 36% want to spend less. The remaining 59% said they would keep 
expenditures at the current level but allocate the money in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll participants resisted some of the hardest-edged measures in the 
Republicans' reform proposal, specifically those aimed at deterring 
out-of-wedlock births. Nearly three in five respondents opposed cutting off 
benefits for single women younger than 18 who bear children, and fully 77% 
opposed any effort to move children from welfare families into group homes or 
orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working and keeping families together (are what people want)," said 
Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who conducted the survey. "But not taking 
kids out of the home. That doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other recent polls, the survey found broader support for measures aimed 
at encouraging greater individual responsibility from welfare recipients. More 
than 90% agreed that welfare recipients should work while receiving benefits; 
62% said recipients should be required to work before they reach two years on 
the rolls. Four out of five said business should be given tax credits to 
encourage the hiring of welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 More moderate measures aimed at discouraging out-of-wedlock births also found 
wide support. By a 2-to-1 ratio, those polled supported a requirement that 
minors on welfare live with their families; nearly four in five said women 
should be required to identify the father of the child before receiving 
benefits, and only 15% said recipients should receive additional money to 
support children born while they are already on the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found widespread support for shifting responsibility for welfare 
away from Washington and toward local institutions. Some 82% of those surveyed 
said local and state governments should assume control of welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Those surveyed divided almost evenly on whether charities or the government 
should play the lead role in providing assistance to the poor. House 
Republicans are studying proposals that would cut direct government social 
spending and use the savings to fund tax credits aimed at encouraging donations 
to private charities serving the needy.

FAA COULD CLEAR ATR COMMUTERS FOR FULL SERVICE SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ATR turboprop commuter plane, grounded from cold-weather flights after a 
recent crash in Indiana, may soon be back in full service, the head of the 
Federal Aviation Administration said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA Administrator David Hinson said he was "reasonably optimistic" the plane's 
European manufacturer "will be able to get the airplane returned to service 
very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA barred the aircraft from flying in icy conditions on Dec. 9, after 
tests suggested the plane was unusually susceptible to loss of control when ice 
formed on the wings. Federal investigators suspect icing may have caused the 
Oct. 31 crash of an American Eagle ATR-72 in Indiana that killed all 68 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson, appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," said further 
tests were being conducted, and the French-made aircraft could be operating 
again soon. But he did not say whether the FAA might impose restrictions on use 
of the planes in cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine U.S. regional airlines have about 150 of the ATR-72 and the smaller 
ATR-42 turboprops. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson and Transportation Secretary Federico Pena both said Sunday that the 
FAA has stepped up its inspection of all of the nation's airlines. They also 
said they consider flying to be safe.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; HOLIDAY SPIRIT ELUDES BUSY OFFICIALS; BANKRUPTCY: 
WITH ITS ENDLESS MEETINGS AND LONG WORKDAYS, THE CRISIS COSTS THEM THEIR 
PERSONAL LIVES. THE TURMOIL AFFECTS THEIR FAMILIES TOO. 
</P>

<P>
 When he hauled out the ladder and decorated his Woodbridge home with colored 
lights a little early this season, Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
thought he was getting the jump on the Christmas chores. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, it was probably one of the few festive things he'll have a 
chance to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I've put things on hold from a personal standpoint," said Brady, 
who has been working 18-hour days since Orange County declared bankruptcy. 
"We've already canceled our vacation during the Christmas holidays because of 
all this. It puts a damper on some of the social things that I would normally 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Like scores of other public officials in the county -- from county 
administrators to city and school district managers -- Brady has lost any 
semblance of a personal life as he tries to keep up with the day-to-day 
developments of the biggest municipal bankruptcy in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider says he's just about living in 
his office these days. Hecklers shout at him at supervisors' meetings and 
reporters call him at home. And if it isn't bad enough that the thrill of the 
holiday season is dampened, Dec. 25 is his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carleen Wing Chandler says her job as assistant superintendent of the 
Capistrano Unified School District is usually busy but routine. Lately, said 
Chandler, "my life has been taken over by meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 For Brady, the county bankruptcy filing is akin to a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 37 years in the business," he said, "this is the most difficult 
crisis-oriented event I've ever been involved with, and there have been many. 
Fires, earthquakes, nothing compares to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady says the city of Irvine has $209 million in the Orange County investment 
pool, with $27 million of it coming from retirement pension funds. Since the 
financial fiasco began, the city manager says, he has been arriving to work at 
6:30 a.m., spending most of his time in meetings and returning home 12 or 13 
hours later to field telephone calls late into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, he and I go shopping for the little ones, our grandchildren, 
together," said Charlotte Brady. "And I'm sure he's very disappointed that he 
won't be able to do that. But this is serious, this is very serious, and it's 
his job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bradys are expecting their six grown children, five grandchildren and a 
dozen other relatives at their home on Christmas Eve. In preparation for a 
turkey and ham buffet, Charlotte Brady says she spends her days baking cookies 
and planning the meal, hoping all the while that her husband doesn't catch the 
laryngitis she's been fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing for me is that there's no way I can help him," she said. 
"He's not getting much sleep, and with something like this you don't eat right. 
I want him to stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, 53, who has been with the city of Irvine since its incorporation in 
1971, says he has addressed the more than 500 Irvine city employees in the last 
few days, trying to keep them up on the latest information. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, because it's nothing you can take charge of. It's out of 
our hands," he said. "I'm the kind of person who likes to take control, and you 
have no control over this." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider says he is trying desperately to take control of the "horrific 
nightmare" facing Orange County and his family this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Working on three to four hours of sleep, Schneider says, he spends his days in 
back-to-back meetings in attempts to "put my arms around the problem and deal 
with the situation," only to come home to face reporters in the front yard and 
the family phone ringing off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen my son in three weeks, unless he's asleep," he said with 
exasperation. "It's like I don't even know when I get home. I just grab a bite 
to eat and go to bed. I've really neglected my home, I've neglected my family. 
. . . This is a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's wife, Sally, says that any gifts she's bought for her husband and 
their 13-year-old son, Nicholas, were purchased before the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this is bad enough for everyone in Orange County," she said. "But I'm 
most unsettled because it's a problem that affects us personally. Seeing your 
name in the newspapers connected with this thing is really awful. . . . It's 
really taking its toll." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few signs of Christmas in their San Juan Capistrano home, she says, 
is an artificial tree that has yet to be decorated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been in the mood to decorate it, and haven't done any (Christmas) 
shopping since this whole thing started," she said. "What I have done is lost 
weight, but I wouldn't wish this kind of diet on anyone. . . . We've all been 
through the wringer." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider turns 48 on Dec. 25, a birthday he says will not be much worth 
celebrating this year. Not only is he trying to "pick up the pieces" of a 
county in shambles, but he has been held responsible for the crisis by those 
who say he failed to keep close enough tabs on recently resigned Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron and his investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst Christmas I've had since my father died, and that was 18 
years ago," Schneider said. "The joy and spirit have gone out of it this year. 
I haven't bought a single present -- not one -- and I probably won't. I haven't 
thought about Christmas at all, and it's my birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in good times, Schneider says, he works from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., but the 
bankruptcy crisis has pushed those hours around the clock. A fitness buff, he 
says he hasn't exercised and has lost about 10 pounds from the stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to keep it in perspective," he said. "There are a lot of people out 
there worse off than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler says she has done "absolutely nothing" to prepare for the holidays. 
With more than $74 million in the Orange County investment pool, the Capistrano 
school district's assistant superintendent in charge of business and fiscal 
services has had a lot on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I normally decorate my house and bring a few things into the office," 
Chandler said. "But what's normal with all this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in her office near a cluster of colored balloons, cards and a banner 
her staff draped in celebration of her 43rd birthday last week, Chandler tells 
of spending less time with her husband, Ray, and more time fielding phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The calls are everything from the parents of the children to (district) 
employees," she said. "I just tell the parents that we will try to keep the 
lives of our kids as normal as possible, and we're telling them that we are 
trying to protect all new revenue that's coming into the district. Education is 
our highest priority." 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District has 3,500 employees, making it the 
largest employer in south Orange County. Chandler says her office, which 
handles the budget and financial operations for the district, is in the process 
of completing cash flow documents for the district's 12 operating funds and 
looking at the next six months for possible revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 She has met with the County Department of Education and held several meetings 
"to calm our employees." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most distressing thing is that everything that I would normally be doing 
and should be doing gets lost in this," she said. "My mom is coming out next 
week, but I'm going to try to keep her out of it . . . maybe even get out of 
town for a few days."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BUSINESS LARGELY TAKES A HANDS-OFF APPROACH; 
FINANCE: CORPORATE OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS TOO LITTLE INFORMATION AND THE 
SITUATION IS TOO FLUID FOR THEM TO GET INVOLVED. BUT A FEW HAVE TAKEN STEPS 
BEHIND THE SCENES.

<P>
 As cities and schools have grappled with layoffs and service cuts in the wake 
of Orange County's bankruptcy, local business leaders have largely sat and 
watched from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 In interview after interview, officials of major corporations in the county 
made no apologies, instead saying that there is too little information 
available and that the situation is too fluid for them to get involved or make 
public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's simply too many unknowns at this point," said a spokeswoman for Les 
McCraw, chairman of Fluor Corp., the multibillion-dollar engineering services 
company in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say it is now -- in the middle of the largest municipal bankruptcy 
in U.S. history -- that the Orange County business community's ample business 
acumen and clout are vital and perhaps essential to a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that in New York and other cities that faced bankruptcy, top 
business executives moved swiftly and played a leading role in the cities' 
recovery -- themselves serving in government agencies or lending personnel to 
raise money and help administer municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "They responded immediately and quickly," recalled Felix Rohatyn, a senior 
partner at the investment firm Lazard Freres & Co. who played a key part in New 
York City's recovery after its financial collapse in the mid-1970s. While the 
roots of New York's fiscal crisis were different, Rohatyn added, the problems 
Orange County now confronts are essentially the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to allocate sacrifices, how do you deal with service cuts and how do you 
deal with revenue reductions?" are questions that businesses can help answer, 
Rohatyn said. "I think they can make a real contribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger W. Johnson, administrator of the federal General Services Administration 
and former chairman and chief executive of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine, 
agreed: "Business leaders have a major responsibility because they have 
enormous skills." And for those senior executives who haven't come forth in 
Orange County, he said in an interview Friday: "It's time to get your butts in 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, local business leaders say they want to help. Many of them have had 
private, informal talks with county officials, they say. And some accountants 
and bankers have offered free services to county officials, such as giving a 
second opinion on advice from outside consultants and providing instruction on 
complex subjects such as derivatives, which were blamed for much of the 
$2.02-billion loss suffered by the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 A few business leaders have taken steps behind the scenes. Henry Segerstrom, a 
major Costa Mesa landowner and the developer of the South Coast Plaza mall, 
contacted top Bank of America executives on Orange County's behalf, said County 
Supervisor William G. Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear what Segerstrom hoped to accomplish, although two days after he 
placed his call, a dozen Bank of America officials met with county officials to 
talk about a possible line of credit. Segerstrom declined to comment for this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people yet know what steps should be taken," said Buck Johns, a 
Newport Beach developer and a prominent Republican activist. "We've had a 
colossal train wreck the magnitude of which we're still not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the more than two weeks since the county's financial troubles became 
apparent, business leaders as a group have yet to meet formally with local 
government officials. And, though they are now starting to form a task force to 
focus on the fiscal problems, there has been no public word from the county's 
heavyweight corporate players. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the 
Industrial League of Orange County hope that senior executives from Taco Bell 
Corp., Rockwell International Corp., Fluor and the Irvine Co. will head a 
special task force to meet with county officials and, among other things, send 
a delegation to the East Coast to lobby Washington legislators and New York 
bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 But to date, each of the top executives from those firms, as well as some 
others, has refused to make a public commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't stepped up to the counter to help, have they," said Carl N. 
Karcher, chairman emeritus of CKE Enterprises, the company that operates Carl's 
Jr. restaurants. Karcher, who narrowly avoided bankruptcy himself last year, 
added that he would remain in the background. "I'm too busy myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald R. Beall and Donald Bren, the respective chairmen of Rockwell and the 
Irvine Co., said through representatives that, at this time, they could not 
offer any specific plan of action regarding the county's financial problems. 
"We're very confident that the county will weather this storm," said Bren's 
spokeswoman, Dawn McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, company officials admit that there is little to gain by getting 
involved in a financial crisis in which there is a lot of finger-pointing, 
federal investigations and public ire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses also say they are really stymied as to what they can do now. 
Orange County's debacle, they maintain, is less tangible than, say, the 
Northridge earthquake or the Laguna Beach fire last year, when there was an 
immediate outpouring of help from businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Nicholson, president of the Orange County Industrial League, remains 
confident that business leaders will spring into action soon with a long-term 
strategy. "Business has the expertise needed to respond, and once the facts are 
known, I think you'll see its willingness to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 But others aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem is that no one has emerged as a coalescing force in Orange County, 
as Gov. Hugh Carey did in New York's crisis, when he called senior executives 
from Macy's, Metropolitan Life and other companies, as well as union leaders, 
to join forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be the power people in Orange County doing it," said Dennis J. 
Aigner, dean of UC Irvine's Graduate School of Management. Without them, 
analysts said, it will be tougher to bring business, government and labor in 
Orange County together to work on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fogarty, head of the Orange County Central Labor Council, whose 
membership includes several thousand county workers, said he has been trying to 
get a meeting with the Board of Supervisors for the last two weeks. "They have 
ignored us," he said, adding that unions have had experience working with 
bankrupt cities and as such "have the resources to help the county out." 
However, the board has met with the Orange County Employees Assn., an 
independent organization that represents 11,000 county workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with experience say part of the business community's reluctance reflects 
a change in times. 
</P>
<P>
 During New York's crisis, for example, companies gave some senior executives 
leaves of absence or otherwise freed them up so they could volunteer full time 
as deputy mayor for finance and budget director, among other positions, Rohatyn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But consultant Jacob Ukeles, who helped New York City as well as Bridgeport, 
Conn., which filed for bankruptcy in the late 1980s, believes it will be harder 
for Orange County to enlist the assistance of major corporations, because big 
companies have laid off multiple layers of management in recent years. "That 
means you have to do more with (fewer people) after hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, said Don Murray, a partner at the Costa Mesa office of Deloitte & 
Touche: "Most private businesses are trying to survive." Though Murray says his 
accounting firm and others have privately offered their services to county 
government officials, he said of the business community's involvement: "No, I 
honestly don't think it's going to happen on a large scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Some business executives candidly say the county's financial woes are a 
failure of government, not theirs to get involved in. "This is the county's 
problem. They created it," snapped one top corporate executive, who spoke only 
on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified. But he also 
acknowledged that traditionally businesses in Orange County have not adequately 
participated in civic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rohatyn, there are rewards from helping out in times of crisis. 
"It gave me enormous satisfaction," he said of assisting New York, adding that 
the Municipal Assistance Corp. he chaired raised $10 billion for the city 
through bond issues between 1975 and 1985. "We live here, and it would have 
been a terrible thing for New York. . . . The city has been very good to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many others, Peer Swan, president of the Irvine Ranch Water District, is 
hoping that the joint Chamber-Industrial League business task force being 
formed will make a difference. With business expertise behind them, Swan says, 
the county and the municipalities can help make up the losses by re-examining 
how government operates. "I think they need help in understanding how to run a 
business," Swan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukeles, the New York consultant, put it this way: "You have to recognize that 
there is a crisis and that it's everyone's crisis. It's not someone else's 
crisis, it's our crisis."

PARTY LEADERS VIE FOR BUDGET-CUT HONORS; CONGRESS: NEITHER REPUBLICAN NOR 
DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATORS SEEM TO GIVE CLINTON'S MIDDLE-INCOME TAX CUT PLAN MUCH 
OF A CHANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 While Administration officials scoured the federal budget for ways to pay for 
the President's tax-cut plan, lawmakers argued Sunday over which party is 
better equipped to manage the government's books. 
</P>
<P>
 And neither Republican nor Democratic legislators seemed to give President 
Clinton's middle-income tax cut much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Archer, incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, 
would say only that the President's plan "is going to be considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," the Texas Republican chided Clinton 
for weighing in last with a tax-cut plan. "He came late to the dance, but he's 
on the dance floor and we welcome that," Archer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) 
said he doubts that the GOP will pass a tax cut that is paid for -- or one that 
the President will be able to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think in the end the calculation by the new majority would be: 'Why 
give the President that credit? . . . Don't give the President a bill he can 
sign.' It will be part of the strategy," he said on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's package of tax cuts for families raising children, paying tuition or 
planning for retirement is mostly aimed at households earning less than $75,000 
a year. House Democrats proposed less-restrictive tax breaks for families 
earning less than $75,000. By far the priciest plan is the GOP proposal to give 
tax credits for children in families earning less than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton claims he can cut $72 billion from the federal budget in five years to 
pay for his $60-billion program. But $52 billion of the cuts are unspecified 
and would not take effect until 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, who planned to unveil some of the cuts today, has his aides and 
agency officials reviewing several options, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Making the nation's air traffic control system private. 
</P>
<P>
 * Slashing $22 billion over five years from the Energy Department, one of the 
agencies Clinton had considered eliminating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cutting $700 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 
$30-billion budget, mainly by consolidating 60 programs into a handful of block 
grants to cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers from both parties, appearing on Sunday TV news shows, agreed in 
principle on one point: The federal government must be drastically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about proposals to eliminate various Cabinet agencies, incoming House 
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt said: "I don't put that off the table." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was sharp disagreement over which party is best suited to make the 
budget cuts to give the middle class a tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt, of Missouri, lambasted the GOP "contract with America." "Over half 
of the tax benefits in their contract goes to people who earn over $100,000 and 
blows a $700-billion hole in the deficit," he said on ABC-TV's "This Week With 
David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have yet to come forward with cuts they're going to need to 
make this contract work," Gephardt said. "I doubt they're going to be able to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas replied: "Mr. Gephardt 
continues to incorrectly and inaccurately spout the party line that they've 
lived by since the 1980s. He's in a state of denial."

O.C. SPORTS HALL OF FAME ADDS TO ITS ROSTER; INDUCTION: ONLY RYAN AND SLANEY 
SKIP THE EVENT HONORING THE CLASS OF 1994 AT ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Sports Hall of Fame's class of 1994 brought to the induction 
ceremonies much of the same things the previous 13 sets did -- glittering 
achievements and genuine appreciation for what was happening to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I would make it," said George Latka, who also is in the World 
Boxing Hall of Fame as a boxer and referee. "There are so many high-profile 
people who deserve it. So many good athletes who are not in it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I didn't get in the first time around I figured 'Naah, it'll never 
happen.' And now? It's a wonderful feeling. When they told me I broke down and 
cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Latka was one of seven inducted Sunday at the Hall of Fame Patio next to 
Anaheim Stadium, bringing the membership to 74. Also elected this year were 
former Angels Nolan Ryan and Brian Downing, former Ram center Rich Saul, track 
stars Steve Scott and Mary Decker Slaney and tennis player Josephine 
Cruickshank. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan and Slaney did not attend the ceremonies, which attracted a crowd of 350. 
</P>
<P>
 Downing almost did not come, either. He had made no secret of his unhappiness 
with the Angels and how they released him as a player in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he came up to the podium to accept his plaque, Downing used the 
moment to begin mending fences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something I had dreamed about," Downing said of his induction. "I 
realized very early I would never make it to Cooperstown (the Baseball Hall of 
Fame). To be in one in your own hometown makes you very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family knows I have been tough to live with the past few years. I hope 
today, with this award, I can start to turn my life around. I had thought about 
not coming here, but I'm glad I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Saul, who was named to six Pro Bowls and was the captain of the Rams' lone 
Super Bowl team in 1980, alternated between humor and pathos in his acceptance 
speech. "There are probably more people here than have been at a Rams' game," 
he said. But he also picked on Downing's regard for area recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your kids hear you've been elected they think, 'Maybe Dad was better 
than we thought,' " Saul joked. "But the best part is . . . you can be elected 
to one of those national halls and nobody saw you play. Here, the people know 
whether you did it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ryan was unavailable because of a prior commitment, he was remembered 
by Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nolan was a hero of mine," Scott said. "He taught me that age is not a 
limiting factor to an athlete's success, but that attitude is." 
</P>
<P>
 Five other people were honored Sunday in addition to those elected to the 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Murphy, who helped found the American Basketball Assn., the World 
Hockey Assn. and World Team Tennis, was given the Lifetime Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Bryant, an organizer of the "Save the Rams" committee and who helped 
establish the Freedom Bowl and Disneyland Pigskin Classic, was presented with 
the Good Guy Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Bethel, who set a national record in the pentathlon for 13- and 
14-year-olds last July despite losing her right eye after being struck by an 
errant golf ball, received the Woody Deitch Courage Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Kennedy, board chairperson of the First American Financial Corporation 
and captain of the 1939 Stanford national champion golf team, was given the 
Distinguished Citizen award. Kennedy's son, Parker, accepted the award for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Dunleavy of Anaheim Hills received the Youth Sports Development Award.

Q & A: HELP O.C. FIND ITS WAY BACK, EXPERT URGES; FORMER HEAD OF 
SECURITIES-REGULATION PANEL SAYS SUPERVISORS NEED GUIDANCE FROM OUTSIDE 
LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As chairman of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board in Washington, 
investment adviser Charles W. (Skip) Fish argued for more disclosure of 
political contributions from securities brokers, which federal investigators 
now suspect may have contributed to Orange County's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish, chief executive of Fish & Lederer Investment Counsel Inc. in Orange, was 
a member of the rule-making board for two years before his yearlong term as 
chairman, which ended last fall. The board, whose 15 members mainly come from 
the securities industry, was created by Congress in 1975; the guidelines it 
suggests for bond traders are subject to approval by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week, Fish reiterated his concerns about the financial 
expertise of the Orange County Board of Supervisors and called for additional 
assistance from other officials, including Gov. Pete Wilson, to help the county 
choose its strategies for dealing with the bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: A lot of comparisons have been made between Orange County and New 
York City's near-bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. How similar are the two 
situations? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The primary difference is the underlying health of the issuer. You 
have a situation in Orange County where the economy is well off, except for 
this glaring problem you have with the investment pool. The other conspicuous 
difference is that the marketplace is a completely different entity today than 
it was 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, there was about $31 billion worth of new 
debt issued. The figure for last year was $230 billion. That's not quite 
tenfold, but it's a huge difference. And there are a lot more complicated, more 
exotic (securities) out there. 
</P>
<P>
 You have this growing volume, let's call it a freight train headed east, on an 
increasingly complicated type of product. On the same track headed west is the 
investor, who is gradually changing. The banks are taking a diminishing role. 
Now you have the casual, retail customers -- the ordinary families -- who buy 
bonds through mutual funds. They're relying on their own intuition and the 
broker they're doing the transactions with. Everything . . . screams out for 
more disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There has not been much political pressure for disclosure in the last 10 
years. Is that because something like Orange County's bond fiasco hadn't 
happened yet? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's a good part of the reason. Obviously the Orange County situation 
would have hastened it, as would any other disaster in the municipal securities 
industry. Now there's no question that more has to be done. It was just a 
matter of time until you had the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you think it would happen this way? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was a question of when it would take place. I didn't think it would take 
place this soon, I didn't think it would be this dramatic, and I certainly 
didn't think it would happen here. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a disclosure problem. With a corporate bond filing, you have all the 10Ks 
and 10Qs (disclosure forms mandated by the SEC), but you don't have those 
requirements with (municipal) bonds. This is a problem because you've got 
people valuing the bonds daily, but the data they had to rely on to judge the 
credit, that data became five, six or seven years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're referring to the rating agencies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I'm referring to the mutual funds. There's only so much a rating agency 
can do. You always want them to do more, but they have an awesome task. . . . I 
think it's very hard for a rating agency to stay current. Most of the 
disclosure that they would want (in order) to make a decision is voluntary, and 
I don't suppose it's always easy to get the cooperation of the issuers of the 
bonds. The rating agency's only hold over them is, if they want to maintain 
their rating, they had better cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should there be standards for the way that these portfolios are 
constructed? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To me, it was inadequate for Orange County to issue debt with the fund in 
the condition it was in last September, when they did their last issue. There's 
no question in anybody's mind that, if you use so much leverage that the 
portfolio appears to be three times its size, that's a ridiculous use. That's 
so totally beyond what is prudent that even a young, inexperienced portfolio 
manager would be shocked to see that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the light of day never hit, the alarms never went off. The people that 
knew this was going on were (former County Treasurer-Tax Collector) Bob Citron 
and maybe three to four members of his staff, and I suspect maybe three to four 
. . . of the securities dealers that were facilitating the actual transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Whose job was it, outside that circle of people, to say that the fund had 
too much leverage? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Obviously, the county should have had the checks and balances in-house, and 
the oversight should have been there. But the point is that, if the disclosures 
had been taking place, this problem never would have occurred. There's an 
obligation on the part of the underwriters of the bond to do due diligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much can you put the blame on the brokerage houses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The SEC is looking for violations of the law in their investigation (of 
Merrill Lynch and other brokerages). But the moral issue is, even if there 
weren't violations of the letter of the law, I think it was readily apparent to 
a lot of people a long time ago that they didn't want to be part of what was 
going on there. Maybe they owed it to the public to make it part of the body of 
public knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: By that do you mean the employees of the brokerage houses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have no firsthand knowledge, but I have been told there were some people 
who just backed away from the whole thing and refused to do these kinds of 
trades. Very commendable, Eagle Scout stuff. But it's only half a measure, 
because nobody else knew that. If it was some sort of a professional courtesy, 
by some really sick interpretation, that they don't want to say something nasty 
about one of their fellow securities dealers, then they let them go and 
exacerbate an already bad situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some of the things the supervisors or other officials of the 
county ought to be doing now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a tremendous urgency for leadership, and the leadership has to come 
from outside the county. I think the supervisors have been taking some good 
steps, but only to address half of the problem. (Former state Treasurer) Tom 
Hayes seems to be doing an excellent job; I think he was a very good choice. 
And Salomon Bros. is apparently doing a very credible job of handling the 
assets left in the pool . . . (but) the resources to extract the county from 
the problem just don't exist inside the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who are some of the outsiders you're thinking of? 
</P>
<P>
 A: What I want to do is talk to the governor. I'd like to see something like a 
financial emergency control board created, and created immediately. He could do 
this in a matter of days, and bring together an extremely knowledgeable body of 
volunteers, men and women who are all highly ethical and who have their own 
networks and a great deal of ingenuity -- all the things that the internal 
situation lacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who are they? Where should they come from, Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, probably elsewhere besides Orange County. What you want them to do is 
calm the markets, just like Tom Hayes, his mere presence has people breathing 
easier. But that's only part of the problem. The other problem is that you have 
the (cities and school districts) that invested in the fund, which are in dire 
straits. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not trying to be an alarmist here, but the plain and simple truth is that 
it may not be enough to get some of the money out of the fund and get it into 
their hands. That may not be enough to stave off future defaults. If you get a 
rash of future defaults, if you get a domino-type thing going here, the effect 
would be very profound. What we need to do is buy time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you suggesting that the county needs the backing of other government 
entities? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, Orange County isn't expecting anybody else to pay for the problem. . . 
. The state just got done with revenue anticipation warrants, and the county 
should look at using those as well. That probably means the county would have 
to get letters of credit and would have to agree to comply with certain budget 
goals at certain time intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned that there were some other specific things that county 
officials could do. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, there are a number of things, so let me just give you a list. The 
county could identify payments it is owed from the state and from other sources 
that it could ask to be accelerated. It could outline programs where the major 
tax and fee payers could be given incentives to prepay their taxes or fees. 
They could also look at substitute sources of credit, or identify revenue 
streams, such as things that come back to the municipalities from user fees. Or 
you could look for ways to mobilize pension assets, where that would be 
appropriate. Finally, I would urge the county to take steps to secure revenue 
sources that it has failed to take advantage of in the past, mostly because of 
political barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As these things are done, what should the county's priorities be? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The most important thing is that they have to do everything possible to 
avoid defaults by any of the entities that were members of the pool. (County 
officials) have a profound responsibility to them. It takes decades to repair 
the damage that a default or a delinquency would cause in the investment 
community. They (the Board of Supervisors) need the support of all the citizens 
of the County of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why should citizens now support the supervisors or other county officials 
who were supposed to oversee the fund? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I suppose I could say at this point that I rest my case, talking about how 
much help leadership needs to come from outside the county. I might say that, 
in a number of instances, the citizens have absolutely no reason to feel 
comfortable with the leadership that is coming from inside the county right 
now. And they desperately need leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You argued against the county seeking Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection 
before the county filed for it. Are there other legal actions that might still 
be worth pursuing? Is county government spending too much effort on legal 
defenses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's easier for them to understand (legal actions). I don't think they 
understand the ramifications of long-term and short-term debt, or the financial 
markets that are involved in what they're facing. Lawyers are giving them 
logical explanations of what they should do and why to protect themselves 
against liability. But if the priority is on doing what is right by the average 
Orange County resident and taxpayer, it seems to me that the priority should be 
on containing and minimizing the damage. That's what they need to be focused on 
right now.

 Southern California Edison -- Due to an editing error, an item in Friday's 
Briefly column misstated the range of employees at Southern California Edison 
Co. whose salaries will be frozen in 1995 in a cost-cutting move. Non-union 
employees, ranging from clerical workers to senior management, are subject to 
the hold on raises. Chairman and Chief Executive John E. Bryson and 19 other 
officers will voluntarily forgo both 1995 salary raises and 1994 bonuses, which 
would have been paid in 1995.
