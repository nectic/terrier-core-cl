IT BEGINS WITH A SPARK; A BOLT OF LIGHTNING DISRUPTED GRETEL EHRLICH'S LIFE AND 
HER HEALTH, BUT IT ALSO SET HER ON A QUEST TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE BREATH OF 
LIFE COMES FROM.; A MATCH TO THE HEART, BY GRETEL EHRLICH (PANTHEON: $21; 201 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Dorris, Michael Dorris's book of essays, Paper Trail, was recently 
published. His second novel for children, Guests, will appear this fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
 At five o'clock one threatening afternoon barely two years ago, Gretel Ehrlich 
was struck by lighting. Of this event that profoundly and permanently altered 
her life she writes: "Before electricity carved its blue path toward me, before 
the negative charge shot down from cloud to ground, before 'streamers' jumped 
the positive charge back up from the ground to cloud, before air expanded and 
contracted producing loud pressure pulses I could not hear because I was 
already dead, I had been walking." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Match to the Heart" is the affecting, gorgeously written chronicle of 
Ehrlich's subsequent struggle toward, if not recovery, at least balance. 
Against the arbitrary bad luck of having been in the wrong place at the wrong 
time, she searches for a sense of understanding, of acceptance, even as her 
body resists recuperation. It is a long and difficult journey, a continuing 
process, but guided by Gretel Ehrlich's passionate and unflinching inquiry into 
the scientific causes of lightning, the delicate intricacies of the body, and 
the battle between stoicism and determined will, we emerge, with her, wiser 
than we began. Along the way we are privy to an introspective autobiography 
splendidly rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 With her first book, "The Solace of Open Spaces" (1985), Gretel Ehrlich proved 
herself to be a prose poet of impressive talent and breadth. Her vivid, 
intelligent meditations on the land, especially the wide horizons of a Wyoming 
ranch, invited readers to experience an almost mystical connection to an 
environment few had ever known directly. In the work that followed -- a 
memorable essay in "Legacy of Light" (1987); a novel, "Heart Mountain" (1988); 
stories, "Drinking Dry Clouds" (1991); and the nonfiction "Islands, The 
Universe, Home" (1991) -- she continued to hone and perfect her vision, 
garnering along the way a devoted and enthusiastic following. 
</P>
<P>
 My reading copy of "A Match to the Heart" is marked with almost as many turned 
down corners as it has pages, with countless underlinings and notes. A passage 
or two I've committed to memory, for both the pleasure and the instruction in 
the creation of fine descriptive literature it provides. How to choose between 
them for this review? 
</P>
<P>
 When Gretel Ehrlich looks out on the Pacific, for instance, she doesn't just 
see waves. On one occasion, she "watched a slivered moon move west, its back 
hunched to the winter sun." On another, "Purple changed to blue dappled with 
pink: the water was a shield, reflecting what was above, below, inside each 
wave. The waves started blue, ribbed black, ended white. Where kelp beds 
floated, the sea was bright like ice. Two pelicans skimmed whitecaps with their 
wingtips, and farther out a hidden reef broke waves the way irony breaks open 
certain truths." And later: "Most of us are so earthbound, so terracentric, we 
think of the continent as the centerpiece around whose edges oceans lap. But to 
a set of waves journeying across the Pacific, the sea is the central body into 
which the lithosphere rudely bumps. The life of a wave ends at the edge of the 
continent where water becomes shallow. As they approach the shore, their length 
suddenly decreases, and to compensate, the waves slow down and steepen. The 
shallow bottom refracts waves: they are bent, not by a twist of wind but by the 
shape of the ocean floor. For a moment the wave is a mirror image of underwater 
contours." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Match to the Heart" similarly echoes the very essence of the elements it 
records: water, the fire of lighting, the sturdy utility of Wyoming earth, the 
blissful dynamic of air. It also poses answers to that most personal of 
questions: Who am I? "How odd," Ehrlich considers, "that we walk around with 
these bodies, live in them, die in them, make love with them, yet know almost 
nothing of their intimate workings, the ludicrous balancing act of homeostasis, 
the delicate architecture of their organs and systems, or the varying weathers 
of their private, internal environments. Up to this point my living and 
breathing had been an act of faith. I existed but I didn't know how" -- a gap 
in her knowledge she aims at least partially to rectify. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnessing open-heart surgery to better grasp the mystery of the organ she 
sought to heal in herself, Ehrlich says: "I was a traveler, a Marco Polo who 
had arrived in a place so exotic, few had seen it before. . . . Steam rose from 
the open cavity. I felt as if I had broken into a hidden cave and come upon 
rubies and sapphires. Looking past skin, red tissue, white bone, into a chest 
held open by a steel frame, I saw a beating heart." 
</P>
<P>
 She stands in awe of both the mechanisms of life and the vocabularies used to 
approximate them. "An intake of breath is not just oxygen, a pulse is not just 
the rush of blood but also the taking in of divinity through an orifice, and as 
it moves through, it becomes a spark. To be inspired is to have accepted spirit 
in the lungs and heart, to watch it circulate through miles of blood vessels 
and capillaries whose tiny fenestrations allow oxygen, nutrients, and grace to 
leak into the tissues of muscle and consciousness, then be taken up again, 
reoxygenated, and returned." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning her attention to the brain, she declares: "The synapse is holy. Apse 
comes from apsis, whose roots mean, to loop, wheel, arch, orbit, fasten, or 
copulate, and the apse of a church is a place of honor. The synapse is the gap 
where nothing and everything happens. Bodies of thoughts swim in the synaptic 
lake, sliding over receptors, reaching for the ones that live on the other 
shore. An interval of between 0.5 and 1 millisecond transpires before an 
impulse makes its way across the gap . . . where we pause between life and 
death, treading water in the oblivion of a gray sea. What is a thought before 
it registers memory? . . . Is it like unrequited love, or a lover who is spirit 
only, who has no body?" 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 1,800 thunderstorms in progress over the earth every moment," 
we learn, "and lightning hits the planet one hundred times each second. In the 
continental United States alone, there are forty million cloud-to-ground 
strikes each year." One of them, by pure chance, hit Gretel Ehrlich and changed 
her life forever. In response, she produced "A Match to the Heart" -- a 
dazzling work of art -- and so changes ours.

TRADING INTO THE INDIES; THE HONOURABLE COMPANY: A HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH EAST 
INDIA COMPANY, BY JOHN KEAY (MACMILLAN: $25; 474 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alexander Frater, Frater is chief travel correspondent of the London 
Observer. His book Chasing the Monsoon is published by Owl Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The seed from which the British Empire sprang was an obscure, tiny, wretchedly 
malarial island lying at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago. Its 
name, Pulo Run, sounds like a consequence of having eaten bad curries, yet it 
once carried such resonance that James I chose to style himself "King of 
England, Scotland, Ireland, France and Puloroon" (Pulo Run). Even the pragmatic 
eye of Cromwell took on a feverish glitter when it was mentioned. Send a 
shipload of good Presbyterian settlers, he commanded, with chickens and goats; 
it must be ours for eternity. (They were dispatched but, fortunately for them, 
never got there). 
</P>
<P>
 What excited the Brits were a few acres of nutmeg gardens. On Pulo Run 10 
pounds of nutmeg cost half a penny. In Europe it retailed for 1.60 -- a profit 
of 32,000%. Europeans craved the stuff; nutmeg street values, reminiscent of 
those commanded by certain forbidden substances today, led a group of English 
speculators, in 1600, to form themselves into "The Company of Merchants of 
London Trading Into the East Indies." 
</P>
<P>
 They came together to exploit the spices market and, almost inadvertently, 
changed the world. Indeed, they would eventually come to regard themselves as 
"the Grandest Society of Merchants in the Universe" creating their own army, 
navy and civil service, laying down their own laws, issuing their own currency. 
No multinational is likely to wield that kind of power again. 
</P>
<P>
 John Keay, a British historian with several outstanding books on India to his 
credit, has been following the Company's Indian path since the Sixties. "The 
Honourable Company" was a surprise bestseller in England -- corporate histories 
don't usually make the lists -- and it's not hard to see why. Keay has managed 
to produce both a formidable work of scholarship and a ripping yarn. His story, 
peopled by a remarkable cast of characters, pulses with life and incident. The 
saga of the Honourable Company is an adventure tale on an epic scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it started in spices, the Company soon diversified into anything likely 
to enrich the shareholders -- cotton, salt, tea, silk, saltpeter. Tiny Pulo Run 
soon found itself on the back burner. There were bigger fish to fry. 
</P>
<P>
 Its activities encouraged the insular Brits to think, for the first time, of 
global possibilities. And the problems they encountered along the way, ranging 
from matters of high statecraft to personal dilemmas (a Company man locked in a 
Turkish "dogge's kennell" escaped by floating out to sea in an empty water 
butt) created a body of experience useful to the creation of empire. 
</P>
<P>
 At home they assembled the apparatus that would one day service its building 
the first London docks, creating the London money market. Abroad they were 
everywhere -- in the American Colonies, China, Japan and the South Seas, 
starting sheep stations in Australia, failing to start the first European 
settlement in Southern Africa. (Ten condemned men awaiting execution in Newgate 
prison were put ashore in Capetown's Table Bay but, after only a few months 
begged to be taken home and hanged.) They traded through Burma and Malaya, 
opened up the coffee ports of the Red Sea, investigated Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the country with which their name will forever be associated, and which 
forms the core of Keay's book is, of course, India. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1609 Capt. William Hawkins landed on the Bombay coast and journeyed to the 
Moghul court at Agra, Jehangir, the Emperor, took a shine to the Englishman, 
made him a khan, put him on the palace payroll and invited him to take a wife. 
Hawkins was appalled. He wanted Indian trading rights, not an Indian spouse 
and, blustering, told Jehangir he could only marry a Christian. To his horror 
Jehangir promptly produced one, an Armenian "mayden" whose father had died 
"leaving her 'only a few jewels.' " Hawkins, a loyal Company man, gritted his 
teeth, endured the nuptials, won the Company its first foothold on the 
subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
 They established a settlement at Bombay, drained the swamps, built a city 
boasting a hospital, an Anglican Church, a Supreme Court (which impaneled 
India's first juries) and a mint "to turn the Company's bullion exports into 
ruppes, xeraphins, shahls, and all the other exotic denominations then in use." 
They founded Calcutta and Madras, both frightful places -- the latter rendered 
hideously dangerous by the seas one had to negotiate to get ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 You had to slightly crazy to volunteer for Madras. In 1656 an open boat 
carrying Company personnel (including the captains of three East India ships) 
capsized as they sat reclining "verie merrie in discourse." But the upturned 
boat contained an air pocket; after two hours inside they tore off their 
clothes and swam for it. Sixteen perished in the undertow but the survivors, 
even in this hard-nosed Company town, encountered unexpected acts of kindness. 
The captains were running stark naked down a road when, one recalled later, he 
happened upon "a good Dutchman who lent me his hat and his slippers." 
</P>
<P>
 There was, about Madras, an atmosphere akin to gold rush fever. Fortunes could 
be made specially, Keay tell us, by subversives who -- ignoring the wrath of 
head office in faraway London -- pursued free-lance business activities in 
Company time. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn that American-born Elihu Yale, Governor of Madras in the late 1680s, 
dismissed by the Company for "abusing (his) position," managed, adroitly, to 
keep both reputation and fortune intact. (Part of the latter he donated to "his 
old school, then known as His Majesty's College of Connecticut. In 1718 the 
grateful trustees renamed it Yale College in his honour.") 
</P>
<P>
 Keay lovingly chronicles the minutiae of business life, the efforts the 
Company made to keep the wheels of commerce turning. Forty tons of exotic gifts 
had to be hauled across 800 miles of bandit-infested country for an Emperor 
reluctant to grant them a special trading license. The consignment included 
1,001 gold coins, a clock set with precious stones, a "unicorn's horn," a gold 
escritoire, a lump of ambergris, an ewer and basin, and a globe six feet in 
diameter, its place names written in Persian. The Emperor accepted the goods 
without comment -- then kept the Brits hanging around for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The intrigues of court life could directly affect Company profits. Executives 
spent much time monitoring Indian royalty, trying to read the nuances of palace 
politics, figuring to back the man in the ascendancy. Luck often played a part 
in these calculations. Only a year after they finally bade farewell to the 
Emperor with groin strain -- clutching their precious trading license -- he was 
deposed, imprisoned, blinded and, finally, executed by strangulation. And none 
of his successors, it became clear, would have granted them even a dog license. 
The Company enjoyed only limited popularity in ruling circles. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bengali Nawab named Siraj invaded Calcutta and, one night, locked 146 
Britons into a detention cell measuring 18 feet by 15; only 23 survived. A 
Company soldier, Colonel Robert Clive, arrived to exact revenge for the "Black 
Hole" incident. He confronted Siraj at Plassey and defeated him; soon afterward 
Siraj, a victim of treachery within his own court, was assassinated. The 
Company sued his successor for damages, confiscated his fortune and sent it 
floating "downriver to Calcutta on a flotilla of barges," 
</P>
<P>
 Part was handed out as prize money. Clive received 234,000 -- at a time when a 
house in Berkeley Square cost 10,000 -- and collected lands from the new Nawab 
worth 30,000 a year for life. Though he later became a baronet and governor of 
Bengal, he remains controversial, a great but greedy man caught, perhaps, with 
his hand in the till. Yet all of them, merchants and militia alike, had joined 
the Company to make money, exploit India. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing disquiet at home caused urgent corporate reappraisals. The new-look 
Company began concerning itself with social justice and the governance of the 
people, turned from a commercial operation into an administrative one. It had 
lost its way. India was absorbed into the Empire and, in 1858, the Company 
dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Keay has given us a marvelous book, deftly and engagingly written, sparkling 
with humor. There is, for example, a running gag about protracted attempts to 
persuade the peoples of the tropics to wear English tweeds which, I suspect, P. 
G. Wodehouse would have loved.

 Regarding "Rewriting the Dictionary of Madness" (by Ann Japenga, June 5): 
</P>
<P>
 As a psychiatrist, I must point out that there is a vast body of world 
literature on the biological elements of many mental disorders, including 
Alzheimer's Dementia, alcoholic encephalopathy and numerous organic brain 
syndromes, all included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, as well as schizophrenia and affective disorders. One wonders how 
anyone could possibly conclude that "a bunch of guys just made this stuff up." 
</P>
<P>
 This literature, recognized as scientific by every major university in the 
world, has involved decades of work by many thousands of researchers and has 
contributed to the development of highly successful treatment for many mental 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wishing to examine this evidence can consult any standard textbook of 
psychiatry or any one of dozens of scientific journals and then would be in a 
position to make arguments in terms of flaws in research design, of statistical 
errors or on any other scientific basis. Critics of psychiatry as 
"unscientific" never seem to do this.

<P>
 Examples of downright falsehood abound in Japenga's article. A sample: ". . . 
no one has ever been able to prove that mental illnesses -- such as depression, 
panic disorder and even schizophrenia -- are biological conditions." Granted, 
this is a quotation from Peter Breggin, a maverick psychiatrist who plans to 
bring out a book soon, but why would an ethical journalist quote him in such 
detail as an authority on a subject that deeply affects so many families in our 
communities? And why this all-out sideswiping of psychiatry? 
</P>
<P>
 The DSM-IV is a manual. If no one attacks the manuals that computer engineers 
and architects prepare to do their work, the reason is quite clear. These 
manuals are not about human beings and their sufferings. 
</P>
<P>
 As psychiatry moves into the future, there will be further editions of the 
DSM. It is hoped that the future also will include universal coverage in the 
National Health Plan of the biological brain diseases -- schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder and major depression -- along with other physical illnesses, as well 
as support for research in these areas.

 Japenga's refreshingly accurate article on DSM-IV actually quoted both 
proponents and opponents. So often "the other side of the story" is ignored in 
articles about psychiatry, a field in which experts are deified. I was quoted 
several times as coordinator of our 28-group Support Coalition International. 
Thank you for treating our members as human beings whose views are actually 
worth hearing.

 No doubt you'll hear typical complaints from the psychiatric establishment, 
which is used to its power being unquestioned.

<P>
 When my son, now 25, was 18, he called me from the patient telephone at UCLA's 
Neuropsychiatric Institute and Hospital. He was there for his second 
"evaluation." Tearfully, he said: "This is the happiest day of my life. I found 
out it's not my fault." 
</P>
<P>
 What was not his fault was the "weird" collection of behaviors, skills, 
deficits and interpersonal failures he suffered from all his life. It was his 
brain, the doctors said, that was to blame -- brain damage of an amorphous kind 
that had caused lifelong loneliness, brought about unrelenting teasing and 
triggered an "allergic reaction" on the part of others when he entered the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the case of Margaret Jensvold, my son's initial label provided the 
illumination that allowed him and his loved ones to seek the appropriate 
treatment. It took another seven years for the diagnosis of "Asperger's" to 
find its way onto the pages of the DSM-IV -- "Autism: Asperger's Type," replete 
with a list of criteria. Who can guess what course my son's life might have 
taken if only one of his many doctors, therapists or teachers had come across 
that label when he was 5, even 8 years old? 
</P>
<P>
 One thing, however, is certain: He and his parents would have grieved sooner, 
and advocated earlier, freed as they would have been from the blame, guilt and 
mystification borne by an unlabeled, yet painfully real, disorder.

 Japenga has omitted the primary reason for DSM categories -- that is, 
"third-party" dollars for mental health treatment. Insurers pay only when 
providers use the DSM diagnoses as evidence that the prescribed treatment is 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Jensvold proves that she does not suffer from "self-empowering 
personality" by her self-destructive attempts to deny not only such money for 
herself but for all women who could benefit from mental health treatment.

 I was encouraged to read about the controversies surrounding the DSM, a

</P>
<P>
 As a therapist working with emotionally disturbed children and their families 
in a school setting, I have been struck with the extraordinarily unscientific 
approach to treatment that this publication affords a mental health worker. I 
have watched too many children affected at age 4 or 5 by one of a variety of 
diagnostic labels that in effect promote resistance to growth or instill a lack 
of hope for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosing a child inadvertently allows the entire family to be focused for 
years on the problems of the "identified patient," rather than looking at the 
crucial, broader family

 As a free-lance photographer and 18-year veteran of the advertising business, 
I have clients that include several of the big-name agencies that Warren Berger 
mentioned, some so-called boutique agencies and even some one-man shops ("Chaos 
on Madison Avenue," June 5). 
</P>
<P>
 While many of Berger's observations cannot be disputed, it is not fair to lay 
most of advertising's faults on the mega-agencies. The clients mentioned, such 
as Ikea and Nike, are doing good work not only because they have hired 
excellent ad agencies like Deutsch and Widen & Kennedy, but also because they 
are companies that have the smarts to take some chances, as did Volkswagen in 
the late '60s and early '70s. Decades later, those VW ads are still regarded as 
industry icons of creativity -- some of the most memorable and successful 
advertising ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of what I considered my own best work died on the vine, but that had 
nothing to do with the bigger agencies' lack of response to creativity. It was 
due to nervous clients over-testing the work in focus groups and blunting its 
creative edge. Though it is the clients' dime, and they are the controlling 
factor, the smarters ones hire talented people and allow them to do good work.

 The quandary that creators of TV commercials find themselves in appears to be 
due to a public response that differs from what is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there were fewer commercial breaks and we sat in place so as not to miss 
the show's continuation. Now so many commercials appear in a row that we have 
time to prepare the next day's lunch, make a telephone call or even take a fast 
shower. 
</P>
<P>
 When a show becomes popular, more and more commercials are inserted, 
detrimentally shortening the show itself. That encourages us to use the mute 
button and move our attention to the book in our hand. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, some stations greatly increase the sound level during 
commercials, forcing us to lower the volume to the point where we can't hear 
the program when it comes back on.

 The public may not want to be manipulated, but it is -- and knows it.

 It was gratifying to read that those in the advertising business are 
struggling to find new formulas for the '90s. I hope that they fail.

<P>
 No other industry is as insidious, manipulative, patronizing and bigoted. Its 
constant premise -- if we buy the product, we will be happy -- by its nature 
implies that if we don't, we must be miserable, underprivileged, denied, 
impoverished, not respected and worthless. No wonder desperation abounds in 
society today.

 It has been my experience as executive director of the Southern California 
Counseling Center that clients best respond to the counseling relationship when 
both counselors and clients let go of labels and validate the human qualities 
and strengths that we all share. The DSM manual is a complicating, yet 
necessary tool for mental health professionals. Its value is derived from the 
structure it provides for insurance paperwork, research, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The potentially destructive nature of the manual can be overcome if therapists 
and family members respond to the individual and not to the label.

RICHARD EDER: THE WORLD WITHIN SIGHT OF THE LIGHTHOUSE; THE BIRD ARTIST, BY 
HOWARD NORMAN (FARRAR STRAUS & GIROUX: $20; 320 PP.)

<P>
 "We do not die of being sick; we die of being alive," Montaigne wrote, and in 
Howard Norman's brief and measureless new novel, four violent deaths are as 
lively as a convivial meal, sexual passion, the flight of birds, a painter's 
urge to portray them, a hunter's to slaughter them and the wavering wake of 
fishing dories hailing each other through the Newfoundland fog. 
</P>
<P>
 These things are high-colored and intense, and they are bubbles. Like the 
fishermen and their boats, the characters and their stories in "The Bird 
Artist" set out on courses, but their actual movement meanders on a sea that is 
enigmatic and still as a whole and -- wave by wave -- playful. 
</P>
<P>
 If modern physics builds mountains out of absurd dottles of positively and 
negatively charged matter, Norman's metaphysics devises large human affairs out 
of frivolously and unstably charged particles of tragedy and comedy. His 
humanity's Big Bang was a burst of laughter that time gravely floats through 
the eons. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, Norman published "The Northern Lights," set among the Inuits 
of upper Canada. It was a magical romance, told with a restraint and lightness 
that ensured that neither the reader nor the remote society where it took place 
was in the least manipulated. It was dazzling, though it sagged somewhat when 
its Anglo protagonist, growing up, was brought back from the north to live for 
a while in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most second books that follow a brilliant first one, "The Bird Artist" 
is an improvement. It is as light and magical, it is more searching and 
suggestive, and it has no flaw at all. It is one of the most perfect and 
original American novels that I have read in years; and the only trouble with 
saying so is that, when extracted for a blurb, such words distend the book's 
witty economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bird Artist" recounts in the first-person the growing-up of Fabian Vas in 
Witless Bay, Newfoundland, early in this century. From childhood he drew and 
painted birds; and as an adult he makes most of his living doing it, along with 
a little shipyard carpentry. His story is dramatic, even melodramatic, but it 
is not told that way. The voices that Norman gives him and the other characters 
are reflective and deflected: by turns aroused and relinquishing, wry and 
lyrical, comic and homely. As with John Gay's "Beggar's Opera," a libretto of 
passion and violence takes on a quizzical serenity, set -- we can all but hear 
them -- to a disconcerting variety of lilting and raffish tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name is Fabian Vas," the narrator begins, using the matter-of-fact 
airiness of Huck Finn or Ishmael to announce a story that may go anywhere at 
all. "You would not have heard of me. Obscurity is not necessarily failure, 
though; I am a bird artist, and have more or less made a living at it. Yet I 
murdered the lighthouse keeper, Botho August, and that is an equal part of how 
I think of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 So we know what happened and who did it right from the start. Yet Fabian's 
account has the mystery and tension of a novel of suspense all the way through. 
It is the mystery of how people behave, of how life treats them, and of the 
antic calligraphy that quite disrupts the way you would expect the markings of 
life and behavior to go. Since this is so much more than a genre book, the 
mystery is not dispelled at the end; only appeased. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian is the son of Alaric, a restless, dreamy woman, and Orkney, a 
hard-working carpenter and bird-hunter who has yoked a limitless heart to a 
series of narrow and devoted purposes. With all of the book's characters, in 
fact, the fundamental transaction is the friction between their essential 
limitlessness and the limits they live in. The result is never frustration -- 
that would make the kind of realistic novel that Norman has no notion of 
writing -- but a rainbow of unexpected colors. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, essentially, tells how Fabian is taught to abandon safety and take 
possession of his limitlessness; not by cracking open the world of Witless Bay 
but by cracking himself open while making some perceptible dents on that world. 
The transformation will come from a series of joyful, disastrous or merely 
bemusing encounters in which he experiences, in doses ranging from tiny to 
overwhelming, the limitlessness of everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 On the large side there is his stormy passion for Margaret, the daughter of 
the mail-boat captain. A precarious Beatrice composed of sex, vitality, fury 
and impenetrable schemes, she will alternately lead and goad him through his 
journey. There is Alaric's affair with Botho during her husband Orkney's long 
absence to harvest birds. There is Orkney's return, and an explosion of grief 
and shame that will propel Fabian to the lighthouse to shoot Botho with the gun 
Margaret has providently lent him. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Fabian's flight with his mother to Halifax to undergo a marriage she 
had arranged and he had been unable to resist. It lasts 10 minutes, cut short 
by the pursuing constable who had been too caught up by the romance of the 
ceremony to intervene until it was over. There is the comically eccentric 
criminal hearing of Fabian, Margaret and Alaric, conducted back in Witless Bay 
by the same constable. There are other deaths, more or less by mischance, but 
all with an element of the violence that is part of the lovely complexity of 
the characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabian will always be a bird artist -- "God gave me a small talent to help 
clarify my world," he says in a moment of crisis -- but by the end, he will use 
the small talent for something large: a mural that recapitulates everything 
that has happened. It is a mural of modest figures, each with a glint of magic 
no more pretentious or unnatural than their shoe-buckles. It is one of the 
marks of Norman's talent that he can make the description of a painting move us 
both as a dramatic climax and a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the large limitlessnesses there are the small ones. There is the 
librarian who first gave him paints and paper; trained in England and washed up 
in Witless Bay, she keeps the books in her parlor and has each card inscribed 
-- distant oceans of romance -- with the outline of a woman in a bathtub. There 
is Kelb, who walks the stage as the implacable instrument of justice and whose 
backstage resembles a garden with beehives. There is ancient Helen Twombly, who 
lived respectably and wildly, and rows herself out in the fog to die; after 
arranging with Botho to douse his lighthouse lantern. Take hold of any of 
Norman's characters and the other end seems to stretch to infinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret, who chooses Fabian when he is 13 and she, 17, is the most 
dangerously winning character in the book. As a child she would fill the house 
with lit candles when her father was away on the mail boat. Grown older, her 
candles are bigger and hotter; with no details furnished, she is formidably 
arousing. She is a Calamity Jane, a Cleopatra and a young woman striving to get 
things to work. Her father, Enoch -- part Beothuk Indian -- is quieter but 
equally memorable; the wisest and funniest character in the book. Fabian's own 
father, Orkney, starts quiet and repressed and, in a letter written long after 
he leaves home, turns into a giant. Even at home, soothing Alaric who must get 
up at four to make breakfast for him and Fabian, he placates distinctively: 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be father and son ghosts at the table. Just set out the coffee, mugs, 
scones. You'll see bites disappearing. The table'll be cleared. The door'll 
open. The door'll close. You can go right back to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bird Artist" has elements of fable and touches of magic realism. What is 
remarkable is the restraint and purpose with which Norman treats them. He does 
not decree moral or magic; he uses them the way they show themselves in our 
lives: as odd echoes, premonitions, surges of discovery, epiphanies. "The Bird 
Artist" is essentially a classic story of a young man coming to terms with 
himself, with his art and with his life. All that is splendid and spectacular 
in the book is simply light, magically employed, to seek out what is real.

COVER STORY: MOON SHIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.  
</P>
<P>
 With those immortal words, Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped on the 
ghostly lunar surface, becoming the first man to walk on the moon. It was July 
20, 1969, and the whole world sat enraptured in front of TV sets as the 
haunting black-and-white images were beamed back to Earth. But few knew the 
real story behind America's 10-year race to beat the Soviet Union to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moon Shot," a four-hour TBS documentary, chronicles the fierce competition 
between the United States and the U.S.S.R. to put a man on the moon. The 
stories of two of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, Alan Shepard and the late 
Deke Slayton, explore the complexities and difficulties of the mission from 
their personal perspectives. Both Shepard and Slayton traveled in space and 
were grounded for several years because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moon Shot" features never-before-seen footage, archival photos from NASA and 
from personal collections of astronauts along with interviews with the 
astronauts attached to the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo projects. The special is 
based on the new Turner Publishing book of the same name written by Shepard, 
Slayton and Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict. Barry Corbin, who plays astronaut 
Maurice Minifield on CBS' "Northern Exposure," narrates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Wolfinger, the producer and director of "Moon Shot," discussed the making 
of the documentary with Times Staff Writer Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many amazing stories in the documentary, especially about all the 
near-misses in space. Were they public record? 
</P>
<P>
 All the stories of what happened in space were a matter of public record, but 
nobody ever talked about it -- the near-mishaps, the near-accidents and the 
guys who almost didn't make it back, especially in the early Mercury days. If 
you read the articles closely in the newspapers, you'd get the details of that, 
but you had to really read for it. It's like we didn't want to tarnish the 
National Aeronautics and Space Adminsitration's reputation when everything else 
in the world looked so bad. NASA was this kind of shining beacon. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys were test pilots, so their attitude was, "It's part of the 
business, why talk about it?" It's only now when they are 65 and 70 years old 
that they are beginning to say to themselves, "What the hell? It's a good 
story. We might as well tell it." 
</P>
<P>
 You realize watching "Moon Shot" just how heroic these astronauts were. 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely. I think these guys, whatever else gets said about them, for all 
their personal antics and test-pilot machismo, were real heroes. That took a 
lot of guts to climb on top of one of those rockets, especially when you didn't 
know whether it was going to go up or down. John Glenn, that guy was really 
brave. When he sat on top of that Atlas rocket, it had a one-in-four chance of 
going up. I think that's pretty amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 They had no idea what they were getting into, none of them. They were test 
pilots and this looked liked the hottest ride going. They said, "That's where I 
want to be and if I'm going to be there I want to be first." These guys were 
real heroes. It was a time we liked heroes. We just loved having heroes. While 
I think they were overwhelmed by (celebrity) at first, I don't think there 
wasn't a one of them who said, "I can get used to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Where did you obtain the extraordinary footage used in the documentary? 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all was gotten out of the Johnson Space Center. A lot of it has not 
been seen before. It simply has to do with the tack of the story that we took. 
When we started to talk about what story we wanted to do, I had had it up to 
here with the kind of "spiritually elevating all mankind, let's feel good about 
going into space" movie. I wanted to do something about who these guys were, 
what made them tick. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one of these guys started off with the idea they were doing this for all 
mankind. It's every man for himself: "I want to be the first man on the 
rocket." There was a tremendous spirit of camaraderie and getting the job done. 
They truly all really liked and respected each other, but, man, they were test 
pilots. They wanted that seat and that was the name of the game. Not one of 
them to this day will deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys hate the movie "The Right Stuff" (based on Tom Wolfe's book). They 
think the movie is totally wrong. They were all pretty angry the way the story 
was unwound. I think because of that movie -- and it was very fresh in their 
minds -- these guys were telling me stories I don't think they otherwise would 
have told me. I think we got "the real stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "Moon Shot" is seen through Deke Slayton's eyes. Since he died a year ago of 
cancer, how involved was he in the documentary before his death? 
</P>
<P>
 I never met Deke. One of the devices we were going to do dramatically in the 
documentary was we were going to invent an astronaut. We were going to call him 
a mythical astronaut who was to be an omnipresent narrator who was there on all 
the missions. We were going to write what we thought was a very clever device. 
Then Deke died. We looked at ourselves. We had read everything that Deke had 
said and written, right down to his light bills. He had an incredible amount of 
insight and revelations which he shared while he was writing the book. We said, 
"It's all here, so let's make Deke our storyteller." We fashioned the story as 
told through the perspective of Deke. He was the perfect person to tell the 
story. 
</P>

DO NOT PASS GO; JUDGING FROM E. LYNN HARRIS'S SUCCESS, GAY FICTION IS GOING IN

By David Ehrenstein, David Ehrenstein is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer 
and critic.

<TEXT>
<P>
 'They lived in fear, they loved in secret.'  
</P>
<P>
 'A new adult novel of the torments and temptations of abnormal desires.'  
</P>
<P>
 'An electrifying novel of a man who had an uncontrollable desire for other 
men!'  
</P>
<P>
 So blazed the cover blurbs of the many paperback novels devoted to the 
"strange twilight world of the homosexual" that sold in drugstore book racks in 
the years before Stonewall. In the 1940s, when these books first appeared, 
cover art generally featured lone figures looking shamefully downward. By the 
early '60s, in the wake of the success of Jean Genet's "Our Lady of the 
Flowers," and John Rechy's "Desire in the Shadows," and "The Occasional Man" 
had reconfigured into two men placed against a jet black background, one 
looking longingly at the other who is turned away at an angle and staring 
shamefully at the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rise of gay and lesbian civil rights movement, such covers fell from 
fashion -- along with the lurid, downbeat tone of the stories contained between 
them. The early '70s novels of Gordon Merrick (a homo-erotic Judith Krantz 
avant la lettre ) featured brightly colored illustrations of handsome hunks 
sunning themselves on Fire Island or languidly lounging around a phenomenally 
expensive Manhattan townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 With conspicuous consumption scarcely fitting in to the ACT-UP era of the 
1980s, such sybaritic covers -- and the lusty romanticism promised within -- 
have all but vanished. But now comes E. Lynn Harris' "Just As I Am." The cover? 
Two black men in a semi-embrace (one stands behind the other, touching his 
partner at the shoulder and waist) while a black woman passes by on the left 
glancing longingly toward them. It's brightly lit. Neither of the men is 
casting shameful downward looks. And it's in hardcover! 
</P>
<P>
 But don't start breaking out the Chardonnay just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Invisible Life" and its sequel "Just As I Am" are set in the demimonde of 
closeted, urban, upscale black gay and bisexual men. Successful in everything 
except their emotional lives, Harris' characters represent a generation that 
has profited from the gains of the civil rights movement without ever having 
participated in it, yet feels hostile to a gay and lesbian movement it 
(wrongly) regards as the exclusive province of whites. This is potentially rich 
material. Unfortunately Harris is barely up to the task of regurgitating the 
cliches of previous generations gay pulpsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I longed for a love that would make me feel like the soothing love songs that 
caused an involuntary smile to linger not only on my face but in my heart," 
sighs Harris' hero (inwardly of course). But such noble ideals don't stop him 
from spending endless hours pursuing every deeply closeted, self-hating black 
man he can find. Between bouts with these troubled swains, he courts -- and 
nearly marries -- a woman whose chief attraction is that her love for him 
proves he isn't "completely gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Self-deceiving protagonists are a literary mainstay. A novelist capable of 
providing the proper context can make even the most problematic of protagonists 
compelling. Harris would appear to be unconcerned with this; his hero's many 
acts of bad faith tromp across page after page, unchecked and unremarked. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS, the most important human health tragedy of our time, figures in both 
novels; killing a minor character in the first and a major one in the second. 
But if Harris has had any actual experience in dealing with the disease, it 
isn't apparent. A description of a typical evening at Keller's bar in the New 
York's West Village is one of the few things in either volume that rings with 
any degree of truth. Everything else appears through a grid of pop novel 
cliches; as if the author, unable to trust his own instincts, felt he had to 
"channel" the ghost of the late-lamented Jacqueline Suzanne before putting pen 
to paper. All things considered, that wouldn't be such a bad idea provided one 
had a sense of humor. Harris has none. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was listening to a Kathleen Battle CD when my doorman buzzed me and told me 
Delaney was on her way upstairs," reads one breathless bit of exposition. 
"Basil's backside captured my attention as I walked through the huge lobby of 
the Hilton Hotel," reads another. It's in lines like these that Harris' talents 
are truly revealed. For such neat linkages of casual sex and consumer opulence 
underscore his awareness that he isn't addressing an audience of readers, but 
of shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace Thurman, Melvin Dixon, June Jordan, Audre Lord, Joseph Beam, Steve 
Corbin and Essex Hemphill (to name just a few) have more to say about the 
African-American gay and lesbian experience than E. Lynn Harris could ever 
imagine, but you're not likely to find them featured in the major chain 
bookstores. "Invisible Life" and "Just As I Am" are there however -- right 
alongside the like-minded tales of Judith Krantz, Danielle Steele, Jackie 
Collins, et al. -- and both are riding high on the African American bestseller 
lists (which ran in these pages last week). 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the early 1960s, James Baldwin's novel of gay/bisexual 
African-American life, "Another Country," was a runaway bestseller. Despite a 
spate of hostile reviews clearly upset by the sexuality of Baldwin's 
characters, the book reached mass audiences as few novels by an 
African-American -- regardless of subject -- had ever done before (or since). 
Deeply passionate, utterly personal and completely indifferent to the demands 
of either radical politics or polite society, "Another Country" slipped through 
the cracks of a then-closing divide between serious and commercial literature. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no chance of something like that happening today. 
</P>
<P>
 The lines have been clearly drawn between what the powerful publishing machine 
will push and what is to be left to the ghetto of small specialty presses and 
university presses. Serious gay/lesbian African-American literature is part of 
the ghetto. E. Lynn Harris is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the four horsemen of the daytime talk show apocalypse -- Oprah 
Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael, Geraldo Rivera and Montel Williams -- the 
fascination many heterosexual women have for homosexual men has -- -- finally 
-- been revealed as a market ripe for the plucking. Harris, an Atlanta-based 
marketing executive, is clearly aware of this fact. Self-publishing "Invisible 
Life" in 1992, he distributed it to bookstores in areas he had carefully 
scouted in advance for sales potential. As a result, it became a regional 
bestseller, and Doubleday agreed to publish its sequel, "Just As I Am," in 
hardcover while re-releasing "Life" as an Anchor paperback. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the cover of "Just As I Am," it's clear that Doubleday knows the 
books with gay subject matter pitched to a "crossover" audience of heterosexual 
females could prove to have as big a sales potential in this country as they 
already do in Japan. The widespread enthusiasm among Japanese housewives for 
gay romance novels, E. M. Forster's "Maurice" on both page and screen (the 
film's director, James Ivory, has been approached to turn his work into a stage 
musical, and its star, Hugh Grant, has become a pin-up heartthrob), and the 
growing subculture of the okoge (Japanese for "fag hag") has led to such 
curious circumstances as Gus Van Sant's decidedly non-mainstream film "My Own 
Private Idaho" getting the major part of its financing from Japan -- surely 
because of its gay subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
 First it was miniaturized circuitry, then the automobile, now it's 
homosexuality. Are we going to let the Japanese beat us to the sales punch 
again? Not if E. Lynn Harris has anything to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 You can judge a book by its cover.

 The clue Wanda Coleman lacks in "A Loner's Leap" (Three on the Town, June 5) 
is not the "race, size or hair color" of the suicide victim but rather why 
people commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't owe people who take their own lives anything after the fact.By then 
it's too late. We already know that suicide is usually a messy, cowardly way to 
exit life at the expense of others. But if viewing "mounds of flesh, some 
flattened in a trail of skid marks" only incites Coleman to write a column 
about the ennui of society and banal parallels to rock songs, then she doesn't 
get it either. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, while everyone else is looking at their watches and diving for the 
nearest off-ramp, Wanda, pull over to the side of the road and cry your eyes 
out instead. It isn't really a "metropolis gone mad." It is an enormous 
collection of individuals who just don't get it -- and don't seem to care.

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, the former Navy test pilot 
became the first man into space on May 5, 1961. In December, 1963, he was 
grounded because of an inner-ear disorder and became chief of the astronaut 
office. In May, 1969, his disorder was surgically treated and he was returned 
to flight status. In July, 1971, he returned to space on Apollo 14. Shepard, 
now 70, became the first man to play golf on the lunar surface.  
</P>
<P>
 Were you scared on your first flight into space? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think scared is the right word. Nervous . Obviously, you practiced for 
all kinds of things to go wrong. You have trained to respond to emergency 
situations. Still, you are a bit nervous when you are sitting on top of the 
rocket. . . . I (was) nervous that I might make a mistake, same thing as a 
youngster taking an exam. He's a little bit nervous, but as soon as the kid 
starts to answer the first question of the exam, he stops being nervous. As the 
rocket fires, you stop being nervous and pay attention to the rocket. You don't 
worry about nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did you hit golf balls on the moon on the Apollo 14 flight? 
</P>
<P>
 It was not spontaneous. Several months before the flight, I thought about it. 
On the moon, golf balls are going to go six times as far and it's not going to 
slice or hook because there's no atmosphere. So I started to practice. We had a 
collapsible handle which had a scoop on the end of it to scoop up dust samples. 
The handle would be left up there, so I took the end of a No. 6 iron because 
that was about the length of the handle. I had it so it would snap on the end 
in place of the scoop. I took some pictures and then told the boss what I 
wanted to do. First, he said "No." And then I said, "Wait a minute, boss." I 
showed him the pictures. I said I paid for the club head and paid for the golf 
balls, so no expense to the taxpayers. I said, "Suppose I wait to the very end 
of the lunar mission, just before we were supposed to leave. If anything has 
gone wrong or we have equipment failures or had screwed up, anything like that, 
I won't hit the golf balls. But if everything has gone completely right, then 
the last thing I'll do before I go is whack these two golf balls. I won't even 
get them. I will leave them up there." And he said, "That's a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 How do you regard the state of NASA today? 
</P>
<P>
 We would like to see a full level of funding that would keep the space station 
on schedule. I think we all understand that most of the people don't really 
know what's going on at NASA. But it's a very mature sense of exploration in 
looking into various fields of science. All the experiments they are doing up 
on the shuttle -- I would say they are going to help people make their life 
better. The average citizen doesn't know this. That's why they're having 
difficulty with the Congress because they don't realize that either. They don't 
understand basic research. When we start talking about the experiments that the 
space station will be doing -- looking back at the planet, looking at the ozone 
levels, looking at pollution, and doing it on a worldwide basis -- then they 
are going to say those NASA guys are doing something for us on this planet 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you go into space again? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yeah, absolutely. But I wouldn't want to go through the thousands of hours 
of training again. I am too old for that (laughs). WALTER (WALLY) SCHIRRA 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the original Mercury Seven astronauts, the former lieutenant 
commander and Korean War veteran made his first foray into space on Oct. 3, 
1962, in the Sigma Seven. On the longest American mission to that date -- nine 
hours -- Schirra performed a series of scientific and engineering experiments. 
On Dec. 15, 1965, Schirra and Tom Stafford took off in the Gemini 6, which 
achieved a historic rendezvous with Gemini 7, steering within 6 to 8 inches of 
it. And on Oct. 11, 1968, Schirra, Walt Cunningham and Don Eisle lifted off in 
the Apollo 7. Schirra developed a severe head cold and the crew complained 
about the workload, including last-minute changes in their flight program. 
Schirra, 71, is known as the prankster among the Mercury 7 astronauts.  
</P>
<P>
 What were your feelings about the movie "The Right Stuff"? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my appellation for that was "Animal House in Space," which I said often 
enough that Tom Wolfe (who wrote the best-selling book) called me and said, "My 
first bid for movie rights was from (John) Belushi and (Dan) Aykroyd, which 
would have made it a much better comedy." I met Lance Henrikson (who played 
Schirra in the movie) at the premiere. That is the only time I have seen it 
really. He said, "Did I get you wrong!" I kept saying I had more time in my 
Actifed commercial than I did in that movie, and it was a 30-second commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you feel when you weren't given the first manned flight into space? 
</P>
<P>
 It was a real thud. All of us feel that you think you are the best, and 
suddenly you are not the very best. But then the sequence worked out to where I 
had a better flight. I kept teasing Shepard after that. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of emotions did you feel as you waited to blast off? 
</P>
<P>
 You are setting me up for my favorite line, though all of us claim it. As you 
are lying there just before liftoff you think, all of these hundreds and 
thousands of parts were put together by the lowest bidder. It is one of our 
favorite lines. 
</P>
<P>
 What was your first flight like? 
</P>
<P>
 That was a busy flight. I tried to conserve the altitude-control fuel which 
had been exhausted on John Glenn and Scott Carpenter's flights. I did so well 
at it, I think I had 80% of the fuel left and that permitted Gordon Cooper to 
go up for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Describe your White House visit after your Sigma Seven flight? 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, son and daughter and I were sitting there in the Oval Office; it was 
the Cuban Missile Crisis that very day. (President) Kennedy was so cool, and he 
asked my daughter how old she was and she held up five fingers. He said, "Do 
you want to see Macaroni?" That was Caroline's pet horse out in the Rose 
Garden. It was amazing how cool the man was with this crisis going on around 
him. That has shown up in a number of history books. 
</P>
<P>
 What was the Gemini 7 flight like? 
</P>
<P>
 That was my favorite mission ... the first time a rendezvous was ever done and 
it was done so well. It was done to perfection. Up until then we came in second 
to the Soviets. They had the first space walk. They had the first multiple 
crew. They had the first man in orbit. The first woman in orbit. So suddenly, 
about all we could do was compete for duration, which we started doing, and 
even then we didn't win. But they had never done a rendezvous and they didn't 
do that kind of rendezvous for another 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 What about your head cold on Apollo 7? 
</P>
<P>
 That was a bad deal. There were no symptoms prior to the flight, which was 
kind of interesting. Then it developed within about 24 hours, maybe 48 hours, 
as a screaming head cold. We had Actifed (in the capsule), which many years 
later my daughter, now older, called the 10-day cold capsule. The producer of 
Actifed said, "Would you do the spokesman role since you used Actifed?" and I 
said, "Sure." I had a lot of fun with it. SUSAN KING

 TRACKING THE VANISHING TREE FROGS: An Ecological Mystery by Kathryn Phillips 
(St. Martin's Press: $22.95; 244 pp.) They're disappearing, the foothill 
yellow-legged frogs, the common bullfrogs, the Yosemite toads, Cascade frogs, 
leopard frogs, and western toads. One half of the 21 species native to 
California are in decline. Herpetologists from all over, perplexed at the 
continued disappearance of species that had been on the planet for between 150 
and 200 million years, met in February 1990 in Irvine, California and exchanged 
anecdotes. From there, several, including the two scientists that Phillips 
travels with, Mark Jennings and Marc Hayes, went on to document the probable 
causes for the disappearance of several species. Development, acid rain, 
deforestation and pesticide poisoning are probable causes. But the most likely 
cause emerging from available data is ozone depletion and climate change. 
Scientists measuring stress caused by increased exposure to UV-B radiation 
found that frogs could respond to and avoid it in the lab but not in the wild. 
Their body temperature is regulated by their environment, and unfortunately, 
they like to sunbathe! Still other experiments showed the immediate effects of 
increased radiation on eggs and tadpoles. While many claim that there is 
insufficient evidence that frogs can serve as "bioindicators" -- canaries in 
the rapidly warming coal mine we all live in -- that speculation is not 
entirely unfounded. Like Douglas Hand in "Gone Whaling" (above), Phillips 
shows, along the way, the difference between the leaders or pioneers in a field 
(often scientists not attached to institutions), and the followers.Jennings and 
Hayes were successful in their efforts (against a recalcitrant U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service) to get at least one species, the California red-legged frog, 
listed as threatened, but "a 1990 audit by the U.S. Department of the 
Interior's Inspector General found six hundred candidates that the Fish and 
Wildlife Service deemed eligible for listing had not been listed. 'During the 
last ten years,' the audit said, 'at least thirty-four animal and plant species 
have been determined to be extinct without ever having received full benefit of 
the (Endangered Species) act's protection." Canary in the coal mine or not, 
they aren't the only species that likes to sunbathe.

 We're in agreement with Mr. Hall's (TV Times, June 26) opinion that the older 
situation comedies are far superior to most of the current ones. We recently 
went to cable and thoroughly enjoy seeing again the older "Mary Tyler Moore," 
"Bob Newhart" and "Dick Van Dyke" shows. I had forgotten how genuinely funny 
they are.

 HOUSE OF SPLENDID ISOLATION by Edna O'Brien (Farrar Straus & Giroux: $21; 232 
pp.) Splendid. A two-edged word if there ever was one.In this house history and 
myth and superstition and regret simmer under the floorboards. The almost 
unbearable pain and disappointment of the woman who lives there is relieved for 
a brief time by an Irish nationalist hiding and resting under her unwilling 
roof. Because this is Ireland, specifically the war in Ireland, everyone you 
become attached to in this novel will suffer, be haunted by his or her doubts, 
and be persecuted by some barbaric past involving unspeakable cruelty. The 
nationalist, McGeevy, supposedly an inscrutable killer, saw his 30-year-old 
wife gunned down with their baby (who later died of heart trouble) at her 
breast. The woman, an innocent new wife, watched her own heart harden under the 
unconscious tutelage of a blunt, violent, alcoholic husband. By the time 
McGeevy seeks refuge in her house, she is in her middle years, alone. But all 
this violence will not evaporate, it gets passed on, and this is what O'Brien 
captures so unobtrusively: the senseless continuation of pain.

THE MOUSE AND THE SNAKE, BY VIKRAM SETH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One fine morning two small mice, 
</P>
<P>
 Much against their friend's advice, 
</P>
<P>
 Visited a room where grain 
</P>
<P>
 Undisturbed for months had lain. 
</P>
<P>
 Other mice had entered; none 
</P>
<P>
 Lived to eat and tell -- not one. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two friends, unpoliced, 
</P>
<P>
 Broke in and began to feast; 
</P>
<P>
 And their laughter fell and rose, 
</P>
<P>
 Till their blood with horror froze. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold and shiny, vicious, long, 
</P>
<P>
 Venom-fanged, hypnotic, strong --  
</P>
<P>
 Slid a snake towards the pair, 
</P>
<P>
 Swallowed one right then and there, 
</P>
<P>
 Hissed obscenely at the other: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first; and here's another!" 
</P>
<P>
 And, when she stood shocked and still, 
</P>
<P>
 Sprang at once to make his kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Glared at him, and twitched her nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time he slid or sprang, 
</P>
<P>
 Dripping venom from each fang, 
</P>
<P>
 Out beyond his reach she leapt, 
</P>
<P>
 Till the snake, grown tired, crept 
</P>
<P>
 To his hole, slid first his head, 
</P>
<P>
 Then his gleaming, overfed 
</P>
<P>
 Trunk in, so that just his tail 
</P>
<P>
 Jutted out to thrash and flail. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift as rage the little mouse 
</P>
<P>
 Rushed towards the killer's house, 
</P>
<P>
 Bit his tail once, twice, again, 
</P>
<P>
 Clung to it till, wild with pain, 
</P>
<P>
 Hissing wrath, the snake backed out, 
</P>
<P>
 Swerved his body round about, 
</P>
<P>
 Lunged towards the mouse and tried 
</P>
<P>
 Swallowing her -- but she leapt wide 
</P>
<P>
 Every time he lunged, till he, 
</P>
<P>
 Wriggling back exhaustedly, 
</P>
<P>
 Slid inside his hole once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, exactly as before, 
</P>
<P>
 Down she clamped with might and main 
</P>
<P>
 On his tail till, mad with pain, 
</P>
<P>
 Yet again the snake emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 This the battle ebbed and surged 
</P>
<P>
 And the mouse fought on and on 
</P>
<P>
 Till her strength was almost gone 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the snake, without a sound, 
</P>
<P>
 Spat the dead mouse on the ground, 
</P>
<P>
 And, with mangled slither, stole 
</P>
<P>
 Unopposed into his hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the mouse came up and cried 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter tears for her who'd died. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeaking sadly, and bereft, 
</P>
<P>
 Corpse in mouth, she sobbed and left. 
</P>
<P>
 This was seen by Mr. Yang. 
</P>
<P>
 When his friend the poet Chang 
</P>
<P>
 Heard the mouse's story later, 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to commemorate her, 
</P>
<P>
 As he walked back to his house, 
</P>
<P>
 He composed "The Faithful Mouse" --  
</P>
<P>
 Where in elegiac metre 
</P>
<P>
 He extols the Snake-Defeater 
</P>
<P>
 And in couplets sad and stoic 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrates her acts heroic --  
</P>
<P>
 Acts that prove that shock and pain, 
</P>
<P>
 Death and grief are not in vain --  
</P>
<P>
 Which fine lines, alive or dead, 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the mice has read.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A New Jersey baby -- his mother (Karla Tamburrelli)l dead and his father 
(Michael Ontkean, in a devilish change of pace) in the slammer for her murder 
-- is the center of a fierce custody case waged by embattled relatives in the 
engrossing 1991 TV movie In a Child's Name (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m., concluding 
Tuesday at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Suburban Commando (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a likable but mostly frowzy action 
comedy-fantasy about a repressed architect (Christopher Lloyd), his smiling 
wife (Shelley Duvall) and a Han Solo-style outer-space adventurer (Hulk Hogan) 
who rents their suburban apartment and promptly demolishes every troublemaker 
in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Night of the Hunter (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a mediocre 1991 TV movie remake of 
the classic 1955 chiller "The Night of the Hunter," affords Richard Chamberlain 
a radical departure from past roles. But as a demonic phony preacher, he is 
rarely sinister enough to be truly convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Babe (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.), a 1992 Arthur Hiller-John Fusco movie, 
misses the essence of its subject: home-run prodigy George Herman (Babe) Ruth. 
John Goodman is a good Bambino, but watching this movie, with its careful 
period decor, sincere direction and sanitized script, is like catching a game 
where the players are always bunted from base to base. 
</P>
<P>
 The mostly engaging 1993 TV movie For the Love of My Child: The Anissa Ayala 
Story (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), made with understanding and care, explores the 
sometimes conflicting feelings that swirl around a family when one of its 
members is stricken with a potentially deadly disease. Ayala (Teresa DiSpina) 
is the leukemia-stricken 16-year-old whose parents conceive another child in 
the hope that it will provide a suitable match in a potentially life-saving 
bone-marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy (KCOP Friday at 8:30 p.m.), The Who's celebrated rock opera, was treated 
as a wretched excess in this 1975 Ken Russell extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Thunder (KTTV Saturday at 6 p.m.), a chilling 1983 close-up look at 
police helicopter Big Brother surveillance, is technically impressive, but its 
basic disregard for human life is its undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Extremities (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a serious, nonexploitative 
story of a woman (Farrah Fawcett), twice the victim of a rapist, who turns the 
tables on her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine Things (NBC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is very slow going, a 1990 TV movie about 
a department store executive (D.W. Moffett) who falls in love with a woman 
(Tracy Pollan) only to suffer through her cancer death and then tangle with his 
stepdaughter's vicious real father. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirably offbeat and quite engaging, the 1989 Listen to Me (KABC Saturday at 
9 p.m.) focuses on a high-ranking, small-college debating team coached by a 
hard-driving Roy Scheider, but its finish is disturbing in its implication that 
what counts is effectiveness of presentation -- in this instance, shameless 
grandstanding -- rather than the substance of the argument.

 Once in a lifetime, each of us should spend a month on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 To be on crutches is a cruelly edifying excursion into the small places in the 
human heart. 
</P>
<P>
 To be on crutches is to learn what it is to be Otherly Abled Like Me. 
</P>
<P>
 To be on crutches is to see behavior that may not qualify for the Seven Deadly 
Sins but certainly ranks high among the Ten Unpleasant Attributes, like: 
</P>
<P>
 Callousness. Those who treat you as if you were invisible, letting go of a 
door as you hobble madly to catch it while it is still open . . . or who resent 
that you are far too visible and lean on the car horn as you struggle to climb 
or descend from the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruel wit. I've heard everything from "How'dja get that, at the Nordstrom 
sale?" to "You're too old for the Olympics/surfing/that kind of sex." 
</P>
<P>
 And cupidity, cupidity, cupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sue 'em," said a couple of lawyers I know (the only lawyers I know). "You 
should sue those guys," said the attendant, who came out to pump my gas at the 
self-serve island when he saw my impedimenta. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers yammered at me from the midday television set, promising that even if 
my broken foot was my fault, even if I had been driving with a burlap bag over 
my head or tap-dancing down the stairs of a red-tagged condo in Northridge, 
someone owes me money. This, after all, is America. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, it wasn't my fault, and the medical bills are already paid. My 
only pain and suffering has been answering "What happened to you?" 20 times a 
day. And once I gave up telling the drab truth and relied on increasingly 
fanciful answers ("It's nothing, really. Nelson Mandela just stepped on my foot 
at the South African inaugural ball"), it was rather fun. 
</P>
<P>
 What has stayed with me longer than my injury is how the lawsuit has become a 
part of modern social relations. It is the nasty flip side of our American 
faith in perfectibility; if something is not perfect, it's somebody's fault, 
someone must pay. 
</P>
<P>
 An old friend broke his ankle dancing at his own birthday party, and even as 
paramedics carted him away, party-goers were advising him -- some not entirely 
in jest -- to sue the hostess who had organized the gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrageous California lawsuits are what comedians resort to when they run out 
of jokes: burglars who have sued and won for falling through a skylight or 
tripping on a skateboard in the places they were burgling, and a motorcycle 
thief who took a header in a furrow and collected a half-million from the 
farmer because the plowed field wasn't posted as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 These absurdities feed the clamor for tort reform and endanger legitimate 
lawsuits that punish the caveat-emptor practices of the careless and 
avaricious. Patent medicine was a history of cut-and-run, quick-buck buccaneers 
until the law and crusading journalism and the FDA arrived on the scene. 
Sometimes the only way an arrogant company learns a lesson is by counting all 
the zeros on the check it has to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some things are no one's fault. Not all babies are born perfect, 
despite the best intentions and efforts. Should a valuable vaccine be abandoned 
because a statistically, tragically predictable few children get ill and die? 
How many other children should go unprotected because of that? Where is the 
trade-off? 
</P>
<P>
 Me, I don't think I'll sue. 
</P>
<P>
 But a conciliatory gesture would have been nice. Lunch from a different 
restaurant every day, delivered as I sat immobilized at my desk. And a sedan 
chair and four strong men to carry me home through the streets like a 
Restoration duchess. Surely that's not too much to ask, when the right lawyer, 
the right jury might have gotten me $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 I did, however, get something for my pains, something the TV-PI lawyers could 
never have wrung out of any jury. After a month on crutches, I had biceps like 
Spaulding tennis balls.

 I can't imagine a newspaperman, when writing up an ongoing news event, saying, 
"We have just discovered a new twist on this item, so get the next edition for 
the full story."Yet on the TV channels, they do it all the time. The 4 o'clock 
news gives out blurbs about what's coming up at 5 o'clock, and at 5 o'clock, 
what's coming up at 6 or 11 -- no doubt to try and keep us watching. It seems 
to me what they, the station, already know at 4 o'clock should be shown or told 
at 4 o'clock. Then it would be, as they say, "News as it happens."

 THE NORMANDY DIARY OF MARIE-LOUISE OSMONT: 1940-1944 introduction by John 
Keegan (Random House: $17; 118 pp.) This is a brave woman, intrepid. Between 
August 1940 and August 1944, her home, Chateau Periers, only three miles from 
Sword Beach, the center of the D-Day invasion front, was requisitioned, first 
by the Germans from the 716th Infantry Division, and then by the British from 
the 3rd Infantry Division. She found the Germans tired, serious, melancholic 
and very decent. She found the British, for the most part, boisterous, 
imperious and inconsiderate. The Germans bring two things that offend Madame 
Osmont's sensibilities: "kitchen girls," and " 'that thing' -- a framed picture 
on the second floor-a life-size Hitler!!! Horrors!" The British, unfortunately, 
steal -- everything from knives to lipstick. At age 50, Madame Osmont does not 
complain, expresses her fear in only the most straightforward, practical way 
and is, at worst, discouraged, particularly the day after landing (June 7): 
"Suddenly everything's erupting, everything's falling around me, I feel a 
painful blow to the small of my back. I see balls of fire a few meters in front 
of me. I raise my head instinctively and catch sight of an airplane falling in 
flames. . . . I try to calm myself. Blood is running down my face. . . . I am 
horribly sad." Days later, Osmont has a friend remove the shell fragments from 
her spine: "Oof! . . . I'm delighted to be rid of it." She marvels how, weeks 
before, life had seemed so different, with German soldiers sunbathing on the 
lawn.She bicycles, despite the warnings of the authorities, into the completely 
shattered nearby town of Caen. In one of the book's photographs she is cradling 
a very hefty goose, in another she is wearing a fashionable hat and looking 
demurely and defiantly at the camera. "Men are capable of anything," she 
writes, half in awe and half in disgust, "but alas, only to destroy!"

 BECOMING NATIVE TO THIS PLACE by Wes Jackson (The University Press of 
Kentucky: $20; 121 pp.) There are a few writers, thinkers and scientists, like 
Wes Jackson and his friend Wendell Berry (whose praises are sung throughout 
"Becoming Native"), who try periodically to readjust our way of seeing our 
relationship to nature. They believe that, without some vision of that 
relationship, efforts such as recycling and what Jackson somewhat sarcastically 
calls "smart resource management" are not deep enough to head off a 
fast-approaching disaster. These are my words, not Wes Jackson's, who, I am 
sure, approves of recycling. Jackson writes from his home in Kansas, where he 
sees evidence of generations abandoning their rural homes for the city and 
farmers increasingly unable to use and live with the land the way their 
ancestors could. "The universities," he writes, "now offer only one serious 
major: upward mobility." Science, with its Cartesian focus on the parts, not 
the whole, assures its smug practitioners that "the world operates by the same 
method they use to study it." Descartes contributed the assumption that "humans 
are the . . . only real repository of mind and consciousness." Kant contributed 
the "notion that our senses tell all. . . . Any other possible realities behind 
or beyond our senses can never be known." What can we do? Jackson is not long 
on suggestions. "America does not need jobs that depend on an extractive 
economy," he tells us. "We could begin by accepting our profound ignorance," he 
tells us.I nod vigorously all the way through this book, as I always do with 
Wendell Berry. I am grateful for the reminder. But I worry that books like this 
make us comfortable with our own demise. When we are shrieked at and made fun 
of for our wasteful unconscious ways some door slams shut, and we settle in for 
the long sleep.

 GONE WHALING: A Search for Orcas in Northwest Waters by Douglas Hand (Simon & 
Schuster: $20; 223 pp.) "I live in New York City now and I like it here," 
writes Douglas Hand, "but I have to tell you this story." That's his opening 
sentence, and he keeps up the combination of simplicity, humility and humor all 
the way through. Hand's trail, which begins with a killer whale totem pole 
carved by a Haida indian in the American Museum of Natural History, spent God 
knows how many months asking total strangers why they were driven to make 
whales the focus of their life's work, be it science or wood carving. My take 
on it is that Hand was driven to the whales because the whale is his totem 
animal and his spirit animal. He would probably laugh. I practically did 
writing it, but there it is. He never once says anything of the kind, but he is 
led so uncoincidentally from one storyteller to another, and is able to come at 
our fascination with orcas from so many different angles. Why killer whales? he 
asks each person he interviews. After a litany of reasons given to him by one 
scientist, from their wildness to their power, Hand responds: "You could also 
just say, they eat until they're full. Then they stop." Why killer whales? Hand 
asks Dr. Murray Newman, director at the Vancouver Public Aquarium. "It's a very 
symbolic animal," Newman replies blandly.Doug Ford, curator of marine mammals 
and an expert on killer-whale communication, keeps a similar distance. "Are 
they being creative when they make up a new call?" Hand asks. "Creative? No," 
says Ford. Hand visits Ken Balcomb, head of the Center for Whale Research, also 
in Vancouver, where he sees his first whales close up. "Did you have a good 
encounter?" one of the volunteers asks him. "I hadn't felt the illumination," 
Hand responds honestly, "I hadn't crossed the line." "To us," says Sam, a 
Nimpkish Indian Hand meets on a ferry, "they're people. . . . All animals can 
transform themselves to human form. They're very much like us. It has enough 
food, so it's a very good life. It's a sensual life. I think that's the way the 
Nimpkish used to live." Food was always very plentiful, so we had time to 
play." Back in New York, reflecting on the Haida carving, Hand wonders: "Where 
does one creature end and the other begin?"

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; NICKELODEON AND THE 'TEMPLE' OF 
TREASURE MIX HISTORY AND GAMES

 Indiana Jones may have found adventure in his "Temple of Doom," but today's 
kids are having fun their own way in Nickelodeon's Legends of the Hidden 
Temple, which caromed into its second season in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Boasting a huge, jungle-like set, complete with moat and temple filled with 
treasure and booby-traps, the show offers contestants a chance to demonstrate 
both physical prowess and mental acuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of kids perform various tasks -- starting with a challenging trip across 
the moat -- and answer historical questions relating to "legends" told by the 
show's icon, Olmec. Through a process of elimination, two teams of two end up 
vying for the treasure at the end of the maze-filled temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to make history so exciting that kids don't even realize they're 
in the middle of an educational experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it 'edu-tainment,' " say producers Scott Stone and David Stanley, who 
make up Stone Stanley Productions ("Funhouse" and "Shop 'Til You Drop"). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like 'Funhouse' at a theme park," says Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just reached into the history of legendary people so we could base the 
show in fact and combined it with games and stunts that were fun to watch," 
says Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
 Each show sets up a hunt for a fabricated "legendary" item, such as the pig of 
Amelia Earhart, the giant nose ring of Babe (Paul Bunyan's ox), the golden 
pepperoni of Catherine de Medici or, the yellow snakeskin boots of Billy the 
Kid. 
</P>
<P>
 During each show, the contestants, age 10 to 14, plow through a maze of 
challenges -- each of which changes daily -- that include climbing, catching, 
throwing, running and a combination of all four. Mind-benders test how much 
kids remember of the "legends" recited by the 6-foot-tall head of Olmec. The 
Mayan god, made of foam rubber and brought to life with the voice of Dee Baker, 
explains the competitions and tells the stories the kids must remember to win 
the brain part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get a real winning team if you have, say, a brainiac kid and a strong 
one, or kids who are a combination of both," offers host Kirk Fogg, who calls 
the play-by-play. 
</P>
<P>
 The sets and games aren't "just thrown together," assures Stanley. "We really 
want to make sure all things work, so we build prototypes, test with adults and 
then build it in final form, take it to Florida -- since the show is shot at 
Universal Studios Florida -- and test it again, this time with kids to see what 
the skill is needed to win. But there's agility needed, too." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really designed the show for channel surfers, for the MTV kid audience," 
says Stone. "That's why the temple changes, the games change, everything 
changes to keep their interest. Each of the games are only one minute long so 
something new is always happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes on recent shows have included televisions and VCRs, sleeping bags and 
camping equipment and skateboarding gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants come from the Orlando, Fla., area, and are sought in ads placed in 
local papers. Area schools also send young hopefuls and occasionally a 
contestant is plucked from the studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legends of the Hidden Temple" airs weekdays at 5:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. 
Another Family Show 
</P>
<P>
 If your kids are tired of parties at McDonald's, Chuck E. Cheese's or the 
local miniature-golf park, tune in to Monday's Home Matters (1:30 p.m. 
Discovery) for a feature on "Birthday Parties for Children." Marla Edelstein, 
associate food editor of Parents magazine, gives some creative ideas for having 
your child's birthday party at home. For parents.

ALSO STARRING; MR. HEY NOW; JEFFREY TAMBOR FINDS HIS NICHE SITTING IN WITH 
GARRY SHANDLING 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

Calendar.

 Jeffrey Tambor has developed great respect for Ed McMahon. Now that he's into 
his third season as Garry Shandling's sidekick on HBO's "The Larry Sanders 
Show," he's learned something of the art of, well, just sitting there. 
"Basically, your whole job is to support," says Tambor, whose previous series 
included "Max Headroom," "American Dreamer," "Mr. Sunshine" and "9 to 5." "It's 
a great responsibility to stay focused, to know when to talk, to know when to 
take it. And mostly, you have to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Tambor, with his balding head and familiar face, is one of those character 
actors people have recognized for years. But it's the role of Hank Kingsley on 
the hippest cable series around -- which takes us backstage at a late-night 
talk show -- that has really locked him in many viewers' minds. "I just did a 
film in North Carolina," Tambor muses, "and even there, people at the stores 
were yelling, 'Hey now!,' his character's signature phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor feels it's Kingsley's many facets, his unpredictability, that hit 
home. Despite some arrogance and seeming buffoonery, there's a lot more there. 
"All the characters on the show are layered, which I love," he says. "My 
concept of Hank is that he's an absolute professional as an announcer and an 
absolute amateur in life. And while he has a buffoonish aspect to him, you're 
always wondering if he just wants to be seen that way to get off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved with casting Hank knew when Tambor first read that they had 
found their man. "Jeffrey is a very strong actor, and he's turned Hank into 
someone you look forward to every week," says Brad Grey, one of "Larry Sanders' 
" executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
 More of Hank's layers will be revealed this season. "We'll explore a darker 
side of Hank and you'll have greater insights into how he thinks," says Grey. 
Show fans will continue to see in Hank deeply rooted, and probably unfulfilled, 
ambition, a theme many can relate to. "Oh, I think in his deepest recesses he 
probably thinks he can do Larry Sanders' job better himself," says Tambor But 
that sort of naivete helps offset the times he can be a prima donna and a bit 
dismissive. He's a guy who chooses when he's aware and not aware." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Tambor himself was aware of was the obvious quality of "The Larry 
Sanders Show," something apparent when he read the first script. At the same 
time, he was offered two other network series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I held out for this one," he says, "because I just felt it would be 
successful. It also appeals to the voyeur in us. Everyone wants to know what 
David Letterman is whispering to a guest just as they go to commercial. Our 
show answers that question." 
</P>
<P>
 After appearing in numerous network series that didn't succeed, Tambor also 
has responded positively to working for a cable show. 
</P>
<P>
 "HBO keeps saying, 'Kick it out, take risks,' and so the show is irreverent. 
It will pass by many laughs to get to the one good laugh," he says. "There's a 
bit of danger to it. I'd truly rather be on cable, because the whole frame of 
reference, what you can say and not say, is greater. There's just an attitude I 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 A calm, unusually secure man out of character, Tambor harbors no bitterness 
about past failures on television, except one. "The only one I ever said, 
'Dammit, it's too soon," when it was canceled, was 'Max Headroom'," says the 
man who played newsroom director Murray in the cult 1987 show set in a 
TV-dominated future. "The show was way ahead of its time." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, everything feels completely in balance for the actor who lives with 
his wife, Katy, in Sherman Oaks (he has a 20-year-old daughter from a previous 
marriage). He reads voraciously, teaches acting, works out daily on the 
life-cycle in his office, makes movies in between shooting "Larry Sanders" 
(three this past year) and, basically, just loves this job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think an actor gets maybe four or five roles in his life that just fit," 
says Tambor. "Hank and I are both reaching our 50th year at the same time, and 
the merger works. And being on this set, there is so much laughter and a kind 
of randomness, sort of like a party. You feel like you work hard, but it 
doesn't feel like hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 It's work he wanted from the age of 10 when, as a youngster, he would walk 
across the street from his San Francisco home to the local college and watch 
the theater department in action. "It just seemed very exciting to me," he 
says, "to do things on stage that you could never do in life. There certainly 
was no history of show business in my family except that we are Hungarian 
Russian Jews. And with that comes a lot of theatrics." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Larry Sanders Show" airs Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m. on HBO.

 No one likes hassles with the government. They're inconvenient, time consuming 
and unnerving. But they're practically a raison d'etre for Scott McMillan, 
founder of BLAM! -- the Bivens Legal Action Movement. BLAM!, whose motto is 
"Better Government Through Litigation," is named for Webster Bivens, the 
plaintiff in a landmark 1971 Supreme Court decision that federal employees can 
be held personally responsible for violating an individual's constitutional 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 BLAM! was born in 1991 after McMillan ran into a series of snags with U.S. 
Customs agents at the San Ysidro border crossing. McMillan, a computer products 
importer, was used to the grillings he got from agents, but one day, agents 
searched him and told him to empty his wallet. They confiscated it, saying it 
was made from an endangered crocodile species. McMillan says he pursued all 
legal remedies to recover the wallet, which was made from a legal reptile. He 
got nowhere, so he filed a lawsuit against the agents, which is still going 
through the courts (though he did recover his wallet), and started BLAM! 
</P>
<P>
 "Most citizens haven't read the Constitution -- or read it only when they were 
in high school," says McMillan, 30, who learned legal research from his father, 
an attorney. "So when folks are mistreated by government agents, they don't 
often know their rights." 
</P>
<P>
 With BLAM!, he aims to change that. Each month about 40 people meet in San 
Diego to get information on filing their lawsuits; most of them don't have an 
attorney. About 150 people across the country are on the BLAM! mailing list and 
members have 20 lawsuits percolating through the courts, including one accusing 
a government official of assault and another demanding a return of property in 
a forfeiture case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few cases to have reached the trial stage involved Nancy Halus, 58, 
a pharmacist from Valley Center, who sued the San Diego County Assessment 
Appeals Board over its appraisal of her home. The case was dismissed on a 
technicality, but she appealed and the U.S. District Court granted her the 
right to refile. She decided not to pursue the suit because it had already been 
too time-consuming. But, she says, "I wouldn't have known how to proceed 
without Scott's help." 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't accept less than excellence from our government," McMillan says, "but 
it probably won't happen in my lifetime." Sharon Whitley

 Michael Connelly's third novel, THE CONCRETE BLONDE (Little, Brown: $21.95; 
392 pp.) achieves a kind of crime fiction hat trick. Like his award-winning 
debut, "The Black Ice," and last year's "The Black Echo," the new one is a 
police procedural of crackling authenticity. But it is also a courtroom drama 
worthy of any of those from the current crop of lawyer-novelists. And finally 
it is a cunningly conceived mystery in which, in the Agatha Christie tradition, 
a series of quite convincing suspects are set up and cast aside before the 
ultimate perpetrator is revealed. (And a surprising but acceptable jolt it is.) 
</P>
<P>
 Harry (short for Hieronymous) Bosch, Connelly's LAPD homicide detective, is on 
trial -- a civil case -- for killing a suspected serial killer during an 
investigation four years earlier. The nude and unarmed man was, as it turned 
out, reaching under a pillow for a toupee instead of a weapon. The widow is 
suing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosch remains confident he got the right man, but a subsequent killing with 
the same characteristics is a gift to the tough prosecuting attorney, a woman, 
suggesting Bosch shot the wrong man in another instance of police arrogance and 
brutality. (Rodney King hovers over the trial.) 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly, who left daily journalism at The Times to concentrate on his novels, 
has created in Bosch a good, stubborn, perceptive, independent-minded cop who 
is neither a super-hero nor a burned-out case (although his life could stand 
improvement). 
</P>
<P>
 When Bosch can get away from the courtroom, he explores the new case (a woman 
encased in concrete), following a tenuous track into the sad and gamy 
half-world in the San Fernando Valley where porno filming and prostitution 
meet. Among its several virtues, the novel is vigorous, tautly suspenseful and 
finally confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a rare while, Connelly strains for a Chandleresque touch (an empty 
house has windows "as empty as a dead man's eyes"). Far more often, his prose 
has the elegant accuracy and sensitivity of superior reportage. 
</P>
<P>
 He writes with anger as well: "Through political ineptitude and opportunism, 
the city had allowed (the LAPD) to languish for years as an understaffed and 
underequipped paramilitary organization . . . top-heavy with managers while the 
ranks below were so thin that the dog soldiers on the street rarely had the 
time or inclination to step out of their protective machines, their cars, to 
meet the people they served." 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly joins the top rank of a new generation of crime writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Muller launched the present wave of women writing about women as 
sleuths with Sharon McCone in "Edwin of the Iron Shoes" in 1977. Still less 
celebrated than Sue Grafton or Sara Paretsky, Muller quietly keeps getting 
better and better. 
</P>
<P>
 In McCone's 15th outing, TILL THE BUTCHERS CUT HIM DOWN (Mysterious Press: 
$18.95; 339 pp.) Muller has split from the San Francisco legal cooperative 
where she was the investigator to open her own firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first client is a hustler she knew on campus in the '60s, when he peddled 
exam questions, ghosted essays and controlled substances out of a battered 
suitcase. He became Suitcase Gordon, in fact. Now he's a so-called turnaround 
man, grown rich by moving in to rescue failing corporations by ruthless firings 
and closures, making platoons of enemies in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 He says one of the enemies is out to kill him. True enough. His Mendocino 
coast home is blown sky-high, with a victim inside. McCone, herself in jeopardy 
early on, explores Gordon's past in a Nevada ghost town he saved, a 
Pennsylvania steel mill he didn't, a San Francisco dockyard still in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller has not previously created so wide and varied a canvas, nor so 
extensive a cast of characters. At 39, McCone is newly thoughtful about her 
life -- a mix of boredom, danger and loneliness. Her love is a man often absent 
on mysterious errands, though you feel that in revealing a little more of him 
in each book, Muller is efficiently setting up stories yet to come. She is 
ready for much larger audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Victorian novel was thought skimpy if, after serialization, it did not 
fill three hard-cover volumes. In modern one-volume editions, Anthony Trollope 
runs well beyond 800 pages without getting winded. Elizabeth George, enamored 
of all things British from her Orange County perch, appears to have a 
comparable Victorian itch. 
</P>
<P>
 Her seventh novel, PLAYING FOR THE ASHES (Bantam: $21.95; 624 pp.) is of 
near-Trollopian dimensions, outdistancing "A Taste for Death" by P. D. James 
(another neo-Victorian in her spaciousness) by some 200 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 A torched cottage in Kent proves to contain the charred remains of a leading 
cricketer, Kenneth Fleming, a Mickey Mantle of the greensward and the white 
flannels. (The ashes of the title are the symbolic trophy of the 
England-Australia test matches.) 
</P>
<P>
 The novel alternates between chapters of a report being written by a woman 
named Olivia, who is dying of Lou Gehrig disease, and other chapters told in 
the standard third-person omniscient. The investigators are the lordly Thomas 
Lynley, as before, and his working class aide, Det. Sgt. Barbara Havers. It 
reveals the leisurely expansiveness of the George style that she requires nine 
pages simply to establish Havers' new residence, even before Lynley calls to 
say there's work to be done. And much later, as we await, doggedly, for the 
denouement, we must pause while Lynley and his lady go for a long jog in the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 The result seems to be a kind of mystification -- obfuscation, really -- by 
style, and I was reminded of an aside the comedian Bobby Clark tossed at the 
audience during his revival of "Sweethearts:" "Never was a thin plot so 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming proves to have been quite a player, with an estranged wife and at 
least two mistresses. The difficulty for the reader (one, anyway) is that 
neither Fleming in retrospect, nor the women, nor the other menfolk who rise 
and fall as suspects, are very interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 To cite another memory evoked by the book: The late Lord Boothby once remarked 
that the British, never having been a particularly religious people, had 
invented cricket to provide themselves some conception of eternity. Just so. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolas Freeling, the English-born novelist now living in Strasbourg, takes 
quite a different tack. His YOU WHO KNOW (Mysterious Press: $18.95; 192 pp.) is 
hardly longer than a novella, but as always it is such an allusive, elusive, 
elliptical, richly internalized trip with his Inspector Henri Castang that it 
is as richly satisfying as a full meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Castang, now doing bureaucratic work at the European Community in Brussels, is 
puzzled by the murder of a likable Irishman who also worked at the Community. 
With no valid police credentials, Castang noses around in Ireland, then in the 
Italian Alps, where a woman on the same pursuit is gunned down almost at his 
side. The Irishman was, not least, a lover; what else he was and was not 
Castang seeks to discover. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of all things, a master criminal, oddly named Subercaseaux, lurking 
about, subtler but not much less lethal than those 007 met, and his 
confrontation with Castang, on a boat in an Alpine lake is a showdown 
conducted, as you might say, in killing words. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeling writes like no one else. There is an astonishing amount of action and 
suspense in the novel, given its brevity. Yet its charm is in its musings, its 
adroit wit, its acknowledgment of values, including love, friendship, honor, 
loyalty and, to be sure, justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Castang's Czech wife Vera is herself a fully realized character, a 
free-speaking delight whose perceptions can be unexpectedly helpful to her 
husband. They both notice "how the most complicated things in life become 
simple. Like dying." And Castang, the most civilized of policemen, can 
acknowledge the blunt instrument of police reasoning and add sardonically, 
"Never mind all this rubbish of music and poetry." Wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 A new voice of unexpected origin arrives this month. John Armistead is said to 
be a Baptist preacher in Tupelo, Miss. In A LEGACY OF VENGEANCE (Carroll & 
Graf: $21; 256 pp.), Armistead writes of a series of killings of black men -- 
the first a preacher -- whose motivation appears to lie in the tumultuous civil 
rights struggles of the Mississippi 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't remember a sleuth who is forever chewing Red Man tobacco, but in this 
aspect of Sheriff Grover Bramlett as in all his observances of the state's 
rural hill country, Armistead is right on target. 
</P>
<P>
 A mysterious white Pontiac, untraceable, seems to be the carrier of death. 
Bramlett himself, who infiltrated the Klan as an FBI spy in the '60s, begins to 
suspect his cover has been blown and that he himself is on the hit list of 
whatever white supremacists are seeking the long-delayed vengeance. Indeed, the 
sheriff and his wife are in peril, but Armistead has some clever and plausible 
plot twists in hand, and nothing is quite as it appears. 
</P>
<P>
 The prose is occasionally stiff, especially when Armistead is conveying 
thought processes, but he tells a strong story and has made a strong debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Rankin is a Scots writer, living in Edinburgh, London and France. He 
writes about an Edinburgh detective named John Rebus. In HIDE AND SEEK: A John 
Rebus Mystery (Otto Penzler Books: $21; 210 pp.), Rebus confronts the murder 
(by rat poison-enriched heroin) of a young addict who had been living as a 
squatter in an abandoned housing project. Dying, the addict has told a 
girlfriend "They've murdered me." The who and the why are unusually baffling. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rankin's swift procedural, Rebus, a rough-cut diamond who would be a hard 
man to work for as his underlings discover, arrives at last at a posh gambling 
club with special and perverse activities in the basement that attract 
Edinburgh's major power figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedural becomes a large, slam bang caper whose ending is and is not 
satisfying, with its breathtakingly cynical view of the recuperative abilities 
of a power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Taylor Bland is one of the small but slowly growing number of black 
writers of crime fiction, and one of the very few women. Her Marti MacAlister 
is a police detective, who is black, in a small Illinois city closely 
resembling Waukegan, where Taylor lives. Marti is a widowed mother, formerly on 
the Chicago force. 
</P>
<P>
 In GONE QUIET (St. Martin's: $19.95; 224 pp.), an unpleasant old man, a 
tyrannical father and husband, has been found dead in bed, suffocated despite 
the appearances of heart failure. Almost anyone who knew him is a suspect, 
including his long-suffering wife. Bland's book is as much a study of a 
dysfunctional black family as a police investigation, but on both accounts it 
is closely observed, carefully written and admirable, Marti a sympathetic 
witness to black life in the community.

GOOD 'VOODOO' OR LOUNGE-LIZARD TIME?; ***; THE ROLLING STONES, "VOODOO LOUNGE" 
( VIRGIN ); THE REVIEW; GETTING BACK TO BASICS, THE STONES AGAIN SOUND RELAXED 
AND ENTHUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first studio album in five years, the No. 1 or No. 2 greatest band ever 
in rock wastes no time in trying to start us up. Almost immediately in the 
opening track, you hear the sensual guitar swagger that has been the Rolling 
Stones' trademark for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the theme of the song, "Love Is Strong," is quintessential Stones 
flirtation. Coos Mick Jagger: A glimpse of you was all it took / A stranger's 
glance it got me hooked . 
</P>
<P>
 The band's galloping, drum-driven rhythm is just as quickly evident on the 
next two songs -- both of which have titles with the inviting, call-to-action 
imagery long favored by the band: "You Got Me Rocking" and "Sparks Will Fly." 
</P>
<P>
 No question about it: The Stones -- almost two dozen albums down the line and 
with bassist Darryl Jones replacing Bill Wyman -- can still do the Stones 
better than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing here is likely to give fans who grew up with the British band in the 
'60s and '70s the same kind of lasting emotional rush as the recordings, from 
"Satisfaction" to "Honky Tonk Women," that defined the renegade side of 
blues-flavored rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 No way, either, are the Stones going to compete with Pearl Jam or Nine Inch 
Nails in trying to examine the alienation and anger of today's teens and 
twenty-somethings. 
</P>
<P>
 But social introspection has never been the band's primary interest or weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the '60s, the debate over whether the Stones are the greatest rock 
band ever has hinged largely on whether you want music with the stamp of 
artistic ambition and statement (the Beatles) or whether you want it to simply 
rock and roll you (the Stones). 
</P>
<P>
 For longtime fans who opt for the latter, the new album's basic, 
straightforward approach should evoke memories of the band's classic days more 
positively than anything the Stones have delivered since "Tattoo You" 13 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For today's MTV crowd who may be fuzzy on their Stones history, the album has 
more inviting, blues-rock authenticity than anything they have heard in recent 
years from such Stones-influenced groups as Aerosmith, the Black Crowes and 
Primal Scream. 
</P>
<P>
 There are echoes in "Out of Tears" of the Stones' early love for such R&B 
torch songs as "Time Is on My Side," while the harpsichord shading of "Lady 
Jane" is saluted in "New Faces." The latter is a tale of a woman being tempted 
by a younger man -- the reversal of common male rock obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 The male roving eye does surface in "Brand New Car," which features a wickedly 
lecherous vocal by Jagger. On the country-flavored "The Worst," Richards sings 
in a dark, menacing tone that is equally evocative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweethearts Forever" suggests a Drifters-era R&B innocence, while "Blinded by 
Rainbows" is a reflection on terrorism that is the album's most ambitious 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the 62-minute journey (long enough in the old vinyl days for this 
to be a double album), the band sounds more comfortable than it has in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Every superstar act, from Michael Jackson to Prince ( especially Michael 
Jackson and Prince) reaches a point where the artist's energy shifts from 
making challenging music to maintaining cash flow. The goal is no longer music 
that is purposeful or heartfelt, but that will work in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Stones, heaven knows, have been guilty of turning out 
albums that can be more easily described as product than passion. Some rock 
purists have even argued that the Stones should have thrown in the towel back 
in 1970 when the Beatles did. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Stones' history belittles that suggestion. Three of the band's most 
stirring works came in the '70s: "Sticky Fingers," "Some Girls" and the 
landmark "Exile on Main Street." (All three have just been re-released in 
remastered CD collections by Virgin Records,along with five others from the 
group's Atlantic and Columbia days). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite moments in "Voodoo Lounge" when the band falls too predictably within 
its long-established boundaries, the band shows generally that it still has the 
desire and skills to disarm us in sometimes subtle and surprising ways. For the 
first time in ages, you wish that you could have been in the studio watching 
the whole thing go down.*

THE ROCK BEHIND ROCKEFELLER; ABBY ALDRICH ROCKEFELLER, BY BERNICE KERT (RANDOM 
HOUSE: $30; 537 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ted Berkman, Ted Berkman's books include the Mickey Marcus biography, Cast A 
Giant Shadow, and To Seize the Passing Dream, a biographical novel of James 
McNeill Whistler. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bernice Kert demonstrated in "The Hemingway Women" an eye for offbeat 
biography. This time she brings us Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the patrician 
rebel who breathed humanity into the somber Rockfeller clan, advanced the 
causes of working women and minorities, and by founding New York's Museum of 
Modern Art left a lasting imprint on the American cultural scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Kert's penetrating close-up captures not only a remarkable personality but the 
suffocating nuances of post-Victorian matrimony; women readers in particular 
will relish Abby's refusal to be pigeonholed. If Kert occasionally sacrifices 
pace to detail, a rich collection of personal letters -- assiduously 
researched, adroitly dovetailed -- soon puts her narrative back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of a prosperous U.S. Senator, Abby Aldrich in 1901 married into a 
family whose assets made hers look like petty cash. Her husband, John D. 
Rockefeller, Jr., was the only son of the legendary oil baron, raised in 
isolation, robotically programmed to continue his father's global benefactions. 
A billionaire before he was forty, John staggered under the double burden of 
riches that all but defied expenditure, and a stern Baptist religiosity that 
occupied his conscience every waking moment and through many a sleepless night. 
His personal needs neglected, he was a timid, insecure suitor who predictably 
became a remote father and an exacting, controlling husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But Abby saw -- and loved -- the tormented boy beneath; gave him the physical 
fulfillment and intellectual companionship he desperately craved; and somehow 
satisfied her own yearnings for expression while walking the delicate tightrope 
of their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Abby Aldrich Rockeller's immersion in modern art began on a European gallery 
tour with her discovery of the German Expressionists. Captivated by the 
intensley personal credo of such pioneers as Kathe Koilwitz and Lyonel 
Feininger, she plunged into serious collecting. Few modernists of talent, at 
home or on the Continent, escaped her eager scrutiny, although at first only a 
relative handful, thanks to John's watchful eye, wound up in her collection: 
John Sloan, Winslow Homer, Arthur B. Davies, and in minor manifestations 
Picasso and Matisse. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pleasures of fine art, Abby felt, should not be reserved for the 
wealthy. In the spring of 1929 she rounded up a coterie of like-minded women, 
persuaded a personable Ivy League gallant to front for them in a male-dominated 
art milieu, and set about the arduous task of raising money for a modern art 
milieu, and set about the arduous task of raising money for a modern art 
museum. Step by step, with Abby directing from the sidelines, the operation 
inched forward, from a temporary base on West 57th St. to an opening in 
November with a loan exhibit from France. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Abby hobnobbed happily with William Zorach and the sculptor's 
radical wife Marguarite, entertained Matisse at dinner, and engaged the fiery 
Diego Rivera to create a huge mural for Rockefeller Center -- all under the 
increasingly critical gaze of her husband. John had no patience with modern 
art; Jackson Pollock's tortuous drippings offended his sense of no-nonsense 
discipline. To spare John irritation, Abby tucked away her prints and canvases 
in a lofty ghetto of their nine-story town house. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even this opposition she overcame; John gradually increased her art 
allowance. Her final victory in their tug of war over the MoMA came when he not 
only helped to pay off its sizable mortgage but turned over a prime piece of 
midtown real estate to accommodate its outdoor sculpture garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Kert makes a somewhat sluggish start, reeling off ancestral names and dates 
with a kind of clinical detachment. She hits her stride as the newlyweds come 
into focus: John, if not cast in the ruthlessly acquisitive mold of his father, 
nonetheless the personification of cautious capitalism; Abby instinctively 
open-minded, a champion of the underprivileged, drawn to art and artists. Where 
John was shy, reclusive, harnessed to his Bible classes and his inheritance, 
Abby was avid for life, trained in the social graces as her father's frequent 
hostess in Washington, receptive to people of every economic class and ethnic 
origin. How to pursue her passion for women's rights while wrapped in the purse 
strings of a pathetically neurasthenic billionaire? 
</P>
<P>
 Her one weapon, astutely but never callously wielded, was her husband's 
near-absolute emotional dependence. For all of his domestic tyranny, John was a 
fragile creature who shrank from contact with his five sons and was hopelessly 
at odds with his one daughter. Jealous of their children and his wife's other 
interests, he plotted constantly to keep her at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 A large woman of stately bearing, Abby was hardly the dainty sprite intimated 
in John's courtship letters. What he apparently found irresistible was her 
tireless joie de vivre. yet even with her he could not always surmount his 
ingrained formality. Although the two lived under the same roof and shared what 
Kert assures us was an active bed, when John raised his wife's living allowance 
he did so in a terse businesslike memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
 Kert has had the good judgment to explore the family correspondence and -- and 
the good fortune to strike gold there. Abby's letters convey the woman: To her 
three eldest sons in 1923: "One of the greatest causes of evil in the world is 
race hated or race prejudice...The two peoples...who suffer the most in this 
country are the Jews and the Negroes." 
</P>
<P>
 To Charles Eliot, former president of Harvard, in 1925 affirming her 
membership on the Board of the Rockfeller-backed International House in 
Manhattan: "I am deeply interested in the problem of making better 
international relations. If the future leaders of the world are brought 
together while they are still young, (perhaps) there will be an understanding 
that will make world peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Abby spearheaded the construction of the low-cost for-women-only Dodge Hotel 
in the capital, and established a community house for immigrant employees near 
the Jersey Standard plant in Bayonne. And she opened her purse regularly to 
settlement houses, the United Jewish Appeal and Margaret Sanger's American 
Birth Control League. 
</P>
<P>
 Kert compounds a dearth of vivid physical description, cluttering her 
landscape with lifeless detail ("on July 10 (Abby and John) checked into the 
Hotel Crillon in Paris for eight days") that could have been winnowed out by a 
more vigilant editor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Abby Aldrich Rockefeller emerges intact. "Had she been a man," according 
to the architect Philip Johnson, "she could have commanded an army;" under 
other circumstances, her powers of persuasion might have landed her in the 
Senate. Yet her greatest strength was her character. If Abby had been married 
to one of the Rockfeller oil field hands instead of to the kingpin himself, one 
feels she would have held to the same principles and promoted the same values. 
That she happened to run the household and influence the decisions of the 
wealthiest man in America was a windfall for the rest of us.

 Claudia Folska runs a bike-related company and spent hundreds of hours on 
bikes over the past year in preparation for a tandem trip across the country. 
But she insists she's not a serious cyclist."I'm just a regular Joe who happens 
to be blind," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Folska, 29, is the founder of Santa Monica-based Eyecycles, which pairs blind 
and sighted cyclists for weekend tandem rides. Last year, Folska hit on the 
idea of "Eyecycles Across America," a less-intense version of the Race Across 
America, to promote recreational opportunities for the visually impaired. She 
enlisted 10 tandem teams that trained with three-time RAAM champion Cindi 
Staiger. Folksa trained with Karen Adkinson, who would "captain" the bike while 
Folska rode in the "stoker" position. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, disaster. Their major sponsor dropped out, so the other 18 riders 
couldn't go. Then their mechanic backed out. But Adkinson and Folska cobbled 
together donations from companies big and small, and on May 1, they left from 
Santa Monica City Hall. Gerry Tatrai, winner of the 1993 RAAM, was watching: He 
joined them on the spur of the moment, abandoning a ticket back to his home in 
Australia. And they began their 3,200-mile ride across America. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling with a support van, they kept a 100-plus-mile-a-day pace, with 
Adkinson and Tatrai alternating as captain. They rode through killer head 
winds, drenching storms and "murderous heat," finally arriving in Washington, 
D.C., on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "All along the way we met people who were visually impaired. They said, 'Wow, 
how about that! You've inspired us,' " Folska says. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the point. "When you're disabled in this country, you don't have role 
models in the mainstream media. I wouldn't exactly identify with Ray Charles or 
Stevie Wonder." Judy Raphael

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; THE TIN PAN MAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The carwash is an excellent place for Angelenos to network, get their shoes 
shined and pick up a nifty air freshener. But to change your life? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened to singer Richard Halpern one day in 1981. He was hanging 
around a carwash in Palos Verdes when he spotted a cassette entitled "Al 
Jolson: 20 Golden Greats, Volume 2." He bought it and stuck it in his car 
stereo as soon as the car was dry. 
</P>
<P>
 From that moment on, the former show tune singer has dedicated his life to 
resurrecting the songs of Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Fanny Brice and other Tin Pan 
Alley unforgettables from the earliest days of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't write melodies like that anymore," Halpern says. "The most 
beautiful melodies that have ever been written in American popular music came 
out of this period -- the teens and, especially, the '20s. And the lyrics, it 
was poetry, definitely more so than today, like telling a story in song." 
</P>
<P>
 Halpern tells those stories in cabarets and clubs around town, including the 
Derby in Los Feliz and the Atlas Bar & Grill on Wilshire and Western. In 
September, he'll resume his weekly show, "Richard Halpern's Speakeasy," at the 
Radisson Hollywood Roosevelt's Cinegrill. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure his performances sound authentic, Halpern combs music archives to 
make sure he's got everything just right. "I get such a thrill from performing 
from the same arrangement Jolson used," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow cabaret performer Buck Winston adds, "When Richard compliments my 
arrangements, I know that I'm on the mark, because Richard knows." Mari 
Florence

SPIES, SATELLITES AND SEX; THE FIST OF GOD, BY FREDERICK FORSYTH (BANTAM: 
$23.95; 560 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Cullen, Robert Cullen's most recent novel is Cover Story, just 
published by Atheneum. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to tell exactly what Frederick Forsyth had in mind when he 
started "The Fist of God." 
</P>
<P>
 He clearly wanted to write an op-ed piece of sorts, warning his readers about 
the dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation and the need for great powers to 
maintain a robust network of human spies, even in the post-Cold War era. In 
fact, just to make certain no one who reads the novel misses these points, 
Forsyth supplies an appendix in the form of an essay in which he spells them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is madness for the thirty most industrialized developed nations of the 
world, who dispose between them of ninety-five percent of high-tech weaponry 
and the means for its production, to sell these artifacts to the crazed, the 
aggressive and the dangerous for short-term profit," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. No one watching the gathering crisis in North Korea would be 
inclined to argue. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth's devotion to the preservation of the secret agent's brotherhood is a 
little harder to support in light of espionage fiascoes like the Aldrich Ames 
case. Outside of the genre novel, it's not so clear that the intelligence 
gathered by human spies justifies the enormous cost. But since Forsyth clearly 
has friends in the brotherhood, his view is not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth apparently also wanted to write a technical history of the Persian 
Gulf War of 1991, and in this he succeeds brilliantly. Page after page is given 
over to lucid, thoroughly researched descriptions of the weapons systems and 
communications technology that won the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Among many other items, he gives the best concise explanation I have yet read 
for why the Patriot missile failed to stop most of the SCUD warheads thrown by 
Iraq at Israel and why, in the end, it hardly mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach Israel, the Iraqis had to modify the SCUD supplied by the Soviet 
Union, adding range at the expense of payload. This jerry-building meant that 
the rocket tended to disintegrate as it descended toward its target. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriot was programmed to respond to this confusion by seeking out and 
destroying the biggest piece of the SCUD it could see, which in most cases was 
the missile's spent fuel tank. But the good news was that the warheads that got 
through were too small to cause much damage. The SCUD was largely a 
psychological threat, and the Patriot was largely a psychological response. It 
did its real job, which was to keep Israel out of the war and thereby preserve 
the coalition of Western and Arab nations arrayed against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth chose to package all of this erudition in the form of a thriller, and 
in this he was somewhat less successful. The book has characters aplenty; it 
begins with the Tolstoyan three-page dramatis personae that lists only the 
important ones. But few of these characters are engaging and almost none have 
more than two dimensions. Forsyth's idea of character development is to have 
one character read the resume of another, listing the schools and regiments he 
has passed through. 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings are not, in the end, as important to the story as governments and 
weapons are. Forsyth spends much of the first 50 pages discoursing on the late 
Gerald Bull and his advanced cannon technology. Only after this is complete 
does he get around to introducing his hero, an Arabic-speaking commando in the 
British Special Air Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth has fortunately not forgotten how to structure a plot. This one 
involves the conjecture that Saddam might indeed have developed a nuclear 
weapon just prior to Desert Storm, secreted it in a camouflaged mountain 
fortress, and prepared to fire at the advancing allied troops, using the big 
cannon technology developed quietly for Iraq by Bull. The successful 
prosecution of the war hinges on whether the Allies can find and destroy this 
weapon before the land war begins. Clever spies, communications satellites, 
reconnaissance technology and high-tech weaponry, as well as money and sexual 
wiles, are all bent to this end. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers who can remember the headlines from February, 1991, will know the 
outcome. But Forsyth spins a story so well that they will keep turning pages to 
find out exactly how it was done.

 THE SHIPPING NEWS by E. Annie Proulx (Touchstone: $12.; 337 pp.) Proulx won 
both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for this quirky novel about 
a two-bit reporter discovering the redemptive power of love.A lumpish bear of a 
man, Quoyle hides a gentle heart within his bulk; a heart that was cruelly 
abused by his promiscuous wife, Petal Bear, "a curious equation that attracted 
many mathematicians." After her death, Quoyle moves with his two daughters and 
aged aunt to his ancestors' home in a remote Newfoundland village. Sheltered by 
the tiny community, he learns that love is not necessarily linked to misery. 
Proulx's staccato, fragmented prose captures the repressed feelings of the 
latently talented Quoyle, who rises above the people who ridicule him in an 
oddly heartening story.

 TALES OF THE EARTH: Paroxysms and Perturbations of the Blue Planet by Charles 
Officer & Jake Page (Oxford University Press: $10.95; 226 pp., illustrated). 
Officer and Page examine the destruction caused by volcanoes, earthquakes, 
hurricanes, floods -- and humans.The clouds of dust, gas and ash produced by 
the eruption of Tambora in Indonesia turned 1816 into "The Year Without A 
Summer" in Europe and North America. However, mankind has done even greater 
damage to the Earth, exterminating species, burning forests and ruining land, 
often irrevocably. The authors conclude their thoughtful attempt to place 
ecological concerns in an understandable context by restating the need " . . . 
to learn to live in harmony with the planet and its resources, not simply to 
plunder and overrun it."

 UNTIL YOUR HEART STOPS by T. M. McNally (Ivy: $5.99; 289 pp.) . McNally's 
novel about the repercussions of a high school student's suicide reads like two 
imperfectly joined novellas. The students of the Arizona school strive to 
comprehend the loss of their friend as they struggle with usual teen-age 
crises. The teachers and administrators face problems of their own, but the two 
worlds don't quite mesh, and the resulting book is more notable for its flashes 
of insight than its successful examination of a sensitive subjective.

 LUMBER GHOSTS: A Travel Guide to the Historic Lumber Towns of the Pacific 
Northwest by Kenneth A. Erickson (Pruett: $16.95; 132 pp., illustrated, 
paperback original). During late-19th and early-20th Century, dozens of small 
towns sprang up around the mills of the big timber companies in Oregon and 
Washington. Today, their crumbling buildings and bare foundations stand as the 
timber industry's equivalent of Ozymandias's Colossus: fading monuments to 
vanity and greed. Erickson offers detailed maps and notes for six trips for 
travelers curious to explore ruins that would still be habitable if their 
founders had practiced sustainable-yield silviculture.

 BARBIE IN FASHION edited by Renee Klock (Abbeville: $10.95; 327 pp., paperback 
original). As millions of parents have learned over the last 35 years, Babie's 
wardrobe can be almost as expensive as a real daughter's. The 300 outfits in 
this mini-album date from 1959 to 1989 -- from the Jackie Kennedy look to 
MTV-influenced styles. Women who had the dolls as children will enjoy this 
slightly campy anthology, as will students of fashion curious to see what has 
been considered chic yet acceptable by middle-class America.

 VOLUNTEER SLAVERY: My Authentic Negro Experience by Jill Nelson (Penguin: 
$9.95; 244 pp.) . Nelson joined the Washington Post in 1986, but soon 
discovered that the predominantly white male staff expected African-American 
journalists to be more than writers: "Not only must we function as reporters, 
but we are also ambassadors from that colored catchall, Black America, 
explaining and justifying not only ourselves but also the mythical, monolithic 
'black community.' " At the same time, Nelson was also searching for an 
"authentic" African-American experience, rejecting her upper-middle-class 
background as brummagem. Her sardonic account of a quest for journalistic and 
ethnic integrity displays the grace and resilience she drew from a difficult 
life.

 SCISSORS, PAPER, ROCK by Fenton Johnson (Washington Square: $10.; 226 pp.). 
Johnson's tale of the intergenerational problems of a rural Kentucky family is 
less a novel than a series of linked short stories.Tom, the embittered 
patriarch of the Hardins of Strang Knob, is dying of cancer; Rose Ella 
stoically endures marriage to Tom and the deaths of two children. Elizabeth, 
the youngest daughter, struggles to establish herself outside her parents' 
influence; AIDS claims Raphael, the youngest son. The fate of the Hardins is 
bound to the mysterious spinster, Miss Camilla, who links the past as people 
choose to remember it with the more prosaic reality: "What matters are not the 
facts (disputable at best) but the stories they inspire, and our hearts' need 
for creating and preserving these stories to pass on . . . "

<P>
 Perhaps because it is the most quintessentially American of Hollywood genres, 
the Western is proving to be surprisingly durable both on the screen and on the 
page. And while current films leave a certain amount to be desired, two new 
books on the subject couldn't be bettered. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the Western food chain were the dozens made by the great John 
Ford, films like "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon," "Wagonmaster," "Rio Grande," "The 
Searchers," "Two Rode Together" and "Cheyenne Autumn." Harry Carey Jr., whose 
father was one of the preeminent Western stars of the Silent Era, was in each 
of those Ford movies, and his splendid memoir of working with the master is an 
indispensable book on this most accomplished filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Gifted with close to total recall, Carey does not allow his great love and 
respect for Ford to cloud his memory or his judgment of the man he's always 
called Uncle Jack. He shows us the humor, the sentiment and the sadism of a 
director who could personally break an actor's ribs (Carey's) when the spirit 
moved him. "You're going to hate me when this picture is over, but you're going 
to give a great performance," Ford told Carey before their first film together, 
and this graceful book is the next best thing to being there and watching it 
all happen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the cowboy spectrum were the B Westerns, the 2,000 or so 
low-budget "oaters" made from the 1930s through the 1950s. They may not have 
been artistic, but they sure could be fun. The key book on the subject, 1976's 
"Hollywood Corral" by Don Miller, has long been out of print. This new volume 
reprints it in its entirety and does a whole lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the new edition is illustrated with more than 400 carefully 
chosen photographs, including such playful oddities as Joan Crawford coyly 
posing with Tim McCoy in a scene from 1928's "Law of the Range." It has added 
an extensive annotated bibliography, comments by Gene Autry and Roy Rodgers 
and, most impressive, 16 newly commissioned essays on aspects of the field that 
Miller's book didn't quite get around to. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most interesting of the new essays are Robert S. Birchard's 
examination of what a movie cowboy's day-to-day life in Hollywood was like Karl 
Thiede's careful dissection of B Western finances and Dave Holland's Baedeker, 
complete with directions, to the key sites where the Bs were filmed, so fans 
can saddle up and check them out for themselves. Kenneth Turan

SELF-HELP 2000

<TEXT>
<P>
 A response to a book review by Dick Roraback on "The Celestine Prophecy" ("In 
Brief," May 15). 
</P>
<P>
 Books like "The Celestine Prophecy" are much needed to counteract fear-based 
ideas, while this review seems to exemplify the negativity illustrated in the 
book.It contains more information and is easier to read than most self-help 
books. The abstract fictional story can attract readers interested in novels, 
adventure and fantasy, while also teaching important concepts. Who knows -- one 
slight shift for one individual could affect many others.

 Roraback missed the point! This is a parable clothed in a fantastical 
adventure. I liked the book very much and it has made quite an impact on me and 
my friends. We are striving to put its non-new but worthy principles to work to 
improve our lives. I'm thrilled that it's on the best seller list because it 
means that many people are striving to become more human and to create 
much-needed harmony on this planet, if not by 2000 AD, then as soon as 
possible.

L.A. WITHOUT BORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read Charles Champlin's "The View Through the Private Eye's Windshield" (May 
29) with interest, but several things about the article puzzled me. One was the 
inclusion of Ross Macdonald among those writers "inspired by the city (of Los 
Angeles) to a remarkable prose-poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 I share Champlin's admiration for Macdonald, who not only wrote fine crime 
novels but was a fine writer, period. No one else has described the greed, 
anxiety, and overall spiritual emptiness of suburban California so well. But 
Macdonald did not write Los Angeles crime novels, unless one wants to include 
Santa Barbara, San Diego County, and even the San Joaquin Valley among L.A.'s 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Macdonald did not live in Los Angeles, and made no pretense of 
understanding it. Like any good writer, he wrote about things that he knew. 
Santa Teresa, the setting of so many of his novels, is a thinly disguised 
version of Santa Barbara, his home. Pacific Point, where most of the others are 
set, is a fictional coastal town half-way between L.A. and San Diego. "Find a 
Victim" is set in a mythical Central Valley city that strongly resembles 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing that puzzled me was the omission of James Ellroy from the list 
of significant L.A. crime writers of today. Champlin has every right to dislike 
Ellroy's work, but ignoring the L.A. Quartet series was petty.

 Am I missing something? In your L.A. nostalgia pieces ("It's Only L.A., Jake," 
May 29) no article mentioned James M. Cain. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was away from my home in L.A. while in the military service 
(1948-1952), I had my L.A. fix (which I needed badly when stationed in Texas, 
New Jersey and Korea) by reading Cain.

 I realize the impossibility of including a snippet from every author whose 
thoughts on L.A. became words on a page. But hey -- I know an oversight when I 
don't see it. For me, no writer has ever vitalized Los Angeles better than 
Christopher Isherwood. 
</P>
<P>
 When by the end of your selection I still didn't see his name, a sudden wave 
of dismay made my Sunday smog gray. Almost every page has L.A. as its 
subliminal theme, mysterious, sensuous, glamorous, ridiculous, enigmatic, 
obvious, awesome, plain, strange, elusive, intimate, infinite . . . A paradise 
of paradox. Hooray for Isherwood!!

REMEMBERING BERT MEYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Miles' beautiful tribute to the poet Bert Meyers ("Secrets of a Teacher," 
May 29) evokes a host of emotions in me. 
</P>
<P>
 Being remembered as an inspirational teacher would certainly gratify Bert, 
even as it would make him bray with self-deprecating laughter. Bert was first, 
last and always a Poet. His poetry is his enduring legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 I know. I grew up with Bert. Our world was East Hollywood in a neighborhood of 
frame bungalows, weedy vacant lots and quiet streets. The 1940s Hollywood we 
knew had little resemblance to Raymond Chandler's Hollywood, nor John Rechy's, 
nor Nathanael West's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California we knew was benevolent. It encouraged a 
live-and-let-live tolerance of differences. (Nobody really gave a damn if a 
person chose to be a poet, a sidewalk philosopher or a streetcar conductor.) 
The environment and the times permitted a poet like Bert to seek and find his 
own voice without undue pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 In junior high school, Bert, the gentle poet-to-be, was a time bomb ready to 
explode any time he was mishandled. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school (John Marshall, not Belmont, never Belmont!) Bert was a surly 
kid, a loner, a gymnast who scorned the society of gymnasts; a poetry lover who 
avoided the student intellectual fringe. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school our friendship deepened. The Hollywood we embraced was 
populated by would-be writers, by art students and dancers, by dreamers, 
eccentrics and fools -- it was a fine environment for an embryo poet like Bert. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert's Hollywood and mine consisted of bookstores and bungalow parties, 
second-run movie houses and coffee shops, long walks through the length and 
breadth of our hometown -- and poetry. Bert's obsession with writing and 
reading poetry was awesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Except in the underground culture, poets hardly rank in the hierarchy of 
Hollywood society; but in that underground culture, Bert Meyers was 
well-respected and admired long before his migration to Claremont and his 
subsequent role as teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 I miss him. I guess I always will. 
</P>
<P>
 LEONARD HYMEN, OJAI 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Bert Meyers was not only a teacher at Pitzer College but one of L.A.'s finest 
poets. Unfortunately, Bert's poems have been out of print for some time. He 
published as many as six books of poetry before his untimely death at 51 from 
lung cancer. Unlike many poets publishing books today Bert did not rush into 
print, but, as careful with his poems as he was with his frames, he applied 
each word to a poem as if applying gold leaf to a frame. He was known to us as 
poets in L.A. as a fine poet who died far too soon. The well known poet Robert 
Bly did announce some time ago that he was going to publish a book of 20 poems 
by Bert Meyers. It is truly unfortunate that such a reprinting of some of these 
poems has so long been delayed. But I do hope that more people will know of him 
now that Jack Miles has written his article about the fine poems he heard read 
in Claremont.

 The feminine ideal ever changeth. When women with sharp angles offend the eye, 
weight -- not waif -- becomes the object of desire.Then fashion cinches the 
corset or raises the hemline. Suddenly, thin is in and synonymous with beauty 
again. And women who set their worth in inverse proportion to their girth tread 
the slippery slope to Jenny Craig. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, top fashion models wear sizes 2, 4 or 6. But the truth is, the average 
woman is 5-foot-4 and 145 pounds. In fact, half of all American women today 
wear size 14 or larger, subscriptions to Big Beautiful Woman (where I'm the 
executive editor) approach a quarter-million and sales of plus-size clothing 
have hit $12 billion a year. It's comforting, too, that some medical research 
minimizes the health risks of moderate weight gains later in life. That could 
mean an extra 20 pounds might not be so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 So enough with the diets, the fasting, the low self-esteem. Women would do 
better to eat nutritionally, exercise regularly and take a hint from the 
world's great artists, who have always appreciated the sensuality, intelligence 
and strength of a healthy woman, no matter what her dress size. Here, in 
re-creations of some of their paintings, no model is smaller than a size 16. 
Life can be grand. JANEY MILSTEAD

THE BLANC PAGE; AT TOMMY HARASE'S NEW CAFE, NOW IN BEVERLY HILLS, THE FLAVORS 
FILL THE TINY ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tiny cafe is not much bigger than a shoe box, its simple glass facade 
trimmed only by a bleached canvas awning with the name "Nouveau Cafe Blanc" 
stenciled in black. Quietly, very quietly, Tommy Harase has reopened Cafe 
Blanc, which closed in late 1991. His new 12-table restaurant is only a smidgen 
larger than the first, but this time it's in Beverly Hills instead of the old 
neighborhood near Beverly and Vermont. While other entrepreneur-chefs rush to 
open big restaurants with upscale fast food and theme-park pizazz, Harase keeps 
going his own sweet way. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pleasure to sit down in the simple white room and let this young 
Japanese chef cook for you. His idiom is fresh, light French cooking, filtered 
through a stripped-down Japanese sensibility. Flavors are bright and unfussy, 
products carefully chosen and the prices almost too modest for this caliber of 
cooking. Customers who know him from the old place worry just a little. He 
could at least raise the corkage fee, a longtime fan fretted one night. 
</P>
<P>
 Muffled murmurings and stirrings come from the kitchen that is set at an angle 
to the room. A narrow band of glass frames a stack of plates, the top of the 
cook's head, a rack of wineglasses. Two paintings are hung side by side on one 
wall; on another, a flat white sculpture looks like a bubble bath trailing the 
tub stopper and chain, but who knows?  
</P>
<P>
 Lunch and dinner at Nouveau Cafe Blanc are different experiences. Open just 
three weekdays for lunch, the cafe features a short menu of salads, pastas and 
fish and poultry dishes. At dinner, the menu is prix fixe only. They're both 
delicious bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunchtime, the place feels like a neighborhood cafe where customers might 
end up chatting with the person at the next table. "How was your Chinese 
chicken salad?" asks a sociable woman as she steadies her shopping bags on a 
chair. It's terrific -- soft, wrinkly Napa cabbage tossed with nuggets of 
roasted chicken, curly endive and wisps of bitter greens. Fine threads of 
deep-fried potato give it some crunch; the creamy dressing is beautifully 
balanced and blissfully not too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar salad "flower arrangement" looks gimmicky at first: tender inner leaves 
of romaine tucked upright into a short, hollowed-out length of baguette 
encircled with Parmesan shavings and ribbons of dressing. Tip it over, the 
ponytailed Japanese waitress advises, and then mix everything together, 
breaking the "crouton" with your knife. It works. The piquant dressing, livened 
with fresh garlic, is just enough to coat the leaves, with nothing left over. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a refreshing grilled chicken in a ponzu sauce strewn with pine 
nuts, capers, fresh mint and basil, pasta in a subtle fresh tomato sauce or a 
special of northern halibut in an herb vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, Harase pulls out all the stops with a five-course prix fixe menu at 
either $29 or $38. Each course has at least two choices; occasionally he'll add 
an extra selection, like the buttery soft-shell crab I snatched up one night. 
As soon as you sit down, before you've ordered a thing, the waiter will bring 
out a "palate teaser" appetizer. One night it was a pure-tasting tartare of 
salmon and scallops served with perfect little toasts; on another, a tangle of 
enticing crab salad to savor while looking over the wine list. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fine little list with very fair prices. A good match with first courses 
and fish dishes is a German Riesling, like the off-dry 1992 Kabinett from R. 
Weil in the Rheingau ($17.50). The 1992 California Pinot Noir from Au Bon 
Climat's Talley Vineyard ($21) is well suited to poultry and meat dishes. And 
once the wine is ordered, there are only a few more choices to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewels of marinated vegetables or the wild mushroom terrine of the day? That's 
easy. Take the marvelous slab of terrine, a complex composition of gray and 
tan, made with four kinds of mushrooms. Or splurge on the more expensive menu's 
sauteed foie gras with fine slices of ripe pear. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoked squab with orange burgundy sauce or steamed black mussels with shallot 
cream? That's difficult. The squab is tender, rare, with a seductive smoky edge 
that plays well against the sweet-tart sauce. But I just might lean more toward 
the bowl of small, delicately steamed mussels swimming in a delicious bath of 
mussel broth, cream and shallots.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, there's a salad of mixed baby greens with a few slender chives that, at 
first bite, seems to be missing its dressing. It's there, but just barely. Or 
you can opt for the rich lobster bisque with a shock of cool thick cream to one 
side.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the main courses can be slow to arrive because only Harase and his 
assistant are in the kitchen. But the food is worth the wait. The Norwegian 
salmon, with its crispy skin, garnish of salmon roe and a graceful pesto and 
cream sauce intrigues with contrasts of texture and taste. The farm chicken in 
a coriander-laced tomato sauce is less interesting. But the roasted duck, 
beautifully carved and served on an oversized platter with a glaze of sweet 
tangerine-orange that has a bitter citrus edge, is good enough to order two 
times over.  
</P>
<P>
 Just sit back and enjoy as the carefully thought out menu comes to a close. 
You don't have to decide a thing. Harase might send out a bar of chocolate 
"terrine" that tastes like an updated brownie, a scoop of rich ice cream, or a 
feathery light cheesecake. Dessert, like everything else at this lovely little 
cafe, is the chef's own "sweet surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Nouveau Cafe Blanc, 9777 Little Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills; (310) 
888-0108. Closed Sundays and Mondays; also Saturday through Tuesday at lunch. 
No reservations at lunch. Parking in city lot or parking structure. Dinner for 
two, food only, $58 to $76. Corkage , $5.

ON THE RECORD: 'FRANCK CIRCLE': WHAT GOES AROUND . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to believe that Cesar Franck's Symphony in D minor vied with 
Beethoven's Fifth in frequency of performance by American and European 
orchestras from the turn of the century until World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Symphony, and the rest of Franck, have virtually disappeared from concert 
programs. But there's something brewing on recordings: not so much the 
reappearance of his music as that of his disciples, the so-called "Franck 
Circle," made up of his stellar pupils: Ernest Chausson (1855-1899) and Henri 
Duparc (1848-1933). Vincent d'Indy, once the best known of the group, is having 
his recorded innings as well, perhaps to offset the inevitable 75th recording 
of "Pictures at an Exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
 All three composers imbibed Franck's complex application of French formal 
logic to Wagnerian chromaticism. Chausson and Duparc made a better job of it. 
They had the lyric gift and the passion that d'Indy -- perhaps even Franck 
himself -- lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Symphony in B-flat, completed in 1891, Chausson created a work that is 
Franckian in its melodic cast, but with the addition of rhythmic vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 The case for Chausson's Symphony, which has long had a cult following, is 
convincingly argued by Eduardo Mata and his former orchestra, the Dallas 
Symphony (Dorian 90181). 
</P>
<P>
 Their performance is at once elegant and vigorous. It also projects the 
elusive element that might be called "style." It moves at a smart clip but 
never rushes, and Mata encourages his responsive string players to employ 
portamento in the pursuit of expressivity, which is impressively achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Symphony is coupled with the best-known orchestral works of Jacques Ibert 
(1890-1962), his gaudy-pretty musical travelogue, "Escales," and his 
gaudy-dumb-satirical "Divertissement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henri Duparc was, unlike Chausson, long-lived but even less prolific, limiting 
his output largely to the "Melodies," written when he was in his teens and 
early 20s and among the glories of the art-song literature. 
</P>
<P>
 All 17 are presented by the redoubtable Jose van Dam, who has clearly explored 
their every musical and textual cranny. But this stage of his career -- he was 
53 last year, when the recording (Forlane 16692) was made -- finds his dark 
baritone too weighty to negotiate the more sinuous curves of this music. 
</P>
<P>
 Duparc's songs, the 13 published during a lifetime that saw him suffering from 
a series of nervous ailments and eventually blindness and paralysis, are more 
subtly and satisfyingly delivered by baritone Bernard Kruysen in the first CD 
appearance (Valois 4703) of a 23-year-old recording. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruysen hardly has Van Dam's power or steadiness, but he does have the 
flexibility and delicacy to make the greatest of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruysen is sympathetically seconded by pianist Noel Lee, whereas Van Dam gets 
merely non-specific accompaniment from Maciej Pikulski. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Franck himself is represented by two vastly differing interpretations of what 
may be his most durable creation: the Sonata in A for violin and piano. 
</P>
<P>
 A young Anne Akiko Meyers plays it with attractively firm, focused tone -- but 
also rather stiffly, with the concurrence (instigation?) of her pianist, Rohan 
de Silva (RCA 612830). 
</P>
<P>
 Gidon Kremer and his collaborator, Oleg Maisenberg, give the impression of a 
first, enraptured encounter with the score, bending rhythms and tempos at will 
(Chant du Monde/Praga 250 024). 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers and De Silva couple Franck with the young Richard Strauss' effusive 
Sonata, while Chant du Monde allows us a rare encounter with Franck's sole 
String Quartet, a huge, endearingly over-ambitious creation most of whose worth 
is contained in the vast opening movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Its performance by the Prague Quartet is grandly heated and expansive, a 
perfect match for the colorful Kremer-Maisenberg take on the Sonata and, like 
it, a treasure from the archives of Prague Radio.*

 MUSSORGSKY: "Songs and Danses of Death"; arias by Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin, 
Rubinstein and Rachmaninoff. Dmitri Hvorostovsky, baritone; Kirov Orchestra; 
Valery Gergiev, conductor.Philips 438 872-2. The young Russian would seem to be 
on a roll. Following his splendid "Onegin," here is a brilliant collection of 
mostly unhackneyed songs and arias. The perfectly equalized, multicolored sound 
may be a bit light for Mussorgsky, but his delivery is blazingly dramatic. He 
brings the same commitment to the arias, especially excerpts from "The Demon" 
and "Sadko." The "Igor" aria lies rather low for him, but he manages a 
thrilling climax nonetheless. Evident everywhere, but most notably in the 
"Aleko," are exemplary enunciation and extraordinary breath control. Gergiev 
and his orchestra provide a cushion of supportive sound any singer might pray 
for. WALTER PRICE

 SAMUEL BARBER: The Complete Songs. Cheryl Studer, soprano; Thomas Hampson, 
baritone; John Browning, piano; Emerson String Quartet. Deutsche Grammophon 435 
862-2.These 47 songs include 10 from various archives unpublished until now. 
Barber, who died in 1981, was a conservative who cared little for changing 
fads. A baritone himself, he was one of the few of his time who knew how to 
write gratefully for the voice. Browning is the core in this major recording 
achievement, knowing Barber's oeuvre as few do, and he has two of the most 
sensitive singers around today as his partners. Studer's limpid soprano is 
ideal for such pieces as "A Slumber Song of the Madonna," "Sure on This Shining 
Night" and, especially, the often witty "Hermit Songs." Hampson, who seems bent 
on challenging Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the number of recordings to his 
credit, amazes with his use of a cushion of air to support the bottom of his 
silky baritone and exquisite piano head tones (never falsetto) at the top. "The 
Daisies" has great charm, "Sleep Now" a languid calm and "I Hear an Army" and 
"Depart" raw dramatic power. The enunciation of both singers is a model of its 
kind. Superlative notes by Browning. WALTER PRICE

 DEBUSSY: "Khamma"; "Jeux"; "Printemps"; "Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune." 
Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jukka-Pekka Saraste. Virgin 
Classics CDC 5 45018 2.In 1912 Debussy quickly wrote the ballet "Khamma" for 
dancer Maud Allen and left it for Charles Koechlin to orchestrate -- damning 
impurity that may be the reason for its neglect. Other grounds are difficult to 
find, and this shadowy, sinister score gets an urgent, lithe reading under 
Saraste. The other pieces here fare equally well under the conductor's assured 
guidance; these are purposefully etched and poised interpretations, yet always 
warmly delivered. The Finnish Radio Orchestra is an alert ensemble, responsive, 
focused in its string playing and refined in instrumental balances. Virgin 
provides a sensitive, naturalistic production. TIMOTHY MANGAN

 The tireless Corea performs unaccompanied on this 14-tune collection of pop 
standards, jazz classics and originals, and it's a delight to hear the sound of 
his piano unadorned. Though decidedly a modernist, Corea reveals his profound 
knowledge of the history of jazz piano: Bud Powell's "Oblivion" is done a la 
Art Tatum, the evenness of his lines on "Someone to Watch Over Me" has a Teddy 
Wilson-like clarity, the swirls of color on "Stella by Starlight" recall the 
pastel palette of Bill Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this is Corea's show, and it's his diamond-bright, then dusky sound, 
his dancer's touch, his sparkling asides that land gingerly in our ears. He 
chooses a grand repertoire. Billy Strayhorn's classic "Lush Life" is given a 
four-note repetitive bass part that makes it move with uncommon force, while 
"This Nearly Was Mine" is delivered almost without ornamentation. "I Want to Be 
Happy" is curiously angular and jarring, while "It Could Happen to You" weaves 
between melody notes and boppish exclamations that spin and spark. 
</P>
<P>
 Corea also offers two Monk works, and again shows that he, along with Barry 
Harris and few others, completely comprehends that great man's approach. Listen 
to "Pannonica" and you hear the composer's understated, descending murmurs, his 
brilliant right-hand voicings. Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWART

 ENEMY TERRITORY: Is Public Enemy's time over? Chuck D. and crew rank as the 
most acclaimed rap group ever, but the initial reviews of its upcoming album, 
"Muse Sick N Hour Mess Age," are anything but respectful. Both Rolling Stone 
and the Source, the top hip-hop music monthly, slammed group leader Chuck D. 
for being out of touch with rap's currents -- and there's nothing worse in 
hip-hop than charges of irrelevance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Source's James Bernard wrote that Chuck D. refuses "to accept that his 
revolution is over," while Rolling Stone's Toure calls the collection "not only 
a bad PE record but a bad hip-hop record." Both make mention of Chuck D.'s age 
(34) and take him to task for what they deem ineffectual lyrics criticizing 
gangsta rap. 
</P>
<P>
 With the album's release having been pushed back to mid-August, those first 
sour tastes will be on fans' tongues for more than a month before they actually 
get to hear the music and judge for themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 How does PE's team plan to counter the negative impressions? 
</P>
<P>
 Ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even read the Rolling Stone review," says Lyor Cohen, the CEO of 
Def Jam and Rush Communications, the record and management companies that 
handle PE. "It has not impacted our strategy for this album whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyla Turkkan, PE's former publicist, who is still closely tied to the group, 
says the best strategy to counter the reviews is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they have to do is tour," she says. "Public Enemy is the best live rap 
group and one of the best live acts of any kind, period." 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem: PE doesn't plan to hit the road until November. Steve 
Hochman

POP MUSIC CHARTS: NOT BAD FOR A CUB 
</P>

 "The Lion King" roared to the top of both The Times' Southern California pop 
album chart and the national chart, spurred by the king-sized box-office 
figures. The album also got a hefty boost from the success of the single, Elton 
John's "Can You Feel the Love Tonight"--which is No. 8 on both the local and 
national pop singles chart. Stone Temple Pilots' "Purple" album, which slipped 
to No. 2 on the national and Southern California pop album charts, still tops 
the hard-rock chart.

RECORD RACK: POP MUSIC; L7 SLIDES BACK TO SLUDGY ROOTS; ** 1/2; L7, "HUNGRY FOR

<P>
 On L7's fourth album, the L.A. quartet drops the tame pop veneer of 1992's 
"Bricks Are Heavy" and returns to the fuzzed-out din from which it sprang. The 
band -- whose abrasive and wacky attitude has made it a college-rock godhead 
and inspiration to a myriad of new female groups -- now delivers a more 
substantial album.Yet there are still problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Donita Sparks and Jennifer Finch's haggard screams are perfectly blase and 
jaded -- to the point where they seem feigned. There's little genuine 
personality, be it a sense of irony or conviction, behind the lyrics, which are 
so predictably anti-Establishment that the only feeling you get from them is 
the band's need to be incredibly punk rock. It's as if after nine years, L7 
still has nothing to say beyond the stock talk of clubs and coffeehouses: 
"Plastic people with their plastic lives, plastic models and plastic 
magazines." 
</P>
<P>
 The best things here are the music's surprise twists and turns and the 
experimental production touches. Sugary backing vocals skip daintily across 
sludgy grooves while an intricate melee of guitar feedback and distortion 
pierces the dirge-like beats. The eerie whistle of synthesizers, the kitschy 
croon of organ and occasional bongos wash the songs with a quirky '60s appeal.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). LORRAINE ALI

RECORD RACK: POP MUSIC; *1/2; DA BRAT, "FUNKDAFIED" ( CHAOS/COLUMBIA ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HEIDI SIEGMUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Da Brat (Chicago's Shawntae Harris) claims to be representing 
Chi-town, the young rapper seems to have confused her address. Distinctively 
West Coast grooves make up the bulk of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 An appropriate subtitle to Da Brat's debut album could be "The Ghost of 'The 
Chronic.' " Obviously, "Funkdafied" pales in comparison to Dr. Dre's brilliant 
debut album, and the overt attempt to echo Dre's smooth sound and Snoop Doggy 
Dogg's equally smooth delivery makes the album ring even more hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta-based producer Jermaine Dupri, who also produced Kris Kross and 
Xscape, weighs the album waaaaaaay down with his music mix, which includes 
copies of passages from some of rap's biggest sellers. The best example is the 
title track, which is merely Dre's "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" redux. Between the 
album's borrowed beats and one too many borrowed popular phrases, "Funkdafied" 
is less a tribute than a flagrant pilfering of some of rap's finest moments. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rapper, Da Brat offers nothing new. Unfortunately, giving people an album 
that sounds like what they like seems to be her only objective.

RECORD RACK: POP MUSIC; ***; MC 900 FT JESUS, "ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE SPIDER" ( 
AMERICAN ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LORRAINE ALI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cutting-edge rapper and all-around studio virtuoso MC 900 Ft Jesus (a.k.a. 
Mark Griffin) kicks his feet up and lays far back for his third album and 
major-label debut. The record's balmy and organic grooves are far from the 
electronic dance pulse of previous records, and now he steeps his hip-hop 
sensibilities in minimal, goatee-stroking jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 But "One Step" isn't just another easy-listening attempt at acid-jazz. The 
album has a sharp, cynical and thinking edge. It's a hybrid sound the 
25-year-old Texan -- who carries a college degree in trumpet! -- has been 
mutating toward since his professional beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin delivers lyrics with a cadence that shifts quite fascinatingly between 
those of a finger-snapping beat poet, a cheap detective novel and a bar-stool 
storyteller. The subject matter ranges from long, smoky tales (one song clocks 
in at 11 minutes) to one-shot scenarios. Saxophone, clarinet, flute and, of 
course, trumpet converge to make seductive and sometimes hyperactive backdrops. 
Machine-generated beats are extremely minimal, giving way to the more imperfect 
thump of bongos and drums, while the lone rap number on the album boasts clever 
wordplay above nifty sampling. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). LORRAINE ALI

 No surprises in Pollstar magazine's tabulations of the top concerts for the 
first half of 1994: Barbra Streisand, Pink Floyd and the Eagles dominated the 
scene, with Streisand's two Las Vegas New Year's shows (top ticket price: 
$1,000) leading the way with a gross of more than $13.5 million. Those three 
acts accounted for all of the top 14 dates of the year so far and 41 of the top 
50.Pollstar editors predict that with the Rolling Stones, Woodstock II and 
"Lollapalooza '94" still to come, 1994's U.S. concert business will be the top 
touring year ever. . . .

<P>
 Van Morrison took an active interest in a tribute album to him -- he produced 
it himself, along with Irish instrumentalist Phil Coulter. Titled "No Prima 
Donna," the collection, due Aug. 23, features Morrison songs performed by, 
among others, Sinead O'Connor, Elvis Costello, Lisa Stansfield, Marianne 
Faithfull, Hothouse Flowers and Morrison's daughter, Shana. Oscar-nominated 
actor Liam Neeson also makes an appearance on the recitation "Coney Island." .

 The latest project from the production team behind Beck's "Mellow Gold" album,

 AND ONE MORE THING: It will take sales of 150,000 or so for the Rolling 
Stones' new album, "Voodoo Lounge," to debut at or near No. 1 on the pop charts 
next week. That could be a slam-dunk for the band, without much competition 
among new releases."The Symphonic Rolling Stones," the collection of Stones 
classics performed by an orchestra, is having a tougher time hitting the top. 
It's currently No. 3 on Billboard magazine's classical chart, stuck behind the 
Benedictine Monks' "Chant" and the soundtrack to the movie "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 The album's executive producer, RCA Victor vice president Steve Vining, is 
hopeful that the new Stones album will push interest in the "Symphonic" album 
and put it over the hurdle. His sights aren't quite so high as the pop figures, 
though. In the classical world, he says, an album can hit No. 1 with sales of . 
. . 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The (relative) success of the Stones project, though, has spurred more 
developing rock-classical crossovers: A Procol Harum album is being finished 
now, while Who and Jimi Hendrix projects are in development.*

 This intimate 1991 film is in essence a one-act Horton Foote play, which he 
has gracefully adapted to the screen. But it is of sufficient scope to afford 
Robert Duvall one of his juiciest roles as an elderly, crusty Texas sugar cane 
planter whose fields are tended by black convict labor; the year is 1902.Foote 
has said that "Convicts" is about one's making peace with death, which Duvall's 
Soll Gautier does to the very best of his wavering mental abilities. What Foote 
and director Peter Masterson have evoked is the passing of the Old South. It is 
viewed not only with an appreciation of its gallantry, but also with clear-eyed 
awareness of its cruel social and economic injustices (TMC Sunday at 1:20 
p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 For this diverting, silly 1993 release, Charlie Sheen got in super shape to 
send up Sylvester Stallone and his "Rambo" movies.Actually, director Jim 
Abrahams and writer Pat Proft spoof no fewer than 30 pictures in this fizzy 
summer comedy in which Sheen's indomitable, hopelessly square, sober-sided 
Topper Harley is the only man capable of rescuing American hostages, plus two 
sets of unsuccessful rescuers from Saddam Hussein. Abrahams and Proft admirably 
deflate those action movies that exploit violence in the name of a pious, if 
dubious, patriotism. At the same time, their nonstop throwaway humor keeps 
spirits lifted and smiles on our faces (HBO Saturday at 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 With Clint Eastwood starring as a veteran Secret Service agent in Wolfgang 
Petersen's crisply entertaining 1993 movie, the key question is who gets to 
play the implacable assassin sworn to drop the President. The choice was John 
Malkovich, who received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his efforts in 
providing an insinuating, intrinsically adversarial presence, an ideal foil for 
Eastwood's bluntly straightforward delivery.Traumatized ever since the killing 
of J.F.K., Eastwood's Frank Horrigan wants to be on hand when Malkovich makes 
his try. Petersen brings many of the same qualities to the film as Eastwood 
himself would: a lean, unadorned style, a concern with pace and an 
understanding of genre. Petersen, best know for the splendid "Das Boot," is as 
good a match for Eastwood on his side of the camera as Malkovich is on his 
(Showtime Sunday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; 'MAD ABOUT YOU' CLAIMS JOHN PANKOW AS A COUSIN READY TO 
GO THE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Devoted fans of "Mad About You" are fond of personally identifying with the 
hit sitcom's symbiotic couple, Paul and Jamie Buchman -- but how many of them 
have their own Cousin Ira? 
</P>
<P>
 John Pankow's role as the single New Yorker musician-on-the-prowl gives Paul 
Reiser's character a comedic confidante, providing an edge to the comfortably 
edgy Buchman banter. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Jacobson, the NBC show's executive producer and co-creator, says that he 
was looking for Ira to be Paul's best friend, but with a brotherly feel. Ira 
didn't exist, Jacobson points out, until midway into the first season, when 
Jamie says to Paul: "Let's talk about your cousin Ira's band at our wedding." 
Ira was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pankow of the musician who never seems to get gigs: "He tends to think 
he's as cool as the Fonz, but (he) is as deluded as Barney Fife. There's no 
malice in that man, though. I find that appealing, since I am as malicious as 
the day is long." 
</P>
<P>
 Pankow says he knows exactly why "Mad About You," which is airing its 
second-season repeats this summer, often wins the ratings war with "The 
Simpsons" in the 8 p.m. Thursday time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because the relationship between Paul and Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt) is 
such a universal one. That's why it's not unusual, he adds, for fans to tell 
him that their relationship is just like the Buchmans. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pankow's "Mad About You" audition, he played a scene without a script 
opposite Reiser, who is also an executive producer. "We just worked a scene out 
together as we went along," he explains. "From the very beginning, as soon as I 
met him, I just feel a real kinship with him. It's not like we hang out off the 
set, but we're crazy about each other. It's very familial working for him. I 
know that sounds mushy, but it's true." 
</P>
<P>
 After guesting on the latter part of the first season, he was made a regular 
last fall for the second season. 
</P>
<P>
 "John's one of these actors who, the more you give him, the more you want to 
give him," says Jacobson. "Everytime he walks in the door, the actors love him 
and the audience loves him. He plays this single guy as a real guy. He does a 
scene as gracefully as Roberto Clemente used to throw someone out at home 
plate. It's such a capable cast. There's little they can't deliver. And John, 
he really, really likes the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Pankow considers it all a blessing. "I gotta tell you," he says. "Having been 
on my share of sets, this one is almost without stress. There's a lot of 
harmony and you go to work and you laugh a lot and you have a good time. This 
is a show you absolutely don't have to apologize for." 
</P>
<P>
 He's so fulfilled by it, he adds, that he's about to try his hand at writing. 
"I'd like to write," he says. "Maybe not for the show, but for myself. I just 
want to see what I come up with and bang out a couple of spec (sample) scripts, 
that, if they're really worthy, maybe I'll just submit them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pankow was born in St. Louis and raised in Chicago, one of nine children. He 
always wanted to be an actor. Trained at Northeastern Illinois University in 
Chicago and the St. Nicholas Theatre, he starred as Mozart on Broadway in 
"Amadeus" and was in "The Iceman Cometh" and "Serious Money." In 1985, he won 
his first screen role in "To Live and Die in L.A." More feature and television 
roles followed, including a recurring role as a Manhattan neighbor to Blair 
Brown on "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mad About You's" schedule has allowed Pankow to spend time and travel 
extensively with his wife, Kristine Sutherland, also an actor, and his 
daughter, Eleanore, 3. Last month, he spent two weeks shooting "Cop Land" at 
the Sundance James Mangold June Film Lab at the Sundance Film Institute. 
Currently on a road trip on the East Coast with wife and daughter, next month 
he returns to Los Angeles for "Mad About You's" third season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pankow says he's "heard talk of Ira taking over (his father's) sporting goods 
store, which might be interesting, but I'd like to see Ira with his band 
again." Maybe he will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mad About You" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on NBC.

NETWORKING THE BALLPARKS; ABC AND NBC TAKE SEPARATE TURNS AT BAT TO DRIVE HOME 
REGULAR AND POST-SEASON PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After years of declining ratings, missing endorsements and collapsing TV 
revenues for major league baseball, nearly everyone agreed that the game needed 
some kind of revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let the revolution begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Its prelude bows Tuesday with the broadcast of the All-Star game at 
Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium when the "baseball network" will be unveiled 
for a curious public -- and an equally curious nest of sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a radical switch from the past weekly Saturday daytime broadcasts (most 
recently handled by CBS), this joint venture of Major League Baseball with ABC 
and NBC will cover the second half of the season on a single weekly prime-time 
night dubbed "Baseball Night in America." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC will air the first six regular season game nights beginning July 16, while 
NBC will air the remaining six nights starting Aug. 26. ABC will carry both the 
divisional playoffs starting Oct. 4 (expanded this year with divisional 
realignment and wild card teams) and the World Series, which begins Oct. 22. 
NBC's post-season job is to carry the American and National League championship 
series, which begins Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 When the baseball network president Ken Schanzer claims that the weeknight 
broadcasts will be "truly Olympian" in scale, he's not using hyperbole. "Look 
at a typical day during the Olympics," he says by phone from his New York 
office. "The most venues a network will handle is 9 or 10. We will have 
broadcast teams at 14 games. Rather than seeing a game of the week, we will be 
seeing a night of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious plan involves posting a primary play-by-play unit (ABC's is Al 
Michaels with Tim McCarver and Jim Palmer; NBC's is Bob Costas with Bob Uecker) 
at a key game, with regional games handled by 13 other units often including 
locally based play-by-play announcers and analysts. Each region will see both 
the "local" game, and when action heats up elsewhere, any of the other 13 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 And in another Olympian gesture, Greg Gumbel, who anchored CBS' Winter 
Olympics show, will do similar chores for the new "network." 
</P>
<P>
 Think of "Baseball Night in America" as attempting to snare some of the event 
status of the NFL on Sunday TV, only on one station. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also attempting to snare some momentum, which had been severely lost in 
recent years with CBS' disastrous broadcasting venture. The network lost nearly 
$600 million during its four-year, $1.06 billion deal with Major League 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks realized that they had overpaid for broadcast rights in the past. 
Thus, the notion of a joint venture between baseball and ABC and NBC emerged as 
a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before spring training, Madison Avenue skeptics doubted it could reach 
its stated goal of $180 million in ad sales. But with 21 sponsors lined up, the 
goal has virtually been met. 
</P>
<P>
 Schanzer hopes that sponsors will highlight stars, and cites sponsor Kellogg, 
which features Seattle Mariners slugger Ken Griffey Jr. With the Dodgers' Mike 
Piazza, the Chicago White Sox's Frank Thomas and the San Francisco Giants' 
Barry Bonds leading the endorsement way, Schanzer sees the linkages between 
stars, games and commercials as fueling the kind of TV fan upsurge enjoyed by 
the NBA in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, says Costas, "This is a show that will be very tricky to pull off. I'm 
enough of a purist to say that a simultaneous 14-game coverage isn't the 
classical way to televise the game. You won't see the game from start to 
finish. But as an added, once-weekly way of seeing both leagues in action, this 
can be real spice compared to the glut of daily baseball on the cable and local 
channels." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as curious as anybody to see how this works," Michaels says. "You'll see 
your base game in your region, and then, after a while, who knows what you'll 
see. If Greg Maddux is pitching a no-hitter for the (Atlanta) Braves, or 
Griffey is going after the home-run record, we'll cut away to that." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of his heavyweight status as one of TV's leading sports voices, 
Costas feels free to criticize the new network's post-season coverage. Since 
all games will air at night (unlike in past years, when games were played day 
and night), fans won't be able to watch all of the crucial match-ups. "I have 
real problems with that," Costas says, "and with splitting up the coverage 
regionally. The Braves' playoff game, say, will air in Florida. But where does 
that leave the transplanted New Yorkers who live there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schanzer understands the problems, but insists that poor ratings for day 
playoff games demanded night broadcasts. The most immediate problem, facing the 
new broadcast team, though, is the prospect of ballplayers on strike, smack in 
the middle of the weeks the network plans to broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 The " baseball network " premieres at 5 p.m. Tuesday on NBC with the All-Star 
Game.

RESTAURANT NEWS: MAYBE PUCK CAN CATER THE MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do Wolfgang Puck, Joachim Splichal, Michel Richard and Mary Sue Milliken 
have in common? None of the super chefs/entrepreneurs have been invited to join 
a new as-yet-unnamed chefs' club organized by Fred Eric, chef/owner of Vida on 
Hillhurst and Octavio Becerra, chef at Splichal's Pinot Bistro in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that they aren't good enough. It's just that Eric and Becerra and the 
other-members feel that these well known chefs have already had their day in 
the sun. "We don't want any of those old-school, '80s-wave people," says Eric. 
"They've had their thing and are busy opening patinettes and citronettes 
everywhere. It's not doing anything for the city's culture base." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Eric and Becerra, members of the new not-yet-famous chefs organization 
include Josie Le Balch of Remi, Francois Kwaku-Dongo of Mi Piace, Josiah Citrin 
and Raphael Lunetta of Jackson's, Tommy Hirose from Nouveau Cafe Blanc, and 
Francois Meulien of The Bistro Garden at Coldwater. The group, which first met 
at Vida and again last month at Pinot Bistro in Studio City, plans to help each 
other out through networking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been cooking for 22 years in Los Angeles and nobody knows who I am," 
says Le Balch, who has made a list of ideas to take to the next meeting. "I 
have no idea how to market myself. And I want to ask Fred Eric, 'Who gave you 
money to open a restaurant?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to agree on a direction L.A. could take to make the city 
more respected in the country (for its food)," adds Eric. "But we have to start 
from the ground up by creating restaurants that deserve that promotion." 
</P>
<P>
 HERE TODAY . . . : Chef Brian Keller, who was brought in by Peter Morton to 
oversee the kitchen at his new quarters in West Hollywood, has left Morton's. 
Sources say burger baron Morton hasn't been happy with the food at his watering 
hole since the move across the street, and that serious customers are defecting 
to Drai's. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, says Morton's maitre 'd Todd Thurman, sous chef Gerry Garvin 
has replaced Keller in the kitchen. Thurman refused to confirm whether the 
rumors that Keller had been fired were true. "I can't comment on that," he 
said, "you'll have to talk to Peter." Peter Morton was out of town and not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 CHEF MOVES: Michael Shaheen, who cooked at the Grill and previously Morton's 
until Peter Morton replaced him with Brian Keller when the restaurant moved, 
will cook at Carson, the restaurant Joe Stellini is opening in Beverly Hills. 
Stellini closed his 16-year-old eponymous restaurant, a hangout for sports 
figures and fans, last August. No doubt Shaheen will be making those spare ribs 
from the recipe Stellini appropriated while he was maitre d' at the Luau in 
Beverly Hills. . . . David McMillan, who formerly cooked at the Peninsula Hotel 
in Beverly Hills, is now at the Gate, the Hollywood nightclub/restaurant with a 
limo entrance for those special guests. . . . Ghazaros Mahroukian, former owner 
of Al Kasar in Sherman Oaks, is now cooking Mediterranean-Middle Eastern 
cuisine at the Lighthouse in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 PASTA & PEANUTS?: Francois Kwaku-Dongo is negotiating to open a place of his 
own later this year. In the meantime he will continue cooking at Mi Piace in 
Pasadena. The African-born chef, who left Spago a year ago to take the position 
as executive chef at Mi Piace, intends to feature basic Italian cuisine with an 
African flair, "something," he says, "nobody has done yet." 
</P>
<P>
 CIAO/ADIEU: Just when you thought you had the whole Fennel/Pazzia/Pazzeria 
situation figured out, owner Mauro Vincenti has gone and changed his mind 
again. The La Cienega restaurant reopens a week from Monday with new partners, 
a new concept and a face-lift. The back section, or fine-dining area, Pazzia, 
will feature such dishes as grilled chicken, lamb chops and sauteed spinach and 
veal stew with grilled polenta. The lower-priced front section, formerly 
Pazzeria, is due to open later this month. It will now be called Alto Palato 
(Italian for high palate) and will feature pizzas, pastas and takeout. And what 
about Fennel? "It disappeared," says Vincenti, "gone back to France."*

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: BERNARD'S NEW DOMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driving past the old Morton's site a few weeks ago, I noticed a banner draped 
over the front of the building-under-reconstruction: "Bernard Is Back!" it 
proclaimed. As if all of Los Angeles were waiting breathlessly. Bernard who? 
Why, Bernard Erpicum, the one-time all-powerful maitre d' at Spago, who decided 
the fate of would-be insiders every night, conducting parties to one of the 
coveted tables up front -- or to the back realm where it was impossible to see 
or be seen. Needless to say, Mr. Erpicum made a lot of friends at Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's counting on every one of them following him to his new restaurant, 
which opened June 30 after a flurry of celebrity-laced private parties. It's 
called Eclipse and features "the cuisine of the sun," which, at first look, 
seems to be St. Tropez tossed with California. As chef, he's enlisted Spago and 
Chinois alumnus Serge Falesitch, who cooked most recently at Delicias in Rancho 
Santa Fe. The decorator is no less than Lambert Monet, grandson of the 
Impressionist painter, who has given the large, high-ceilinged dining room a 
high gloss of velvet and brocade. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclipse's heavy glass doors close to form the splayed rays of the sun. From 
the bar, which has been moved close to the entrance, there's a view of the 
glassed-in kitchen where cooks in embroidered white uniforms and floppy toques 
toil before the stoves. From the brick wood-fired oven comes the house 
specialty: whole fish brushed with olive oil and herbs and fileted table-side. 
(Some of the waiters seem to be struggling, though.) 
</P>
<P>
 Seafood dominates the menu, from the starters (grilled langoustines, seared 
sea scallops in sea urchin sauce or oysters on the half shell), to seafood 
pasta and risotto, a Santa Barbara rockfish soup served in oversized bowls, and 
finally roasted, grilled and steamed fish. The category "from the land" 
includes dainty thyme-scented lamb chops and, oh yes, "surf & turf," which 
seems to have wandered onto the menu from another restaurant altogether. 
Desserts include frozen lavender-honey nougat and a torpedo-shaped lemon tart 
topped with candied kumquat zest, tart enough to make your lips pucker. 
</P>
<P>
 All through the meal, the suave Belgian works the room. The unsettling gaze of 
the Pharaoh in Alexander Mihaylovich's hyper-realistic painting seems to follow 
him from table to table. Kisses, more kisses. Drifts of expensive perfume. 
Plenty of accents. The room is full. The phones are ringing. So far, it's the 
biggest restaurant opening of the summer and, for the moment at least, it seems 
that Bernard is indeed back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eclipse, 8800 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (310) 724-5959. Open for dinner 
Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking. All major credit cards. 
Appetizers $8-$12, entrees $18-$28. S. IRENE VIRBILA

RETRO; A SAGEBRUSH BONANZA; TROTTING OUT A SADDLE BAG OF TELEVISION'S LEGENDARY 
WESTERN HEROES FOR ONE VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WALSTAD, David Walstad is a Los Angeles-based writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Mel Gibson's "Maverick" and Kevin Costner's "Wyatt Earp" gunning for 
box-office gold, it's high noon for a refresher course in '50s and '60s TV 
Westerns. "TV's Western Heroes" from GoodTimes Home Video rounds up glimpses of 
more than 40 shoot-'em-ups that dominated the screen when Father knew best. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides scenes from standards like "Bonanza," "Wagon Train," "Gunsmoke" and 
"The Big Valley," clips from such rarely seen classics as "Have Gun Will 
Travel," "The Rebel" and "Lawman," mix with the more G-rated "Roy Rogers," "Rin 
Tin Tin," "Annie Oakley," "The Lone Ranger" and "Buffalo Bill Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 An enthusiastic Will ("Sugarfoot") Hutchins narrates the two-hour, $20 trot, 
taped at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, which devotes a full wall to 
artifacts from these shows. Hutchins provides background details on the 
sagebrush sagas, and shares his own anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clips from commercials of Western heroes pitching for everything from bread, 
gasoline and toys to cigarettes might take you aback. Watch Hugh O'Brian as 
Wyatt Earp pitch Cheerios; Robert Culp ("Trackdown") as the deadly Texas Ranger 
selling Mobil; Gail Davis ("Annie Oakley") push Hostess cupcakes, and Clayton 
Moore demonstrate the Lone Ranger Rapidfire Revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the surgeon general's 1964 warning about the dangers of smoking, it was 
acceptable for Dale Robertson ("Tales of Wells Fargo") to espouse the pleasures 
of Pall Mall; for Rory Calhoun ("The Texan") and Steve McQueen ("Wanted: Dead 
or Alive") to push a real man's smoke -- Viceroy. "When it comes to choosing a 
cigarette, don't let anybody push you around," McQueen admonishes. Nick Adams 
("The Rebel") insists on L&Ms; Culp promotes Lucky Strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gunsmoke's" James Arness and Amanda Blake, in Matt and Kitty wardrobe in the 
Long Branch saloon, impress viewers with the satisfaction of an L&M. "Live 
modern; change to L&M," Arness proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in the oater's style and content over the years also is obvious. The 
Westerns of the late '40s to mid-'50s -- ("Roy Rogers," " Hopalong Cassidy," 
"The Cisco Kid," "Annie Oakley," "Gene Autry") had strong child-appeal. In the 
mid-to-late '50s early "adult" Westerns popped up with the likes of "The Life 
and Legend Wyatt Earp," "Gunsmoke," "Wagon Train" and "Bat Masterson." The 
Warner Bros. stable proffered "Sugarfoot," "Cheyenne," "Bronco," "Colt. 45," 
and "Lawman" along with "Maverick" in the mid-'50s to early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother lode of never-before or rarely seen footage brings John Wayne behind 
the scenes on a set visit to "Gunsmoke." Clint Eastwood and the "Rawhide" 
drovers appear in costume on a game show! Portions of a Dave Garroway special 
offer not only Gene Autry, "Annie Oakley" and "Maverick" stars but also an 
incredible display of marksmanship by a studio sharpshooter using live 
ammunition (surely a no-no today). 
</P>
<P>
 At a mid-'60s CBS affiliates presentation, tough-as-nails Robert Conrad's Jim 
West cocks his revolver on "Hogan's Heroes," as bumbling Sgt. Schultz (John 
Banner) urges him to remind viewers about the other great Friday series, "The 
Wild Wild West." 
</P>
<P>
 The talented cast of "F Troop" does an impromptu, mock gay version of their 
comedy Western -- footage saved from a long-ago wrap party bloopers gag reel. 
And there's footage of "Gunsmoke's" Arness taking the bullet in the 
long-running main title showdown -- instead of Marshal Dillon's opponent at the 
opposite end of the deserted street. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, a few of the earliest Westerns, "The Cisco Kid" and "Sgt. 
Preston of the Yukon," were filmed in color, before color TV. "Bonanza" 
premiered gloriously in color in 1959 and "The Virginian" in 1962, but the 
majority continued or debuted in black and white until the mid-'60s, when the 
day of the TV Western was beginning to wane.

BACK TO WOODSTOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Still No Room for Grateful Dead Even in Relaxed-Fit 'Woodstock,' " 
by Judy Brennan (Film Clips, June 26): 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodstock festival -- the original and the repeats -- are news and in the 
headlines, and to say the least I was disappointed in the article. For 
starters, of all the things Brennan and I spoke about as being important about 
"Woodstock" and what it relates to, approximately 119th -- if it was even on 
the list -- was the fact that the 40 minutes added to the film did not include 
the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did both of us waste so much of our time and end up with such nuts and 
bolts and trivia and irrelevancies? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not, for example, lead and emphasize free expression versus free 
enterprise? Surely these issues were near the top in importance on both our 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Crosby, Stills & Nash's song "Long Time Comin' " ("Speak out against the 
madness / Speak your mind if you dare") was twisted in the article's opening to 
mean mindless numbers (it's been a long time coming, 25 years, to putting in 40 
minutes), totally eviscerating meaningful, important content. 
</P>
<P>
 I know all too well that the headline and opening paragraphs of a story are 
all important, but look what readers got: numbers and laundry lists. Where are 
culture, society, politics and so forth, which are what Woodstock is all about? 
</P>
<P>
 Is it that compared to the '60s, stories of the '90s emphasize negatives, not 
positives, and are written with the upper row of keys on the computer -- the 
number keys: 40 minutes, $100 million, simple uncomplicated numbers. Forget

 In what was otherwise an excellent article chronicling the restoration and

did not check out her facts very thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 In her interview with supervising sound editor L.A. (Larry) Johnson, she says 
that "the original eight-track recording was put in a sonic solution," as if 
the tapes had been dipped in a vat filled with some arcane and magical fluid, 
thereby cleaning and restoring the audio to pristine quality. This does a great 
disservice to both Johnson and my employer, Sonic Solutions.

DEVIL OF A STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As someone who has been writing about historic Central Avenue for the past 
dozen years, I'm surprised to read how inaccessible it was for the production 
designer of "Devil in a Blue Dress," the new Easy Rawlins film ("The 'Devil' Is 
in the Details," by Sean Mitchell, June 26). 
</P>
<P>
 While I was researching my two books and one detective novel touching on the 
subject (all published within the past several years), not to mention numerous 
articles and two dozen R&B reissue album notes, I found enough photos, old news 
items and personal recollections to bring Central Avenue very much alive for 
me. Two other recent chroniclers -- Tom Reed and Johnny Otis -- also brought 
"the Stem" into clear focus in their books. 
</P>
<P>
 So Central Avenue's rich history wasn't lost, really. It's just that until 
Hollywood's new interest made it trendy, the street didn't merit any media 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 JIM DAWSON 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Your cover story on "Devil in a Blue Dress" included two photos. One was a 
shot of Central Avenue in the '40s, and it clearly shows the L.A. Transit Lines 
("Yellow Cars") narrow-gauge (42-inch) tracks. The bottom picture, from the 
movie, shows a section of Main Street between "Wilton" and Fifth representing 
Central Avenue in the late '40s; there is no such street alignment, and I 
believe Winston Street downtown was indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The other puzzle was that the bottom photo shows what appears to be a railroad 
track between white lines in the center of the street. I say "railroad" because 
no trolley wires are in sight. This is obviously standard-gauge (56 1/2 
inches), but I know of no such track on either Main or Central. Was this track 
put in by technical movie magic? 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the streetcar line on Central from Slauson north was replaced by a 
trolley coach on Aug. 3, 1947, but I am sure that the tracks would still have 
been in the street during 1948, the time of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 HARVEY J. QUITTNER 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Reader Quittner is correct on all counts. The cross street in question is 
Winston, not Wilton, and the tracks would have remained in 1948. Notes Gary 
Frutkoff, the film's production designer: "We re-created the tracks and applied 
them to the street with permission from the city, and they stayed for 11 days."

<P>
 Regarding "Welcome to Opie's World," by Kristine McKenna (June 26): 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Opie's world of perverse sexuality and fragmented identity reveals 
how confused we've become as a culture. 
</P>
<P>
 While reading McKenna's upbeat descriptions of the photographer's forays into 
piercings, ritualized sexuality and the developing of personas that include 
psychopaths and prostitutes, I felt sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Not because I haven't the capacity for such evil. But because the objects of 
Opie's vision were framed as just another variation, a human liberty, in the 
photographer's own words, "the freedom to image oneself as one sees fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom? The only freedom I could imagine would be liberation from the 
compulsion to create false and destructive selves, or from the need to inflict 
pain in order to feel sexual pleasure. But art in the '90s seems bereft of any 
hint of what is true and whole in regard to sexuality and gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Opie's world offers us little more than a vision of people in profound need 
whose lives testify to how destructive our attempts at love can be. Any other 
assessment does a disservice to her community, and to the truth of our capacity 
for gender and sexual wholeness.

 FRENCH CONNECTION: If you're French, you're well aware that Thursday is 
Bastille Day, to commemorate French independence. They're celebrating a little 
early today at Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. The first of its annual 
Bastille Day runs, to benefit local charities, starts at 7:45 a.m. Organizers 
say 4,000 runners are expected. Biggest single corporate entry: PacifiCare of 
Cypress, which is bringing 180 runners.

 HIGHER IN HOLLYWOOD: It may not rank with the hoopla of movie openings at 
Mann's Chinese Theatre, but Chapman University film students are excited about 
the premiere Wednesday of their four-part TV drama, "Higher Education." It will 
be shown -- preceded by a reception -- at the Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences Plaza Theater in North Hollywood. . . . The students wrote and 
directed, but they got a boost from one of their professors, Pamela Ezell: She 
persuaded her good friend, TV veteran Ed Asner, to star in it.

 SPEEDY RISE: For years, while playing with local rock band Dexter, Mark 
Mancina of Huntington Beach was convinced his years studying music -- two at 
Golden West and five at Cal State Fullerton -- had been wasted. "The band was 
going nowhere," he says. . . . But Mancina started writing music for movies. 
His latest two hits: He wrote the entire score for the critically acclaimed 
"Speed" and worked on some of the music for "The Lion King." Says Mancina: "Now 
all those years in college are paying off."

 FOLLOWING CODE: Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has refused to 
consider being a write-in candidate on the November ballot for the 70th 
Assembly District seat he's giving up. Ferguson is relinquishing his seat to 
run for the state Senate next year. . . . The write-in is the idea of 
conservative Republicans, angered that moderate Marilyn C. Brewer won the 
party's June primary. They may seek another candidate. But Ferguson says a 
write-in would break the "Republican code" to support the party's nominee.

PULITZER DREAM CAN TURN INTO NIGHTMARE ONCE IT COMES TRUE; AUTHORS: SIX-FIGURE 
ADVANCES, BEST-SELLER LISTS, HOLLYWOOD DEALS ARE AMONG TRAPPINGS. DOWN SIDE IS 
OFTEN MORE STARTLING AND LESS TANGIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days, six bouquets and an entire roll of fax paper after winning the 1994 
Pulitzer Prize for "The Shipping News," novelist E. Annie Proulx realized 
something startling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've become a thing ," she said. She sounded both delighted and relieved. 
Delighted, because the Pulitzer is "a very, very, very major thing, a big 
heavy-duty." Relieved, because she was finally beginning to make sense of the 
bedlam that surrounded her. 
</P>
<P>
 Proulx's Pulitzer capped a year that had already brought her three major 
prizes: the PEN-Faulkner Award for "Postcards," her first novel; and the Irish 
Times International Fiction Prize and the National Book Award for "The Shipping 
News," her second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was hardened," said Proulx, a no-nonsense woman whose manner over 
the course of an hourlong interview shifted from friendly to flinty and back. 
"But this is different." 
</P>
<P>
 So it is. Unlike most book awards, the Pulitzer Prize arrives without warning. 
No short list of finalists is made public in advance by Columbia University in 
New York, which administers the awards. Winners generally hear the news from 
the first enterprising reporter able to get them on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The year's most publicized literary trophy may also be the most lucrative. 
Winners of the fiction prize routinely show up on best-seller lists, command 
six-figure advances and get courted by Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 They also get horrifying amounts of mail that will never be answered, 
backbiting reviews by lesser writers in the throes of Pulitzer envy, and 
endless demands that have little or nothing to do with writing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great time to be pregnant, says 1992 winner Jane Smiley, who was, and a 
terrible time to have call-waiting, says 1993 winner Robert Olen Butler, who 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the eight to 10 days after my winning, the phone only rang eight or 10 
times," he said. "In fact, another 250 to 300 calls daisy-chained their way 
through my life in that week and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so for Proulx. Her phone rang. And rang. And rang. 
</P>
<P>
 The fax machine never stopped faxing. 
</P>
<P>
 The flowers kept coming. So did the reporters. Eventually, she said, "I got 
frightened." So she picked up the phone and called Butler, last year's winner 
for "A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain," a collection of short stories about 
the legacy of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long does it last?" Proulx asked Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the rest of your life," he replied. "The first eight words of your 
obituary have been written. Pulitzer Prize-winners become icons of literature. 
You represent something. You can either play with it and have fun or not." 
</P>
<P>
 He then passed along some advice given to him by Pulitzer Prize-winner Oscar 
Hijuelos, whose novel, "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love," won the 1990 
prize: "Get ready to take a warm bath in your own life." 
</P>
<P>
 For Proulx, who lives in splendid isolation in a tall, weathered house tucked 
beside an anonymous dirt road in a town of a few hundred people, it felt more 
like an icy shower. Her calendar was already crammed with literary commitments 
that would take her away from the things she likes best: fishing, canoeing and 
partridge hunting. How could she possibly squeeze in more? 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the house she'd just bought in Newfoundland, where whales play 
in the front yard and icebergs float past. When would she ever get time to 
spend there? 
</P>
<P>
 Rugged and wild, Newfoundland is Proulx's idea of heaven. It's also the 
setting for "The Shipping News," the story of a widowed, third-rate 
newspaperman who builds a new life for himself and his children in the 
abandoned home of his ancestors. Like most of Proulx's stories, its central 
themes are loss of community and the end of a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote it during long, leisurely mornings by the wood stove. Now, because 
of the prize, "I have to learn to write in short spans of attention, to carry 
my work around on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be easier said than done for Proulx, a tireless researcher whose 
giant jigsaw puzzle of a novel is pieced together with intricate detail about 
arcane topics -- how to tie ancient sailor's knots, how to prepare seal flipper 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
 For Butler, who produced his first four published novels on the Long Island 
Rail Road while commuting to work as a business journalist in New York, writing 
on the run is old hat. He now does much of his writing on airplane tray tables. 
</P>
<P>
 In other ways, though, his leap to Pulitzer status was far more dramatic than 
Proulx's. Prior to winning, he had had six novels published during the 1980s 
"to great but very narrowly pocketed acclaim and absolutely no sales." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say 'relative,' or 'considerable,' but in truth, it was absolute 
obscurity. Mine was the classic overnight reversal," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your first impulse is to be a slut, to say yes to everything. It's hard to 
say no to opportunities that two weeks before you would have been desperately 
grateful to have." 
</P>
<P>
 An aspiring actor who majored in theater at Northwestern University in the 
mid-'60s, Butler seems ideally suited for literary stardom. "The ham has been 
sizzling hotly this past year," said the author, who invited a reporter to feel 
free to call him back anytime, day or night. This, despite having just returned 
home to Lake Charles, La., from "the mother of all book tours," 40 cities in 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
 He likens his Year of the Pulitzer to Miss America's reign, except that the 
Pulitzer never ends. "You're no longer Miss America once the age lines start 
showing around your eyes. But you never stop being the Pulitzer Prize-winner. 
It affects the pace of your life, the clamor of the quotidian upon you." 
</P>
<P>
 His most memorable moment: being recognized by a woman at passport control in 
Kuala Lumpur. A counterbalancing moment: a reader calling up his publisher to 
request a copy of "A Good Scent From a Strange Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Taylor, who won his Pulitzer in 1987 for "A Summons to Memphis," still 
chuckles when he recalls his most humbling moment. Having heard about Taylor's 
Pulitzer, a friend asked if he'd be flying to Sweden to get it. When he stopped 
laughing, Taylor explained that he'd won a Pulitzer, not a Nobel. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Summons to Memphis" is the story of a man called home by his sisters to 
stop their widowed father from remarrying. It was the first novel in nearly 40 
years for Taylor, 77, primarily a highly regarded short-story writer whose 
previous books never sold more than a few thousand copies. He's since finished 
two other novels and started a third. "As you get older," he said, "you get 
more long-winded." 
</P>
<P>
 His late-in-life Pulitzer "didn't change things that much. I had my pattern of 
life all worked out." He never considered giving up his teaching posts at 
Harvard University and the University of Virginia, but acknowledges he no 
longer needed to teach for financial reasons. He has since retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler says he will continue to teach creative writing at McNeese State 
University in Lake Charles, even though he, too, could get by without his 
salary. Paperback rights for "They Whisper," his first novel post-Pulitzer, 
recently sold for well into six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Factoring in foreign sales, screen rights and opportunities on the lecture 
circuit, "all these add up to quite a bit of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest reward has been far less tangible. 
</P>
<P>
 Though reviews of "They Whisper" have been mixed, the Pulitzer has provided "a 
kind of insulation. I used to be really sensitive to bad reviews. Now they 
don't bother me at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not or will not change my vision of the world or what I say. But I 
don't have to win anything anymore. The monkey is off my back, and it's 
wonderfully liberating." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all winners share Butler's love of the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Smiley has chosen to keep a low profile, as evidenced by the message on 
her answering machine at Iowa State University, where she teaches: No books 
signed, no talks given, no manuscripts read, no assignments accepted. Thank you 
for calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiley won for "A Thousand Acres," a modern-day reworking of Shakespeare's 
"King Lear" set on an Iowa farm. Like "A Good Scent From a Strange Mountain," 
it appears headed for the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby she was expecting when she toasted her Pulitzer with fruit juice is 
18 months old now. She also has two older children, a husband, two dogs, and 
her teaching job, along with her writing life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get caught up; you have to start resisting right away," she said of 
the heightened demands that accompany the Pulitzer. "Maybe there's a price you 
pay somewhere down the road, but I'm willing to pay the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Butler, Smiley was already fairly well known when she won. "One thing 
about writing eight books, being around for a long time before getting famous, 
you have a long time to contemplate the potential effects of fame on you. It 
doesn't come as a surprise. I always thought I would just go on being as I 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 There's an added bonus to doing so, she said. "Once you've won the Pulitzer, 
if you act like a normal person, everybody thinks how great you are. It gains 
some sort of weird dimension in other people's eyes."

EXHIBIT DETAILS PORTUGAL'S HONOR IN WWII; HOLOCAUST: MEMORABILIA ON DISPLAY IN 
LISBON SHOWS HOW IT BECAME A PORT OF HOPE FOR REFUGEES FACING DEATH AT NAZI 
HANDS.

<P>
 During World War II, neutral Lisbon was an anomalous place, a perilous tangle 
of intrigue that served nonetheless as a benevolent escape route for refugees 
fleeing the Nazi terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Relics of the humane Lisbon are on display at the Goethe Institute: a dogeared 
diary hastily scribbled by a Polish Jew in the dark days of 1939, old German 
passports stamped with J for Jew, tickets for passage on ocean liners to 
freedom and safety in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fleeing Hitler and the Holocaust: Refugees in Portugal 1933-1945" depicts a 
city that was the last chance for people desperate to elude the Nazis. It 
assembles photographs, documents and memorabilia of the 100,000 Jews and other 
refugees who escaped through Lisbon, among them artists Marc Chagall and Max 
Ernst, composer Bela Bartok and writers Erich Maria Remarque and Andre Maurois. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portugal at that time was of unbelievable significance as a country of refuge 
and transit, and that is a widely forgotten fact," said Christa Heinrich, a 
coordinator of the exhibition that runs through July 15. "What we want to do is 
put a face to these numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 In one small room at the German cultural institution, she and her colleagues 
tell the dramatic story of the Iberian escape route. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief smiles from the faces of people photographed boarding the Serpa Pinto, 
Nyassa and Mouzinho -- Portuguese ships that carried refugees to the United 
States and Brazil. The ships became "almost legendary symbols of hope," 
historian Patrik von zur Muehlen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The despair and horror of the Holocaust also are documented. Janina Iadwiga 
Wurceldorf, a Polish Jew who married and settled in Portugal, wrote grim 
reflections in a diary saved by her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said their mother had always hinted at dark things in the book," 
Heinrich said. "They don't speak Polish and have never wanted to have it 
translated, so we won't either." 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the exhibit tells the story of Aristides Sousa Mendes, the 
Portuguese consul in Bordeaux, France. In three nights, he issued 30,000 visas 
to Jews without waiting for authorization from the government of Portugal's 
dictator, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Salazar regime was modeled on fascism, Portugal remained neutral 
in the war, largely because of its traditional alliance with Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Salazar's government tolerated the refugees, but the exhibition demonstrates 
that they got more help from American aid committees and a hospitable populace 
than from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Sousa Mendes, who had 14 children, was recalled immediately and dismissed. He 
died in poverty and oblivion, but since the release of the movie "Schindler's 
List" he has been likened to Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who helped 
Jews survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The comparison to Schindler is unfair," Heinrich said. "Sousa Mendes reacted 
immediately to the suffering of people. Schindler first had people working for 
him as cheap labor before realizing their suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Only after the dictatorship was overthrown in 1974 did the consul's deeds and 
other details of what happened during the war gain wide circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost as if Portugal and the Portuguese were ashamed of having saved 
the lives of Jews and others persecuted by Nazism," commentator Joao Mendes 
wrote in the daily Publico. The exhibition, he said, is an antidote to "this 
silence and cultivated amnesia." 
</P>
<P>
 Surviving refugees have no doubt of their gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portugal was the only land that allowed thousands of us to escape," Fritz 
Adelsberger said at the opening of the exhibition. "No other country in Europe 
did that, and so I say thank you to Portugal and to the Portuguese."

DEVELOPMENT VS. ENVIRONMENT IN SOUTH PACIFIC; PAPAU NEW GUINEA: PRIME MINISTER 
ACKNOWLEDGES THREAT TO ECOLOGY, BUT OPPOSES LAWSUITS FILED BY VILLAGERS AGAINST 
A POLLUTING MINE. HE WANTS NOTHING TO SCARE AWAY FOREIGN INVESTORS.

<P>
 The once-sparkling river chokes on milky-gray sludge from a huge mine upstream 
and the prime minister is furious -- not with the mine owners, but with the 
villagers suing them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the biggest lawsuit ever filed in neighboring Australia, 16,000 villagers 
who live along the Ok Tedi River seek $3 billion in damages from Broken Hill 
Proprietary Co., owner of the gold and copper mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Paias Wingti opposes the suit. He wants nothing to interfere 
with a minerals boom he hopes will bring prosperity to Papua New Guinea, parts 
of which had not seen a European until three generations ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingti acknowledges that development can bring environmental problems, but 
fears villagers near other mines will file copycat suits, stalling resource 
exploitation and scaring away foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 He has threatened to draft retroactive laws to block the claim against Broken 
Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The claim has certainly caused damage to investor confidence," the prime 
minister said. "Our country is a developing country and we need substantial 
investment capital if we are to develop our resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Several large multinational corporations already do big business here.

 Chevron Corp. of the United States, for example, has a large oil-development 
project in the central Highlands. An Australian subsidiary of Canada's Placer 
Dome Inc. is a major partner in one of the world's richest gold mines, at 
nearby Porgera. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ok Tedi mine is 52% owned by Broken Hill, 30% by the government and 18% by 
Metal Mining Corp. of Canada. It earns billions for the local economy, but that 
is no consolation to more than 100 clans that hunted, fished and farmed 
downstream for thousands of years until the mine started dropping tailings into 
the river a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They allege that 10,000 tons of waste rock containing copper, lead, zinc and 
cadmium is dumped in the water daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing lives in the river. We can't drink the water. The trees on the banks 
are dying," said Rex Dagi, a chief of the Miripki clan who is a party to the 
suit. "The mine makes money, but our traditional way of life is ruined." 
</P>
<P>
 The court case highlights the heavy toll taken by economic development on the 
fragile South Pacific environment: rain forests are being logged illegally, 
coral reefs are polluted, fish stocks have been plundered by foreign fleets and 
small islands face chronic problems of overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken Hill says a half-built tailings dam that would have handled the Ok Tedi 
waste was destroyed by a landslide in 1984. Because of such engineering 
problems as frequent earthquakes and rainfall 390 inches a year, the government 
allowed mining to continue without a dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the damage to the river, the mine has brought many benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Other landowners near the mine have been paid millions of dollars in 
compensation and royalties. Jobs and education have been provided for thousands 
of people. Health care has reduced the infant mortality rate from 33% to 3% and 
raised average life expectancy from 30 years to over 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations among miners, the government and landowners are often difficult 
in Papua New Guinea, where more than 80% of the 4 million people still live at 
the subsistence level. 
</P>
<P>
 All three are haggling over the ownership of a proposed gold mine in an 
extinct volcano on Lihir Island, 560 miles northeast of Port Moresby. 
</P>
<P>
 The most violent example is on Bougainville island, 600 miles northeast of 
Port Moresby, where a dispute between landowners and an Australian mining 
company led to a secessionist war in which more than 500 people have been 
killed. The world's largest copper mine has been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingti has not dismissed all environmental issues. His government enacted 
tough regulations against indiscriminate logging by foreign timber companies. 
It also proposes a tribunal to resolve land disputes and plans to establish a 
$12-million compensation fund for the river people. 
</P>
<P>
 He has warned foreign lawyers against trying to drum up business among 
disgruntled villagers. "We do not want to see our country being used by lawyers 
from outside," he said in a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister is angry that Australian lawyers for the Ok Tedi villagers 
filed the suit in Melbourne, where Broken Hill has its Australian headquarters, 
rather than in Papua New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Styant-Browne, the villagers' lawyer, said the Ok Tedi "is 
biologically dead. The landowners want rehabilitation of the river, monetary 
compensation and a proper waste-handling system set up at the mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Dagi, the Miripki chief, said the villagers are "not against mining, but it 
has to be done properly to save the environment and protect the people." The 
suit alleges that pollution flows from the Ok Tedi into the 700-mile Fly River, 
Papua New Guinea's longest waterway, then into the sea near the top end of the 
Great Barrier Reef off Australia's northern coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Styant-Browne said he expects thousands of villagers along the Fly to sue. 
Broken Hill maintains that both the Fly and the reef are healthy.

SOME CANOLA GROWERS FLOUT EPA PESTICIDE RULE; AGRICULTURE: AN INSECT THAT 
PLAGUES THE LUCRATIVE CROP IS EATING INTO PROFITS. A CHEMICAL THAT KILLS THE 
PEST IS BANNED, BUT NOT FOR CROPS THAT WILL BE EXPORTED. THAT LOOPHOLE GETS 
STRETCHED. 
</P>

<P>
 Canola, farmers say, is a Cinderella crop -- the sudden demand is so high that 
they can sell as much of it as they can grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinderella crops come along as often as lovelorn princes. And in their 
scramble to fit the glass slipper, some in the U.S. canola industry -- farmers, 
buyers and processors -- are defying federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency has yet to approve pesticides to fight an 
insect that plagues canola. When U.S. producers are allowed to use unregistered 
pesticides, the law requires that their crops be exported. 
</P>
<P>
 So some farmers truck their canola across the Canadian border and then back to 
U.S. processing plants. In other cases, buyers have created documents to show 
canola is exported when, in fact, it never leaves the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: Canola, an oil made by crushing the seeds of a variety 
of rapeseed, is a hot commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than all other vegetable oils, roughly 6% 
compared to 13% for corn oil. It also is high in mono-unsaturated fat, which 
helps the body eliminate fatty deposits, and recently was touted as a healthy 
way to reduce cholesterol in movie popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, leftover canola meal is used for livestock rations. Its roots 
improve the quality of the soil, and wheat farmers can diversify by adding 
canola to their crop rotation without investing in costly equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: In Canada, which dominates canola production worldwide, 
prices have increased by 40% since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. growers, the fly in the ointment is the flea beetle, a voracious pest 
that flourishes under the same cool, moist conditions favored by canola. 
</P>
<P>
 "These insects feed so rapidly that, in the course of several hours, a crop 
can be completely eaten down," said Jim Gray, crop protection manager for 
Intermountain Canola Co. of Idaho Falls, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is a pesticide known as carbofuran, which is planted in granular 
form along with the seed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the solution is that although the EPA allows farmers to use 
liquid carbofuran on crops ranging from alfalfa to grapes, it prohibits use of 
the granular version for most crops. 
</P>
<P>
 When planting equipment is raised at the end of a row, a few particles of seed 
and pesticide dribble out on the surface of the soil, Gray said. 
Carbofuran-coated granules attract birds, who need sand or grit to digest their 
food. The chemical kills birds, though there is no evidence that it harms 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Lyon, a researcher for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, says 
carbofuran is one of the most toxic agricultural pesticides in use, and one of 
the most studied. "What we've found is that even when it's applied in-furrow, 
at a low application rate with state-of-the-art equipment, we've had bird 
kills." 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers disagree, and Gray is among the canola growers and processors 
lobbying the EPA to approve the carbofuran for use on canola. Without it, he 
contends, the crop cannot survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada, carbofuran granules have been used for years, though the Canadian 
Wildlife Service is considering restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to import canola that has been grown with carbofuran into the 
United States, but the federal Food and Drug Administration monitors just 1% of 
all imported commodities. John Jones of the agency's Center for Food Safety 
said there are no plans to expand those inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canadian canola, treated with the same pesticides, is coming down here 
anyway," said Cavalier County, N.D., extension agent Ron Beneda. "It's the law. 
But it doesn't make any common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 North Dakota, Minnesota and Montana growers have EPA approval to use 
carbofuran on the canola they produce for export -- and they do. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Mickelson, who farms near the border at Rolla, N.D., said, "The 
canola we raised last year never went to Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson had a contract for his crop with Northern Sales of Winnipeg, 
Manitoba, which arranged for him to deliver it to a local elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they trucked it out, I knew it was going to Fargo," Mickelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Malkoske, a canola contractor for Northern Sales, denies that happened. 
But Gray said it happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers "create a paper trail that says the crop is exported, not wanting to go 
to the expense of shipping it to Canada and turning around and delivering it to 
a U.S. crusher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes the crushers uncomfortable, he said, because they don't know if a 
shipment is legal or not, "and it's real uncomfortable for the growers." 
</P>
<P>
 What really upsets farmers, though, is that canola could be an enormous crop 
in the United States -- if carbofuran were allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Weiss, a researcher at North Dakota State University, said domestic 
consumption of canola is 1 billion pounds annually. He estimates it would take 
2.5 million acres to meet that need, roughly 13 times last year's production. 
</P>
<P>
 North Dakota led U.S. production with 47,000 acres of canola in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Procter & Gamble would buy that much in one month," Weiss said.

LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE HEADACHE LOOMS AGAIN AS LANDFILL CLOSES; SOUTH 
CAROLINA: BUSINESSES AND HOSPITALS OUTSIDE EIGHT STATES WILL HAVE TO STORE 
THEIR CONTAMINATED ITEMS ON SITE. AND SOONER OR LATER, AMERICA WILL HAVE TO 
DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH ITS NUCLEAR WASTE. 
</P>

<P>
 Among the red clay and pine trees of this rural town lies the only place 39 
states could send the low-level radioactive waste their hospitals, power plants 
and universities create. 
</P>
<P>
 That was true until July 1, when Chem-Nuclear Inc.'s Barnwell County landfill 
closed to all but eight Southeastern states. Businesses and hospitals elsewhere 
will have to store their waste -- such as contaminated tools, clothing, 
laboratory animals and tissue -- on their own premises. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, this is not an immediate problem. Costs will go up, though not a lot 
at first. Wastes will pile up in makeshift sheds and storerooms; hospitals will 
freeze animals and tissues, as some already do. 
</P>
<P>
 And America will continue to grapple with the question of what to do with its 
nuclear trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw no reason to continue to be the nation's dumping ground," said South 
Carolina House Speaker Bob Sheheen, to explain the state's decision to cut off 
31 states from the Barnwell dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnwell, which has operated since 1971, is one of only two low-level 
radioactive waste landfills in the nation. The other, in Hanford, Wash., 
accepts waste from 11 Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the states that served as hosts for radioactive dumps complained 
that they were bearing the national burden unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Congress told the states to form compacts and build a dozen regional 
landfills by 1986. In 1985, with no new sites built, lawmakers extended the 
deadline to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But South Carolina legislators finally lost patience. Though Barnwell was 
scheduled to be replaced by a North Carolina site in 1996, South Carolina 
decided to close it to waste from anywhere but the Carolinas, Alabama, Florida, 
Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The states that cannot send to Hanford or Barnwell will be left to their own 
devices. Most are caught up in court fights or political disputes over where to 
place the regional dumps; Sheheen says they are "laggards" for failing to build 
their own disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill McGavern, a lawyer with the government watchdog group Public Citizen, 
said Barnwell's closing should remind lawmakers that their states continue to 
produce the waste. New disposal sites aren't enough; industry must stop 
creating the waste, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. in Billerica, Mass., has cut 
its low-level waste from 300,000 cubic feet a decade ago to 50,000 cubic feet 
last year. Some is compacted, some burned and some recycled, said Ray Shepard, 
the plant's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, about 1.7 million cubic feet of low-level waste was produced in 
1992, the last year for which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has figures. It 
would cover a football field more than 29 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuclear power industry generates about 35% of the nation's low-level 
waste, chiefly protective clothing, tools, machinery and filters exposed to 
radiation. Most of the rest comes from universities with reactors and from 
industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
 For nuclear power plants, storing more waste shouldn't be much of a problem. 
They routinely store low-level waste, especially during scheduled maintenance 
while reactors are being refueled. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals produce about 1% of the nation's total but are likely to suffer the 
most from Barnwell's closure, said Dr. Conrad Nagle, chief of nuclear medicine 
at William Beaumont Hospital in Troy, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals and pharmaceutical companies can store some waste until it decays to 
safe levels. That can take a few days or a few months, depending on the type of 
radioactive isotope. After that, it can be handled like regular garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagle, chairman of a waste generators' consortium, Organizations United for 
Responsible Low-Level Radioactive Waste Solutions, figures it will be two to 
six years before hospital administrators begin questioning the cost of working 
with radioactive material. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid that because institutions will be able to handle the waste 
temporarily the urgency will be dismissed on the political level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, some of the 200 institutions that produce waste already have 
begun storing it in shacks and trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means 200 places have to monitored, 200 places that have to be regulated," 
said Dr. Donald Margouleff, chief of nuclear medicine at North Shore Hospital 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is going to drive this. If it gets too expensive to handle radioactive 
waste . . . people will have to look at alternatives," he said. "It will impede 
medical research and medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 Those most immediately affected by the cutoff at Barnwell are 59 workers at 
the dump who will soon be out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 After working at the landfill for 12 years, Carol Belshaw, Chem-Nuclear's 
regulatory affairs coordinator, will be laid off this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lay the blame completely on some of the legislators who decided we didn't 
need our jobs anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another victim will be the state treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast compact charges states outside the region an additional $220 per 
cubic foot to dump there, boosting the total disposal fee at Barnwell to $279 
per cubic foot. Cut off that flow, and South Carolina will lose an estimated 
$90 million in fees during the next 18 months.

HANDS-ON APPROACH TO HUMAN BIOLOGY; HEALTH: WITH ITS EXHIBITS OF HEARTS, BRAINS

WANT TO TREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN? STEP RIGHT UP TO THE COMPUTER.

 Touch a real brain -- yes, real, not a model. Measure the skeleton of a fetus. 
Perform surgery with the same computer simulator medical students use. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the newest museum planned for the capital's Mall -- the 
National Museum of Health and Medicine, a place where human biology will get 
the same punch that the Smithsonian gives to dinosaurs and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a museum about the human body on a human scale," said museum officer 
Libby Videnieks. "We don't say, 'Here's a picture of a smoker's lung.' It's 
there, the smoker's lung next to the nonsmoker's lung, the healthy brain next 
to the Alzheimer's brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a morbid thing; it's a learning tool." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Museum of Health and Medicine already exists, but most of its 
unique artifacts are hidden in a cramped Army building in north Washington, out 
of sight and out of mind of the 25 million tourists who come here each year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum plans to move onto the Mall by 1999, where it will teach visitors 
to take charge of their health and translate medical advances into their 
everyday lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a great national museum doing the kinds of work in health that 
great museums like the Smithsonian do in earth sciences," said museum director 
Dr. Marc Micozzi. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans want to learn about medicine and they want it to be fun, said Bonnie 
VanDorn of the Assn. of Science-Technology Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think how the general public is attracted by something unusual or gory or 
strange," she said. "They have some of those things. How they choose to use 
them in order to further their health education goals will be interesting to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 That's already beginning at the museum's present home at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center. A masterful exhibit walks visitors through the human body, from 
the cardiovascular system to hormones. Touch the inside of bone. See an 
enlarged heart -- not in a jar of formaldehyde but sitting open, preserved 
because cell fluids were replaced with silicone. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Cohn, 10, made a beeline for ADAM, the advanced computer cadaver that 
teaches medical students anatomy and surgical techniques -- and allows visitors 
to do simulated surgery just like doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cool," Marcus pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the hall, a frank exhibit discusses AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors see the bullet that killed Abraham Lincoln and play a computer game 
that asks how to treat the stricken President. Do you ease his pain with 
brandy? Not unless you want to drown him. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum has a unique interest in such history because it was founded in 
1862 not to create exhibits but as the first federal medical research facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Army's direction, museum doctors fought battlefield disease during 
the Civil War, a legacy illustrated by the thousands of soldiers' skeletons 
still housed for study. They were the doctors called when Lincoln was shot and, 
over the years, the pathologists called upon as forensic detectives -- a craft 
so honed that curator Paul Sledzik now teaches the FBI how to find clues from 
long-buried bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, part of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, once sat next to 
the Smithsonian on the Mall, drawing almost 1 million visitors a year. But when 
the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration decided to build a modern art museum in 
1968, the medical museum was evicted. Attendance plummeted to as few as 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Congress is considering giving the museum prime real estate across from 
the Smithsonian's hugely popular National Air and Space Museum.

MERCURY PERIL WARNINGS CATCH FISH EATERS SHORT; NEW ENGLAND: BUT SOME SAY THEY 
WILL IGNORE MAINE'S NEW HEALTH ADVISORY, WHICH COVERS LAKES AND RIVERS.

 Dark-bottomed clouds float in to cover the early morning sun as late 
breakfasters linger in the dining room of Castle Island Camps. A fisherman 
carries a rod and gas tank to the boat landing, preparing to shove off into 
Long Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The pond, stretching on both sides of the camps, epitomizes the tree-lined 
serenity of the surrounding Belgrade Lakes region. But there is an uneasiness 
these days in the wake of a statewide public health advisory warning of mercury 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Women of childbearing age and children under age 8 are being urged not to eat 
any fish from any pond or lake in Maine. Others are advised to restrict their 
consumption to no more than six large fish or 22 small ones annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury ingestion at high levels can harm the development of children and 
human fetuses and cause nervous system disorders and kidney damage, scientists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 At Castle Island, there is no sense of alarm. But, as at other popular fishing 
locations around the state, which boasts nearly 5,800 lakes and ponds, there is 
talk about the sweeping nature of the health advisory and the extent of harmful 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people from out of state haven't even heard of it," said Bryan 
Castle, the camps' assistant manager. "As far as the locals who come by, they 
say they're going to eat as much fish as they always have." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road on Belgrade Bridge, Steve Jones began a conversation by 
dismissing the significance of the warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't let it worry me, to tell you the truth," Jones said. "I'll keep 
eating them." 
</P>
<P>
 But soon he conceded that the recent warning was changing the way he thinks 
about fishing, given the potential effects on his pregnant wife and 5-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boy, I'll probably let him have some. I probably won't let him eat it 
like he did last year," said Jones, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he would discourage his wife from eating fish, "but she doesn't 
care too much for fish anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said other warnings in recent years -- dioxin-related cautions on fish 
consumption have been issued for several Maine rivers -- and his own concerns 
about pollution shaped his current approach to fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll eat the humpback perch because they're easy to fillet out. Salmon, stuff 
like that. . . . I never eat the river fish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine's advisory, which officials say they hope to refine as more data from a 
federally aided survey of more than 120 ponds are analyzed, was welcomed by 
environmental advocates at Clean Water Fund and Clean Water Action in Boston. 
Last year they issued a report on the buildup of toxins around New England. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, the Clean Water coalition called for a regionwide health 
advisory covering all freshwater fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Around northern New England, official advice varies greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, New Hampshire had issued no advisory, but had recommended that 
people who consume a lot of fish -- more than 3/4 pound of freshwater fish a 
week -- vary the source of their fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Brook Dupee of the New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services said the 
aim was to guard against repeated exposure to unhealthful levels of mercury, 
"if there is a hot spot out there." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 10, an advisory went out for one body of water, warning against 
consumption of any largemouth bass from Horseshoe Pond in Merrimack. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupee said New Hampshire officials are reviewing new data from the 
Environmental Protection Agency and analyzing more fish samples, so that "it 
would not surprise me if New Hampshire were to consider revising its 
recommendations" to strengthen them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vermont, an advisory cautions against eating walleye from Lake Champlain. 
Women of childbearing age and children are advised to abstain; others are urged 
to eat no more than one meal per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing continues, said district fisheries biologist Brian Chipman, although 
he added: "We haven't looked at a lot of our smaller bodies of water for 
mercury in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vermont advisory was issued after fish samples taken from Lake Champlain 
were found to contain levels of mercury that averaged slightly more than one 
part per million, the threshold for action set by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA "action limit" is substantially higher than the 0.43 parts per million 
used by Maine as an indicator of concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Maine's threshold more or less matches the national average, according to 
Martha Keating, a staff scientist with the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning 
and Standards.

 Keating said Maine's advisory is one of the nation's most sweeping; Michigan 
is the only other state to issue a statewide warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts suggest that at least some of the contamination in remote ponds and 
lakes in states such as Maine may originate far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's probably a good hypothesis at this point," said Keating, who 
is based at an EPA headquarters in Research Triangle Park, N.C. "We're getting 
long-range transport of mercury from other areas. . . . It's beyond the 
hypothesis stage." 
</P>
<P>
 For many who fish for sport, mercury levels may not matter much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's probably a big concern for fishermen because basically 
they catch and release," said Nick Hill, behind the counter at D. L. Fleury's 
Sporting Goods Inc. in Winthrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally and even worldwide, "it's becoming more and more evident that the 
problem is widespread," said William Fitzgerald, a professor of marine sciences 
at the University of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald estimates that mercury deposits, on average, are three times 
greater than they were a century ago, but that it remains to be seen whether 
there has been a similar elevation in levels in fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coal combustion ranks high," said Fitzgerald. "Smelting is a contributor. 
Waste incineration, without a doubt. . . . There's even estimates for 
cremation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We breathe worse than what we eat," said Robert Fitch, 49, who frequently 
fishes with his 8-year-old granddaughter. "I mean, everything we eat these days 
is going to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
 Eyeing the Sticky River off Sebago Lake near his home, Fitch said he usually 
releases his catches anyway, but has paid attention to the advisory. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as that goes, I listen," he said. "But I enjoy fish. I eat fish."

SKULLS TELLING TALES OF ANCIENT MARINERS; SWEDEN: SKELETONS FROM A 1628 
SHIPWRECK GIVE A GLIMPSE OF HOW THE SAILORS LOOKED AND LIVED. HOLLYWOOD'S 
PORTRAYALS TURN OUT TO BE PRETTY ACCURATE. 
</P>

 Hollywood's stereotypes of old-time sailors as scar-faced, crippled and 
toothless come close to reality, according to a Swedish scientist who is 
studying the remains of 17th-Century seamen. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone specialist Ebba During spent four years scrutinizing the bones of sailors 
who died in 1628 when the Vasa, headed for the Thirty Years War on its maiden 
voyage, sank in Stockholm harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting her findings at the museum where the raised wreck now rests, During 
said that about a third of the 25 crewmen she studied had broken at least one 
bone and many had had teeth pulled or knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a handsome man . . . very manly, with his square eye sockets and 
powerful chin," she said, holding up a skull. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "he's been hit here and his nose has been broken, perhaps in a 
bar fight." She pointed to a mark between the eye sockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vasa was built to be the pride of King Gustav II Adolphus' fleet in his 
campaigns on the European Continent. The 200-foot warship had a crew of about 
400, including 300 soldiers, and was equipped with 64 guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, the ship was unstable. It capsized about 1,000 yards 
from the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident shocked the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be compared to the Challenger disaster. It was probably just as 
horrible for the people watching," said During, referring to the U.S. space 
shuttle that exploded after launching in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 After 333 years at the bottom of the harbor, the Vasa was salvaged in 1961 and 
the remains of the crewmen, ages 13 to 60, were buried. 
</P>
<P>
 During, an osteologist at Stockholm University, had the graves opened in 1989. 
What was left of the crew was a collection of tobacco-colored bones and skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 She was unable to identify the men, so she invented a name for each group of 
pieces that came from the same individual. 
</P>
<P>
 She put together two reasonably complete skeletons, but in most cases she had 
only a few parts to work with. The only part remaining of a man she called 
"Niklas" was one wisdom tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vasa was headed through the Stockholm archipelago and was due to sail 
southward, across the Baltic, after letting off wives and girlfriends at 
Vaxholm, a port outside Stockholm. The women had been allowed aboard for the 
first part of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them was "Beata," a woman about 20 years old who stood about 5 feet 4. 
During found 51 pieces of her skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child, she was sick several times," During said, pointing out stains on 
the teeth that indicated they had stopped growing because the body was battling 
a disease. During said she was also prone to diarrhea because of chronic 
malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 A pilot, "Filip," had a lesion on his elbow that showed he had worked too hard 
at the tiller as a young boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the earliest documented occupational injuries," During said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Vasa crew members were damaged, During said the navy "probably 
looked for people in relatively good health. I wouldn't be surprised if these 
people were in better shape than the average." 
</P>
<P>
 She published her report in a 160-page book, "They Died Aboard the Vasa." 
</P>
<P>
 The skeletons have more to tell, she said. In the next phase of her research, 
she plans to analyze the bones via DNA techniques. The skulls of Beata and a 
younger woman have similar shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a DNA analysis, we could answer the question of whether the ladies are 
sisters or related in some other way," During said.

RECALL ISSUED ON CYPRESS GROVE CHEVRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California company is recalling thousands of packages of goat milk cheese 
because they may contain life-threatening bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who purchased Cypress Grove Chevre between early May and June 22 is 
asked not to eat it, but to return it to the store where it was purchased for a 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheese was sold primarily in California, but possibly contaminated 
shipments also went to Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
New York, Oregon and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration discovered some of the cheese wasn't 
pasteurized long enough, so it could be contaminated with listeria. That 
bacteria usually causes flu symptoms in healthy people, but can be deadly to 
the very young, elderly, people with weak immune systems and fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no reported illnesses associated with the cheese.

FEARFUL MEMORIES STILL HAUNT BUDAPEST SQUARE; HUNGARY: NEARLY 70,000 JEWS WERE 
FORCED INTO A GHETTO 50 YEARS AGO. UNLUCKY ONES WERE SENT TO DEATH CAMPS. 
</P>

 Klauzal Square. The air fills with the squeals of children and the squeak of 
playground swings. But David Gutmann remembers the square differently, as a 
dumping ground for the looted corpses of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of Budapest, another Holocaust memory. Terez Virag was 14 when 
her grandmother perished in a gas chamber. Now 64, Virag understands another 
dimension of the horror: "I'm near her age and I want to live. How badly she, 
too, must have wanted to live!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, Budapest was a place of heart-wrenching drama for the nearly 
70,000 Jews forced into a ghetto in a traditionally Jewish district on the 
east, or Pest, side of the Danube. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama had a villain and hero larger than life: Adolf Eichmann, Adolf 
Hitler's executioner of Jews, who oversaw the slaughter, and Raul Wallenberg, 
the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its individual tragedies, the story of the Budapest ghetto is also a 
story of survival. While 600,000 Hungarian Jews from outside the capital were 
transported to Nazi death camps and thousands died of hunger and cold in the 
ghetto, many thousands more lived. The Budapest ghetto was the only one of 
about a dozen large ones in Europe to survive the war. 
</P>
<P>
 For most people, half a century has obscured the terror that began in October, 
1944, when fascists called the Arrow Cross overthrew dictator Miklos Horthy, 
who had tried to end the alliance with Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Atrocities against Jews had been relatively rare under Horthy, but the new 
regime threw Hungary's Holocaust machinery into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Eichmann testified at his war crimes trial that the Arrow Cross was more 
efficient at genocide than the Gestapo, sending 600,000 Jews to death camps in 
Germany, Austria and Poland in less than five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Final Solution was implemented, all those in the provinces were 
destroyed with lightning speed, the fastest anywhere," said Randolph Braham, 
professor emeritus at the City University of New York and author of the 
"Politics of Genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Jews of Budapest were protected by Wallenberg and other 
diplomats, who set up safe houses and issued passes. But they could not manage 
that forever, and the first straggling lines of Jews were forced into the 
ghetto in late November, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Marta Deri remembers that march, when she was 12. Like others, her group was 
escorted by a band of Arrow Cross thugs, some no older than 17, itching to 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 6- or 7-year-old girl stepped out of line in front of me," Deri said, eyes 
misting as she absently stirred her coffee at a table a stone's throw from the 
former ghetto. "They shot her. I can still see the apples rolling out of her 
backpack after she hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop was Klauzal Square. There, the Jews were ordered to give up all 
their valuables. By the time Gutmann arrived, the frozen bodies of those who 
disobeyed were strewn on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those corpses there are Jews who tried to be smart with me," Gutmann 
remembers a swaggering Arrow Cross youth telling him. "Now they are dead. And 
the same thing will happen to every dirty Jew I catch hiding his valuables." 
</P>
<P>
 A few Jews used their "Aryan" looks to advantage. Laszlo Siklos, A blond, 
blue-eyed boy of 15, bluffed the Arrow Cross into issuing him identification 
papers and a rifle. He then escorted his mother past real Arrow Cross troops at 
the ghetto gates, telling them he had caught her escaping. In her backpack, she 
carried food for relatives inside the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 But most people in the ghetto had to subsist on whatever food the Germans and 
Arrow Cross allowed them, usually watery soup and a little bread. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Soviet army arrived in January, starvation and cold had killed 
many. Living and dead shared the dank cellars. Frozen bodies were dumped in 
Klauzal Square by the thousands because there was no room for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors barely made it. A plan to send hundreds of Nazi and Arrow Cross 
killers into the ghetto was canceled on Jan. 15, 1945, just two days before 
Soviet army tanks crashed through the wooden palisade that imprisoned the Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first Soviet soldier to poke his head into our cellar was a kid of 24, 
yelling, 'Nemyetsky, Nemyetsky (Germans, Germans)!' and pointing his submachine 
gun every which way," said Gyoergy Nadas, 63. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was afraid Germans were waiting in ambush. I felt life coursing back into 
me. I could finally hope that we could live again." 
</P>
<P>
 Some were too far gone for emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't cry until a visit to the Wailing Wall in May, 1989," Deri said of 
her moment of release on a trip to Israel. "All the horror came back in a rush, 
and I broke out in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly I realized how lucky I was to be alive."

JOBS PROGRAM HELPS OLD HANDS STAY PRODUCTIVE LONGER; EMPLOYMENT: SOME BELIEVE 
WORK KEEPS THEM HEALTHY. AND MANY FIND THAT SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS JUST DON'T 
GO FAR ENOUGH.

 Henry Peshell is 90, spends 20 hours a week plucking staples from police 
reports for minimum wage, and hopes to keep working until he is 106. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Peshell, thousands of older people know that reaching 65 doesn't 
necessarily bring a stroll down Easy Street. In fact, even if they could afford 
a life of leisure, many wouldn't want it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even at 90 years I don't want to retire, because people who stop working die 
within six months," Peshell said. "Maybe when I am 100 or 106, I will retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some want to keep working, others have found that lean Social 
Security checks force them to work well into their 70s, 80s and 90s. Social 
scientists say the trend will continue, especially as people live longer. 
</P>
<P>
 That outlook has made federal job programs a necessity, they say. One such 
program, Green Thumb, was established in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to 
employ retired farmers to maintain the nation's parks and highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the program provides job training and minimum-wage employment to people 
55 and older, living just above the poverty line. Green Thumb, a nonprofit 
corporation in 44 states and Puerto Rico, has 18,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 It operates under federal funding and guidelines and is one of 10 national 
sponsors of the government's Senior Community Service Employment Program. The 
U.S. Forest Service also is a program sponsor in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't fall off your chair, but I have been in Green Thumb for about nine 
years," said Peshell, Utah's oldest participant. 
</P>
<P>
 He has held a variety of jobs, including mail room clerk at City Hall and 
bookkeeper for Salt Lake County's Meals On Wheels. Peshell began working at the 
Salt Lake City Police Department a year ago cataloguing files. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I got a little trouble with my eyes and they decided to make me a 
de-stapler," he said, explaining that he removes staples from hundreds of files 
a week to prepare them for microfilming. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, Peshell dons his uniform: a pale blue shirt, silver star-shaped 
badge that reads "Records," and rainbow-striped suspenders. He rides the bus 
about 10 blocks from his one-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather not drive a car because there are a lot of stupid drivers in 
Salt Lake City," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peshell immigrated from Saxony, Germany, when he was 26. In Utah, he worked as 
a weighmaster for Union Pacific railroad and later as a clerk at a gas station. 
He never held a job long enough to collect a pension. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses his current $4.25-an-hour job to supplement the $594 Social Security 
check he and his wife, Ruth, receive each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Peshell also persuaded his landlord to reduce his rent from $320 to $220 in 
exchange for gardening and yard work he and his 76-year-old wife do at their 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Social Security system is a good system," he said. "If it wasn't for 
that, a lot of older people would be hungry. But it is not quite enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in similar situations have turned to Green Thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude Heiner, 67, discovered the program after he lost a leg in an auto 
accident and was confined to a wheelchair. He was unable to continue working as 
a coal miner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting around the house for two years," he said, "and that word called 
depression finally got to me. I knew I couldn't get back into mining. So I put 
my application in with Green Thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he landed part-time jobs as an engineer at West Valley City and 
the Utah Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more or less something to do to get out of the house," Heiner said. 
"My wife was going to throw me out or I was going to throw her out if I didn't 
get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley City now pays his salary as a full-time engineer after hiring him 
from Green Thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people . . . seem to bring so much enthusiasm to their job and it's 
sparked all of us to do our job better," said John Patterson, West Valley City 
manager. "I wish we could employ more people." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Green Thumb participants reflects Utah's spiraling elderly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Sager, consultant for long-term care for the state's Division of Aging, 
says Utah's population over age 65 is expected to rise 19.3% from 1990 to 2000, 
contrasted with 11.7% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fastest-growing age group in the entire population is 80-plus," Sager 
said. "That's because people are living longer and they're living healthier." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Green Thumb enrollees are divorced or widowed women with few skills and 
even less money, said Ron Burris, regional program coordinator for Utah and 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest-core in terms of poverty and lack of skills is the female under 
age 62," Burris said. "I have had several people tell me that, if it wasn't for 
this program, they would be living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four dollars and a quarter is not very much, but it's enough to provide food 
and shelter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employers are taking advantage of the aging work force, said Amanda 
Barusch, assistant associate professor of social work at the University of Utah 
and author of a forthcoming book, "Older Women in Poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 "Although senior citizens generally are slower on the job, they have better 
judgment and use more caution," Barusch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers also have found that senior citizens like Peshell are likely to be 
more dedicated to their jobs and less apt to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a great program and everyone loves Henry," said Tami Livsey, 
assistant personnel director at the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Peshell was honored last year at a Utah Jazz game for outstanding service and 
earned a certificate of achievement from county commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 But he shrugs off the hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make such howdy-doody in the Police Department. They think I'm a king or 
prince or something. They say, 'Hey, you're 90 years old, why don't you go lay 
on the couch and take it easy?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say, 'No, this is much more interesting.' "

CAST-OFF CROCKERY IS JUST WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

 From a shelf of thousands, James Allen Murphey picks up a Civil War-era 
covered dish and recites its history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was made by Tresmanher & Vogt in France in 1864," the 79-year-old Murphey 
said as he gently turned it over, noting the gold flowers hand-painted atop a 
delicate design embossed into the white china. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time it was made, there were over 60 factories in that area of 
France," Murphey said. "This pattern was probably made until the 1920s. It's 
dated because the manufacturers in those days guaranteed their china against 
impurities for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, it was a casserole dish. But it could have been a plate, a cup, 
a saucer. Murphey's business has become a passion; he's spent 50 years 
searching the world for dinner-table furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need a dish, he's probably got it in his basement, upstairs, even in a 
barn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is unbelievable," said Pat Wishop of Rockton, Ill., as she and 
Karen Swanson picked through hundreds of dishes in the basement catacombs of 
Murphey's Patterns of the Past shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teachers drove to Princeton, like hundreds of other china pilgrims 
each year, in a quest for an obscure, long-discontinued pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought a dish that I'm trying to match," Wishop said. "It's from a set 
that my husband's grandmother owned. They weren't even sold in stores. Some of 
the dishes are chipped, so I'm hoping to replace them." 
</P>
<P>
 She's in luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphey has her pattern, one of a mind-boggling array of china and crystal in 
all colors, shapes, sizes and styles. They sit floor to ceiling on sagging 
shelves that snake, maze-like, through his modest shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers bring plates, pictures of dishes, scrap-paper drawings -- or they 
utter vague descriptions of a pattern in hopes Murphey will recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
 He catalogues in his mind the 12,000 china patterns stored in seemingly wild 
disarray. Only mental maps exist for most of his stockrooms and barn. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father has been here living this business since the 1940s, and now he 
gives speeches and teaches classes on it," said Murphey's daughter, Jyl 
Lorenzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphey said he fell into the business when he was stuck with unsold china 
inventory after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he fell in love with this business," said Winnie Murphey, his wife and 
co-worker of 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If Murphey doesn't have a particular pattern, the real hunt begins. 
</P>
<P>
 He will check with some of the 300 importers on both coasts who supply him 
with china. He may contact china salespeople, dealers or even factories 
overseas -- many of which he has visited over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Auction houses, flea markets and antique dealers are sources for china, as are 
other china-matching shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Assn. of Dinnerware Matchers has about 60 members, said IADM 
President Iris Freeman in Irving, Tex. But several hundred shops nationwide 
sell discontinued china patterns. Most are small and carry only certain brands 
of china or crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly new industry," Freeman said. "A lot of people still don't 
realize there are businesses who specialize in discontinued patterns." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterns of the Past, about average size among the businesses, has six 
employees, a client list of 10,000 and annual sales of between $100,000 and 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Old china is a lucrative business that has exploded in the last five years, 
said Bob Page, founder of the industry Goliath: Replacements Ltd. in 
Greensboro, N.C. Its sales jumped from $52,000 in 1981 to $21.5 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge demand," said Page, who employs 240 people and has a 
computerized inventory exceeding 1.6 million pieces, along with massive 
warehouses and even a restoration division complete with kilns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sentimentality involved when a bride picks out a china pattern and 
still thinks it's the best ever made 25 years later," Page said. "It's very 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Page's, Murphey's approach is stubbornly low-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers compete for a single phone line to reach Murphey. Handwritten logs, 
not computers, track inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lorenzana is just getting a facsimile machine installed.

RARE TURTLES GET SECOND CHANCE AT SURVIVAL IN CONSERVATION PROJECT; ECOLOGY: 
ZOOLOGISTS SALVAGED EGGS FROM DIAMONDBACK TERRAPINS KILLED BY MOTOR VEHICLES 
AND RAISED THE HATCHLINGS IN CAPTIVITY. RECENTLY, CHILDREN RELEASED THE 
CRITTERS INTO THE WILD, GIVING THE YOUNGSTERS A LIVING LESSON.

 The freckle-faced kindergarten student reached into a pailful of diamondback 
terrapins and pulled one out. Gingerly, he stepped to the water's edge in a 
saltwater marsh and lowered it in, waving goodby as the turtle entered its own 
habitat for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like he was going to bite me," 5-year-old Matthew Bridgeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he's swimming all the way out there," he said, pointing to the winding 
river that snakes through the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 After him, 24 other children paraded two by two to the same spot, each 
releasing a turtle and watching it disappear into the blue waters of the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The "turtle launch" marked the end of a yearlong conservation effort, the 
Terrapin Rescue Project, in which zoologists salvaged eggs from diamondbacks 
killed by motor vehicles, raised the hatchlings in captivity and released them 
into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby turtles got a second chance at life partly because their mothers 
didn't. And the children learned an early lesson in conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids live all around these wetlands and this lets them know that there's 
more than tall grass there," said Cindy Hein, a teacher who accompanied the 
children. "It makes them aware of the environment at an early age. It's a good 
place to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamondback terrapins live in salt marshes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 They are rarely seen. But each year, from early June to mid-July, female 
terrapins crawl up out of the marshes in search of higher ground to dig nests 
and lay their eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many end up as summer's squashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Stockton College zoology professor Roger Wood and students under 
his direction removed eggs from dead females and raised 25 baby turtles in 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The children got to see the baby turtles when they were the size of a quarter 
last fall. When they saw them again recently, the turtles were 3 or 4 inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, the children baked turtle-shaped cookies and held a raffle for a 
quilt embossed with turtles to raise money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 David Harlan, 6, presented Wood with a check, the proceeds of which will help 
pay to raise this year's batch. "We raised $390 for the baby turtles," he said 
shyly, handing an envelope to Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to buy a lot of turtle food. That's going to make a lot of 
turtles happy this winter," Wood told the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, like a Pied Piper of the marsh, Wood led the children down a 
path and out into the marsh for the launchings, and the giggling children began 
reaching into the pails to pull out wriggling turtles.

ANITA GARVIN STANLEY, 88; ACTRESS IN 350 COMEDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anita Garvin Stanley, a movie comedian who was teamed with British music hall 
player Stan Laurel before he met Oliver Hardy and later did knockabout routines 
with the two of them, has died. She was 88. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Stanley died at the Motion Picture & Television Fund Hospital in Woodland 
Hills on Thursday after an extended illness, spokeswoman Carol Kinsey 
Pfannkuche said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Stanley began in show business when she was 12 by lying about her age and 
becoming a "Mack Sennett Bathing Beauty" in a stage show. At 13, she was a 
"Ziegfeld girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Hal Roach -- who gave the world the Little Rascals -- later put her 
opposite Laurel. After Laurel and Hardy became a team, she appeared in dozens 
of their comedies during the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took pratfalls better than anyone else. You got bruised up once in a while, 
but it didn't show," Mrs. Stanley once said. "Stan and Ollie were terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Before marrying bandleader Red Stanley and retiring in 1942 to raise two 
children, she had appeared in about 150 of Roach's movies and more than 200 
others for various studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley is survived by a daughter, Anita Patricia Stevenson; a son, Edward 
Garvin Stanley, seven grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are scheduled Tuesday at 10 a.m. at St. Mel's Catholic Church in 
Woodland Hills.

ROBERT E. LEE; CO-WROTE 'AUNTIE MAME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert E. Lee, half of the distinguished writing team that brought the 
incorrigible "Auntie Mame" and the politically significant "Inherit the Wind" 
to theatergoers around the world, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter, Lucy Lee, announced over the weekend that her father had died of 
cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Friday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 With his collaborator of 50 years, Jerome Lawrence, Lee brought to radio and 
then to stage, television and film some of the brightest and enlightening 
productions in the entertainment world. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their other works is the current "Whisper in the Wind" and such long ago 
favorites as "Look Ma, I'm Dancin'!" The latter was conceived by Jerome 
Robbins, directed by George Abbott and starred Nancy Walker as a brewery 
heiress who tries to bridge the world of ballet. It opened on Broadway in 1948 
and was the first in a string of successes that continued nearly until Lee's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the most remarkable, intelligent, brilliant, creative mind I have ever 
known in my life," Lawrence told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inherit the Wind" was a fictionalization of the 1925 trial of John Thomas 
Scopes, who advocated Darwinism in a state that required creationism be taught 
in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1955 play -- which originally starred Paul Muni, Ed Begley and Tony 
Randall -- was widely praised and sold almost 2.5 million copies in printed 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been translated into 34 languages, including Urdu and Russian, and seen 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In it the two playwrights made Scopes a symbol of not just evolution versus 
divine creation but of a philosophical struggle with the education and 
political establishments and a person's right to think and teach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was written because we were indignant, appalled at thought control in the 
mid-'50s," the McCarthy era, Lawrence said. "So we went back in history to 
another case where people were being told what to learn, what to think, and it 
did have a great effect on the country. It was combatting McCarthyism," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was made into an award-winning film in 1960 starring Spencer Tracy, Fredric 
March, Gene Kelly and Florence Eldridge and was a "Hallmark Hall of Fame" 
production on TV in 1965 starring Melvyn Douglas -- who had filled in 
temporarily for Muni on Broadway -- and Begley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Auntie Mame" was their comedic examination of a free-spirited woman based on 
the writings of Patrick Dennis, which later was adapted for the big screen and 
n made into the musical "Mame," for which Lee wrote the book. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point after its 1956 Broadway release starring Rosalind Russell (who 
also was featured in the film), it was being produced by five stage companies 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Lansbury was the first star of the musical "Mame" on Broadway in 1966. 
It ran for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail" was a play by Lee and Lawrence of a night 
Henry David Thoreau was incarcerated for not paying his taxes because the 
United States was fighting what he believed was an unjust war with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 That too was widely produced after its first semiprofessional staging at UCLA 
in 1970. Lee had taught theater at the Westwood campus for the last 20 years of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Elvira, Ohio, Lee attended Ohio Wesleyan University and then moved to 
New York where he was a director of radio advertisements for Young & Rubicam. 
It was there he met Lawrence, and they sketched out over lunch their first 
collaboration, a radio production, "Inside a Kid's Head." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee helped found Armed Forces Radio after the bombing of Pearl Harbor before 
writing for the stage, which became his true love. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Lawrence-Lee) always preferred theater because that's where the writer 
is really revered," Lucy Lee said. "In the theater there's a kind of purity 
about the playwright's role that they enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Their latest, "Whisper in the Wind," was written in conjunction with Norman 
Cousins and produced in Arizona and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plays from the Lee-Lawrence collaboration were the Cold War drama "A 
Call on Kuprin" and "First Monday in October," about the first woman on the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee had recently completed a book about Gen. Robert E. Lee, to whom he was not 
related. Lucy Lee said the book, which has not yet found a publisher, reflected 
"his lifelong and passionate fascination with the man whose name he shared." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his most personal writing," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his daughter, Lee is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two 
grandchildren. He is also survived by his wife, actress Janet Waldo, whose 
voice first became widely known when she starred in "Meet Corliss Archer" on 
radio and more recently as Judy Jetson in the animated TV series "The Jetsons." 
</P>
<P>
 The family asks that contributions be made to the Lawrence and Lee Theatre 
Research Institute at Ohio State University.

RELIGIOUS-RIGHT STANCE WILL WIN VOTES, GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE SAYS; MINNESOTA: 
ALLEN QUIST HOPES TO DEFEAT A FELLOW REPUBLICAN FOR NOMINATION. HE FOCUSES ON 
FAMILY VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the white farmhouse where Allen Quist grew up doing chores with his three 
brothers, politics was not considered polite dinner conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the world has changed for the worse since then, according to the man who 
wants to be Minnesota governor. So in the same southern Minnesota farmhouse he 
now shares with his wife and children, politics is the topic of the day, every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist, an unabashed religious conservative, squashed incumbent Gov. Arne 
Carlson when the state's Republican Party conferred its endorsement last month. 
It was the first time in Minnesota history that the state GOP snubbed its own 
sitting governor. The state's primary is set for Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The former state representative also is having a ripple effect on dinner 
conversation around the state, especially with his comment that there may be a 
"genetic predisposition" for men to be heads of households. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist, who was a professor of psychology and political science at a small 
Lutheran college for 14 years, says he'd rather get attention for his views on 
taxes and welfare reform. But he doesn't think the spotlight on his moral views 
hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to attack me for being on the religious right, my attitude is, 
'Go right ahead. You're giving me the election,' " Quist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist, 49, says Americans should learn from the way things were a generation 
or two ago. Families were relatively solid, crime was much lower, and so were 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is convinced that the main causes of crime and other troubles today are 
what he calls the breakdown of the family and society's failure to teach core 
values. He says as governor he would try to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family is the best social welfare program ever invented," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposes welfare reform, including a two-year limit and making it easier 
for welfare recipients to marry without losing benefits. He would spend less on 
prisons and rely more on restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants tax breaks for families, supports abstinence-based sex education, 
opposes civil rights legislation for homosexuals and opposes no-fault divorce 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 He also opposes abortion. His political opponents have seized on the public 
disclosure that his wife, Julie, obtained a legal abortion in California in 
1970. She was a leftist activist at the time and helped found the feminist 
Amazon Bookstore in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julie's not the candidate, and that was 24 years ago," Quist said. "She 
obviously has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple married in 1987, after Allen Quist's first wife died in a car 
accident while six months pregnant with their 10th child. Julie Quist was a 
supervisor at AT&T and had become a Republican Party activist and committed 
Christian before she met her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she was ready to have a family, so she moved to the 800-acre corn and 
soybean farm, adopted Quist's nine children, and gave birth to the couple's own 
child about a year later at age 41. 
</P>
<P>
 "My background is somewhat sensational, but it's not unusual," she said. 
"Everyone has something in their past they're not proud of." She said many 
people have gone through breakdowns "and have come to look for what are the 
values that are truly lasting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Quists also say the "genetic predisposition" comments were taken out of 
context. They say they are simply observing that men often lead a household, 
and they say male leadership does not mean female subservience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never argued it has to be that way, and I observed that very often it is 
not," he said. But the controversy "puts the two of us in the position of 
defending the traditional family. That's a political winner for us." 
</P>
<P>
 His candidacy is aimed at toppling a fellow Republican who is already in 
office. Quist has no qualms about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that Arne Carlson could not get reelected and did not represent a 
Republican viewpoint," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson has alienated many in his party by supporting legal abortion and gay 
rights. He won in 1990 after a surprising turn of events; he lost the primary 
but became the Republican candidate after nominee Jon Grunseth quit the race 
after allegations that he fondled teen-age girls at a swimming party. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist said he could have tolerated Carlson's liberal views on social issues 
had Carlson been more conservative with money. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that while Quist was a state representative, he was preoccupied 
with the moral issues, not the economic ones. His fight against gay bathhouses 
-- including an undercover visit -- is notorious. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to the House floor and gave a booth-by-booth description of what he 
had found," said state Rep. Don Ostrom, a Democrat who said even Republicans 
congratulated him when he defeated Quist in 1988 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson says that Quist's interpretation of his economic record is wrong, and 
that Quist has an untoward fixation with moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of prowling through dirty bookstores, why didn't he go out and change 
state spending policy?" Carlson said. "How can you spend 30 hours on the House 
floor haranguing your seatmates with issues on sex, and then come around and 
expect the public to take your tax proposals seriously?" 
</P>
<P>
 Quist believes he's riding the crest of a public desire for personal 
responsibility and a return to shared values.

NEW LIFE IN A DEAD REEF: CORAL MENDS BONES AND BLOCKS SUN -- FOR STARTERS; 
ECOLOGY: SCIENTISTS ARE DISCOVERING HUMAN USES FOR CALCIFIED REMAINS OF MARINE 
ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD J. FREDERICK, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Snorkelers on a nature excursion watch marine biologist Gareth Johnstone skim 
past a giant clam and deftly pluck a small piece of coral from Australia's 
Great Barrier Reef. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming to the surface, he displays his trophy, which oozes clear mucus. 
"Something in this stuff and other parts of the coral protect it against the 
sun's ultraviolet rays," he says. "The substances someday may be useful as a 
sunscreen." 
</P>
<P>
 Two coral experts -- Bruce Chalker and Walter Dunlap at the Australian 
Institute of Marine Science, or AIMs, in Townsville -- have synthesized and 
patented the protective chemicals. Some pharmaceutical companies soon may 
include them in sunscreens and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Coral reefs, found mostly in shallow temperate or tropical ocean waters, are 
the largest formations made on Earth by living organisms. They are the 
handiwork of small marine animals called polyps, which fashion limestone cups 
to protect their soft bodies. When these living bits of coral die, their 
calcified remains bond together, forming massive reefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The living organisms "are probably getting the highest dose of solar 
ultraviolet anywhere on the planet, with the exception of ice algae in the high 
alpine regions of the world, yet they thrive in it," Chalker says. 
</P>
<P>
 But coral does a lot more than build reefs and produce sun block. One of its 
most important benefits is in helping to repair the human body. Doctors 
sometimes use coral as a bone substitute in reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The main advantage of the coral substitute, says Dr. Michael Chapman, an 
orthopedic surgeon at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, is 
that "we no longer have to harvest bone grafts from the patients themselves. 
This saves the patient discomfort and the complications associated with taking 
the graft." 
</P>
<P>
 The interconnected pores of specially treated warm-water corals allow adjacent 
living bone to send new blood vessels and bone tissue into the coral maze, 
creating a strong bond of new bone. 
</P>
<P>
 David Mercer, president of Interpore International in Irvine, Calif., the only 
U.S. producer of coral for bone, estimates that his company imported about 
6,000 pounds of coral in 1993. One coral head weighing 150 to 200 pounds 
provides enough material for hundreds of bone grafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Versatile coral shows promise for still other applications. It contains 
substances that may be effective food preservatives. And, like tree rings and 
ice cores, it harbors a record of former climates. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the centuries, coral picks up molecules of soil washed into the ocean 
by rivers. Drilling into the coral, extracting a core and then "reading" the 
fluorescent bands created by the molecules, scientists have tracked climatic 
conditions as far back as 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've perfected a set of instruments that allows us to read these beautiful 
fluorescent bands each year and in some places each month, back through the 
centuries," says AIMS scientist Peter Isdile. "They tell us what sort of wet 
season, monsoon seas or drought that the river catchment incurred. So you can 
look at long sequences of dry years, large flood events and all sorts of 
mixtures." 
</P>
<P>
 The instruments also can detect much older readings from ancient corals that 
are now buried in land formations. "We've reconstructed the climate of the 
Sinai Peninsula in the Middle East for the last 200,000 years," Isdile says. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some of coral's remarkable properties lead to its destruction 
by humans. Live coral in some parts of the Indian Ocean is mined for the 
construction industry, which turns it into cement. "Most of the reefs around 
the Indian subcontinent are in real trouble," says Clive Wilkinson, an AIMS 
research scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although destructive practices in many parts of the world can wipe out years 
of growth, coral often survives through its sexual prowess, as evidenced in a 
spectacular event involving at least half of the 350 coral species on the Great 
Barrier Reef every austral spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This incredible mass spawning phenomenon, discovered only in 1982, is the 
corals' main answer to the great problem of how to get sperm and eggs together 
from parents that are separated widely and that live in an environment of 
never-ending water movement," reef biologist J. E. N. (Charlie) Veron writes in 
a book, "Corals of Australia and the Indo-Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 Mass coral spawning isn't unique to Australian waters, even though it hasn't 
been observed in great detail in other places. "We're talking about a 
phenomenon that's worldwide," says Alina Szmant, a University of Miami marine 
biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the same spawning behavior has been observed shortly after the 
August full moon on the Flower Garden Banks, the northernmost coral reefs on 
the continental shelf, in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.

IN 2 YEARS, THE MTA CONNECTIONS' STAFF HAS DEALT WITH 2,900 PEOPLE ON THE 
TRAINS, IN GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL AND PENN STATION.

 The old man is clean and shaven, but napkins are stuffed in his patent-leather 
shoes to keep them from falling off, and a paper bag full of clothing sits at 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy McInnis tries to strike up a conversation: "Hi, wanna come out and talk? 
We'll sit on the bench. Maybe we can find you something more comfortable than 
the train, something long-term." 
</P>
<P>
 The man doesn't want to leave his seat, so McInnis and Shari Siegel -- 
outreach workers for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Connections 
program for the homeless -- jump on the E train and start chatting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad you came along," the man tells them, and he shares childhood 
memories of creamy fresh milk and fat blueberries on a New Hampshire farm. He 
talks about his plans: He's just been released from the hospital and is en 
route to stay with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 McInnis and Siegel give him their phone number and then move on, seeking to 
persuade other homeless people to move from the subway system into housing. A 
few days later, the old man calls and they find him a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The underground homeless are nothing new. Since 1982, police have transported 
homeless people from trains and stations to shelters 55,000 times. Previous 
outreach programs were limited to certain stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Connections is the first systemwide effort to reach the homeless, and its 
philosophy is different: It's not enough to take someone to a shelter; you have 
to get to know them, determine their needs and motivate them to make the move 
themselves. "If you had to figure out the one thing that's keeping you from 
housing, what would it be?" is how McInnis often starts his assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Since starting two years ago, Connections' staff of 22 has dealt with 2,900 
different homeless people in the subway, Grand Central Terminal and Penn 
Station. Some are encountered once; others are seen again and again before they 
agree to accept help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beautiful part of it is, they're not just sending these people somewhere; 
they're checking on them," said Michele Butchko, director of homeless services 
for the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more than 600 homeless people identified by Connections in its first year, 
221 were placed in shelters, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and other 
programs. At least 34 returned to MTA property, but the majority did not. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA developed Connections, budgeted $1 million a year for it, and hired 
Gouverneur Hospital, a city facility, to run it and hire staff. The employees 
range from professionals like Siegel, a psychiatric nurse, to McInnis, a former 
bartender whose streetwise gregariousness makes up for his lack of degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the West Fourth Street station the two see a man asleep on a bench, a pile 
of tattered clothes beside him. "Hello, sir!" McInnis calls out. "How are you?" 
The man opens his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes McInnis learns that the man is on welfare. He gives him a phone 
number for an agency to help him use his benefits to obtain a room. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a ragged man frantically searches through a garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, how ya doing?" Siegel says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too bad," the man replies, nodding warily. "You?" 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later he hurries away -- but this is the beginning, not the end, of 
their relationship. When they see him again, on some other day, the outreach 
workers will try again to make a connection, trying to gain his trust. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way to 59th Street, they pass a woman who appears agitated, mumbling as 
she runs up the stairs. She's rebuffed them in the past, so they let her go. 
</P>
<P>
 And they run across an old friend, a one-legged man who just got out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, how are you?" McInnis says. "The station manager was telling me about 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah? What'd he say?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Said you're still hanging around." 
</P>
<P>
 They laugh and agree to meet the next day in the station to talk about finding 
a better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Some success stories stand out, such as the pregnant tunnel dweller who had 
been approached by outreach workers many times before agreeing to get treatment 
for a drug habit. Moments after a Connections team met her at the hospital 
where she was to go for detox, she went into labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby was born in a hospital and she was born alive," Butchko said 
proudly. The child is now slated for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the life cycle, a Connections worker found a homeless 
acquaintance semiconscious in Grand Central and had him hospitalized. He died 
two days later. McInnis got a funeral home to bury him for free and is trying 
to find the man's next-of-kin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cover everything," said Siegel, "from cradle to grave."

 NJ Transit has earmarked more than $23 million to give older people and 
disabled residents better access to state transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The state transit agency in June renewed a $20-million program that helps 
counties purchase equipment to make buses and trains more accessible. It will 
also purchase 66 lift-equipped buses and minibuses for $3 million.

DANA PARSONS: YOU THINK SPORTS HEROES ARE A MYTH? SAY IT AIN'T SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DANA PARSONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 We're told we don't have sports heroes anymore. Or, that we shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 We're told that only suckers would confer heroic status on athletes, because 
we don't really know them and, after all, they're mere mortals not worthy of 
adoration. We're told they'll only let us down. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some of the biggest names in the American sports pantheon have 
fallen to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Rose was kicked out of baseball for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson was promiscuous and acquired the virus that leads to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mantle has publicly acknowledged that he's been an alcoholic for much 
of his adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 And O.J. Simpson is going to trial for a double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of all this bad news, some observers are debunking sports heroes 
and their place in American society. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Cabinet member William J. Bennett, author of the best-selling "The Book 
of Virtues," went so far as to say after Simpson's arrest that he wasn't ever a 
hero but, rather, a celebrity. "We confuse real heroism with celebrity and 
confuse celebrity . . . with significance," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett's observation is startlingly shortsighted because it doesn't take into 
account the things Simpson may have done over the years that Bennett knows 
nothing about -- such as efforts O.J. made with youngsters that may have 
improved their lives. Simpson may be the reason that untold numbers of kids 
stayed in school or left the streets. To those touched by Simpson or any 
athlete in a circumstance like that, the sports figure is a hero and rightly 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no shame in having sports figures for heroes. Embracing them is 
nothing more than recognizing the passion they add to our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like athletes, great musicians or thespians can be heroic figures. So can 
politicians and soldiers. So can authors and painters and poets. 
</P>
<P>
 What the heroic ones have in common is being larger than life, made so by a 
combination of their extraordinary talents and their ability to perform. They 
must be able to rouse our emotions, bring us joy and risk our disappointment, 
but all the while elevating our sensations beyond that which we can do for 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The debunkers are right, up to a point. It would be great if every boy's hero 
were his father, or if every little girl's hero were her mother. But insurance 
salesmen and biology teachers will never suffice as public heroes, no matter 
how noble their everyday deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The cynics say we'd have a better world if athletes weren't seen as heroes. I 
say we'd have a poorer one, because it would be a world devoid of a child's 
fantasies and of the sheer joy that comes when your hero comes through when it 
counts. A world without sports heroes might just as well be a world without 
sports and all that it can do to enrich our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, our fallen heroes have hurt us mightily. We invest so much of ourselves 
in their success or failure that we can't help but be hurt emotionally when 
they falter. But the fact that we hurt so much only points out the powerful 
hold they have on us, and we must remind ourselves that those feelings are 
genuine and not shameful. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a little too old now to come up with new heroes. But I'm not too old to 
recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
 This Tuesday night at baseball's All-Star game, the fans in Pittsburgh plan to 
honor Roberto Clemente, the Pirates' Hall of Fame outfielder who was killed in 
a plane crash in 1972. As a Pirates' fan since 1958, I revered Clemente. His 
was a heroic presence for me -- first as a boy but continuing through my teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of it was his manner, part of it was his style on the field. Both 
suggested a specialness that separated him from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente died in a plane crash while delivering supplies to earthquake victims 
in Nicaragua. Try telling his native Puerto Ricans that Clemente was just a 
baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who have been through the hero-worship phase know it's a risky 
business. We know we're putting a little bit of our hearts on the line. But to 
give up on having heroes would be to give up a little of ourselves. It would be 
a concession that we'll accept a world that's less passionate, less fun. 
</P>
<P>
 I lament the downfall of sports figures, because I know the impact sports has 
on many people's lives. In its purest form, that impact enriches people and 
makes them more whole. To say that athletes can't be heroes is to misunderstand 
the society in which we live. 
</P>
<P>
 It hurts, and it hurts bad when a hero does an awful thing. The temptation is 
to walk away and say we won't let anyone hurt us again. 
</P>
<P>
 At times like this, I'll remember the Clementes of the sports world and remind 
myself that there are such things as real heroes and that we don't lessen 
ourselves by saying so.

DDT RESIDUES HAUNT THE ENDANGERED PEREGRINE FALCON, SCIENTISTS WARN; 
ENVIRONMENT: MORE THAN 20 YEARS AFTER THE PESTICIDE WAS BANNED IN THE UNITED 
STATES, ITS EFFECTS LINGER. IT IS STILL USED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD; WHEN 
IT RISES INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IT FALLS WITH RAIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Jeep Pagel rappelled down a spectacular rock cliff to a ledge harboring two 
peregrine falcon chicks, pulled on a surgical glove and gathered up broken 
eggshells. 
</P>
<P>
 "A toxicologist told me, 'Don't touch the eggs. They're loaded with 
organochlorine contaminants,' " the U.S. Forest Service biologist said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years after DDT was banned in the United States and the peregrine 
falcon species was put on the endangered list, the deadly pesticide still is 
causing problems for the bird. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT, ingested by the falcons through the birds they prey on, has long been 
blamed for eggs with shells so thin they often crack before they can be 
hatched. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Pagel is wondering whether DDT or other chemicals could be responsible for 
an unnatural 2-to-1 proportion of females to males among chicks, and whether 
they are also causing female behavior in at least one male adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "With these contaminants introduced into the system since the 1940s, I may 
never have seen normal peregrine behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT came into wide use during World War II to control insects such as lice and 
mosquitoes. Through the 1950s and '60s, it was widely used to control 
crop-eating insects. 
</P>
<P>
 But when scientists discovered that birds such as the peregrine and the bald 
eagle were ingesting the pesticide and were unable to hatch young because of 
eggshell thinning, DDT was virtually banned in the United States in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The bald eagle has recovered enough that the government took it off the 
endangered species list, classifying it instead as a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of DDT on wildlife have been dissipating as the chemical gets 
buried in the sediment of rivers and bays, said D. Michael Fry, a research 
physiologist at the University of California at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 But storms and dredging stir it up from time to time, and the pesticide still 
is used in Central America and other parts of the world, where it contaminates 
migratory birds. In warm weather, the chemical becomes volatile. It is carried 
into the atmosphere and falls to earth in rain around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it in the snow and ice of Antarctica, as well as the Arctic," Fry 
said. "I think the problems with DDT are much reduced in the temperate zones, 
but it will continue to pose a global risk if it is used in other parts of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Zenone, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Reno, Nev., is 
analyzing a proposal that the status of the peregrine species in the West be 
changed from endangered to threatened. After the 1992 breeding season, the 
Western states counted 591 breeding pairs, compared with estimates of fewer 
than 50 pairs in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, peregrines in southwestern Oregon, the California coast near Big Sur 
and West Texas have problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel, who keeps watch over 37 nests in Oregon and Northern California, 
counted an average of one chick per nest. That's better than the 0.7 count of 
recent years, but still below the 1.5 needed to maintain a stable population. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenone believes peregrines are contaminated by DDT from migrating to Mexico 
and Central America and from eating birds in North America that have been south 
of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel said he believes the sources of contamination may be closer to home, in 
forests that were sprayed for years with chemicals to control weeds and pests. 
</P>
<P>
 He is finding that peregrines in Oregon that nest below 2,000 feet elevation 
don't travel very far or eat migratory birds in winter. And it is in winter 
that the falcons form their fat reserves, where DDT is stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagel also found that in one nest in Oregon, the male is failing to feed his 
mate while she is brooding and is trying to bump her off the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like there's two females in the nest," Pagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT and other chemicals, such as PCBs, mimic the female hormone estrogen and 
cause malformed male sex organs in species from sea gulls to alligators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We banned DDT basically because of its eggshell-thinning effects," Fry said. 
"Its feminizing effects, although reported 13 years ago, really have not been 
of great interest until the last couple of years. But I think there's much more 
danger to wildlife than just eggshell thinning." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows what is skewing the peregrines' sex ratio. Fry said he doubts 
it's DDT. Pagel suggested it could be other unknown or unmeasurable 
contaminants.

LITANY OF LOSS MARKED 14-YEAR-OLD MURDER DEFENDANT; OAKLAND: HE NEVER KNEW HIS 
FATHER, HIS MOTHER DIED AND HIS SISTER WAS KILLED CROSSING THE STREET. DEATH OF 
GRANDMOTHER CAME NEXT. POLICE SAY SUSPECT 'HAD NO VALUES, NO GOALS, NOTHING.' 
HE IS ACCUSED OF KILLING TWO MEN IN SEVEN HOURS.

<P>
 His mother died in 1988; he never knew his father. Five years later, the big 
sister who looked out for him was killed crossing the street. Last December, 
the grandmother who reared him dropped dead of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 14, police allege, he got hold of a .38-caliber revolver and in seven 
hours used it to kill two men. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a shocking crime -- but shocking crimes committed by the very young are 
common. Generically, we blame poverty, drugs, gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 But every young killer has his own history. And beyond what police say was one 
14-year-old's violent spasm lurks the story of a life shadowed by death, a 
story that may offer some explanation, if not expiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hurting over losing it all. He had lost it all," said the youth's 
aunt, Mary Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Police -- and the widow of a victim -- took a less sympathetic view. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no excuse," said Linda Lee-Hackney, whose husband, Ben Hackney, was 
the first man shot in the May 27 killings. "I'm sorry that he's only 14, but my 
sympathy can only go so far." 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem with this fellow is he didn't have any guidance," said 
Oakland Police Sgt. Paul Berlin. "He had no values, no goals, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager's life had been a litany of loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just about the last surviving member of his family," said his lawyer, 
Kathy Siegel of the Alameda County Public Defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 A virtual orphan, the youth was crushed by the death of his 17-year-old 
sister, struck by a big rig as she walked to school in April, 1993, Jones said. 
Within months his grandfather had also died. Then, in December, his grandmother 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was devastated," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones took the teen-ager in. But after so many disruptions, he had trouble 
adjusting and chafed at her rules and restrictions. The breaking point came in 
early May when she suspected he had stolen a gun from his grandmother's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just started lying and lying and I guess he just felt as though he had to 
run away," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was arrested three days after the killings. Police said he told them 
he had been living in abandoned cars for weeks, and was broke, hungry and 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He confessed to both shootings and the reason for both shootings was that he 
was hungry and was asking people for money and he became angry when they 
refused to give him money," Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones reported her nephew missing when he ran away and "the next thing I know 
the man's been shot," she said, brushing away tears as she sat in a courthouse 
hallway, awaiting a hearing in her nephew's case. 
</P>
<P>
 She could not reconcile the cold killings police described with the nephew she 
said did well at school and was planning to get a summer job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says he's sorry," she said. "I don't think that he believed that what 
would happen would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager is currently in a county juvenile detention center awaiting 
trial. Under California law, he must be tried as a juvenile. That means the 
maximum sentence on conviction would be to serve with the California Youth 
Authority until age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel believes incarceration isn't the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is probably best for everybody's interest is to get this guy some kind 
of treatment to resolve some of the issues he's had," she said. "Because of 
limitations in the youth authority resources, that may not necessarily be the 
best place to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee-Hackney isn't moved by the arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see kids 12 years old acting as (police) lookouts and some sell crack in 
this neighborhood. But there are an awful lot of other 12-year-olds and 13- and 
14-year-olds who live next door to the crack dealers who don't have anything to 
do with them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 40-year-old husband was the first victim. He was shot after being 
confronted in the parking lot of a check-cashing store where his wife worked. 
He staggered back into the building before her horrified eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The second victim, Derrick Wadibia, 41, of Nigeria, was shot about six hours 
later as he sat in his cab a few blocks away. A brother was trying to scrape 
together enough money to ship the body home, Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hackneys had been married for 12 years and were just turning the corner 
from hard times of their own, said Lee-Hackney. They had found a nice house to 
rent and, with the money from her job, were "looking at the day when we 
wouldn't be on welfare at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon of the murder had been filled with the domestic details of 
married life. Her husband stopped by to tell her their car finally passed the 
state-required air pollution test and to get money to pay the electric bill. He 
was on his way to pick up their daughter when he was confronted. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a scream and a shot. Lee-Hackney ran to a window and saw her 
husband's glasses lying on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, she was still absorbing the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still can't believe it," she said. "We had so many things that we were 
going to do."

BIRTH FATHERS FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO HALT ADOPTIONS, GAIN CUSTODY; FAMILIES: FOR

 Meet John and Peggy Stenbeck, a suburban San Diego couple. She is a homemaker; 
he manages a retail store. They have adopted two children -- 4-year-old J.T. 
and 3-year-old Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, they were in the process of adopting Michael, until the boy's 
biological father stepped in to stop the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a story that echoes the notorious Baby Jessica case, the Stenbecks are 
caught up in a legal fight over who should have custody of the boy they have 
reared since he was a day old. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a growing tangle in private adoptions -- biological fathers who demand 
custody when mothers choose to give a child away. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a problem that yields more questions than answers: How do you legislate 
a business whose stock in trade is children? And what are the rights of 
biological fathers? 
</P>
<P>
 "In our society, fathers have been seen as superfluous. Fathers have been 
nothing but breadwinners to the family," said Jon Ryan, a spokesman for the 
National Organization of Birth Fathers and Adoption Reform, who himself spent 
five years searching for his biological daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But stories such as Michael's are forcing the system to pay more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark King had had a brief and stormy relationship with 15-year-old Stephanie 
Harman; it ended with a fight when Harman was five months pregnant. King, who 
has a history of drug abuse, was arrested for hitting her but was never 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, King agreed with Harman that their baby should be adopted by the 
Stenbecks, who knew her family. She moved in with the Stenbecks, gave birth on 
Feb. 27, 1991, and signed the baby over to them. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the time after his breakup with Harman, King had attempted suicide. 
While recuperating, he had a change of heart, and decided to rear his child. A 
day after Michael's birth, he sued for custody. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some differences from the Baby Jessica case. Cara Clausen decided to 
give away her baby without informing the father, Dan Schmidt, that she was 
pregnant. She changed her mind after the birth, and Schmidt, whom she later 
married, asserted his rights. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly three years of court battles, the adoption was overturned. 
Screaming and crying, "Mommy!" 2-year-old Jessica was taken from Jan and 
Roberta DeBoer in Michigan and sent to live with the Schmidts in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome for Michael is still in doubt. A judge has named the Stenbecks 
legal guardians -- while granting King visitation rights -- but King has 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, each parent has to decide, 'What is the best thing for my 
child?' " said Peggy Stenbeck. "And how can that be to pull him out of the only 
home he's ever known? Why ruin a happy, healthy childhood? There's absolutely 
no reason to do that, especially when Mark and the birth mother have always 
been welcome to be part of this family." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, King asserts that he no longer uses drugs, has a steady factory 
job and is willing to do whatever it takes to be a good parent. Michael, he 
says, should be reared by blood relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of other single parents raise children," he has said. "Who says I 
can't do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the last few years, the number of birth-father custody cases has 
increased, legal experts say. There are no national figures kept on such 
lawsuits, but Jane Gorman of the Academy of California Adoption Attorneys says 
about half of her 100 cases involve birth fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase of these cases is "an understandable and healthy consequence of 
the women's movement and the request that fathers become more involved in the 
lives of their children," said Joan Hollinger, an adoption-law expert and 
visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the Stenbeck case, there are at least four such cases in California. 
Of the three that have been decided, judges have tended toward granting greater 
custody rights for birth fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 That trend is alarming to some legal experts and adoption advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rhetoric I'm hearing in California is, 'Because I am the biological 
progenitor of this child, I have a claim to this child that is superior to 
anyone else,' " Hollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollinger, who also is part of a national effort to uniformly update adoption 
law, contends the reasoning "goes back to a totally outmoded conception that a 
child is a piece of chattel, that it can be possessed and owned only by virtue 
of a biological connection." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the four lawsuits, a 1992 case, established legal precedent by allowing 
the civil rights of biological fathers to supersede the legal standard of 
deciding what is in a child's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court, in a sealed lawsuit involving a girl identified only 
as Kelsey S., ruled that an unwed father objecting to adoption must come 
forward as soon as he learns of the pregnancy and offer "a full commitment to 
his parental responsibilities -- emotional, financial and otherwise" to gain 
custody.

POSSUM DEATH STIRS DEBATE OVER CRUELTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opossum and her seven babies made the mistake of crossing in front of 
Steven Garity's car. They got squished. Garity made the mistake of being in 
front of a police car. He got charged with cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 And so began the Great Possum Debate, with people around here sinking their 
teeth into a spirited discussion of animal rights: Are possums such pests that 
you can't be cruel enough to them? Or do they deserve as much respect as any 
other living creature? 
</P>
<P>
 A judge added his opinion last month, dismissing the case and declaring 
Tumwater's animal-cruelty ordinance too vague. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the possum passions in this western Washington town, the last word 
on road-kill morality has yet to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a lawyer and certainly not a judge," said Michael Ellis, director of 
a wildlife rescue center in nearby McCleary. "But I have to say that any human 
being with any sense of humanity would realize that aiming a car at any animal 
and running it over intentionally is cruelty." 
</P>
<P>
 The case began March 31, when police officer Johnna Stevens saw Garity, 39, 
suddenly change lanes and hit a mother possum and the youngsters clinging to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pests," the officer quoted Garity as saying. "All's they do is eat 
dog food and cat food and be a pest. They just hiss at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Garity was accused of intentionally running down the possums and was cited 
under Tumwater's animal-cruelty ordinance, which says it is a crime to 
"purposefully or recklessly subjects any animal to cruel mistreatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The offense carries up to 90 days in jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Garity's attorney, Ken Valz, contended Garity was swerving to miss another 
possum. Valz also argued that the whole case was ludicrous because state 
wildlife officials consider the possum a pest. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited a Department of Natural Resources brochure that tells how to kill a 
"problem" possum: After trapping it, "gently submerge the trap in water for 10 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are astounded that it's gone this far -- that any government 
would prosecute anyone for running over a possum, intentionally or 
unintentionally," Valz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the homely possum -- a beady-eyed, naked-tailed marsupial that looks as if 
nature built it from spare parts -- has its supporters too. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, possums have been the No. 1 topic in the letters section of the 
local paper, the Olympian. Writers have been about evenly split, pro-Garity vs. 
pro-possum. 
</P>
<P>
 Possum sympathizers tend to invoke comparisons to more likable animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's next -- my puppy becomes a pest to someone? Our cat becomes a pest in 
someone's mind? Maybe someday my son will become a pest to someone," wrote 
Laura Perkinson. "Will that someone then decide to just run over any or all of 
these things?" 
</P>
<P>
 Garity's supporters lump possums with all manner of vermin. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you have said if it had been a rat? The opossum is worse than a 
rat in most any way you can think -- larger, more dangerous, and filthy," wrote 
J. Dana Kintner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mina Ensign wrote: "Will some ardent environmentalists soon propose a fine for 
swatting a fly, lest it interfere with the food chain?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Attorney Pat Brock said the case clearly fell under Tumwater's 
animal-cruelty ordinance. He said there are exceptions under state law for 
hunting or for protecting property from pests, and neither applied in this 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 But District Judge C. L. Stilz ruled last month that the ordinance is 
unconstitutional because it doesn't spell out "cruel mistreatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Brock said he will consult with the City Council about what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to think about whether the council wants to regulate the type of 
conduct Mr. Garity wants to engage in," Brock said. "The part of it that 
bothers me -- putting aside the value of opossums as animals -- is that, at a 
minimum, he made a big mess on a road for someone else to clean up."

SEARCHING FOR HEALTH CARE SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am responding to the commentary on health care by Congressman 
(Christopher) Cox, ("Congress and the People Should See the Final Bill Before a 
Vote," July 3). Cox feels that Congress, as well as the nation, should have 
ample time to study the revised bill before a final vote is taken. This is a 
reasonable request. How does it look historically? 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a youngster, I heard debates on the lack of health care for 
Americans. Now I am a grandmother, and the majority of Americans are still 
finding themselves without, or with dubious health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Is health care reform happening too fast, Mr. Cox? For the status quo, any 
change is happening too fast. I suggest that all members of (Congress) be 
deprived of their health care benefits until they have taken the time to 
carefully study the final draft of the bill and can vote in good conscience. 
This may speed up the passing of a universal health plan in my lifetime. 
</P>

<P>
 * Rep. Cox, in his Commentary on Health Care (July 3) writes that neither he 
nor his constituents will be given enough time to understand all of the 
complexities of the National Health Care Reform Act before Congress votes on 
it. It is striking how closely Cox echoes the anguish of Harry and Louise in 
the insurance company ads. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN FERGUSON 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Congressman Cox knows that while he complains about "dauntingly complex" 
health care reform legislation, it is his party's rigid rejection of 
single-payer universal health care that has (made) health care reform 
(complex.) 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reform legislation, with provisions for the federal government to 
pay for all privately provided medical services, could be very simple and 
politically viable. Nearly all employers, health care providers (including 
doctors), senior citizens and veterans, as well as local and state governments 
could readily understand and champion a single-payer medical care initiative. 
Clearly, a majority of working people would welcome a time when changing jobs, 
early retirement, layoffs, and pre-existing conditions would no longer restrict 
health care access. 
</P>
<P>
 How would the federal government finance single-payer medical care? The most 
straightforward, least-costly way is through a payroll-deducted tax. As an 
incentive for individuals to reduce medical costs, the final individual medical 
tax obligation could be computed at the annual income-tax filing where the 
total medical tax withheld would be adjusted by the total medical payments for 
the year. For example: Someone with little or no medical expense would receive 
a generous tax refund; whereas, someone with substantial medical expense would 
not receive any refund.  
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, insurance companies will oppose any legislation that affords 
medical care for every person in the United States who needs it. They will 
argue that escalating costs would quickly overwhelm any cost savings and that 
any government payment of medical services is a form of socialized medicine. 
Everyone should remember, however, that it is the insurance companies that are 
responsible for a health care system that consumes one-seventh of our gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 While Congressman Cox enjoys an excellent health care benefit plan, basically 
paid for by taxpayers, he complains about the difficulties of legislating 
health care reform. He should recognize that, should he become uninsurable, 
single-payer health care would become an urgency overshadowing all imaginable 
legislative difficulties.

BASE CLOSING NOT AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE; EL TORO STORY MAY SERVE AS CAUTIONARY 
TALE IN FUTURE CONSOLIDATION DELIBERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The planning for the future of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is early 
enough in the process that it can't hurt, and might help, to have the Navy 
study the possibility of actually keeping the base open after all. But we 
shouldn't hold our collective breaths, either, that there will be some dramatic 
reversal of fortune. Orange County should carry on with the preparations that 
have begun in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more than raising fresh hopes of keeping the base for military 
purposes, the Navy Department's memo of last month confirmed an earlier rush to 
judgment about the savings that closing the facility might produce. In its June 
1 memo, the Navy invited base commanders to reopen the issue if bases scheduled 
for closure could be deemed necessary either as vital to national defense or as 
too expensive to close.  
</P>
<P>
 When El Toro was being designated for closure, Marine Maj. Gen. P. Drax 
Williams, commander of the station, and others argued that closing the base and 
moving the Marines to Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego did not pencil 
out.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams questioned whether it was wise "to dump 4,600 Marine families on the 
economy in San Diego." Moreover, speaking from a distance and with a bit more 
room for candor, Art Bloomer, a former commanding general at El Toro and a 
former Irvine city councilman, openly declared the decision to close El Toro as 
"a dumb move." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently it has become apparent that it will cost about $1.6 billion to close 
the station. For the record, the Pentagon says keeping El Toro would mean "a 
tough selling job." It would require the Marines to convince both the Defense 
Department and Defense Secretary William Perry, and to ask a 1995 base-closing 
commission to reconsider the matter. Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), 
whose district includes the base, says he thinks the closing will stick.  
</P>
<P>
 And yet, the Navy can't find the money to close the base. And the memo seemed 
to suggest that there was some problem not only with El Toro but also with 
other base closing decisions that may have been made hastily. These bases are 
valuable resources for the nation's defense infrastructure, and they are 
difficult, perhaps impossible, to replace once gone from the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, perhaps the El Toro story may serve as a cautionary tale in 
future base closing deliberations. The rush to consolidate as part of a 
worthwhile cost-saving effort can raise other fiscal questions that may not be 
anticipated at first.

GROWING DEDICATION TO RAIN FOREST IDEAL; VOLUNTEERS HEAD TO COSTA RICA TO HELP 
UC IRVINE PROFESSOR'S RESTORATION PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While many in Orange County are contemplating or embarked on conventional 
summer vacations, or wondering whether they can afford them at all, a group of 
volunteers for researchers at the University of California is actually paying 
for the privilege of working hard, planting and monitoring seedlings and 
studying the soil in Costa Rica.  
</P>
<P>
 If these visitors to the depleted rain forest need inspiration, they have it 
in a remarkable UC Irvine ecology professor, Frances Lynn Carpenter, who bought 
63 acres of degraded cattle pasture land and is fueled herself by a dream, 
restoring some of the decimated earth as part of her extended experiment. She 
hopes to prevent further destruction of rain forests and perhaps lead the way 
for local farmers to invest quickly and economically in trees and reap a cash 
crop of hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 It is fashionable enough to be in favor of rain forests nowadays, but to 
actually lend one's free time and go at personal expense to the front lines 
requires a special kind of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 These volunteers, some of whom reported to Coto Brutus in the southwest of 
Costa Rica near the Panamanian border last week, were moved to lend their 
energies to the project by various motives. But their special blend of idealism 
and pragmatism represents a welcome change in attitudes in an area where 
destruction of the land goes back decades. Their work holds the possibility of 
providing an alternative for local farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's commitment is on an especially high level; she has redesigned her 
career and gone out on a limb financially to bring extra meaning to the 
academic commitment to teaching and research that she already had. 
</P>
<P>
 In this manner, the research component of a local university has taken on a 
special significance for one professor, and provided especially meaningful 
vacation plans for participating volunteers.

TRABUCO CANYON WATER DISTRICT CHARGES ALL WET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the Trabuco Canyon Water District, the issue is an 8,700-square-foot 
operational control center. The water district needs this building to meet the 
staffing requirements of our growing district. Its location adjacent to the 
existing Robinson Ranch sewage treatment plant centralizes the district offices 
and maintenance facilities, which are now scattered around the Saddleback 
Valley. The district religiously complied with all state regulations and 
received county approval for the project. The district was ready to start 
project construction on land it already owns located one-third-mile distant 
from the nearest residence. 
</P>
<P>
 At the last minute, a small group of Trabuco Canyon residents claimed the 
attractively designed and fully landscaped operational control center would be 
an eyesore and opposed it by immediately filing a lawsuit and instituting a 
recall effort against members of the water district board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders of the opposition are making accusations against the water 
district board and management that are misleading at best and, at worst, are 
absolutely false. They claim we didn't provide proper notification. False. (We 
published, posted and also noticed adjacent landowners by mail. We held a 
public meeting, but no one attended.) They claim we doubled its size after 
environmental review. False. They claim the maintenance facility is too small 
and useless. False. (It has been designed for staging and storage.) They claim 
it will increase fire danger. False. (The project has the approval of the 
county Fire Department). They claim this is a "pristine" or "remote" canyon. 
False. (This area is surrounded by graded hillsides and an existing sewer 
plant.) And the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly some of the opponents are truly concerned, but the vocal core see 
this only as an opportunity to further their own political agendas and careers. 
One opposition leader has already stated he wants to get elected to the board 
so he can fire the district management and staff to ostensibly bring in his own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of all these allegations and accusations, the reputations of 
dedicated private citizens who serve on the board and in management are being 
unfairly and maliciously splattered with mud. But the opponents, especially the 
politically motivated ones, don't care. They're carving a political career out 
of the pocketbooks of the district residents. If it wasn't the operational 
control center, it would be something else.

OCTA'S SERVICE PRIORITIES IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Dale Goodman's recent letter "Cutting Seniors' Link to Outside World (June 
26)" makes good points on the need for seniors and persons with disabilities to 
have adequate transportation services. But the letter badly misrepresents 
actions the Orange County Transportation Authority has taken to increase 
mobility in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA is protecting Dial-a-Ride group services for all senior citizens on 
trips to senior centers, to nutrition sites, and to destinations which provide 
these able-bodied seniors with independence. And, by obeying federal law, the 
OCTA is also extending these needed transportation services to the very frail 
elderly, individuals who use wheelchairs, and the persons with disabilities who 
need specialized transportation services. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting priorities with tax dollars is always difficult. But when the OCTA 
Board of Directors voted to fully fund ACCESS service for individuals with 
disabilities, it made a clear and positive statement that the noble rhetoric of 
President Bush's Americans with Disabilities Act would become a reality and 
needed financial resources would be available to preserve and protect 
Dial-A-Ride group services. 
</P>
<P>
 With their compassionate actions to fund ACCESS, the OCTA Board of Directors 
insisted that transportation services would be available to the most vulnerable 
members of our society -- the frail and elderly and persons with disabilities. 
They should be applauded for their wisdom.

NEW LIBRARY NOT THE BEST USE OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Do we need another hard copy of 500,000 existing books? Worse yet, is a 
$35-million library with shelves the best use of our limited education funds? 
</P>
<P>
 I am an executive MBA student at UCI Graduate School of Management.I do not 
underestimate the value of libraries or books. All Orange County and UCI 
students should be proud of our new science library. However, as I was reading 
your article "High-Tech Reference Point" (June 26) the underlying premise 
guiding the actions of our public and school administrators struck me. They act 
as though our libraries need to have all the real books just like they always 
have. Hasn't anyone mentioned the digital world to them?  
</P>
<P>
 If almost every written word will, in the not too distant future, end up 
digitized (one CD-ROM holds 50,000 pages), what will happen to all the 
wonderful buildings designed to hold shelves and books? Renovate? 
</P>
<P>
 So, legislators, planners and administrators -- wake up please. As a taxpayer, 
I do not want to see millions of dollars more spent on supposedly sophisticated 
structures designed for a soon-to-be-obsolete purpose: book storage. 
</P>
<P>
 If everyone is going to have access to the nation's electronic highways where 
everything is digital, do we want the same number and kinds of buildings for 
the next generation of libraries? How many students could have permanent access 
to a computer connected to every book in the world for $35 million? After all, 
it is our money.

WELCOME PROGRESS ON NEW GRAND JURY; ETHNIC MAKEUP OF PANEL BETTER REFLECTS 
AREA'S DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 11 men and eight women of the Orange County Grand Jury who took up their 
one-year terms starting July 1 reflected the demographic makeup of the county 
more than did many of their predecessors. That is welcome progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The current panel has two more Latinos, two more Asians, and one more African 
American than did last year's. The changing makeup is the result of an 
aggressive recruiting campaign by the past grand jury and the Superior Court 
judge who oversaw its operations, Michael Brenner. And that campaign was the 
result of the deserved firestorm that erupted over the 1992-93 panel's call for 
a three-year moratorium on immigration, legal and illegal. That group had only 
two members from minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this year's grand jury is much like previous ones when it comes 
to age: 16 members are retired and the average age is 61. The reason is that 
grand jury service pays $25 a day and the workweek is usually four or five 
days. Most people under 60 must work for a living and cannot afford to perform 
public service for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury that better reflects the diversity of Orange County, where 
minorities now account for more than one-third the population, is necessary 
because members from different backgrounds can bring new insights to problems 
and identify new areas for investigation. Still, the grand jury that ended its 
term June 30 deserves credit for providing valuable public service. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors made the right call in recommending consolidation of the county's 
too numerous water agencies, and trimming the number of all special districts. 
The panel provided a much-needed reality check on crime, too, pointing out that 
the politically popular "three strikes" legislation to put felons behind bars 
for life was appealing but likely to overload the already overcrowded county 
jails, the first stop for criminals. To make room, other criminals likely will 
have to be cut loose early, unless county residents are willing to build a new 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury properly shined a spotlight on the problem of overloaded 
telephone lines at the county Child Abuse Registry, where too many callers 
never got through. The panel also suggested a sensible remedy: Counselors 
required by law to report allegations of child abuse should use facsimile 
machines as much as possible, leaving the phone lines open for neighbors and 
relatives wanting to report abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that civil function of the grand jury, monitoring county government, 
that is so important. The jurors receive hundreds of suggestions a year on 
topics for investigation. The new panel has already heard from the Los Amigos 
of Orange County, a group of Latino educators, business leaders, community 
activists and professionals. Members of Los Amigos directed withering criticism 
at the grand jury report on immigration more than a year ago and then were 
helpful in urging Latinos to volunteer for grand jury service. Other minority 
groups joined the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a wise move, and the groups concerned about the panel's diversity 
should keep tabs on its reports this year. There is nothing wrong with having 
watchdogs monitor the watchdog, and the grand jury can profit from constructive 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the grand jury also can return criminal indictments, prosecutors have 
the option of holding a preliminary hearing to persuade a judge that there is 
enough evidence to require a defendant to stand trial. There is no other 
organized group to keep tabs on government operations, which is why the grand 
jury is so important.

IDEA OF COMPETITIVE POWER FIRMS SCARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As the chief of the Orange County Fire Department, I know well that it was 
Southern California Edison's well-managed size, highly trained personnel and 
enormous system capabilities that enabled power to be restored in record time 
to essential services, homes and businesses throughout areas damaged by the 
recent fires and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 This critical public service role played by all utilities is something that 
must not be taken lightly as the California Public Utilities Commission 
considers a competitive restructuring of the electric utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of numerous competitive companies, more interested in making a 
buck than providing an essential public service, is a scary prospect to those 
of us in emergency service. If not done correctly, restructuring this industry 
will jeopardize the centralized operational efforts necessary to handle natural 
or civil disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 As demonstrated once again during the fires, Edison's ability to quickly mass 
hundreds of utility employees working around the clock to restore power and 
provide additional emergency assistance to millions of homes, hospitals, 
government facilities and emergency services is an enormous stabilizing force 
upon which police, fire and medical personnel have come to depend. 
</P>
<P>
 How could hundreds of new smaller, decentralized electric companies possibly 
do that? 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the CPUC realizes how much we need to rely on having immediate access 
to the utilities' emergency know-how, manpower, facilities and transportation 
operations during times of natural disasters. The CPUC should not dismantle or 
endanger the electric infrastructure that has served us all so well.

PROTESTS DON'T FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I could not help being somewhat amused when I read about Reno Air's 
difficulties in getting permission to fly out of John Wayne Airport. The 
article pointed out that this airline's inability to conduct business here was 
primarily due to restrictions in the number of flights permitted out of John 
Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 It is most interesting that the proponents of "more jobs for Orange County -- 
a new airport at El Toro" are the same voices that bleat "restrict the flights 
and noise" over their sacred ground. How many jobs will continue to be lost by 
artificially limiting flights into and out of John Wayne, an airport already 
built and paid for by the taxpayers? 
</P>

 The sheep's clothing is falling off the wolves.

THE POLITICS OF INCLUSION FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with tired amusement Eileen Padberg's latest rantings that "women" 
are excluded from Orange County politics by a male chauvinist conspiracy headed 
by the chief hobgoblin in Padberg's demonology, (Orange County Republican 
Central Committee Chairman) Tom Fuentes. What nonsense! If Padberg bothered to 
read the Republican Party of Orange County Central Committee's roster of 
members, she'd discover that not only are the majority of them women, but that 
the first vice chairman is also a woman (Dr. Jo Ellen Allen, and the county 
GOP's crucial and effective precinct operation has been headed for years by 
party Treasurer Marcia Gilchrist -- another woman! 
</P>
<P>
 Padberg might also recall that the same Orange County Republicans she 
demonizes helped elect (state) Sen. Marian Bergeson and Assemblywoman Doris 
Allen, and that many, if not most, Orange County legislative staffers like 
myself are women. She might remember that the good and decent Tom Fuentes' 
predecessor, Lois Lundberg, was chairman for eight years. However, I guess none 
of us count, because according to Ms. Padberg, we don't qualify politically as 
"women" unless one is single-mindedly devoted to legalized abortion; we're 
instead viewed as a backward species of throw-back "sub-women." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative women like me who are pro-life and embrace traditional Republican 
positions are inconvenient and embarrassing to pinched fanatics like Eileen 
Padberg because they are well aware that we -- not they -- represent the 
mainstream of Orange County Republican women. Eileen Padberg's fervent support 
for liberal Democrat supervisorial candidate Linda Moulton Patterson is proof 
that she's the one standing firmly outside the Republican Party.

ALL STUDENTS ENTITLED TO LESSONS IN GOOD LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The recent editorial on special education ("Disruptive Children Need 
Education Too," June 26) seeks to advocate good things but misses the mark in 
many places. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement "children with disabilities are entitled to be educated in 
regular classrooms . . . as much as possible" is painfully misleading. The 
Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) does not dictate 
mainstreaming or full inclusion in those terms. Rather, it states that "to the 
maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities . . . are educated with 
children who are not disabled." There are many cases where it would be possible 
to provide a general education classroom for a disabled child, but it would not 
be appropriate as the child would not benefit from that placement. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance between possible and appropriate is ideally struck by constructive 
dialogue between the school district and parents.  
</P>
<P>
 When the experts cannot come to terms, The Times suggests that deference be 
given to the school. This attitude of "the government knows what's best" has 
caused laws such as IDEA to be necessary. The enumeration of the rights and 
protections of the child and the parents has not come about through the actions 
of a beneficent dictator. Instead, a history of acting in a heavy-handed manner 
has forced Congress to place limits on the actions of schools and to make them 
accountable to the parents. Heaven forbid that this should be reversed.

 * What other population of underrepresented students would we dare to require 
to wait for a tax initiative to be fully included? This is a response to the 
article by Alexander Britton, "Resources a Problem in Teaching Disabled (June 
30)." 
</P>
<P>
 It is our firm belief that the democratic system requires equal educational 
opportunity be afforded to all students (including those with disabilities) now 
and not later. It is our country's expectation that our education system will 
provide students with the ability to develop as happy, unprejudiced, 
contributing members of our society. The primary prerequisite to becoming a 
contributing, unprejudiced member of society is to experience and value 
diversity. Therefore, it is critical that all students have the right to 
receive a quality, inclusive education, regardless of their ability level. 
</P>
<P>
 No other minority school population exists in our culture today that is 
required to wait for the legislature to appropriate special funds to integrate 
with their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 We fully agree with Dr. Britton that general education teachers must be better 
prepared to receive and educate students with diverse ability and that class 
sizes must shrink for all students. However, if we wait for more funding to 
fully include students with disabilities, we'll wait forever.

 * Regarding the Jimmy Peters case, I find it interesting that repeated 
articles have focused on Jimmy Peters and his disabilities and behaviors, 
rather than on the school's failure to teach him. Little has been written on 
what the district has done to try and help this child. Inclusion is only as 
good as the process by which it is implemented. The concept is a good one. The 
implementation of the concept can be well-done or poorly carried out, the 
latter of which is what seems to have happened in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of inclusion does not occur overnight. It should include 
disability awareness training for teachers, students, and parents; ongoing 
training for the regular education teacher in specific teaching strategies; 
ongoing behavior management training for the regular education teacher and 
aides, and ongoing specialized consultation services whenever needed. We do not 
know if any or all of this has occurred in this case, because the focus of the 
attention has been on Jimmy and his disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to stop blaming inclusion failures on the child and the severity of 
the disability. Inclusion fails (1) because it is not implemented with the 
commitment to the value of inclusion as an inherent right to integrated 
education for all children, and (2) because of the failure to use effective 
strategies for teaching and managing the behavior of children with 
disabilities.

Pomona.  
</P>
<P>
 * Perhaps you ought to visit classrooms around the county, or state, before 
you write an article so sympathetic to Jimmy Peters. First of all, his father 
is not testing special education student rights to mainstream classes. There 
are many such mainstreamed and fully included students in all school districts, 
at all levels of education. The Circle View school has extended itself in 
helping mainstream education work for this child. Who do you suppose, after 
all, paid for Jimmy to have his own full-time aide? 
</P>
<P>
 In thinking of a learning environment best for this child, it appears clear 
that, despite many interventions attempted by the school, Jimmy was unable to 
learn successfully in a regular classroom. Although Jimmy's father doesn't 
seemed concerned about the educational rights of other students, it doesn't 
appear that very much successful learning was able to take place given the 
amount of instructional time spent doing behavioral interventions for Jimmy.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON CHILD CARE; TAX CREDIT WOULD REMOVE 
FINANCIAL IMPEDIMENT TO ADOPTION; SENATE BILL WOULD HELP PARENTS SURMOUNT HIGH 
INITIAL COSTS, BENEFITING CHILDREN IN NEED OF PERMANENT FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN R. LEWIS, State Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) represents Orange 
County's 33rd District. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Individuals of sturdy character are the building blocks of a civilized 
society, and a stable, loving family is the crucible in which they are forged. 
From birth, children are imbued with their family's values and world view; from 
their parents they learn to acquire virtues and avoid vices. 
</P>
<P>
 It should come as no surprise, then, that the national social degeneration and 
moral decline of the last three decades has coincided with the accelerating 
collapse of the traditional two-parent family. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in a two-parent family gives children a far better chance at 
success in school, career, marriage and parenthood; it is also an advantage 
unavailable to many thousands of children in our state who lack families. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption is a truly compassionate vehicle for extending that advantage to 
unwanted or needy children. Unfortunately, the costs of private adoptions are 
prohibitive for many prospective parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent adoptions (directly between families) typically cost $8,000 to 
$10,000, while private agency adoptions can cost from $10,000 to $30,000. 
Despite this financial impediment, many couples choose to shoulder it in order 
to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the general myth, most adoptive families are not wealthy but, in 
fact, are working-class. While they can handle the day-to-day costs of 
absorbing another child, surmounting the high initial costs can prove 
impossible. Were adoption a less expensive endeavor, it stands to reason that 
even more couples might consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics from the California Department of Social Services reinforce this. 
Sixty-one percent of all parents who put children up for independent adoption 
are single parents, usually mothers. They are typically young (average age 22) 
and low-income and have a high school education at best. Another 10% are young 
birth parents with the same profile who are separating and have decided to give 
up their child for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 The profile of these parents correlates significantly with the profile of many 
receiving public assistance, such as Aid to Families With Dependent Children 
(AFDC). It is logical to assume that many of these adoptions are removing 
children from welfare families and placing them into financially stable 
families. Not only are the sizes of AFDC grants cut back with these removals, 
but the children are far more likely to become productive citizens and less 
likely to enter into intergenerational welfare dependence. 
</P>
<P>
 With regard to foster children, reasons for adopting them into families are 
manifold and compelling. There are approximately 10,000 children in foster care 
with adoption as the goal; the average state payment per foster child is 
$1,096.30 a month, or $13,155.60 a year. Taxpayers would save millions by 
adopting them into loving, stable families. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption is also in the best interest of children in foster care. "The odds of 
moving easily into independence are stacked against foster children," according 
to Richard P. Barth, a UC Berkeley professor and recognized expert on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for a stable family environment is especially acute during the 
adolescent years. A 1983 study found that males in foster care had "strikingly 
more academic and social problems than a comparison group of non-foster youth." 
A recent survey of the homeless in Alameda County found that one-third of them 
had lived in foster homes; similar studies of the homeless in New York and Los 
Angeles revealed that 30% to 40% had been in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conclusions are clear that foster care is a primary source of the 
homeless and that they remain homeless for a long time," Barth said. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be said that we are all grateful to the many selfless and hard-working 
foster parents who do their best to love the children in their care and provide 
them with stable surroundings. Clearly, though, the best foster care is still 
no substitute for the bonding and sense of belonging that comes with membership 
in a family. Foster care is temporary; family is forever. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done? For starters, financial barriers to adoption should be 
lowered. In that spirit, I have introduced Senate Bill 1920, which would 
establish a one-time, per-child tax credit to help adoptive parents. The credit 
would be equal to 50% of the cost of the adoption of an American citizen, to a 
maximum of $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Making adoption a more affordable, and thus feasible, option is not only 
morally good but socially practical. Interestingly, this obvious notion was 
acted on far more thoroughly and effectively a century ago. In his exceptional 
book "The Tragedy of American Compassion," Marvin Olasky points out the 
enlightened attitude toward foster children evident in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compare treatment now -- shuttling from foster home to foster home, or 
growing up in a home without a daddy -- to treatment then, when adoption into a 
two-parent home was a priority preached about in churches and facilitated by a 
lack of bureaucracy," Olasky wrote. "Then, the New York Children's Aid Society 
alone found permanent homes for 70,000, and Jacob Riis (a contemporary liberal 
reformer and poverty fighter) wrote, 'The records show that the great mass, 
with this start given them, become useful citizens.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another contemporary social activist, Charles Brace, wrote of children who 
grow up lacking parental love and guidance: "The faculties of the individual 
are mainly bent on securing support by means other than industry. Cunning, 
deception, flattery and waiting for chances become the means of livelihood. 
Self-respect is lost, and with it go the best qualities of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this very reasonable tax credit is a bargain for all concerned. 
Although the state government will forgo an estimated $7 million, that is a 
pittance in comparison to direct taxpayer savings when a foster child is 
adopted. After all, a onetime credit of $2,500 is cheaper than a $13,000 annual 
foster child subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the myopic, bureaucratic bean-counters cranking the wheels of 
government are unable to grasp this simple concept. Thus, the seat-warmers at 
the state Department of Finance peek from under their green eyeshades and fret 
about "lost" revenue, and the Senate Appropriations Committee ill-advisedly 
bought their argument and restricted the credit to county adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is a beginning. Passage of SB 1920 will place on the books a policy 
tool to strengthen families that can be expanded in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 There are thousands of children in California eligible for adoption. Common 
sense and hard experience dictate that these children be placed into stable, 
loving, permanent families, lest they fall into social pathologies and wind up 
hurting themselves and others and costing taxpayers millions in welfare and 
criminal expenditures. The simple step of lowering the economic barriers to 
adoption -- enactment of SB 1920 -- is a step toward avoiding that situation.

 * Regarding your story (June 28) which told of Bill Knitz's guilty plea to 
criminal conflict-of-interest charges, and your editorial ("Warning About the 
Limousine Life," June 29), I've been following these stories with interest.  
</P>
<P>
 What I don't understand is why neither of the engineering firms which paid out 
these large sums in order to assure million-dollar contracts with the water 
district have not been charged as well. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw recently that a Workers' Comp claims adjuster was criminally charged 
with taking "gratitudes" -- and so was the company which gave them to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't the same section of the statutes apply to MacDonald-Stephens 
Engineers and Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates, the engineering firms 
which I believe have admitted they gave "gratuities"? And if not, why not?

 More on Terns -- The ornithologist who is tracking the terns that nest at 
Bolsa Chica has come up with some preliminary numbers on the current season. 
The numbers confirm the observations of some that the season is progressing 
well despite problems with predators late in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, they look pretty good," said Charles Collins, of Cal State Long 
Beach. The endangered California least tern, which nests on the south island in 
the wetlands preserve, was hard hit, first by a fox, which ate eggs, and then 
by a kestrel, a small hawk species which ate hatched young. Predation problems 
seem to have eased, although it's unclear whether the kestrel is still active. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most encouraging news, Collins reported that many of the least terns 
that lost eggs or young early in the season re-nested and laid new eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tern species, which nest on the north island, are having another strong 
season. The black skimmers are still nesting, but 330 nesting pairs were 
recorded in the most recent survey, compared to 370 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Elegant terns, with about 1,200 pairs, are down slightly from last season, but 
Caspian terns, with 270 pairs, and Forster's terns, at 180 pairs, are both 
running ahead of last season. In just a decade, Bolsa Chica has become a haven 
for several tern species that hadn't nested this far north in decades past. 
</P>
<P>
 Final figures for this season will be released later this month.

ALL-STAR GAME STILL CLEMENTE SHOWCASE; BASEBALL: TWENTY-ONE YEARS SINCE HIS 
POSTHUMOUS INDUCTION INTO THE HALL OF FAME, WHERE HE FINALLY ACHIEVED EQUAL 
FOOTING WITH GAME'S GREATS, PIRATE STANDOUT IS REMEMBERED.

 Ken Griffey could hit two home runs, and this All-Star game would not be his. 
Randy Johnson could strike out all nine batters he faces, and it would not be 
his. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseen yet undeniable star of the 1994 All-Star game won't get a hit, 
won't steal a base, won't get a single at-bat. Instead, he will bring to 
baseball's showcase a majestic and regal presence, an aura that has graced only 
a chosen few. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffeys, Bagwells and Bondses will not walk beside him in Three Rivers 
Stadium, where his motivation came not from contract incentives, but an intense 
Latin pride and machismo. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one years since his posthumous induction into the Hall of Fame, where 
he finally achieved the equal footing with the game's greats, Roberto Walker 
Clemente will again be an All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh Pirates will utilize the stage of baseball's 
biggest show to introduce a new generation of fans to No. 21 -- an athlete who 
was not only larger than life, but was revealed to be an even bigger man in 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it will be only in the mind, but for one star-filled night, Clemente 
will again pick a runner off first with a blind, frozen-rope throw from the 
right-field corner, will again contort and crane his neck in a home-plate 
regimen before unleashing another line drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve times during a Pirates career that began in 1955 and ended prematurely 
in 1972, Clemente made the All-Star game his personal showcase, one he shared 
with the more popular, more publicized players of his era: Mickey Mantle, 
Willie Mays, Hank Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it will be Clemente's game again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do something to make this All-Star game even more special, so it 
was obvious to us that Roberto Clemente had to be a part of this game," said 
Steve Greenberg, the Pirates' vice president of marketing. "An All-Star game is 
special, but Roberto Clemente will make this a very special event." 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelike Clemente statue whose $300,000 cost was covered by fan donations 
will be unveiled at Three Rivers' main entrance. His image also appears on 
T-shirts, glasses, calendars, buttons, pennants and stamps licensed by the 
Pirates and Clemente's wife and three sons. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two newly issued Clemente books, two TV specials in Pittsburgh 
commemorating Clemente's life and career, and a newly released video. Two 
restaurant chains are marketing Clemente drinking glasses and holograms, and a 
cereal maker issued a limited edition Clemente box. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pirates began licensing Clemente articles, they soon realized how 
popular he remains more than two decades after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is frightening, really," said Roberto Clemente Jr., who returned to 
Pittsburgh to run the Baseball Is Great program that is reintroducing baseball 
to inner-city youth. "What is happening in Pittsburgh is overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps, unprecedented. Clemente is more popular today than when he got 
his 3,000th and last hit on Sept. 30, 1972 -- only three months and a day 
before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates' right fielder from 1955-72, Clemente won four batting titles, 
batted .317 for his career, won 12 Gold Glove awards and hit in all 14 World 
Series games he played for the champion 1960 and 1971 Pirates. A 12-time 
All-Star and the 1966 National League most valuable player, Clemente died with 
four others in a Dec. 31, 1972, plane crash while carrying relief supplies to 
earthquake-stricken Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente's throwing arm was so strong, so unerringly accurate, he once did the 
impossible by throwing Mays -- yes, THE Willie Mays -- out at first on what 
appeared to be a routine single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Pirates have won another World Series and six division championships 
since Clemente's death, they still have not recovered fully from the loss. 
Clemente is to the Pirates what DiMaggio and Mantle are to the Yankees, what 
Mays is to the Giants -- a man who epitomizes what baseball is all about and 
how it should be played. 
</P>
<P>
 "He walked a little taller than most men," said Willie Stargell, the Hall of 
Famer who shared the Pirates' outfield with Clemente for 10 years. "He had an 
eternal flame burning inside of him whenever he stepped on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente, who would have been 60 on Aug. 18, was an enormous star in 
Pittsburgh, and his popularity was unquestioned. But he also played in a time 
when racism was prevalent and some fans -- and, it seems, even some teammates 
-- disliked him merely for the color of his skin. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 10 years, Clemente couldn't stay in the same spring training hotels 
as his white teammates, some of whom privately criticized him for inventing 
invisible injuries so he could skip an occasional game, for hanging out with 
other Latin players, and for speaking Spanish so his English-only speaking 
teammates wouldn't know what he was discussing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest misunderstanding with Clemente was not that he was black, but 
that he was Latin," said former Pirates pitcher and broadcaster Nellie King. 
"We didn't understand Latins." 
</P>
<P>
 And some fans didn't understand that Clemente belonged in that same, small 
elite circle as Mays and Aaron -- players who come along perhaps once in a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente's true greatness was not realized until after his death -- when his 
on-field performance and off-field benevolence could be added up, summarized, 
chronicled and critiqued. Only then did many recognize the charitable work he 
did, the dream he had of building a Roberto Clemente Sports City in his native 
Puerto Rico, a complex that his wife, Vera, operates today. 
</P>
<P>
 That dream lives on, and, at least in Pittsburgh and Puerto Rico, so does the 
spirit of Clemente.

MONDESI GOING TO HEAD OF CLASS; BASEBALL: ROOKIE DRIVES IN FOUR RUNS TO FUEL 
8-3 VICTORY OVER THE METS. PIAZZA ADDS HIS 21ST HOME RUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He is ever the rookie, Raul Mondesi, delightful most of the time and wildly 
inconsistent at others, but never because of lack of effort. Each day, Manager 
Tom Lasorda reminds him where to hit the ball and how not to swing at bad 
pitches. Nearly every game, he is coached by Brett Butler in the outfield, who 
praises him, admonishes him, teaches him. 
</P>
<P>
 And one thing has become clear -- Mondesi is a good student. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, Mondesi reached new heights, driving in four 
runs in the Dodgers' 8-3 victory over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mike Piazza's home run over the right-center-field fence broke a 1-1 tie 
in the sixth inning, Mondesi hit a two-run homer that barely cleared the 
395-foot sign in right center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I've spent a lot of hours with this guy, Reggie (Smith) and I 
have, long after everybody was gone in spring training," Lasorda said of 
Mondesi. "I'd like to have a penny for every ball I've thrown to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the Mets scored two more runs in the top of seventh to move within 
one run, Mondesi rifled a two-run shot down the left-field line for a double. 
In the eighth, Henry Rodriguez also hit a two-run homer, a towering shot that 
landed in the seats barely inside the right-field foul pole. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory put the Dodgers five games ahead of the Colorado Rockies atop the 
National League West and ensured them of a winning home stand. They have won 
two of the three series played over the 14-game stretch and are certain of at 
least a split against the Mets when they play their final game before the 
All-Star break today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit the long ball tonight and hit the ball the way we can and are supposed 
to hit," Lasorda said. "We haven't been hitting well this home stand, but our 
pitching has kept us in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored their first four runs against a left-hander, beating Mike 
Remlinger (0-3), who was perfect against the first 10 batters. But in the 
sixth, Piazza led off by hitting a ball that soared as high as the flag poles 
in center field before landing about five rows beyond the 395 sign at the edge 
of the right-field pavilion. It was his second homer in two games, giving him 
21 this season and four in the last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this guy does never surprises me," Lasorda said. "I've got four guys in 
that picture on that wall who hit 30 or more homers, and they didn't reach the 
seats the way this guy does." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach followed Piazza with a walk before Mondesi hit his 15th homer, 
making up for a wild throw he made in the top of the sixth that allowed the 
Mets to tie the score, 1-1. As he walked to home plate to bat in the bottom of 
the inning, he was met with a mixture of boos and slight applause from the 
crowd of 39,589. Then he went on to redeem himself.  
</P>
<P>
 "I try to throw the ball to the base all the time," said Mondesi, who is 
batting .324 with 49 runs batted in. "Rafael (Bournigal) said I throw the ball 
too hard; it's not my fault I throw so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ramon Martinez (8-5) was having another solid outing, giving up 
only two hits and striking out seven until the sixth, when a one-out walk to 
Jose Vizcaino turned into an unearned run on Mondesi's throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been exercising, doing upper-body work for the first time, and I feel so 
strong every time I'm out there," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez got into trouble in the eighth and was relieved by Kevin Gross, sent 
in to get some work before the All-Star break. Gross held the Mets to one hit 
and a walk the rest of the way, earning his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez has pitched seven innings or more in 11 of 18 starts and reached at 
least the eighth inning in eight starts, including three complete games. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years when Martinez won a total of 37 games, his fastball was 88 to 
96 m.p.h. He lost some velocity for a couple of years but this year is closer 
to his old form, his fastball consistently going between 88 and 94 m.p.h.

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; BAGGIO MAKES A LAST-MINUTE DECISION AGAIN; 
ITALY: STAR FORWARD COMES THROUGH WITH A LATE GOAL FOR THE SECOND GAME IN A 
ROW. SPAIN IS THE VICTIM THIS TIME, 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The bedsheet flapped wildly through the afternoon mist, its black lettering 
framed by hundreds of bouncing bodies and answered prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vola Roby Baggio, Vola."  
</P>
<P>
 In Italian, vola means fly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dialect of the 1994 World Cup, Baggio means little miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 For a second consecutive game, Roberto Baggio awoke in the final minutes to 
carry exhausted, cramped Italy to a better place Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 His game-winning goal, in the 88th minute, gave the Italians a 2-1 victory 
over Spain in the World Cup quarterfinals before 54,605 at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 After juking the goalkeeper, Baggio's perfect strike from six yards at a near 
impossible angle eluded a sliding defender and sent the diminutive, ponytailed 
hero into a somersault. 
</P>
<P>
 And the crowd into a bleacher-rattling uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 And Spain into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tragedy," forward Julio Salinas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot describe it to you," goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta said softly. "It 
is just something you have to live through." 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians somehow found the words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was criticizing us, everybody wanted us to bench Roberto Baggio, 
everybody was saying things about (Coach Arrigo) Sacchi," said Antonio 
Matarrese, president of the Italian Soccer Federation. "But we are now at the 
peak of world soccer. . . . so there! " 
</P>
<P>
 After winning only one of their three first-round games, the Italians are only 
one game from the final. 
</P>
<P>
 They will compete in the semifinals Wednesday at Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N.J., against the winner of today's game between defending champion 
Germany and Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 If the opponent is Germany, the battle will be enormous and historic, matching 
teams with two of the top three all-time World Cup records. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is fine with the Italians. They say they want the Germans to be tough. 
They want the temperature to be 90 degrees and their own hamstrings to ache. 
</P>
<P>
 And they say they want to be either tied or trailing going into the final 
minutes . . . because that is all they have known. 
</P>
<P>
 Their only first-round victory, over Norway, came on a goal by Dino Baggio (no 
relation to Roberto) in the 69th minute with his team playing one man short. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second round last week, Roberto Baggio, voted best player in the world 
in 1993, scored in the final minute of regulation and again in overtime to give 
them a victory over Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 And now this , this victory engineered by two of the few remaining Italians 
who in those final dehydrating moments could still walk normally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out this tournament suffering," said Giuseppe Signori, who set up 
Roberto Baggio's goal. "I think we will suffer until the very end. I guess we 
just like it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spaniards, who have won only six of 23 meetings (there have been eight 
ties) between these old rivals, feel they have suffered enough. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in three months that something like this has happened 
to them. The professional team from Barcelona, featuring nine of these players, 
was whipped by AC Milan in the European Champions Cup game in May. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, they say bitterly, it should be obvious the Italians are more blessed 
than good. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they were trying to tell them that in the final moments of this 
defeat, when an elbow by Italy's Mauro Tassotti caught Luis Enrique in the face 
and broke his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique and Italian defender Alessandro Costacurta began shoving each other. 
Then Fernando Hierro jumped into Costacurta's face and began shouting and 
pointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it was Jorge Otero's turn to bump Costacurta and scream. 
</P>
<P>
 After 60 years of grudge matches, the sniping continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost, but not because of the way we played," Salinas said. "We lost 
because of bad luck. We dominate Italy in the second half, we control the game. 
But they get the one play." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Spaniards blew their one play, five minutes before the game-winning 
goal, when Salinas found himself one on one with Italian goalkeeper Gianluca 
Pagliuca five yards from the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas hesitated for an instant, undecided whether to go left or right. It 
was all the time Pagliuca needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The goalkeeper charged, forcing Salinas to punch it straight and off 
Pagliuca's foot, the ball and Spain's chances bouncing harmlessly away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will live with that for the rest of my life," Salinas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he and his teammates must live with what happened late in a game that 
they were dominating. 
</P>
<P>
 After being outplayed in the first half, falling behind, 1-0, on a 27-yard 
bullet shot by Dino Baggio in the 26th minute, the Spaniards toughened and tied 
the score in the 59th minute on a 17-yard shot from Jose Luis Caminero. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, which had three fewer days' rest before this game, suddenly looked 
haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spaniards, who took only four shots in the first half, only two from 
inside the penalty area, suddenly had three good shots in a span of three 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the second half we had command," Spanish Coach Javier Clemente said. "The 
Italians only had one opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 But look what they did with it. Catching Spain with seven men on the attack -- 
Clemente is one coach who was not playing for penalty kicks -- Dino Baggio 
lofted a beautiful pass across midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Signori, who started the game on the bench, picked the ball out of the air 
with his feet and turned that pass into another beautiful pass just before 
being tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the pass that Roberto Baggio found. The Spaniards claimed he was 
offside. But they also admitted he is awfully quick. 
</P>
<P>
 Running from defender Abelardo Fernandez, Baggio found himself on the right 
side with only the goalkeeper in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting until Zubizarreta had come out to challenge, he swiftly dribbled past 
him, jumping over the goalkeeper's left leg and racing for the corner of the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Fernandez could cover the net, Baggio shot, and Italians will 
spend the next four years talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goalkeeper made the right choice to come out," Baggio said. "I had to 
wait to find the right spot." 
</P>
<P>
 He found that spot, but it wasn't on a soccer field: It was in hundreds of 
thousands of Italian hearts. Two more games like this, and he will be there for 
good.

MORNING BRIEFING: WITH TIGER WOODS, ETHNICITY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER

 Tiger Woods, the three-time national junior golf champion from Cypress who 
will play for Stanford next year, is often touted as being potentially the next 
great black professional golfer, but Woods told San Jose Mercury News columnist 
Dan Hruby that his race is often misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'm three-fourths Asian," Woods said. "I'm mostly Thai and a little 
Chinese. And I'm one-fourth black. When I go to Thailand, they call me a Thai. 
In this country, I'm called a black. So it is a little confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger's father, Earl, spelled it out more specifically: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tiger is really one-half Thai, one-quarter Chinese, one-eighth white, 
one-sixteenth Shawnee American Indian and one-sixteenth black."

ANGELS GET RARE BLOWOUT; BASEBALL: LEFTWICH WINS AS BAVASI WATCHES CLOSELY 
DURING 10-5 VICTORY OVER THE YANKEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He sat incognito in the press box Saturday afternoon, wearing dark sunglasses 
and a colorful shirt, canvassing the events on the field below him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of game Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi had envisioned would 
occur more often this season. Not that he expects the Angels to beat the New 
York Yankees, 10-5, every time, but then again, it shouldn't be so 
extraordinary when they finally win, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us thought we'd be at this point," Bavasi said. "We have 
no choice now but to view .500 as a target point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, considering our record, that may be a lofty target." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a painful admission. Bavasi had believed this team would contend in the 
American League West and believed it had as much chance as anyone to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, he is still correct. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are only six games behind the division-leading Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that they also happen to have the worst record in the American 
League, 37-51, on pace for the worst finish in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get on a streak real quick," said Angel starter Phil Leftwich 
(4-7), who won his first game in six weeks. "And for that to happen, it's going 
to take a couple of pitchers to get on a roll. We've got to give our hitters a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time since Leftwich's last victory on May 27 that his 
teammates gave him a chance. No pitcher in baseball has been victimized by 
lower run support, with the Angels averaging 3.43 runs in his 15 starts, 
including only five runs in his previous four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, who sat in awe on the bench watching the pregame ceremonies, 
introducing the likes of Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford, might 
have been more stunned by seeing his teammates finally score runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite stranding a season-high 14, the Angels overcame a 3-0 deficit by 
scoring five runs in the fifth inning, three more in the seventh and two in the 
eighth. The Yankees made four errors, hit four batters, and left the crowd of 
42,521 at Yankee Stadium wishing it was still watching the old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so enthralled by the old-timers' game that it got me pumped up," said 
Leftwich, who talked with former Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson. 
"Everyone said that when you get to Yankee Stadium, you get a certain feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt that way until today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have guys come into town, see that they're facing (Mark) 
Langston, (Chuck) Finley and Leftwich, and say, 'That's going to be a tough 
series.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich, who gave up four hits and struck out seven in seven innings, is 
emerging as a solid No. 3 pitcher on the Angel staff. Having taken away any 
urgency for Bavasi to find another starter, the most pressing concern now might 
be first baseman J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, batting .187, found himself in a mild controversy Saturday when Yankee 
starter Scott Kamienicki accused him of being afraid to swing at pitches. Twice 
he hit Snow with pitches, the last one forcing in a run in the fifth inning, 
and ridiculed him afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't look like he wanted to swing the bat," Kamienicki said. "He looked 
like he wanted to get hit. The way he's hitting, he should be glad he got an 
RBI." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Snow: "Did he really say that? Come on, that's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still hope that Snow, who has only nine RBIs, can be the player who 
batted .343 with six homers and 17 RBIs last April. If he continues to struggle 
through July, sources say, the Angels strongly will consider bringing up 
triple-A left fielder Garret Anderson to play first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of options right now," Bavasi said, "and that's just one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not done here with this club. There will be changes, and you just try 
to fix it one piece at a time."

 ". . . As far as I'm concerned, a person has to be a complete idiot to sit in 
front of the TV and watch 22 players running back and forth on the field 
tripping over each other for 1 1/2 to two hours. I haven't seen such fancy

 How consuming is soccer in countries where it is king? 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the time difference, Italy's games have been played at awkward 
hours for Italian fans.Two started in prime time in Rome at 10 p.m., and the 
other three, including Saturday's quarterfinal against Spain, in early evening 
when shops are open. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a country of 57 million, each of Italy's first four games -- against 
Ireland, Norway, Mexico and Nigeria -- drew a television audience of between 
22.5 million and 25 million viewers. That represents as many as 85% of TV sets 
in the country turned on during the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive, but five prime-time Italian appearances in the Italia 90 Cup drew 
bigger audiences. The most-watched game in Italian history came that year in 
the penalty-kick loss to Argentina, which attracted nearly 30 million viewers 
and 87% of people watching television. WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO

 They can't tabulate World Cup statistics enough. A recent survey from Dallas 
reports that, while the German team stayed at the posh Mansion on Turtle Creek, 
the players demanded lots and lots of cornflakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans, apparently, wolfed the flakes down by the caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in the 36 hours the Germans stayed at the mansion, they consumed 32 
cases of Perrier and six cases of apple juice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis? Statistics now available reveal the Hotel Crescent Court in Dallas 
booked 36 rooms from the 49-man entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the rooms were set aside for prayer. Each player reportedly visited 
one of the three rooms daily to face Mecca. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Weather played a big role in the Italy-Spain game. When the game began at 
noon, the sky was totally overcast, there was barely a breath of wind and the 
humidity was officially listed at 100%.By early in the second half, both teams 
were exhausted and Italy's coach, Arrigo Sacchi, even admitted that, while his 
game plan was to go all out for 90 minutes, his team just couldn't and was 
thoroughly outplayed after halftime by Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour after the game, the clouds lifted, the sun broke through and a 
light wind began breathing some life into the Foxboro area that had been, for 
Spain and Italy and 54,605 fans, a three-hour oven. BILL DWYRE

 Brazil's greatest soccer victory in 16 years was less than an hour old and 
there was Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira behind the microphone, again playing 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira, who has been hammered all tournament by critics, responded to the 
biggest of them all -- Brazilian legend Pele, who has dismissed Parreira's 
brand of soccer as "too European" and lacking true Latin finesse and elan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a great deal of misunderstanding," Parreira said when asked 
about Pele's charge. "We have never played and we do not pretend to play 
European style. We play with a flat back four. We don't use the long ball. We 
don't use man-to-man marking. The only thing we try to do is organize the team 
when it doesn't have the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team has what it takes to be world champion. We try to achieve balance 
between offense and defense. Anything else is just a lot of stories." MIKE 
PENNER

 "Whatever the outcome of (today's) quarterfinals against Sweden, it will be a

<P>
 "The success of the Romanian team, which went to the U.S. as a rank outsider, 
has at last given this Balkan country something to celebrate after nearly five 
years of bruising market reforms and rising poverty and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole country seems to have been caught up by soccer fever. With each 
victory, more and more ecstatic Romanians have taken to the streets and danced 
till dawn in the biggest demonstrations since the overthrow of Stalinist 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Romania's leaders have cashed in, giving lengthy television interviews on 
soccer tactics and firing off telegrams to the U.S. to congratulate the team on 
Romania's greatest sporting success since the victory of gymnast Nadia Comaneci 
in the 1976 Olympic Games.

 " 'Our dear ones, no one can describe the immense joy you have brought to the 
souls of the Romanians in that memorable night of July 3,' messaged Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, an ardent soccer fan, after last Sunday's 3-2 
victory over Argentina.

 And not only for Italians.

 After answering questions for 45 minutes, Berlusconi met with Russian

 French President Francois Mitterrand was trying to cut another news conference

 "Individuals, rather than teams, have made the firmest impact (on the World 
Cup). Kevin Keegan (an English commentator) has mentioned the red-goateed U.S. 
defender Alexi Lalas in TV dispatches and believes 'he is so genuine and such a 
leader by example on the field I could see him making a good living in the 
British premier division. He's the type of player who looks good in England.' "

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; RAPP WILDLY MISSES NO-HITTER FOR MARLINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Rapp was throwing the ball all over the place, but the Colorado Rockies 
weren't hitting it anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapp took a no-hitter into the seventh inning Saturday night before Mike 
Kingery hit a two-run homer -- Colorado's only hit -- with two out as the 
Florida Marlins defeated the Rockies, 4-2, at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapp (5-5) got the first two outs in the seventh before walking pinch-hitter 
John Vander Wal -- Rapp's club-record eighth walk. Kingery followed by hitting 
Rapp's 3-1 pitch over the wall in right for his third homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapp, who struck out six, was removed for John Johnstone, who finished the 
eighth. The Marlins are one of four teams never to have a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired, but I had to challenge him," said Rapp, who threw 125 pitches. 
"I didn't want to walk a ninth guy. I was just trying to get outs; if the 
no-hitter came, it came." 
</P>
<P>
 Robb Nen pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save to complete the combined 
one-hitter, the first in Marlin history. Despite Rapp's wildness, the Rockies 
weren't selective at the pate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was wild, but just wild enough to get guys chasing at bad pitches," 
Colorado Manager Don Baylor said. "It really set up his breaking ball. Some of 
our guys were just waving at pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Freeman (7-2) gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Steve Scarsone led the attack as the Giants 
handed all-star pitcher Danny Jackson his first road loss of the season at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarsone had two hits, scored twice and drove in a run in support of William 
VanLandingham (4-1). Rod Beck got the final four outs for his 18th save, 
sending the Phillies to their fifth consecutive loss, matching their worst run 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (11-3) was 6-0 with a 3.16 earned-run average in eight previous road 
starts. He gave up three runs, two earned, and 10 hits over six innings. He 
struck out eight and walked two, one intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, one for 15 lifetime against Jackson, did not start for the 
first time in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, St. Louis 3 -- Fred McGriff's two-run home run made Tom Glavine a 
10-game winner before the All-Star break for the fourth consecutive year at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Glavine (10-7), gave up eight hits and three runs in eight innings for his 
third win in a row. He struck out seven and walked one. Greg McMichael struck 
out the side in the ninth for his 18th save. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff broke a 3-3 tie in the sixth inning when he knocked in David Justice 
with his 23rd homer against Omar Olivares (1-1).  
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, Pittsburgh 3 -- Hal Morris drove in two runs and pitcher Jose 
Rijo doubled and scored the game-winner as the Reds extended the Pirates' 
misery at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates have lost nine consecutive games at Riverfront Stadium since July 
2 of last year. They've also lost four in a row overall and eight of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Rijo (8-4) gave up homers to Jay Bell and Dave Clark to account for all of the 
Pirates' runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Houston 3 -- Sammy Sosa drove in three runs and Anthony Young won 
for the first time in eight starts in the Cubs' victory at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Young (4-6) gave up one run and three hits in five innings. He left early 
because of a strained right elbow.  
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, San Diego 1 -- Larry Walker hit a two-run home run in the sixth 
inning and the Expos remained unbeaten against the Padres this season, at San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's 16th home run broke a 1-1 tie as the Expos improved to 8-0 overall 
against the Padres. In the last two years Montreal has won 18 of 20 games 
against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Henry (6-1) held San Diego to one run and six hits in 7 2/3 innings. 
Scott Sanders (3-6) suffered the loss.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ROUNDUP; A SILVER LINING FOR PIEXOTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Piexoto played a significant role in the longest men's volleyball match 
of the Olympic Festival on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He also played what he called "one of the best matches of my entire life." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't enough to help the East, which lost to the North in the 
gold-medal match. Behind 44 kills by Brigham Young's Scott Larkin, the North 
won a match with 111 rallies, 16-14, 8-15, 15-12, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Baer, the former Northridge star who was the East's top hitting threat 
from the back row, aggravated an already ailing hamstring injury when he 
vaulted over his team's bench in pursuit of a ball during the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough for Baer, but thoroughly enjoyable for a standing-room only crowd of 
3,350 that sold out the Washington University Fieldhouse. The match featured 
unusually spirited play for a Festival match, even one for a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take some of the best players in college and you should expect that," 
said Piexoto, a CSUN senior. "There was great intensity. No one wanted to go 
home a loser. When you play for a gold medal, you play with a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The East fought off eight match points and appeared to have taken a 16-15 
advantage in the fourth game before a linesman's call was overruled by the 
umpire from across the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a reprieve, the North scored the final two points of the match, the last 
coming when Piexoto hit long. Paul Severns, from Glendale and Loyola Marymount, 
had nine kills, four blocks and eight digs for the North. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his injury, Baer finished the tournament with 53 kills. Piexoto added 
37, and had 34 digs and 12 blocks. For the North, Severns made 26 kills and 21 
blocks. Doug Hughes of Moorpark had 23 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bronze-medal match, former Northridge middle blocker Craig Hewitt had 
13 kills, but the West was routed by the South, 15-7, 15-5, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt, from Chatsworth, hit at a .550 clip. In four Festival games, Hewitt 
had 34 kills and 11 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In table tennis, Anita Zakharyan of Glendale advanced to the quarterfinals by 
breezing through three singles elimination matches without losing a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Zakharyan, ranked fourth in the nation, also won a silver medal in doubles. 
Lily Yip of Metuchen, N.J. and Kristey Reed of Enola, Pa., downed Zakharyan and 
Ann Alvarez from East Brunswick, N.J., 21-10, 21-12, in the gold-medal match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's competition, Masaru Hashimoto of Pacoima was defeated in all 
three of his preliminary singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, Randy Wolf had two hits, a run and got a save as the West earned 
its first victory, 8-5, beating the East at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Richards of Thousand Oaks finished sixth in the decathlon with 7,012 
points, 638 behind the winner, Rick Barker of Euless, Tex.

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY; WOODSIDE IS THE MAIN MAN FOR THE THIRD TIME IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sean Woodside moved into the lead on the sixth lap and pulled away for his 
third consecutive Sportsman main event victory Saturday night at Saugus 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car was awesome tonight," said Woodside, who entered the night with a 
two-point lead over Pat Mintey Jr. atop the standings."It was really hooked up. 
Anyone in the stands could have driven it and won tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside wasted little time proving his point. Just seven laps into the race, 
the Saugus resident shot past Lee Ladd of Thousand Oaks and pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladd was second, followed by Simi Valley's Craig Rayburn and Gary Sigman of 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintey, who last week vowed not to return to Saugus after an incident 
involving Woodside during the main event, did not race. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pro Stock division, Gerrit Cromsigt of Pine Mountain Club broke the 
track record during qualifying and went on to win both the oval and figure-8 
main events. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 25-lap oval feature, Cromsigt was outside on the third row in an 
inverted start, but quickly showed the speed that enabled him to post a 17.54 
qualifying time, which broke Scott Dinger's track record mark by .08 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-lap trophy dashes were won by Nick Joanides of Woodland Hills (Sportsman), 
Richard Smith of Reseda (Pro Stock oval) and Rusty Stewart of North Hollywood 
(Pro Stock figure-8).

WESTLAKE-ROYAL STAYS A STEP AHEAD OF THE SQUEEZE TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first they seemed like three waste-of-time pickoff throws, the kind that 
make some people think baseball games are boring. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as it turned out, those throws to third in the top of the ninth inning 
were the keys to Westlake-Royal's 4-3 victory over Newbury Oaks in an American 
Legion District 16 game Saturday at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 The throws revealed to Westlake-Royal coaches that Newbury Oaks would try a 
squeeze with the tying run at third, so they called a pitchout and recorded a 
key out.  
</P>
<P>
 With Westlake-Royal leading, 4-3, Newbury Oaks had the bases loaded with one 
out. Reliever Keith Loitz threw to third three times, not trying to pick off 
Quincy Samora, but trying to get a peek at which way he was leaning. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first two throws, Samora leaned toward home, as if preparing to break 
toward the plate. On the third, he went straight back to the bag. "I figured 
they might have called off (the squeeze)," said Westlake-Royal assistant Ed 
Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
 Loitz threw a pitchout. Samora, who had broken for the plate, was caught in a 
rundown. Ultimately both Samora and Andy Wilson, the runner from second, wound 
up at third. Catcher Ben Lemos tagged them both, and Wilson was out. 
</P>
<P>
 Loitz walked the batter, Ray Clinton, to reload the bases, but John Shaw 
grounded into a forceout to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 First-place Westlake-Royal (17-3-1, 13-1 in district play) swept the 
three-game season series with Newbury Oaks (11-4, 9-4).

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; RANGERS' REST TURNS TIGERS INTO THE WEARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes less is more. For the Texas Rangers, it turned out to be a whole lot 
more Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers skipped batting practice in favor of an extra hour of sleep, then 
bombed the Tigers, 10-4, with an 18-hit attack that included home runs by Juan 
Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers arrived in Detroit at 5 a.m. Friday and were tired in their 7-3 
loss to Detroit that night. That prompted Manager Kevin Kennedy to cancel 
batting practice on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really needed some sleep," Kennedy said. "I decided to give the guys an 
extra hour, and you can see how it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers (10-4) took care of the rest, pitching three-hit ball for seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 4, Minnesota 3 -- Dennis Martinez earned his seventh consecutive 
victory and Eddie Murray hit a two-run home run, lifting the Indians at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (8-4) retired the Twins in order only once in his seven innings, but 
still extended his streak of starts without a loss to 11. He allowed six hits 
in seven innings, struck out seven and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 8, Oakland 7 -- Jeffrey Hammonds homered leading off the ninth 
inning as the Orioles rallied from a five-run deficit at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Palmeiro had three hits, scored twice and drove in a run for the 
Orioles, who have won six of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 7, Boston 4 -- Edgar Martinez hit two solo home runs and Tino Martinez 
hit a three-run homer to give pitcher Chris Bosio his first road win of the 
year at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, the top choice in the 1993 draft, got his 
first major league hit and stolen base in the fourth inning. He had two singles 
in four at-bats and also reached on third baseman Scott Cooper's error. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosio (4-10) is 3-2 with a 2.84 earned-run average at home but was 0-8 on the 
road before defeating Boston. Sergio Valdez (0-1) made his first start of the 
season, replacing Roger Clemens, who is nursing a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 11, Milwaukee 7 -- Frank Thomas hit his 32nd homer and drove in five 
runs at Milwaukee, as the White Sox won their fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas went three for five with two doubles and Norberto Martin and Tim Raines 
each had three hits for the White Sox. Greg Vaughn drove in three runs for the 
Brewers, who have lost five of their last six. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Kansas City 4 -- Pat Hentgen won his fifth consecutive decision by 
pitching seven strong innings and the Blue Jays stopped their seven-game home 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen (11-5), who improved to 3-0 against Kansas City this season, gave up 
two runs and six hits and struck out nine.

<P>
 Van Nuys East scored 18 runs in the second inning, then took the rest of the 
day off in an 18-1 victory over Burbank North in a District 20 game. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, Woodland Hills West scored 16 runs in the second inning of 
a game against Granada Hills West. West settled for a 16-5 victory before 
coming back to win, 16-10, in the second game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 Even North Hollywood (2-15) got into the act, trouncing Van Nuys South, 24-6, 
in the second game of a doubleheader after South won the opener, 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
 In other District 20 games: 
</P>

 Sun Valley 2-6, Sunland-Tujunga 1-1 -- Sam Viscarra drove in the winning run 
in the sixth inning of the opener.

 Burbank South 2, Verdugo Hills 1 -- Eli Albertson doubled home Anthony 
Fabrizio with the winning run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Virgenes 9-4, Granada Hills East 3-2 -- Solid pitching by Brandon Cohen 
and Tanner Trosper gave Las Virgenes a sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North 13-0, Encino 3-2 -- Chris Hebert pitched a five-hit shutout and 
Encino (13-3) salvaged a split. Valley North (11-6) scored 10 runs in the first

SLUMPING SPLASH MANAGES TO GET BY CAROLINA; SOCCER: ANAHEIM SURVIVES SCARE TO 
WIN, 7-6, AND REMAIN IN FIRST IN THE WESTERN CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The air of invincibility is gone, and the Splash is lucky its hold on first 
place isn't gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
 By beating the Carolina Vipers, 7-6, Saturday in front of 4,530 at The Pond of 
Anaheim, the Splash avoided an embarrassing defeat to the Continental Indoor 
Soccer League's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vipers (1-8), last in the league in offense and defense, frustrated the 
Splash most of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Dale Ervine's shootout goal 12 minutes 58 seconds into the fourth 
quarter, and Doug Neely's power-play score with 55 seconds left prevented an 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash was coming off a terrible performance a night earlier against 
Portland, a 6-5 overtime loss, which Carolina players watched from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Splash's third loss in four games, and the Vipers showed a complete 
lack of respect Saturday for their opponents, who lead the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (8-3), who maintained a half-game lead over San Diego (7-3), needed 
to re-establish itself in this game after winning easily early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash might not have restored its image as a dominating team, but it did 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the year, we established that we were going to be one of 
the best teams in the league," Splash Coach George Fernandez said. "You've got 
to understand that when you're on top, everyone wants to knock you off. Every 
team we play will raise their level of play. Portland proved it (Friday) night 
and Carolina probably played over their heads tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was ecstatic with a Splash effort in which it outshot Carolina, 
47-23, and came from a goal behind to win in the final moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to credit their goalie (Yaro)," said Ralph Black, who gave the 
Splash a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaro was spectacular much of the night, finishing with 19 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably our sharpest game of the year," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to play well despite the Splash's slump is Raffaele Ruotolo, who 
had two goals and two assists. He tied the CISL record for consecutive games 
with an assist (12). 
</P>
<P>
 Neely's goal was his ninth power-play goal, extending his CISL record. He has 
scored 12 times on 28 shots. Stopped, however, was Rod Castro's league-record 
consecutive game scoring streak of 14, dating back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was also important because the Splash enters its toughest weekend 
to date -- a home game against Monterrey (8-4) Friday, and a game at Dallas 
(8-1) Saturday. They are the top two teams in the Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo and Denis Hamlett gave the Splash a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 2-2, at halftime and Carolina led, 4-3, after three 
quarters. Ruotolo tied the score at 4-4, and Paul Ratcliffe tied it at 5-5. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas lost, 8-5, to Washington. Monterrey defeated Pittsburgh, 17-6. 
Sacramento defeated Portland, 7-2; and San Diego defeated Detroit, 10-2. . . . 
Goalie Jorge Valenzuela's third save against the Vipers was the 1,000th of his 
professional career. He finished with 10 saves, giving him 1,007.

EAST ROUTS WEST IN RHI ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Eastern all-stars scored four consecutive goals in the third quarter and 
defeated the Western all-stars, 11-6, in the first Roller Hockey International 
All-Star game, played in front of 16,150 Saturday night at the P.N.E. Pacific 
Coliseum in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 East goalie Bill Pye of the Minnesota Arctic Blast allowed only one goal in 
the final 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Smith of the St. Louis Vipers was the offensive star for the East, 
recording a hat trick with goals in the first, third and fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The West's biggest offensive output came late in the second quarter when it 
scored two goals in less than a minute, one by Craig Coxe of the Phoenix Cobras 
and the other by Scott Daniels of the Las Vegas Flash. Both goals went past 
goaltender Manon Rheaume, the first woman to play in an NHL exhibition game. 
She is now playing for the New Jersey Rockin Rollers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrogs goalie Rob Laurie, who had a league record 64 saves in a game 
against the San Diego Barracudas earlier in the season, was the lone all-star 
selection for Anaheim.

Cleveland Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser, driving an Ilmor-powered Penske racer, clinched his third pole of the 
year Saturday, matching his career total before this year. He has won four 
races this year, including the Indianapolis 500 and the most recent race in the 
Indy car series at Portland.

 After making 15 birdies in the first two rounds of the Anheuser-Busch Golf 
Classic, Bob Lohr had only one Saturday, and the results were predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't win, I may look back at this round and regret it," Lohr said after 
he lost his advantage -- and his lead -- in the $1.1-million event at 
Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohr, who opened the event at Kingsmill Golf Club with a 10-under 61 and 
followed that by setting a 36-hole scoring record for the event, slipped to a 
73, capped by a double bogey on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McCumber charged from seven shots off the pace with a six-under 65, 
leaving him at 12-under 201, one shot ahead of Lohr.

<P>
 Williams was shot last Saturday night while entering a drug store in Niles, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 She is playing with a bullet lodged in her rib cage.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SERENA'S SONG WINS, MIGHT TAKE ON MALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that Serena's Song has beaten up on her own gender, the 2-year-old Rahy 
filly might next take on the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Bob Lewis and trainer Wayne Lukas didn't rule out the possibility of 
Serena's Song returning in the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile Championship on July 
25 after her easy victory in the $111,800 Landaluce at Hollywood Park on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending trainer Brian Mayberry's four-year domination of the Landaluce, 
Serena's Song, the 6-5 favorite, stalked the early pace under Gary Stevens, 
then took over from 5-2 second choice Cat's Cradle with about an eighth of a 
mile to run and went to win by 4 1/2 lengths in 1:10 for the six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Embroidered, the longest shot in the field of 10 at nearly 66-1, rallied to 
finish second, two lengths ahead of Cat's Cradle. Mayberry, who had two 
starters in his bid for his fifth consecutive victory in the Grade II event, 
saw How So Oiseau and Chordette finish seventh and last, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-length maiden winner in her California debut after two starts in 
Kentucky, Serena's Song continued a stakes streak for Stevens. He won the 
Hollywood Gold Cup with Slew Of Damascus and the Beverly Hills Handicap with 
Corrazona the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll talk that over (the possibility of running in the Juvenile)," Lukas 
said after his first victory in the Landaluce since 1987. "That's a 
possibility, but there are some very lucrative filly races in the future. We'll 
just take a look at it and see what comes up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary just settled her a little bit and I think that was good in the fact that 
she won because this is going to help her down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens was concerned going to the gate because Serena's Song was more nervous 
than she had been before her maiden victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This filly was probably more impressive to me today than last time because 
she got stirred up going to the gate," he said. "She got hot and excited and it 
took a little starch out of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I had lost a little confidence going to the gate because she had 
gotten so hot. But five jumps away from the gate, I got my confidence back. She 
won very easily. I really think this filly can do just about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the pattern of recent years holds, Sardula won't win the $210,000 Hollywood 
Oaks at Hollywood Park today. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye is her rider and he has been winning this race every other 
year lately. After winning with Gorgeous in 1989, he came back with Fowda in 
1991, then posted a 16-1 surprise with Hollywood Wildcat in her California 
debut last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, second behind Sardula in the Kentucky Oaks, is the 4-5 favorite in 
the 1 1/8-mile Oaks, which drew only two other entrants -- Fancy 'N Fabulous 
and Sportful Snob -- and the latter might be scratched to run in next 
Saturday's Valkyr Handicap. An easy winner of the Mother Goose at Belmont Park 
in her most recent race, Lakeway drew the rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula, who drew right outside Lakeway, is the 6-5 second choice as she goes 
for her third victory without a loss at Hollywood Park. She won the Princess by 
5 1/2 lengths on June 18 and withstood an inquiry when winning the Hollywood 
Starlet late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, Delahoussaye won't ride for at least a week after today's races. 
He will undergo two nasal surgeries Monday, a sinusotomy to clean his nasal 
passages and a septoplasty to repair a deviated septum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis had five winners on a single program for the third time at the 
meeting Friday night and he has all but clinched the riding title. 
</P>
<P>
 The only one of Solis' mounts to lose was Crown Sterling, who finished fifth 
in the ninth race. Earlier, Solis had won with Curve In The Road, Pride And 
Power, Bolvari, Alybally and Mr. C I Prospector. He has 71 victories, 15 more 
than Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank my agent (Harry Hacek) and God that I am doing so well," Solis 
said. "I'm proud that every day I try to improve my riding and bring it to a 
better level. I also try very hard to get along with all the horses I ride. 
When a rider is confident, I feel the horse he rides can sense that confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the greatest things that happened to me is my agent. He's right on top 
of the business. He's on top of everything, and that makes my job a lot 
easier." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas and his wife, Linda, were among those in the winner's circle after 
Serena's Song's victory. . . . For the second consecutive week, there were no 
perfect tickets in the National Best Seven, so there is a carryover of 
$309,382.10 for Saturday. The biggest upset was provided by Danville ($37) in 
the Round Table at Arlington. . . . Fastness, making his first start since 
finishing fourth in the Hollywood Derby last Nov. 20, was impressive winning 
the first race Saturday. The 4-year-old Rousillon colt was ridden by Corey 
Black and is trained by Jenine Sahadi for the Evergreen Farm. . . . Fu Man Slew 
will leave Monday to run in Saturday's Frank J. DeFrancis Memorial Dash at 
Laurel. Individual Style, who defeated Fu Man Slew in the Harry Henson on June 
17, is already at Laurel and will also run in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North, who underwent arthroscopic surgery Thursday to remove a chip 
in his right front ankle, came out of the surgery well, according to surgeon 
Ted Fisher. . . . Arches Of Gold, making her first start for trainer April 
Mayberry, won the $49,000 Dahlia Stakes at Ellis Park on Saturday. Joe Steiner 
rode the 5-year-old mare, who won by 4 1/2 lengths as the 4-5 favorite. . . . 
Eddie Delahoussaye won three times Saturday, including a victory on favored 
C'mon Lets Dance in the $60,000 Hidden Light Handicap.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JUDY B. ROSENER: IN TERMS OF QUALITY, SOME MBA 
SCHOOLS SUCCEED ONLY TO A DEGREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY B. ROSENER, JUDY B. ROSENER is a professor in the Graduate School of 
Management at UC Irvine. She is co-author of Workforce America! Managing 
Employee Diversity as a Vital Resource. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking their own lessons to heart, the nation's business schools have strived 
over the past 20 years to become profit centers for their universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980s were a boom time, and a master's in business administration seemed 
like a sure ticket to a good job and an impressive title. But with the Wall 
Street crash in October, 1987, many MBAs found themselves pounding the 
pavement. And as the economy faltered and organizations downsized, the MBA lost 
some of its luster. 
</P>
<P>
 Business school marketeers needed a new approach. Economic upheaval had left 
mid-career white-collar workers desperate for ways to add skills and polish 
their resumes, and the demand for continuing education increased. As a result, 
"executive" MBA programs have become cash cows for schools whose revenue has 
historically come from tuition, taxes, alumni donations and research grants -- 
all of which today are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, it's as if the proprietor of a five-star restaurant had 
suddenly decided to offer an all-you-can-eat buffet. A number of business 
schools whose budgets have shrunk dramatically have been forced to forgo 
academic vigor, tough entrance requirements and integrated learning in order to 
attract more students. On the other hand, this newly competitive environment 
has motivated other schools to expand their hours of operation and improve the 
quantity and quality of their offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the range of choices for the prospective MBA candidate 
has been expanded. The bad news is that some programs have all the nutritional 
value of a fast-food meal. Because they are driven as much by the market as by 
an academic mission, MBA programs today are as varied as restaurants in terms 
of their management, menus, ambience, service, accessibility and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 So here is a brief Michelin-style guide to the MBA: 
</P>
<P>
 * A "five-star" MBA experience can still be had in first-tier schools -- those 
ranked among the nation's top 50. Their deans are usually seasoned chefs, and 
the reputation of their programs is well deserved. These schools have solid 
academic programs, distinguished faculties and well-qualified students. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "family style" MBA is found at most large state universities and 
colleges, whose business schools are generally ranked in the second tier. Deans 
here are often cooks-turned-chefs -- that is, faculty members promoted from 
within. Historically, their main task was to manage the faculty and academic 
programs. Today, their main task is to find new sources of income. 
</P>
<P>
 These MBA programs offer basic business courses and traditional electives. 
However, unlike at a five-star business school, fewer resources will be 
allocated to this group's regular MBA programs as more resources are allotted 
to the development and marketing of higher-revenue-generating executive 
programs. Courses in the regular MBA program tend to be taught by part-time 
lecturers because the executive programs take the best full-time faculty 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 * The cafeteria-style MBA is offered at many small, usually private schools. 
Here, the main task of the dean is to make sure -- the way a cafeteria chef 
would -- that sufficient courses are offered and that their quality meets 
minimum standards. Usually there is a dearth of full-time faculty members at 
these schools, and most classes are taught by working professionals on a 
contract basis. These schools are self-service in that students can design 
their own programs; most popular are the "how-to" (vocational) classes rather 
than the "why" (theoretical) courses the five-star and family-style programs 
require. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fast-food MBA is for those who want to obtain a degree the easy way. At 
such schools, customer satisfaction is measured by speed, convenience and 
packaging. These programs usually require no class attendance; exams are 
conducted by mail or fax. Although rarely accredited, this type of program 
continues to flourish because the main entrance requirement is the ability to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, those desiring an MBA today have a large selection from which to 
choose. It's like picking a restaurant: If customers want to be assured of 
getting what they pay for, they should inquire about the quantity and quality 
of the offerings, the reputation of the chef and cooks, the hours of service 
and the characteristics and recommendations of previous customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bon appe tit!

AMERICAN CEOS NEED TO GET SOME CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Michael Schrage ("U.S. Is a Free Market When It Comes to CEOs," June 2) 
makes a good case for the openness of American corporations to considering 
foreign executives as CEOs, there are some significant points that are being 
missed. Even if foreign companies were inclined to consider Americans as chief 
executives for their multinational corporations, few would qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Michael Spindler, for example, converses with ease in English, the 
vast majority of American candidates for CEO consideration have at best a dim 
recollection of high school German or French, and their knowledge of foreign 
culture usually does not extend beyond the superficial and frequently incorrect 
cliches served up by the American entertainment media. 
</P>
<P>
 European executives generally are fluent in at least one foreign language and 
have a working knowledge in one or two others. Schrage's assertion "that it is 
almost impossible to imagine a set of circumstances where Nestle is run by 
someone other than a Swiss" would certainly hold for the typical American 
candidate, who would probably need an interpreter just to find the executive 
washroom. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe foreign multinationals are not nearly as averse to considering 
American candidates for the top spot as is implied, if they could find some 
that have at least a working knowledge of the local culture and language.

OLD FACE A PREJUDICE UNLIKE ANY OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having spent the last year researching age discrimination for my doctoral 
studies in organizational psychology, I was appalled to read the quote from a 
company source reading in part, " . . . it's easier to make a change than to 
teach an old dog new tricks" ("Simon & Schuster Publishing Chief Fired by 
Viacom," June 5). 
</P>
<P>
 As supported by my studies, it would appear that despite the move toward 
acceptance of the multicultural salad bowl metaphor to replace the 1906 term 
melting pot, our society continues to hold prejudicial views toward older 
workers and has no hesitation about expressing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the chronological age of the source unfortunately does not seem to make a 
difference in who holds ageist ideology. Older people are just as likely to 
individually differentiate themselves as being different from the negative 
views they hold of the subgroup as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, it continues to be socially acceptable to make derogatory 
comments or jokes about older people, whereas it is not considered politically 
correct to make such statements about race- or gender-related issues. Just 
visit your local card shop for evidence of this. Age is perhaps the only 
attribute of which former perpetrators of discrimination will eventually become 
victims -- assuming they live long enough.

RECALLING IKE'S STYLE: KEEP ALL REPORTS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Eisenhower's organization is described as military style in the 
well-documented piece on some management tips that might assist President 
Clinton ("Mr. President, Some Management Tips for You," July 5).I am reminded 
of Ike's directive when he was president of Columbia University. In requesting 
annual reports from department heads, he specified that all reports must be 
limited to one page only. Anything beyond one page would remain unread, Ike 
admonished. Not only did they all comply, but I was informed by several 
Columbians that Ike's order was voluntarily extended to other reports. Not a 
bad tip for any CEO to consider in this age of superhighways of information.

DEFINING PRIVATIZATION IN CUBAN VENTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mexican Firm to Overhaul Cuban Phone System" (June 14) falsely stated that 
the deal between the Mexican firm and the Cuban government marked Cuba's "first 
major privatization" since the 1959 revolution. In fact, the Cuban regime does 
not allow any Cuban nationals to own or organize any private economic 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no private property rights in Cuba. Individuals who have violated 
the regime's strict prohibition against private economic initiative have spent 
as much as 10 years in prison, and there are many documented cases of such 
sentences. Only recently did the Cuban regime allow selectively few crafts -- 
and handymen -- to operate privately, but they are not allowed to hire 
employees or to form private companies of any kind. All economic organizations 
in Cuba are therefore government-owned. The kind of deal between the Mexican 
firm and Cuba's Empresa de Telecomunicaciones that you reported on is therefore 
a joint venture with a state-owned company of the Cuban regime rather than a 
privatization per se. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the Cuban telephone company from which the current Empresa de 
Telecomunicaciones was formed was confiscated without compensation from U.S. 
interests in 1960. One wonders whether the Mexican Grupo Domos knows about this 
and whether it realizes that it may be in for a substantial amount of 
litigation (and some sizable losses) when the U.S. embargo on Cuba is lifted 
and expropriated U.S. interests seek to reclaim their properties or sue for 
compensation from current foreign owners and joint venture partners.

GARAMENDI'S INSURANCE SOLUTION ADDS INSULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I think I have this straight in my mind: John Garamendi allows 20th Century 
Insurance Co. to dump in excess of 200,000 homeowners policyholders in the 
street ("Insurance Pool Told to Cover Quakes, Fires," June 23). These policies 
have guaranteed replacement coverage for home and contents, special form, 
liability and can accommodate a variety of riders. 
</P>
<P>
 This dumping creates the possibility of a shortage of homeowners coverage -- a 
possibility Garamendi should have been aware of when he approved the dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to solve the problem, he intends to offer California Fair Plan policies 
to anyone. These policies are issued on a form that pays only actual cash value 
for your home if you have a fire. No content coverage, no liability coverage, 
no special form and no riders offered. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure the 200,000 policyholders with deluxe coverage with 20th Century will 
be thrilled to know that John Garamendi has arranged for them to get 
substandard, bare-bones coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie M. Berte of Gov. Pete Wilson's office said of the order: "It's fine 
to the extent it solves an immediate availability crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we put up with this nonsense?

WESTSIDE WATCH: ENOUGH ALREADY, NICOLE'S NEIGHBORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it simple curiosity that has brought so many reporters and other gawkers to 
Brentwood? Or is it a void on the home front? 
</P>
<P>
 The latter, according to a sign posted on Bundy Avenue in Brentwood, near 
Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 While some homemade signs in the area have greeted visitors with basic 
messages such as "Go Home . . . There is Nothing 2 See," another, spotted last 
week, offered some advice. "Media & Lookie-Loos: GET-A-LIFE," it said. "Go Home 
And Live Your Own So We Can Live Ours In Peace."

 LABOR PAINS: Their vote of support for the North American Free Trade Agreement 
is haunting U.S. Reps. Howard Berman(D-Panorama City) and Anthony C. 
Beilenson(D-Woodland Hills.) 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, NAFTA foes effectively vetoed a move by delegates of the Los Angeles 
County Federation of Labor to endorse the ongoing reelection bids of Beilenson, 
whose district includes Malibu, and Berman, who has strong Westside political 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the delegates was a recommendation made by the federation's political 
wing and its new secretary-treasurer, Jim Wood. But the measure failed to win 
the two-thirds' margin needed for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 According to dissident Carl Kessler, a veteran delegate from the International 
Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the rejection was unprecedented. The 
delegates routinely adopt the recommendations of the federation's political 
wing, he said. "I've been here since 1959, and it's never happened before." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, who recently replaced Bill Robertson as federation leader, blamed 
himself for tactical errors that contributed to the defeat of the proposal. A 
union endorsement of the congressmen may still be forthcoming when the matter 
is taken up again at a state convention of labor unions later this month, Wood 
said. But he refused to make a prediction. "This issue is real emotional, and I 
wouldn't want to predict an outcome," he said.

</P>
<P>
 The real stars, though, will be the live animals on display -- a zebra, a 
chimpanzee and a baby elephant. But don't fear for your life. "These animals 
are pretty tame because they work in movies all the time," noted publicist 
Craig Donahue.

JUSTICE IN THE SHADOW OF O.J. CASE; COURTS: SANTA MONICA JUDGE CITES PUBLICITY 
OVER SIMPSON INQUIRY IN POSTPONING FOR TWO MONTHS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TRIAL 
WITH STRIKING SIMILARITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citizens who thought they were showing up for routine jury duty in Santa 
Monica recently found themselves vicariously caught up in the most sensational 
murder case in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was no casual debate around the water cooler. It unfolded in the 
jury box as Superior Court Judge Robert T. Altman attempted to gauge the impact 
of the O.J. Simpson case on an eerily similar murder case that was set for 
trial in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Altman ultimately postponed the trial, a day of jury selection 
highlighted potential difficulties in trying domestic-abuse murder cases in the 
coming months -- especially if they bear a resemblance to the Simpson matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant in the Santa Monica case is a black man accused of stalking and 
stabbing to death his wife, a white woman, soon after she called off their 
stormy eight-year marriage. Two small children were left motherless; their 
father fled from police. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 It did to Altman, so familiar that the trial of accused wife-killer James 
Foster was put off for two months for fear of taint by association with the 
Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster is accused of stalking and murdering his wife, Maria, in a parking 
garage as she arrived at her job at Los Angeles International Airport in 1985, 
then fleeing. Arrested in Mississippi more than seven years later for breaking 
into a girlfriend's home, he was returned to Los Angeles for prosecution on a 
first-degree murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 As Altman analyzed it in court, the publicity glut could cut both ways: 
Sympathy for O.J. could rub off on the accused, or sympathy for victims Nicole 
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman could harden opinion against 
him. Another factor in play is the widespread reporting on domestic violence, 
heightening jurors' sensitivity to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: Can the jury focus on this case and not the O.J. Simpson 
case?" Altman asked from the bench. "There are a lot of parallels . . . I don't 
want this man (defendant Foster) to be used as an example in anyone's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 To discourage that from happening, the judge quizzed jurors closely on the 
Simpson case, pointing out its obvious factual similarities to the Foster case. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerged was a conflicting picture. Most jurors insisted they were not 
engrossed in the Simpson case but then turned out to know all about it. Nearly 
everyone had heard Nicole Brown Simpson's tearful 911 call to police late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired schoolteacher Kathleen Kemp was typical of jurors who said they had 
had enough of O.J.-media mania. "I've turned on A&E and Bravo lately," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nearly everyone said they could be fair, there was an occasional show 
of the kind of sentiment visible daily around the Downtown courthouse, where 
sidewalk merchants hawk "Free the Juice" T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it hard to believe a guy I've idolized for 25 years is capable of 
doing something like this," said prospective juror Thomas L. Martin III. 
Earlier, Martin said that he was "really not interested" but "stumbled" upon 
news reports about his hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in the Santa Monica case noted that people were eager to serve on 
the jury and paid more attention than usual to the often tedious process of 
culling a jury of 12 from a panel of several dozen citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could hear a pin drop," said Foster's attorney, Deputy Public Defender 
James R. Bendat. "It scared me that people wanted to serve so much -- almost as 
if to get a vicarious feeling they were sitting on the O.J. Simpson case." 
</P>
<P>
 The Foster case prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Loni Petersen, however, opposed 
delaying the trial, saying a fair jury could be selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal standard for impartiality is not what a juror knows or believes 
ahead of time, but whether prior information and prejudices can be set aside so 
that the case can be decided based on what is presented in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no different than (someone) looking at a made-for-TV movie on the 
Menendez case, then serving on the jury," said Petersen's boss, John Lynch, who 
runs the Santa Monica branch of the district attorney's office. "You don't 
cancel something because conditions aren't perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch noted that another domestic violence murder trial is going on in the 
Santa Monica courthouse now. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donna Wills, who is in charge of the district attorney's 
family violence unit downtown, agreed with Lynch, saying it is too soon for the 
Simpson case to adversely affect prosecutions. If anything, the publicity has 
been helpful, she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the media blitz, the sympathy is with the victim," Wills said. If 
Simpson is acquitted, however, that could become an impediment to prosecutors, 
she said, noting that acquittals in the McMartin Preschool molestation case 
gave defense attorneys ammunition that they used effectively in other 
molestation trials. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Monica case, Judge Altman sought the advice of prospective jurors 
on whether it was fair to go ahead with the trial, telling defendant Foster and 
his attorney that it was their call whether to proceed in the glare of the 
Simpson media frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nearly everyone said to forge ahead, one prospective juror admitted, 
"I'm surprised the defense attorney hasn't said something to delay this case." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from those who would have sat in judgment of his client, the 
defense attorney did just that. "The right thing to so is to let things calm 
down," Bendat said in a later interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster was returned to County Jail to wait for two months. There, he is just 
another inmate, far removed from the protective custody status afforded 
Simpson, who, like Foster, is accused of killing someone he professed to love.

GOAL-ORIENTED; FORMER AREA SOCCER STANDOUT IS BUILDING WOMEN'S PROGRAM AT SANTA 
MONICA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carla Zeitlin is a Santa Monica soccer pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 15-year-old at Santa Monica High School, she played on the boys' soccer 
team -- the only girl in the California Interscholastic Federation to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, during her junior year, she started -- and played in -- the women's 
soccer program at Santa Monica High. And the next year, she was named most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 All this she accomplished while wearing hearing aids in both ears to correct a 
serious hearing loss that started in early childhood. Last month, Zeitlin, now 
29, was named coach of the new women's soccer team at Santa Monica College. 
With only two months before the season begins, she has been busy looking at 
talent, much of which is on display at a summer co-ed soccer class she is 
teaching along with assistant coach Paul Churchyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a list of 20 women who have expressed interest in the team, and 15 
have enrolled in the summer class," she said. While they are enthusiastic, she 
said, "there are not a lot of skilled players. But this first year, I'll take 
anyone who is interested." 
</P>
<P>
 While women's soccer is well established at a few Southern California 
community colleges, Santa Monica is a latecomer. The Corsairs will be playing 
women's teams from Mt. San Antonio, El Camino, Moorpark, Oxnard, Long Beach 
City and Santa Barbara City colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of interest, said Avie Bridges, Santa Monica's athletic director, is one 
reason why a women's soccer program was not started sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent evaluation of the college's compliance with federal gender-equity 
rules raised the issue of fairness and prompted swift action, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found we had 73% male and 27% female participation in sports programs," 
Bridges said. "Our college president thought that was unacceptable in a place 
where the male-female ratio was 50-50." 
</P>
<P>
 So the college suspended the men's tennis and baseball programs and Bridges 
began looking into what women's sports could be added. Men's soccer was 
suspended two years ago for disciplinary reasons, including fighting during a 
game, and there are no plans to restore it, although intramural soccer 
continues at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 While other candidates had more coaching experience, Bridges said that Zeitlin 
knows the community and "has the energy and personality to start a new 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Zeitlin played soccer for the women's team at the 
University of California at Berkeley, which was ranked second in the nation 
during her senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 She later earned a master's degree in marriage, family and child counseling 
from Cal State Northridge. Zeitlin also has a black belt in karate. In her last 
job, she was assistant soccer coach at Crossroads School in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting, she said, is her biggest concern. According to the rules of the 
California Commission on Athletics, a community college cannot recruit athletes 
from outside its district. So Zeitlin can only seek out soccer players from 
Santa Monica High School, St. Monica's High School and Crossroads School. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the time element and the recruiting restrictions, she is relying heavily 
on word of mouth to build the new team. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for the new coach, Anya Bohler was already attending Santa Monica 
College. Bohler learned soccer in her native Norway and played with Santa 
Monica College's men's intramural team last year -- its only female. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn a tougher game, playing with men," Bohler said. At 25, she said, 
she's old for the game, but the new team is giving her another chance to excel 
in a game she loves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Marks played soccer at Herkimer College, near Utica, N.Y. She recently 
moved to Santa Monica with her brother, but was planning to leave until she 
heard about the new program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches are talented, and involved," said Marks, 19. "They take the time, 
they get right in there with us. At Herkimer, we had the talent but no 
coaching. You can have all the talent in the world, but without good coaching 
you'll go nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The women will share Corsair Field with the football team this fall. When the 
field is occupied, the women will practice and play at Clover Park in Santa 
Monica. The first home game is scheduled for 2 p.m. Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeitlin said she hopes to draw 24 women to compete on the team this fall. But 
aspiring soccer players, she said, should be warned in advance. "I'm a tough 
coach. I expect people to be committed, and I want women who can work hard."

WOMAN FILES SUIT CHARGING WORKERS WERE PEEPING TOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman has filed suit claiming that workers at a Hollywood restaurant spied 
on her as she used a public toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Sharare Shams 
suffered an "objectionable and offensive" invasion of privacy on April 10 when 
workers at Johnny Rockets, 7507 Melrose Ave., peeped at her through holes in 
the lavatory door. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Arnold, chief financial officer of the Los Angeles-based Rockets chain, 
said the incident apparently began when a busboy dropped a towel by the 
washroom door and knelt to pick it up. Shams' boyfriend noticed the worker 
crouching by the door, became angry and "made a scene" at the restaurant, 
Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager was out of town when the incident occurred, but a subsequent 
inquiry determined that the busboy may have been trying to peer through a 
recently repaired crack in the door, Arnold said. The busboy was sent home 
early that day and has not reported for work since, he added. Shams' suit 
claims that more than one worker spied on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the process of working with our liability insurance carrier to 
resolve this," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other restaurants and hotels have faced similar suits in recent years. In May, 
a Los Angeles County woman sued Jack in the Box after someone allegedly spied 
on her as she used the washroom in a Norco restaurant. Holiday Inn in 1992 
inspected all of its 1,700 hotels after guests in Tennessee and South Carolina 
found peepholes and sued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're afraid somebody else will try to copy this (suit)," Arnold said. "After 
it happened, the manager warned the workers that anybody who even went near the 
restrooms would be fired." 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Shams were unsuccessful, and her attorney, Doug Mastroianni, 
was not immediately available for comment.

ARTS; IRISH THEATRE IS PLAYWRIGHTS' PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaning back in his chair, the heavy Fairfax Avenue traffic churning outside 
the window of his modest office, Robert Ginty looks up at portraits of Samuel 
Beckett, George Bernard Shaw and other Irish scribes on the wall above his 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six months ago," he says, "believe you me, I didn't think I'd be doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 "This" is the Irish Theatre Arts Center, which artistic director Ginty, aided 
by executive director Cynthia Baer, opened in February at St. Ambrose Church 
and Parish as a place for playwrights to hear their works being read by actors 
before an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ginty and St. Ambrose pastor Jack Beattie tell it, the two of them were 
chatting on Christmas Day last year, when Beattie mentioned that the parish 
school had been closed by the Los Angeles Archdiocese. The school's nearly 
dozen classrooms were mostly empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie, who on this sunny Saturday is rushing from conducting a funeral to 
conducting a wedding, pauses for a few minutes in the parish auditorium -- site 
of the theater group's public performances -- to explain the parish's plight: 
"For many years, St. Ambrose had been a commuter school. Fewer and fewer 
children attended from the local area, and with our declining attendance, it 
was understandable when the school closed . . . a year ago, this month." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginty says he realized that a weekly event, with staged readings of new plays 
drawing a large and diverse audience, could serve the playwrights and the 
actors -- and boost the visibility and community involvement of Beattie's 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 There was something else. Since the Celtic Arts Center's Hollywood theater 
burned down in 1992, Irish-oriented performing artists in Los Angeles had 
lacked a real home. (Only recently have Irish-themed performances been booked 
into Cafe Largo on Fairfax -- a few blocks to the south, ironically, of the 
Irish Theatre Arts Center.) 
</P>
<P>
 When Ginty approached local Irish artists with the possibility of performing 
and workshop space at St. Ambrose, "the response was like a people walking out 
of the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it became especially important in this town full of actors," says Ginty, 
a veteran film and television director ("Evening Shade," "China Beach"), "to 
stress that this would be a theater for playwrights, not for actors. The actors 
would have their performance, sure, but the playwright needs to hear his play 
with an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 With Baer -- who owned and operated the Richard Basehart Playhouse in Woodland 
Hills until its January closure -- as the operational mastermind, Ginty set out 
a plan. Staged readings, cast and rehearsed with a director, would be presented 
free on Wednesday nights. A playwriting workshop would be held in a parish 
schoolroom, complete with rudimentary lights and sound, on Thursday nights. 
There would be no membership fees, no charged admission, no productions, and, 
as Ginty terms it, all egos would be checked at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Irish and not-so-Irish material has been heard in the 
auditorium, from John Lordan's "Shamrock" and Joe Powers' "Taxi Dance" to Dan 
Lauria's "Till Jason Comes Home" with Charles Durning and Jeremy Ritzer's stage 
version of Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs," which Ginty says has already 
attracted attention from theaters in the United States and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginty hopes that upcoming readings, including Jason Milligan's "Men in Suits" 
with Tony Danza (Wednesday) and the Los Angeles premiere presentation of three 
Frank Gilroy one-acts (July 27), will climax with an August outdoor staging in 
the adjacent parking lot area of an evening of scenes from Shaw's plays. Says 
Ginty: "We're calling it 'Shaw in a Parking Lot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the center's ambitions seem to extend as far as Ginty and Baer's 
Rolodexes will carry it. Plans include a Beckett evening, a Horton Foote 
evening and a Eugene O'Neill evening for which Ginty is trying to attract Jason 
Robards, George C. Scott and James Earl Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Ginty mentions a list of stars the center is trying to line up, he 
notes that, besides the star's ability to draw an audience, veteran actors 
"bring out the best in a play, and the younger, less experienced actors around 
them, so it helps all of the artists. That's our very simple goal here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Men in Suits," Irish Theatre Arts Center, 1261 Fairfax Ave., West Hollywood. 
8 p.m. Wednesday. Free. (213) 654-3864.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bus stops from Hollywood to East Los Angeles will be decorated with the 
photography of 21 students from five high schools. The students, chosen by 
their photography teachers at Franklin, Lincoln, Bravo, Marshall and Hollywood 
high schools, will debut their work at the Los Angeles Children's Museum today 
from noon to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, the students have dedicated their Saturdays to taking pictures 
-- on any topic.They tackled issues ranging from racism to feminism to 
homelessness, and scanned their photographs into computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is part of a joint project involving the Los Angeles Center for 
Photographic Studies in Hollywood and the California Institute of the Arts 
Community Arts Partnership. Since 1990, CAP has provided Los Angeles youths 
with professional arts training and artistic opportunities.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; CITY CELEBRATES FIRST STAGE OF PALISADES PARK 
RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After six months of work, the first phase of the Palisades Park refurbishment 
is now complete. The $1.5-million city-funded renovation, which runs from Santa 
Monica Pier to Arizona Avenue, was inaugurated last week amid the Fourth of 
July holiday fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds were in attendance, including city officials and descendants of the 
Ocean Avenue landowners who deeded the property 102 years ago. The park's new 
installations incorporate late 19th-Century wrought-iron architecture in the 
bluff's new benches, drinking fountains and trash containers. 
</P>
<P>
 They also include extra park lights, bathroom improvements, shuffleboard 
courts and a new jogging path. In addition, a new drainage and irrigation 
system has been constructed to check bluff-side erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project signals the city's interest in keeping our public spaces 
attractive and is consistent with our environmental stance," said Susan 
McCarthy, the city's director of Community Cultural Services. "Hopefully we'll 
have this park around for another 102 years."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; POLICE USE BARRICADES TO PUT A HALT ON CRUISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Chae Gross ventured out to Crenshaw Boulevard recently to join the 
legions of cruisers who regularly parade up and down the thoroughfare, he was 
shocked by what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the traffic snarls, rowdiness and bikini-clad girls standing up in 
convertibles that lately have caused a ruckus on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there were "barricades, detours, policemen rerouting everyone," said 
the 22-year-old, incredulity in his voice. "I hung out for a while on the side 
streets, but it wasn't the same. I left after about 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of complaints from businesses, residents and police, the city is 
trying to drive home the point that cruising is not welcome on Crenshaw. The 
City Council recently passed an ordinance allowing police to block off a 3 
1/2-mile stretch of Crenshaw on Sunday nights between 9 p.m. and midnight -- 
peak cruising hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are barricading Crenshaw from Adams Boulevard south to 78th Street, the 
border with Inglewood. The area between Adams and Jefferson Boulevard will 
remain open until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Only area residents, emergency vehicles and patrons of local businesses are 
allowed through. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Leslie Wilbanks of the Police Department's South Traffic Division said 
cruising had simply gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents are upset because of the noise, the music, the fact they can't get 
in or out of their driveways." 
</P>
<P>
 Police representatives met with residents and business owners to discuss the 
problem and map out a strategy. Most were in favor of the blockade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cruising has just killed our night business," said Tony Marco, manager of the 
Boys Market at Crenshaw and Rodeo Road. "Customers are scared by kids hanging 
out in the parking lot and acting wild." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yum-Yum Donuts manager Carlos Palencia expressed concern that business at 
his shop at Crenshaw and Exposition will be adversely affected. "We're open 24 
hours, and we do pretty good business Sunday nights," he said. 
</P>

 Anthony, a longtime cruiser who asked that his last name not be used, said he 
doubts that the barricade will stop a tradition that dates to the early '70s 
and attracts young people from as far away as Nevada.

<P>
 * VENICE SEWER -- Approved construction of a new sewer line along Lincoln 
Boulevard in Venice from Milwood Avenue to Venice Boulevard. An environmental 
report concluded that the project will have unavoidable adverse effects on 
local noise levels, but that the new sewer is needed because usage of the 
current system exceeds design capabilities.The $1-million project is scheduled 
to begin in August and be completed by February. 
</P>
<P>
 * RESTAURANT RELOCATION -- Approved a request by the Community Redevelopment 
Agency for $529,000 to relocate Rusty's Hacienda Restaurant from 1331 S. Boyd 
Street in Boyle Heights to 1716 N. Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood to make room 
for Rio Vista Village, a 75-unit housing development. State law requires the 
CRA to provide relocation assistance to businesses displaced by its projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFER -- Approved offering a $25,000 reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the two people who forced their way into a 
residence at 800 S. Norton Ave. in the Wilshire area on May 29 and raped and 
robbed the five women living there. Friends of the victims say they plan to 
match the council's reward. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * GOLFING FEES -- Approved raising the green fees at city golf courses to $16 
from $15 during the week and to $19.50 from $18.50 on weekends. The $1 increase 
overrides the Board of Recreation and Parks action to raise the fees $1.50 for 
most golfers while lowering the fees for seniors and youths under 17 years of 
age by 50 cents. A decision by the council regarding the fees for seniors and 
youths was delayed. Passed 12-2.

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; WHERE LIFE IS PREFAB-ULOUS; RESIDENTS SAY MOBILE HOME 
PARKS IN MALIBU AND PACIFIC PALISADES ARE THE BEST-KEPT SECRET IN L.A.; THEY 
OFFER HOUSING ON PRIME REAL ESTATE AT AFFORDABLE PRICES 
</P>

<P>
 The day kick-starts with a rousing game of tennis on a Malibu hilltop court 
skirted by sinus-clearing Eucalyptus trees and Australian pines. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is a turkey sandwich -- sans the fat -- and herb tea. At 2 p.m. and at 6 
p.m., a bucolic quarter-mile walk takes you to a private beach where you engage 
in a bracing half-mile swim in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 To thaw, you slow cook in a hot tub with a perfect, sweating Manhattan 
cocktail nearby for the quaffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer dinners are beachside, where retirees, academic administrators and 
entertainment executives -- generations apart in age -- rub elbows, trade jokes 
and nosh on a potluck food fest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just absolutely a beautiful life. . . . Paradise Cove is just what it is 
named -- Paradise," said Joe Hecht, 74, who has been living this life for the 
last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness life in a slice of rustic Bohemia high atop towering ocean bluffs 
overlooking the pricey Malibu coastline. But this is no multimillion-dollar 
mansion compound. It is a mobile home park, one of five -- two in Malibu, three 
in Pacific Palisades -- situated on prime real estate near the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sort of hedonistic vacation, ongoing," said Hecht, whose monthly space 
rent at Paradise Cove mobile home park is $385. "We all love the ocean, the 
sand, the people . . . it's lots of love." 
</P>
<P>
 At the coastal mobile home parks, the quality of life spans the spectrum from 
the luxurious -- complete with lavish landscaping and a carwash -- to the 
spartan, an asphalt-paved tract with a run-down clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 And beneath the surface of this seeming utopia, where an inadvertent reference 
to trailer parks sets off angry responses from residents who abhor that seedy 
image, anxieties lurk. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pensioners worry about rent increases. Some fear they will be ousted to 
make way for a hotel and marina. Others complain about noisy children. And the 
few who want to leave are worried that they will not be able to sell their 
residences because banks do not readily finance loans on pre-1976 mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Shangri-La lifestyle goes on in the land of prefabricated homes, 
known more informally as coaches, single, double and triple-wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage payments are low or nonexistent for those who buy theirs outright. A 
10- to 15-m.p.h. speed limit throttles noise pollution. Gardens are optional. 
Crime is rare. Neighbors are close and the sense of community is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, the more elaborate of the two mobile home parks is Point Dume 
(pronounced Du-May) Club, a gated park that feels more like a country club than 
a prefabricated-housing facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated above Point Dume state beach, the 297-space park, built in 1968 by 
the Adamson Cos., a major Malibu landholder, is arguably one of the most 
luxurious mobile home sites in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Governed by an exhaustive list of rules and antiseptically clean, it is 
guarded by security gates behind which there is an Olympic-size pool, a 
clubhouse, a library, a carwash, a state-of-the-art septic facility and a 
helipad for medical emergencies. Visitors to the park are told they cannot walk 
through unescorted. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident recently joked: "My only complaint is that I can't get a chicken 
salad sandwich and a slow-gin fizz after my morning swim." 
</P>
<P>
 The amenities help make the park's monthly space rents some of the most 
expensive on the coast, ranging from $600 to $1,500, depending on ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach owners are an eclectic mix, ranging from the well-to-do to struggling 
schoolteachers, salespeople, senior citizens and single parents with children. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Edwards moved from New York to the park with his wife in 1974 and has 
never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tranquil life," he said as he sat on his porch with a Michael Crichton 
book in his lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense of community is the main thing. When something is wrong, you have 
family. People come and sit with my wife when she is sick and bring her food. 
It is part of our life now." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the way, Wendy Pietzak, 31, who runs the Malibu Community Center, walked 
her dog into the hills, where an expansive view of the ocean opens up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real mix of people," she said. "A younger crowd is moving in. 
Pepperdine students lease here now." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Thomas D. Curtis, an economics professor at Southern Florida 
University who has studied mobile home parks since 1979, seaside mobile home 
park tenants buck the stereotype of the retired, bingo-playing resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of people living in mobile home parks by the ocean, with the 
exception of the elderly, are well-educated and working," said Curtis, who is 
familiar with the Westside parks. "It's a landlubber's version of living on a 
boat. And it's the best buy, given their incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 That is certainly the case at Malibu's Paradise Cove mobile home park, where 
newly arrived families, young executives and academics live alongside senior 
citizens who have been there for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The rustic park, located just off Pacific Coast Highway, is as different from 
the Point Dume Club as a run-down country house is from a trim suburban tract 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few rules here, where spaces rent from $190 to $1,000 a month. Park 
maintenance is minimal. Indigenous and exotic vegetation grows with all the 
flourish of an unrestrained English garden. There is no swimming pool and the 
clubhouse gets little use. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom of the park lies a partially washed-out pier and a private 
beach, where non-residents must pay $15 to park unless they are dining at one 
of Malibu's institutions, the Sandcastle restaurant. Scenes from the 1970s 
television series "The Rockford Files" were filmed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Buchwald, a professor of finance and investment at Cal State Northridge, 
lives in a mobile home, that, like most, is immobile because of remodeling. The 
project left the coach ensconced in redwood siding with a wraparound deck, hot 
tub and awning, with a matching set of Adirondack chairs angled for 
sunset-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a broad ocean vista from nearly every room. And Buchwald's bed, 
situated on a loft beneath a skylight, has the best view in the house, all for 
a mere $250,000 plus a monthly $526 in space rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else could I be, in this spot, one of the prime spots in the world that 
is close to my work," said Buchwald, 61. "If you look up two bluffs, it's 
Johnny Carson, and the other way is Blake Edwards and Julie Andrews and behind 
is (Barbra) Streisand's old place. I just want to stay here another 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
 At the bottom of the park, referred to by one resident as "the ghetto 
section," lives Bill Kish, a 29-year fixture in a tiny trailer he shares with 
his ailing cat Tuffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimming his fruiting tomato plants, Kish, 71, who pays about $190 a month for 
his space rent, reflected: "Once in a great while I fish off the pier; the fish 
are still good there. It used to be better before the pier washed out (in a 
1983 storm). The temperature is nice . . . it's remote, rural and away from the 
big-city folks. And some of us older folks, we check on each other to make sure 
we're still alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The park property, part of an 80-acre plot that sits on Chumash Indian burial 
grounds, was purchased by Dorothy and Harry Kissel in 1964. The Kissels let the 
trailers that had been there for decades remain in the lower park and expanded 
the bluffs into a mobile home park with a million-dollar view. 
</P>
<P>
 East of Malibu in Pacific Palisades, three mobile home parks sit above Pacific 
Coast Highway between Temescal Canyon Road and Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The least luxurious is the Palisades Bowl, established in the 1890s as a 
Methodist camp at the base of steep sea bluffs and home to 173 mobile homes 
that range from streamlined Airstream trailers to double- and triple-wide 
coaches that are as big as some suburban homes. 
</P>
<P>
 To the north of Palisades Bowl, tucked high in the cliffs above Will Rogers 
State Beach, is Malibu Village, inhabited by youngish residents who describe 
themselves as "thirtysomething yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
 Just past Temescal Canyon Road lies the luxurious Tahitian Terrace, where 158 
coaches stretch up and down a terraced hillside high above Will Rogers State 
Beach. The majority of the residents are retirees, a number of whom informally 
gather in morning poolside kaffee klatsches, polystyrene cups of java in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a massive A-frame clubhouse featuring leather couches and a panoramic 
ocean view, two groups of women convened recently for a spirited game of 
bridge. The bets were modest, a dollar apiece, and only one woman was from the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here, I thought, 'Who wants to live in a mobile home park? 
They're all a bunch of drunks,' " said Sylvia Berke, a retiree who abandoned a 
Santa Monica apartment to live in Tahitian Terrace, where the space rents range 
from $300 to $925. "I got that impression from trailer parks. But if you sit up 
here (in the garden), it is like you are in the Sequoias. I would never live 
any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents fear that their idyllic days may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, mobile home tenants are facing rent increases that may be 
retroactive. Some say that would force them out of the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's rent-control law, which rolled rates back to 1984 levels and 
mandated a two-year freeze, was recently struck down by a federal court ruling. 
A final judgment, due in a few weeks, will detail how much rents can be 
increased and if back rent can be collected. Still, park owners will be able to 
increase future space rents by no more than 3% a year or 75% of the consumer 
price index, whichever is higher. When a space is vacated or a coach is sold to 
a new owner, space rents can be increased 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paradise Cove residents fear that the park may be turned into a hotel 
and marina, a representative of the Kissel Co. said there are no plans for such 
a development, which would have difficulty getting zoning approval from the 
state Coastal Commission and the city of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants say they want to buy the park, and the company has expressed a 
willingness to sell. The question, not surprisingly, is the price. In the past, 
real estate appraisers estimated the land's worth at between $70 million to 
$130 million, but the last asking price in 1989 was $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters is a chill on the sale of the seaside coaches. 
According to a real estate agent who specializes in selling Malibu mobile 
homes, they can go for $80,000 to $200,000, with a handful of tonier models 
priced at $400,000 and up, depending on location and improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But because most banks have stringent loan restrictions for the purchase of 
mobile homes built before 1976, about 75% of coaches in the Westside parks, few 
purchasers can get financing. In Point Dume Club, where about 40 coaches are 
for sale, an additional deterrent is the higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an economic problem because these houses really aren't mobile. Once 
you're in a park, you really are a captive audience," said Curtis, who calls 
himself a mobile home park economist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Park owners raise rents, which increase the value of the parks . . . but 
homeowners who have $30,000 homes can only sell them to people who can pay the 
high rents, which means they usually have to lower the (asking) price if they 
want to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another distraction from the perfect life, according to some residents, is 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Point Dume Club tenants complained about the entry of families to its 
premises in 1989 after a federal law was amended to prohibit the exclusion of 
residents based on familial status. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the story. . . . This park used to be for seniors and now it's not, 
and we have no place else to go," groused one woman, who broke from a game of 
poker in the clubhouse to lodge a complaint with a visitor. She declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such concerns weigh heavy on the minds of some, others are 
undiminished in their enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is the best-kept secret in L.A.," said Jim O'Malley, an actor and 
three-year resident of Palisades Bowl, where he pays a combined mortgage and 
space rent of $900 a month. "I look out the window and if there are waves, I 
surf. I have 2,500 square feet of land with an ocean view. l couldn't get 
something like this anywhere in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 For one family, it is the realization of the American dream, complete with the 
requisite hours of sweaty labor necessary to give a deteriorated coach a face 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always dreamed of living here in Malibu and I got that dream," said Herb 
Dorszynski, who bought his "fixer-upper coach" for about $100,000 and pays 
about $1,000 a month for his space at Point Dume Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a million-dollar estate, but I am struggling to keep it, believe 
me," said Dorszynski, whose daughter Sylvia was busy digging up the front yard 
to plant flower seeds. "It's quiet and at night you can see a million stars. 
It's a great way to live."

FOR SENIORS; PSYCHOLOGIST HAS MADE DEATH HIS LIFE'S WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Herman Feifel is losing his sight, but not his vision. Known as the father of 
the modern death movement, he is full of vitality, with a booming voice and the 
enthusiasm of a university student. 
</P>
<P>
 His thoughts come quickly -- one hitched to the other, complete with 
references to philosophy, religion, psychology -- and none are morbid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is not lived fully unless the idea of death is grappled with honestly," 
said Feifel, 78, the former chief psychologist at the Veterans Administration 
Outpatient Clinic in Westwood, a faculty member at the USC School of Medicine 
and a resident of West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with his seminal 1959 book, "The Meaning of Death," his prolific 
writings have changed our way of thinking about death, inspiring two 
generations of researchers and clinicians, colleagues say. 
</P>
<P>
 But he admits, just as we can't gaze at the sun, it is hard to look at death 
straight-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we can say is that death means we're not forever, which for me 
emphasizes the uniqueness of life -- living each day as a beginning, stressing 
the gift of life given anew each morning after waking from sleep," Feifel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A young child believes that when you go to sleep you're dead, and that's not 
a remote idea since Hypnos, the Greek god of sleep, was the twin brother to 
Thanatos, the god of death." 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of person studies death? It's not as if he had a calling at an early 
age. But there are some events in his background that pointed him in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with the issues of redemption and death," he said. "In those days, 
when a relative died, at least in my environment, they died at home and were 
laid out. I was quite young when I saw my uncle's body. . . . There is a gift 
to comfort and care which is just as great as the gift of a cure -- though 
modern medicine gives up after the physician admits there is nothing else that 
can be done medically." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in an Orthodox Jewish environment that he rebelled 
against early on, Feifel attended New York public schools and received his 
bachelor's degree from City University of New York. He received his master's 
degree in 1939 from Columbia University and enlisted in the Army Air Force 
before completing his doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Designated an aviation psychologist, he helped pick flight crews for World War 
II combat missions whose personnel had a good chance of not coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We flew by the seat of our pants making these selections," he said. "But the 
interesting factor was that fear of death was never part of the selection 
process for pilots. In fact, the most successful pilots were those who felt 
they could not die." 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Feifel completed his doctorate and launched his study of how 
people accommodate to the ultimate stress -- the knowledge of impending death. 
What fascinated him during the war and afterward was that the topic was never 
confronted by science. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, he received the first national research grant awarded to study 
attitudes toward death. Until then, the subject was not considered appropriate 
for genuine scientific inquiry and finding subjects was difficult. As one 
physician told him, "The one thing you never do is discuss death with a 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Feifel found cooperative colleagues. During the 1960s and 1970s, 
workshops and courses on dying, death and mourning appeared in universities and 
professional schools all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a select international group of physicians, theologians, educators, 
writers and behavioral scientists meets every 18 months to consider related 
issues. They range from the way we die in modern society to the way different 
cultures view death and dying, and most recently, the business aspects of death 
with people living longer by artificial means. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death, like sex, involves everyone, so just as we have sex education, we now 
have death education in universities and medical schools all over the world," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the essentials, he said: the understanding that dying is not only a 
medical affair but also a human one. That life is not just a matter of length 
but of depth and quality. That healing the spirit is as important as healing 
the body. And that acceptance of personal mortality is one of the foremost 
entryways to self-knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we accepted death as a necessity rather than demote it to the level of 
mischance, if we accepted death from the very beginning," he wrote in "American 
Psychologist" in 1990, "energies could be available to us for more positive 
aspects of living, perhaps even fortifying our gift for creative splendor 
against our genius for destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 What of Herman Feifel's future? 
</P>
<P>
 He is struggling with loss. Having undergone several operations on his eyes, 
he is no longer able to indulge in either of his two favorite pastimes -- 
reading and playing handball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in transition," he said. "I have not accepted Braille yet. What Milton 
said, 'They also serve who stand and wait,' is not for me. I have a lot of fire 
left."

TAKING HIGH ROADS AND LOW ROADS THROUGH IRELAND; IN CONNEMARA, NESTLED IN A 
REMOTE COTTAGE IN A GAELIC-SPEAKING POCKET OF IRELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By I. HERBERT GORDON, Gordon is a New York City-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was early morning. Cool and damp. I was fanning a turf fire in a fireplace 
that had been kitchen stove and central heating before the Irish cottage, where 
my wife, our twin teen-age daughters and I were staying, had been modernized. 
Suddenly there came a heavy knocking on the sturdy wooden front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Glancing out the window I saw an elderly man who I supposed to be a motorist 
in trouble and seeking a telephone in this barren region, where the next phone 
may be 10 miles away. Edging through a closet-sized foyer bulging with coats 
and dirty Wellingtons, I pulled the door open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I help you?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, and I should be helping you," the man said, smiling and walking past me 
directly to the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got it burnin'!" he exclaimed. "Howd'ye know about turf fires?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, uh, I have built a few fires," I explained apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
 We had arrived the night before and that was my first meeting with Tom, a man 
with eyes as blue as the Irish sky and a face as craggy as the rocky shore of 
the small inlet off Bertraghboy Bay, a few yards behind our isolated cottage. 
The farmer and his wife lived a half mile down the road. They had a 
long-standing arrangement with my wife's family in Dublin, who owned the 
charming cottage we were staying in, to keep an eye on it when it was 
unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 On the rare occasions when he saw an unfamiliar car parked on the narrow 
road's grassy shoulder, generously dotted with splatters of manure from 
free-roaming cows, he would walk over and show the temporary occupants how to 
build a fire with turf, somewhat comparable to very soft coal. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later his wife, as bright and friendly as your favorite aunt, 
delighted all of us when she arrived carrying a loaf of homemade bread baked on 
a fireplace hearth and faintly redolent of turf smoke, carefully wrapped in her 
worn, blue apron. She said she had baked it "this vera mornin'. And 'tis for 
yer breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
 Their warmth is a universal trait of the people who live in a lonely and 
hauntingly beautiful corner of all Ireland, the western coastal region of 
Connemara whose epicenter is Glinsk. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a stark and unyielding land. The thin soil has always given grudgingly 
of its fruits, and fishermen long battled the sea in fragile, oar-driven boats 
known as currachs . Separated from the rest of Ireland by vast bogs, bleak 
terrain and barren, precipitous quartzite mountains, it is a sparsely settled 
area, which the 20th Century is only beginning to invade, and the customs of 
the past are still much alive. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the heart of Gaelic-speaking Ireland. Though the people are fluent in 
English, the ancient tongue -- referred to locally as Irish -- is their 
language of street, pub and classroom. Place names usually are written both in 
English and Gaelic, and sometimes only Gaelic. Ancient pride, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, a powerful lure of this barren and remote countryside, where we have 
traveled on several occasions and most recently visited last December, is that 
it is off the tourist paths -- a wondrous place for those who seek the road 
less traveled, but not for those who enjoy bright lights, theater, elegant 
shopping and an active night life. 
</P>
<P>
 You won't hear Mozart at a live concert, but your toes will tap merrily as you 
sit in smoke-filled pubs listening to the beat of traditional Irish music by 
local musicians. It is a taste of real country Irish life. 
</P>
<P>
 Connemara has traditionally been a sparsely settled land. Because of its 
isolation, it historically resisted a close alliance with the rest of Ireland. 
The locals waved to Columbus when his flotilla stopped in Galway Bay on its way 
to the New World. In the mid-1800s, more than half the population left, most 
coming to America because of the potato famine. In the late 1800s, Clifden -- 
today one of Connemara's main tourist centers -- became the unofficial capital 
of the region and a popular vacation location for British hunters and 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists have no trouble finding Glinsk, sometimes spelled Glynsk or Glinsce, 
on road maps of Connemara, 176 miles almost due west of Dublin. But they may 
never know they've found it while driving along a narrow and lonely coastal 
stretch of Route L102. Glinsk consists of only three or four widely scattered 
cottages and the gleaming white Glynsk House, a modest hotel atop a small hill 
in the middle of nowhere, between bog and ocean, with sweeping views of the 
striking landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel has a dozen charming rooms, a bar popular as a local gathering place 
and a turf fire always flickering cozily in the lobby. Some eight empty miles 
south is the village of Carna. As Connemara is a center of one of Ireland's 
Gaelic-speaking pockets, this tiny community is the very soul of those who 
cling to the ancient tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Glinsk and Carna are more of the endless flat peat bogs pushing up 
against the mountains. On our first drive to Carna we stopped to watch a couple 
of farmers cutting and piling heavy black peat into long rows to let it dry 
before it is compressed into shiny, black brick-size blocks of turf, a task 
they have performed for generations. The girls were delighted when they waved 
and the farmers, leaning on their shovels, waved back, beckoning them to come 
over for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally one drives past a cottage, almost always white, surrounded by 
plots of land ringed with stone fences and, often, with stone remnants of a 
long abandoned home nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Carna has one street and a couple of stores, Moran's market and Geraghty's 
supermarket, with bushel baskets out front heaped with packages of turf. There 
are, of course, the pubs. Popular are Mac's bar, whose Irish name is Tigh 
Mheaic, and the cheerful bar in Moran's, whose name is Tigh Mhorain. 
</P>
<P>
 The village is a wonderful place to hear Irish music almost every night in any 
of the pubs. One night we attended an Irish dance, known as celi , in the high 
school gym. I captured the joyous musicians with their whistles and drums on my 
tape recorder. My wife was delightfully shocked when the mayor, a man broad of 
shoulder and light on his feet, invited her to be his partner in a traditional 
dance set. 
</P>
<P>
 During July there are numerous local festivals bouncing with Irish music and 
colorful traditional dances in the Carna area. One of the most unusual is the 
celebration of "St. Mac Dara's Day," July 16. Saint Mac Dara, the patron saint 
of Carna, lived on a nearby island. A pilgrimage goes to the island to hold a 
Mass, watch boat races and celebrate. The island's St. Mac Dara chapel dates 
back to the 6th Century, the same century the region was swept into 
Catholicism. The chapel was restored in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashore, all of Carna celebrates. Visitors will recognize how important the 
holiday is because the pubs, which normally close around 11 p.m., on this night 
are allowed by law to stay open as long as the stout flows and the violins, 
drums and tin whistles play. 
</P>
<P>
 The best-known festival in Connemara, however, is the annual Connemara pony 
show in Clifden, this year on Aug. 18. Legend has it that these sturdy, 
powerful small horses descended from Arabian horses that swam ashore after part 
of the Spanish Armada was destroyed in storms nearby. The breeders range from 
farmers to aristocrats, but they share one thing besides their love of the 
ponies -- a love of Guinness. 
</P>
<P>
 The most spectacular mountains in Connemara are the steep and treeless Twelve 
Bens -- sometimes called Twelve Pins -- a cluster of 2,000-plus foot peaks 
about 15 miles north of Carna as the endangered, protected raven flies, but 
twice that far on the twisting road that follows the rock-strewn coast. There 
are several well-marked hiking trails in Connemara National Park, a small 
section of the Pins, with exhilarating views of bogs, lakes, ocean and 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifden, with a population of perhaps 1,000, about 25 miles from Glinsk, has 
shops offering a remarkable selection of local art and handmade Irish tweed 
clothing. We were especially pleased with the quality and variety at the Celtic 
Shop (in the nearby village of Spiddal, we found similar quality at Standun). 
</P>
<P>
 Four miles from Clifden are several towering radio masts where Guglielmo 
Marconi operated the first commercially reliable two-way transatlantic 
telephone service, and, nearby, a monument marks an almost forgotten epic in 
aviation history. Here in 1919, two aviators, John Alcock and Arthur Brown, 
landed their biplane in the first nonstop crossing of the Atlantic, flying from 
Newfoundland to Ireland. Both sites are well marked. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond being awed by the coast, visiting imposing ruins and prowling through 
shops in the few villages, visitors can fish for trout on lakes scattered 
throughout the area, go to sea in chartered fishing boats for about $25 per 
person, and hike over mountains, across bogs or along the coast to watch the 
seals. At almost every tiny port, boats are available for hire to visit 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers who wish to challenge the always breezy Connemara Golf Club 
overlooking the Atlantic near Clifden be warned: It is a point of honor to play 
through, whether hail or gale. Several villages have free tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent horsewomen, our then 15-year-old daughters quickly spotted roadside 
signs at several horse liveries along the coastal roads. Weather permitting, 
they galloped along the beaches, their red hair flying in the wind, or took 
trail rides into the mountains almost daily for about $4 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The scattered beaches are fine for picnicking, but the waters, even in 
mid-summer, are chilly for swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 On the coast road a dozen miles north of Carna lies one of the most elegant 
country hotels in all Ireland, the Cashel House. Its 50 acres of rare and 
colorful flowering gardens have won both praise and awards. It commemorates 
with unabashed pride in its printed literature when the late Gen. and Mrs. 
Charles de Gaulle spent a two-week vacation there in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an outstanding riding school, the hotel stables breed Connemara 
ponies and offer guided pony treks into the mountains or across the bogs. At 
the hotel there are also tennis courts, croquet, billiards and a tiny 
ocean-side beach, which is a pleasant walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 We found the Cashel House restaurant to be visually stunning, with polished 
wood and gleaming brass. Unfortunately, our meal of lamb and fish was merely 
acceptable, especially considering the price. Dinner for four, with wine and 
tip, was $210. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from Cashel House is the Zetland House hotel, smaller but equally 
charming and in the same price range (about $95 in summer). It is well worth a 
special visit to its truly wonderful restaurant, where we dined on superb lamb 
and beautifully done salmon. Our dinner tab for four, including wine, tip, and 
a magnificent view of the nearby ocean, was $190. 
</P>
<P>
 If meal prices seem high for such a rural area, it should also be pointed out 
that dinner in local restaurants and pubs will range from $6 to $10. A cheerful 
"pint" of heady dark beer is extra. 
</P>
<P>
 But to touch the intimate heart of the people, stuff yourself on hearty 
portions of Irish home cooking, and hear endless tales of this mystical corner 
of Ireland, then you must spend a few days of casual B&B touring. Technique: 
Drive in any direction on any road, from coast to mountains, until you see a 
"B&B" sign in front of a home that pleases your taste. All are clean and 
pleasant, some are antique and beautiful. The Irish love children, and so do 
the B&Bs. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally something wonderful happens by accident in Connemara. This is the 
way we stumbled upon Janny Levin's modest booklet, "Discover Carna, A Guide for 
Visitors" (published in 1991), under a stack of magazines at Geraghty's 
supermarket in Carna. We paid about $2.25 and found it to be an invaluable 
guide to the charms of the area. In 16 pages of amiable text and hand-drawn 
maps -- all place names in both Gaelic and English -- it told us where to 
gather mussels and periwinkles, spot seals, find orchids, watch heron and 
curlew, and go on memorable walks in both bog and mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost more significantly: for readers with further questions, the author 
lists his personal telephone number in the book . . . an illustration of just 
how small and friendly this part of Ireland is. GUIDEBOOK: The Cream of 
Connemara 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: For air service information see Dingle Guidebook, L15. Drive 
time from Shannon to Glinsk is about three hours.

TAKING HIGH ROADS AND LOW ROADS THROUGH IRELAND; IN COUNTY KILDARE, COCOONED IN 
BARONIAL BLISS AMONG THE HORSY SET AT THE SUPERPOSH KILDARE HOTEL AND COUNTRY

<P>
 At the risk of sounding snobbish, I am not a bed and breakfast type person. I 
do not like my morning tea with strangers seated around a sturdy pine table, 
slurped from thick, hand-thrown mugs. Let it arrive on a tray, poured from a 
Limoges pot, toast standing like soldiers in a silver rack, a red rosebud for a 
splash of color. I like crumbs in the bed when I leave it for the day, and I've 
left them in some lovely establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 This bank-breaking habit has taken us to hotels such as the Gritti Palace and 
the Cipriani in Venice, Im Palais Schwarzenberg in Vienna and Hong Kong's 
breathtaking Regent. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Ireland's newish Kildare Hotel, an ordered little dominion that takes 
your pleasure very seriously, as my mate and I discovered on a visit late last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels themselves are a relatively new enterprise in Ireland where, until the 
mid-1800s, tiny wayside inns were the order of the day, offering little more 
than a stable for the stallions, a pub for a pint and a soft place to lay your 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's travelers to these gentle shores, however, include a sophisticated set 
seeking gourmet repasts, genteel sports and elegant swaddling. There has been a 
vast chasm between what they sought and what they got. Then along came the 
Kildare Hotel and Country Club, a Relais & Chateaux and Exclusive Hotels 
member, with a standard so lavish nothing in Ireland can quite compare with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge, say the owners, the Smurfit Group Corp., run by Michael Smurfit 
(whose family is Ireland's answer to the Rockefellers), was to create a 
world-class hotel with a uniquely Gaelic atmosphere. True, the countryside 
hereabouts is dotted with Georgian- and Regency-style inns, comfy and sweet, 
but far from grand. You could not compare the very best of them to Scotland's 
Inverlochy Castle, or England's Cliveden Hotel, Sharrow Bay Country House, or 
Chewton Glen, all paragons of virtue in which we have stayed and that never 
fail to impress. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, though, after my husband and I stayed there, we decided the 
Kildare may be the closest to perfection we've ever experienced. Its staff and 
managers appear to stick to their own golden rule: High-paying guests should 
arrive armed with lofty expectations and prepare to have them met, not with a 
curt smile or deferential nod but with an almost ennobling reverence. 
</P>
<P>
 Located 30 minutes and 17 miles from Dublin and sprawled on 330 acres, the 
Kildare boasts an Arnold Palmer-designed golf course, sybaritic health spa and 
the country's only Michelin-starred restaurant, the Byerley Turk. Opened in 
1991, the "K Club," as it's locally known, is a sensual feast for eye, ear, 
taste, touch and smell. Everything looks bucolically beautiful; peace reigns 
throughout. It is, in fact, confoundingly hard to pick the bones out of the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 A genuinely warm spirit of hospitality is what sets the Irish country house 
hotel apart from its British or French cousins, an ardor that welcomes the 
stranger without question. And even within the Kildare's sumptuous environs, 
that quality is present. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike drafty stone castles and ancient rambling manors that have been merely 
half converted to accommodate overnight guests, Straffan House, the Kildare's 
centuries-old historical setting, was entirely re-made and added-to in a 
resoundingly successful architectural style that defies you to guess where the 
old manor ends and the new wing begins. 
</P>
<P>
 The main building, where the majority of guest rooms and suites are located, 
is an edifice rex resembling a French chateau more reminiscent of the Loire 
Valley than an Irish county. But the classic grand theme frees the guest rather 
than confines. You want to ramble through these halls and are encouraged to do 
so. You can walk to the very end of a corridor to examine one of the splendid 
Russian oil portraits on display, or climb to the third floor to admire the 
view from bow windows of the sculptured gardens below, the River Liffey and 
legendary Hill of Allen in the distance beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware, however, that your fellow guests are of the Hermes golf bag and 
cashmere pullover ilk, a preppyish club of East Coast Americans, English lords 
and Irish bankers. (Their royal guest just last weekend was Monaco's Prince 
Albert.) Venturing out in the early morning air for a quick run when everyone 
seemed fast asleep in their linen sheets, I hastily threw on a pair of old 
bicycle shorts and faded sweat shirt. Much to my chagrin, I returned to find a 
lobby full of the country club set, decked out in their softest flannels and 
silks. I bet the staff at the desk had never seen anyone bolt up that sweeping 
center staircase so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Presidential Suite across from us, a young golf-playing couple from 
Valley Forge, Pa., was ensconced with their young daughter and her nanny in 
tow. But the most memorable, and by far most vocal fellow guest was a 
flamboyant Bea Arthur look-alike who spent her days combing the area on an 
antiquing safari with a tiny, spectacled male furniture expert always at her 
side. Like characters in a play, they'd walk into the public rooms, the massive 
lady delivering lines such as, "Didn't we find the most fabulous armoire today! 
It was worth spending this extra week, wasn't it?," in a booming staccato. The 
meek fellow would nod, glance nervously about, and they'd exit, stage left. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything at the hotel, from the fragrantly heady gardens to the chambers of 
velvet, brocade and plush carpet are designed to effectively smother stress. 
And if, perchance, after a few days of this stupefying coddling you feel 
lethargy setting in, your pulse will quicken and the blood rush to your head 
when management presents you with the bill. The Kildare is an extravagance 
(double rooms in the main house start at $309), but sublime. 
</P>
<P>
 The county itself, one of eight in this East Midlands area, is named for the 
Gaelic Cill Dara , meaning "church of the oak." It's the nucleus of horse 
country, and vast, grazable grassland is delicately embroidered with Europe's 
prime stud farms, mostly owned by Irish "old money" and oil-rich Arab sheiks. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach to the Kildare itself is a rural road, cutting through the hamlet 
of Straffan, curving past a tiny sweet shop, a petrol pump and an old stone 
church. Just before a low bridge, the iron gates of the property swing into 
view, a majestic "K" in gold on each side. (The town of Kildare, larger than 
Straffan, is actually about 20 miles away.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious why County Kildare drew the late 19th-Century Romantics, led by 
Sir Walter Scott, to its wooded landscape with dreamy bowers and lush trysting 
spots, the better to compose love's purple prose. James Joyce, educated at 
nearby Clongowes Wood College in the town of Clane, set the opening of his 
"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" there. Kildare is, in fact, a 
crossroads for artists of all sorts, so chic of late that it's in danger of 
becoming downright fashionable. Perhaps it's the fact that nothing much has 
changed in the last 50,000 years that's luring "blow-ins" (resident 
jet-setters) such as rockers Eric Clapton and Ron Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hotel, a veritable mini-museum's worth of 20th-Century pictures are 
hung with a perfectionist's eye, including a whole room designed around their 
Jack Yeatscollection (poet W.B.'s brother), with valuable Russian, Colombian, 
English and Irish artifacts elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The same attention to detail is evidenced right down to the flower 
arrangements and writing desks in each of the 45 luxe guest rooms and suites. A 
smattering of self-contained apartments, like tiny 18th-Century villas, are 
also available in the former manor stables, and an impressive three-bedroom 
lodge can be had for the right price. Our suite, in the main building, looked 
like the set for a Ralph Lauren fashion layout, with a marble bathroom you 
could park a Daimler in, and service to match: No pillow went unplumped, no 
towel unwarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Each room is individually decorated, and some have been painted by mural 
artist Don Knox. My favorite public room was the olive-sized cocktail bar next 
to the restaurant, a Maxfield Parrish pastoral pastiche of blue sky and puffy 
white clouds to shelter the drinker. Another artist, Naomi MacBride, did a 
stellar job hand-painting the Chinese Drawing Room, one of several areas where 
guests can loll about sipping tea or after-dinner liqueurs, warmed by a blazing 
turf fire and plenty of back issues of "Country Life." But, it's the paintings 
and sculpture that most impress, important works lining the halls, public rooms 
and guest quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Art of another sort is practiced in the Kildare's kitchens by bona fide stove 
star Michel Flamme, who has stamped his French brand on a new wave of Irish 
eating. Ireland has never received high marks for cooking. For centuries, it 
was either feast or famine at the table, and when the gentry produced a "proper 
meal," it was with dishes such as pickled fish and turkey pout. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so gauche appears on the oversized designer plates in the hotel's 
Byerley Turk Restaurant, named for a revered stallion whose lineage runs 
throughout the world's finest thoroughbred bloodstock. His massive portrait 
covers one entire red-brocaded wall in this columned room, surrounded by starry 
chandeliers, severe portraits of peers in powdered wigs and rolling views to 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner is a dress affair here, a slightly pretentious ritual that manages to 
recreate with old-fashioned decadence the old days of the great experience 
gastronomique. The international menu is hipper than that, however, emphasizing 
simple-but-perfect creations where freshness is the key. Everything from salad 
greens to berries at dessert hail from the estate's own gardens. Our first 
night at the hotel, we shared a tranquil meal at dusk, accompanied by a 
black-gowned harpist and attended by a staff of formal-suited waiters. So 
formal, in fact, they even brought a brocaded stool for my tiny evening purse 
to rest upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Come the Sabbath, locals decked out in their best suits, hats and handbags 
appear from Dublin and nearby villages for a traditional "Sunday lunch," as 
prevalent here as in England. Compared to the simple surrounding villages, the 
Kildare's beauty is almost daunting, yet its owners press everyone to visit, 
even just for coffee or tea and viewing the pictures or strolling the gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel and its cream-colored golf clubhouse are artfully placed among lime, 
oak and beech trees so that nature is rarely disturbed. This can drive golfers 
mad on the trickier holes (like the dreaded 18th, dubbed the Hooker's 
Graveyard), but pleases the conservationists no end. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal panel garden stretches from the main house to a fountain and pool 
with granite cherubs near the riverbank. Tripping down these bordered stairs is 
like stepping into a Constable landscape, and I wandered the curve of lawn to a 
19th-Century white suspension bridge spanning the Liffey and shaded by a 
fantastic red-fruited tree. Known as the Hawthorn, this particular variety is 
associated with the "little people": Locals refuse to fell a Hawthorn lest they 
incur the wrath of the fairies and are forever cursed. 
</P>
<P>
 A secretive delight is stumbling upon the walled kitchen gardens where the 
hotel's food is organically grown. Wandering on, I met some wild pheasant, and 
wound up back at the river, where a familiar figure in khaki struggled to 
retrieve a stray shot from the murky depths. Too frustrated to muster much of a 
greeting, my husband nevertheless praised the challenge of the K Club's course. 
</P>
<P>
 No self-respecting manor would be complete without a croquet lawn, taken over 
during our visit by three giggling little boys in short pants and knee socks 
who turned somersaults on the grass after every shot. If croquet sounds too 
pedestrian and pheasant hunting -- it can be arranged -- too beastly, you could 
attempt the club's clay-pigeon shooting or try horseback riding, set up for us 
at neighboring stables. The ride through the woods and fields of tall green 
grass almost made me forget I wanted a swim and massage back at the hotel's 
health spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the main hotel for easy access from rooms, the spa has an indoor 
pool lit entirely by chandeliers, a healthy juice bar, sauna, massage and 
beauty treatments. It's a stunning facility, but also, alas, the one snag in 
the velvet cocoon, so to speak. I found that male and/or golfing guests were 
treated to much better service at the primarily "old boy"-style golf clubhouse, 
while many female-oriented services are not as readily at hand. Example: I 
phoned early in the morning to arrange a massage and manicure, and the polite 
spa receptionist said she'd phone me right back with an appointment time. Hours 
stretched into late afternoon, and no word, so I went down to the spa, only to 
find no record of any request, no masseuse, no manicurist. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile of the River Liffey is owned by the hotel; the river accompanies you 
down the fairways and beyond, and is often stocked with salmon and brown trout 
for which guests fish. In the 19th Century this was one of Ireland's premier 
fishing waterways and thanks to the hotel's re-stocking, it now lures eager 
anglers such as part-time country squire Mick Jagger, an Irish landowner 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the K Club rests within 30 minutes' driving distance of every 
major race course in Ireland did not escape us, and given the choice between 
touring famous literary sights and playing the ponies, I'm afraid the beasts 
won out. Besides, a day at an Irish meet will offer more in the way of true 
Irish culture than any tour of Joyce's former haunts can. 
</P>
<P>
 Society in this country is far from classless, a fact most clearly evident at 
the Irish Derby, held every summer at the Curragh, a legendary racecourse near 
the K Club. Two seasons ago during my first Ireland visit, we had the good 
fortune to attend this see-and-be-seen soiree, which took place this year June 
26. The attendant smart set, dressed for a Merchant-Ivory film, fluttered their 
designer wings, nibbling cucumber and salmon sandwiches and swilling "champers" 
(Champagne) under billowing white tents, despite the inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
 With Dublin so close to the Kildare, it's easy to pop into the city for an 
afternoon's shopping and dinner, and if you don't rent a car, the hotel 
provides transportation, as they did for us. But the strong smell of seaweed in 
the briny air, the constant tolling of tower bells, and the bustling hordes of 
trendy young things seemed too sharp a contrast to Kildare's fresh breeze and 
deserted lanes, and we felt relieved to return long past midnight to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 As we headed up the grand staircase toward our suite, my feet dragging a bit 
after the city's pace, we heard the soft voice of the night receptionist behind 
us, asking, "Would you like a cup of cocoa sent up before you retire, Madam?" 
</P>
<P>
 Why, they'd even removed the crumbs from my bed. GUIDEBOOK: Keys to Ireland's 
'K Club' 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: There are no nonstop flights from LAX to Dublin, and most 
flights require a change of carriers in a connecting city. For example, 
American Airlines flies from LAX to New York's JFK, changing to Ireland's 
national carrier, Aer Lingus, for the flight to Dublin. The cost is about $950 
round trip. The exception is Delta, which flies to Dublin from LAX via Atlanta 
for about $1,050 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kildare Hotel and Country Club is a 30-minute drive from the airport, and 
they will arrange for a car to meet you upon arrival. If you prefer to rent 
your own wheels, Hertz and other rental agencies have offices at the airport. 
(Check on discount rates for making reservations from the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: The Kildare Hotel and Country Club (at Straffan, County 
Kildare, Ireland, telephone 011-353-1-62-73333, fax 011-353-1-62-73312, 
toll-free reservations 800-221-1074) has 45 rooms and suites. Doubles start at 
$309, including tax and use of most sports facilities and health spa (excluding 
golf and special activities). More reasonably priced "weekend rates" or 
"leisure breaks" are available. Courtyard suites, next to the main house, are 
about $265 per night for a double. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Breakfast, lunch, dinner and afternoon tea available at the K 
Club's two restaurants, the Michelin-starred Byerley Turk, and the less formal 
Legends, located in the country club. Dinner for two at the Byerley Turk is 
about $80 without wine. Excellent room service also available. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather: Early summer through September is the safest bet, but always be 
prepared for drizzle -- or a downpour.

TRAVEL INSIDER: NATIONAL PARKS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO RAISE NEEDED CASH; REVENUE: 
TOUR OPERATORS ARE ALREADY PAYING MORE; CHARGES FOR HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES AND 
OTHER FEE HIKES ARE PROPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing an annual billion-dollar bill to maintain our national park system, the 
Clinton Administration is looking for ways to maximize income at those parks. 
So if you're visiting one this summer, be prepared for new and increased fees, 
and the prospect of more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Park Service's focus is on tour operators and high-risk 
adventurers, and doesn't much affect the casual park visitor who arrives in a 
private vehicle. But if Interior Department officials prevail in their current 
proposal before Congress, the department, which oversees the Park Service, will 
have new autonomy in setting and spending park fees. And in that case, broad 
increases are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Service officials instituted the fee hike for tour operators in March, 
setting rates of $25 per entry for commercial vehicles holding up to six 
passengers, $40 for vehicles holding seven to 25 passengers, and $100 for 
vehicles holding 26 or more, including the many buses that roll through 
Yosemite Valley and other high-profile parks. Aircraft carrying tour groups 
over the Grand Canyon, Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes parks also face proposed 
additional fees, which are still being negotiated. The vehicle fee hikes alone 
could bring in added revenue of $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 (Many tour operators opposed the new fees, saying they would be forced to pass 
on costs to travelers. But Albert Schmid, president of Far West Travel Corp., a 
bus tour company based in Marina del Rey, said the new fees so far aren't 
costing his firm any more than under the Park Service's previous 
$3-per-bus-passenger plan at Yosemite. In fact, Schmid said, the new 
arrangement seems "more efficient" and takes less time at the gate.) 
</P>
<P>
 New fees for high-risk activities are another controversial subject. Since 
last August, Park Service officials have been working on a trial program to 
recover the costs of search-and-rescue activities at various parks. The testing 
ground is Alaska's Denali National Park, where rangers estimate that the Park 
Service spent $70,000 in 1993 on 16 missions to rescue lost, injured and 
stranded climbers on Mt. McKinley. This year, with seven deaths on park 
mountains and 23 rescue missions so far, the figure could be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, said J.D. Swed, south district ranger for Denali National 
Park, Park Service officials there will review public input (more than 220 
people wrote in) and consider a three-phase proposal that includes the 
first-ever user fees for climbers of Mt. McKinley and Mt. Foraker. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which would go into effect in time for next year's climbing 
season, would bolster pre-climb educational efforts, require registration 60 
days in advance (climbers now register on the same day they climb) and 
establish user fees, to be earmarked for administrative costs and 
pre-positioning of rescue crews. The fees first proposed were $500 per climber, 
which were then reduced to $200 per climber early this year. Rangers counted 
1,108 climbers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Less conspicuous fee hikes have already been imposed this year at Denali: The 
popular 87-mile bus ride from the park visitor center to Wonder Lake, formerly 
free, now carries a fee of $4 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the broader scheme of things, the biggest fee-related development could 
be the National Park Service Entrepreneurial Management Reform Act, also known 
as House Resolution 4533, now before Congress. The legislation, which probably 
won't be addressed until Congress reconvenes next year, would give the 
Secretary of the Interior authority to impose and adjust admission, 
recreational and special-use fees for parks, lifting currently mandated caps. 
(Congress now retains control over fee hikes.) The Park Service would also gain 
more autonomy over spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the fee hikes Interior officials have already said they would seek: At 
Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks and Death Valley National 
Monument, where adult fees now are $5 per carload or $3 per individual, the 
price would rise to $5 per individual. At Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Grand 
Teton National Parks, where fees now are $10 per car or $4 per individual, 
every adult would pay $5. Those increases are expected to double admissions 
revenues, which amounted to $68 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Where will this money go? Recently, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt estimated 
that the park system had "a present backlog of physical needs totaling over $5 
billion." In an earlier speech, Babbitt said that "for the last several 
generations, we've been exploiting the personnel of the National Park Service . 
. . . My visits to Park Service housing clusters often remind me of Third World 
slums." 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask myself if the American people would be willing to pay a little more" 
than they are now, said Babbitt, "for having the satisfaction of knowing they 
were helping to sustain (a) resource."

WEEKEND ESCAPE: CATALINA; NATIVE AMERICAN SUMMER; AT THE ISTHMUS, RENT-A-TEPEES 
ARE ROOMY ALTERNATIVES TO CAMPSITES AND TENT CABINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 8 a.m., and the ferry to Two Harbors on Catalina Island made its way 
slowly through the Port of Los Angeles. Then the captain gunned the engines as 
the channel widened and the boat headed for open sea. It was Saturday morning. 
The weather report was promising and we were eager to leave Los Angeles behind 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 We are newly returned to this city after many years away, and the past eight 
months of long commutes on crowded highways through endless urban sprawl had 
only increased our desire to load up the camping gear and slacken the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Harbors seemed to fit the bill. It was somewhat remote in that it is more 
like a fishing camp than tourist destination. But a book on California camping 
listed some amenities that had appeal when two small children are in tow -- a 
small restaurant, a general store and hot showers in town if desired. 
</P>
<P>
 And so we reserved a spot at the campground and then decided to go ourselves 
one better. We rented one of the tepees that dominate a point of land above Two 
Harbors, eliminating the need to bring over a tent. 
</P>
<P>
 The tepees, I am told, have been around a couple of years and they are not 
cheap by most camping standards. They run $60 per night for up to six people, 
with a two-night weekend minimum during summer months. Fortunately for us, we 
went over before the summer rule went into effect and were able to stay a 
single night. 
</P>
<P>
 The tepees are not an authentic part of island history, but a bit of whimsy on 
the part of the company that runs the campground. The Gabrielino, who once 
inhabited Catalina, built houses that were domed, circular structures, 
sometimes 60 feet in diameter, room enough for three or four families. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip over was fast and pleasant, turning to fun for the few passengers on 
board when porpoises raced alongside the boat as we neared the mouth of the 
harbor on the eastern side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Two Harbors becomes clear with one look at a map, for this is the 
isthmus of the island, a narrow neck of land no more than a half-mile wide. It 
is sparsely populated -- the locals number about 100. But it is also a favorite 
destina-tion of mainland sailors who tie up at the moorings and take their 
rubber dinghies in to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ferry pulled into the dock, the sun was shining brightly and we watched 
the boats, both sail and motor variety, bobbing at their moorings. The tawny 
hills reached upward on either side of the harbor and we could see the 
campground just off to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 At the check-in office at the end of the dock, it became clear that life had, 
indeed, eased off the accelerator. The woman behind the counter filled out the 
campsite form and said that, sooner or later, the camp ranger would be by to 
pick up our gear and bring us to our tepee. And he did show up a few minutes 
later, saying we would have to bring our duffels and such around behind the 
building he pointed to, for no vehicles were allowed in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Town," actually, is something of a misnomer for this quiet little spot. It 
consists of the pier, a bar, a restaurant, a general store, a beach with picnic 
tables and a volleyball net, a few homes where the locals live and public 
showers. 
</P>
<P>
 We put the heaviest bags on the truck -- at $1 per bag -- and carried the 
rest, hiking on a path while the truck took the road. We paused several times 
along the way to take in the spectacular view of the harbor. And when we 
finally got to the tepee, we wished we had brought the tent. The tepee was 
huge, far too large for our needs. It was also hot and there was no way to 
close it off against ants and other insects. Having said that, I hasten to add 
that the tepee cooled off in the evening and that it was pleasant to look at 
the stars through the opening in the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The tepees, made of canvas and tall wooden poles, were built in a rough 
circle, separated from the rest of the camping spots by a large gully traversed 
by a wooden bridge. Each of the tepees had a picnic table and campfire ring and 
was equipped with a butane stove and lantern. 
</P>
<P>
 They would be great for larger groups. The ranger later told me of a family 
reunion in which all five tepees were rented and the crowd gathered in the 
evening around the large fire pit in the middle of the compound. I would add 
further that our 8-year-old daughter, Merrit, and 5-year-old son, Nick, thought 
the tepee very cool, indeed. But for us, on the next trip, the regular campsite 
(at $7.50 per night) or the tent cabins (at $40 per night), will do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranger arrived with the gear and took our order for various fuels -- wood 
for the campfire, charcoal for the grill and butane for the lamp and stove. One 
thing about camping on an island is that you can't bring any of these items 
with you because of Coast Guard regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to make the morning ferry, we had awakened at dawn and had only 
snacks on the boat over. The plan for the weekend was to have one meal in town 
and we opted to make it the first one. It was nothing fancy, just burgers and 
fries and a corn dog for Merrit at the snack bar, but I had not felt this 
relaxed since arriving back in Southern California. Call it a feeling that the 
major decision of each day would be of the "do we swim or do we hike?" variety. 
After lunch, we set off for the other side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason I thought it would take us an hour or so to get there, but we 
arrived in a matter of minutes, with a brief stop at the children's playground 
and another at the rope swings atop the hill. Dangling from two large trees, 
the swings had ropes so long from branch to seat that the kids went flying in 
long, graceful arcs. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked the dirt road to the cove, then spent an hour or so in the rocky 
tide pools examining the shells and barnacles and crabs and sea snails and 
other life in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked back to the tepee, changed into swimsuits and went down to the 
beach. Actually, Merrit went first. It had dawned on her that this was a 
different place in terms of supervision and that she had far more freedom 
because of the almost total lack of automobiles at Two Harbors. There were a 
couple of tour buses and some of the locals had cars and trucks, but that was 
all. Not a dirt bike in sight. And the dreaded RV was not to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked the 100 yards to the beach, plopped down and took in the sun. There 
were no waves here and snorkelers floated on the surface of the water. I made a 
mental note to bring snorkeling equipment the next time we came over. (There is 
scuba diving as well, with the West End Dive Center at the pier.) 
</P>
<P>
 The other treat was the sea lion in the cove that kept popping up its head 
like a submarine periscope. Then it would dive and pop up again in some other 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, we needed a few things in town -- beer and ice in particular 
-- and so made the short trek, with Merrit once again bounding out in front. In 
the early evening I started a fire on the grill for some dinner, which on this 
occasion was Italian sausage, buttered potatoes wrapped in foil, roasted onion, 
grilled zucchini and a nicely chilled Chardonnay for us, milk for the kids. As 
darkness fell, I lit the campfire and got the lantern ready as well. The 
children played with two small boys who occupied the adjacent tepee. Then they 
were ready for sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, Becky, and I sat at the picnic table and listened as the college kids 
who camped nearby made their way through a few drinking songs. But the day's 
sun and good times had taken their toll on them, as well, and soon enough, all 
was quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 We awoke early the next morning and cooked a breakfast of bacon and eggs on 
the camp stove before setting off for more of a look at the island before 
lunch. We made a quick side trip to the playground and rope swings before 
heading up the dirt road carved into the hillside high above Two Harbors. Far 
below us, we watched as scuba divers were towed out to deeper water. And as we 
rounded a bend, yet another beautiful cove lay below us. We walked on, then 
retraced our steps back to Two Harbors and then up to the campground. Lunch was 
less leisurely than we would have liked because the ferry was leaving at 2 p.m. 
and there was gear to pack up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the ranger arrived with his truck and we walked toward town, stopping 
along the way to take a few more pictures of the view. There was time enough 
for ice cream cones from the restaurant snack bar before boarding the ferry for 
the return trip to San Pedro. And we were home in time for dinner. Budget for 
Four Ferry, round trip: $122.00 Tepee: $60.00 Groceries and snacks: $63.50 
Baggage transport with tip: $15.00 Lunch: $19.40 Wood, coal, butane: $14.50 
Parking: $13.20 FINAL TAB: $307.60

 Welcome to the Fryers Club. 
</P>
<P>
 From early morning to late afternoon, on air mattresses and rented cabanas, 
they roast. Lying on beach mats, dripping in coconut oil and reading John 
Grisham novels, they bake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists come by the planeload to the high-rise resorts and smooth beaches of 
Maui's Kaanapali coast, determined to work on the most prized Hawaiian 
souvenir, a golden tan. 
</P>
<P>
 Coated in ultra block we join the oiled and the broiled on the hot sheltered 
beach for our final snorkel and swim on Maui. 
</P>
<P>
 Our second week on the Valley Isle began with a journey away from the sun to 
the small northeastern town of Hana where rain -- or liquid sunshine as it's 
called here -- falls 300 days a year. But first we encounter a "Mr. Toad's Wild 
Ride" of a road called the Hana Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Hawaii 360 we rise from the cane fields of central Maui to the east coast 
and past Hookipah Beach Park, beyond which dozens of daredevil windsurfers do 
flips and aquabatics on the fresh trade winds. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't any signs to announce that we're on the legendary Hana Highway 
but soon the road narrows and begins to twist and turn. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 600 hairpin bends, the road to "Heavenly Hana" can quickly turn 
into a "Highway From Hell." Car sickness is a real road hazard. While the kids 
are unaffected, we roll our windows down and do some serious deep breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 It has to be even worse for the tour buses that do the Hana shuffle. They're 
crammed with passengers and take the turns at twice the speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do get sick and we try to rotate their seats," says bus driver, Andy 
Raymond, during a waterfall photo break. 
</P>
<P>
 We survive the ride and pitch our tents at the free-of-charge Waianapanapa 
State Park, three miles from Hana. The million-dollar view from our tent screen 
window is of a black sand beach in a rugged rocky cove. 
</P>
<P>
 At night a full moon rises like a huge spotlight. It's so bright we don't even 
need our flashlights. For the first time, baby Presley, 1, discovers that she 
has a shadow and chases it in the moonlight, squealing and laughing, until it's 
time for bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hana is a sleepy place with just two general stores, a couple of gas stations 
and a few hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 But the peaceful seclusion ends abruptly when we park our car among a hundred 
other rentals above the waterfalls and ponds that flow through Oheo Gulch, more 
commonly known as "The Seven Sacred Pools of Hana." 
</P>
<P>
 At the visitor center, ranger Byron Cooke is not a happy camper. At every 
opportunity he exposes the myth of the "Seven Sacred Pools," as a con to fill 
tour buses. "The pools are not considered sacred by the Hawaiians," he tells us 
firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cooke is fighting a losing battle to slow down the flood of tourism. The 
crowds keep on coming, asking the way to the Seven Sacred Pools. 
</P>
<P>
 After three clear days on the Hana coast, gray clouds burst above our 
campsite. The tropical storm finds every hole in Henri and Matilda's generic 
tent, soaking their sleeping bags and clothes as they sleep. Our sturdy North 
Face model doesn't let a drop in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all wet," a sad and soggy Henri, 7, complains at dawn, wringing out his 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 In need of a clothes dryer and a sunshine fix, we head back to the dry side of 
the island and the Kaanapali coast. Using the Entertainment '94 card we get 50% 
off at the Aston Maui Park Hotel near Lahaina and for $55 a night move into a 
nearly luxurious one-bedroom suite with a pullout sofa and a full kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest book in our room informs us: "If you're lucky enough to come across 
a gecko (lizard) in your room, treat them kindly. They are a sign of good luck 
in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
 A lizard in the room! Henri and Matilda mount an intense but fruitless gecko 
search for the shy nocturnal critter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there's a free shuttle from the hotel that takes guests to Kaanapali and 
Lahaina we dump our rental car a few days early. 
</P>
<P>
 It feels great to act like normal tourists. We indulge in mai tais at midday, 
snorkel at Black Rock beach and kick back in the room watching O.J. updates. 
</P>
<P>
 On our last night on Maui, we go across the street to watch the sun as it sets 
over the Friendly Island, Molokai, our next destination. 
</P>
<P>
 In the orange glow of a Hawaiian dusk we walk back to the condo to pack our 
bags and prepare for an early morning ferry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," Matilda points above our doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 Two geckos are clinging to the wall.

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: INSECTS MAKING PESTS OF THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For travelers headed into Southern California's great outdoors this summer, 
there's good news and there's bad where pests are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 The mosquito population is dwindling. The risk of Lyme disease -- a much 
dreaded tick-borne inflammatory disorder -- remains low. It will probably be a 
boom year for spiders, though. 
</P>
<P>
 But vacationers who arm themselves with effective insect repellent and with 
information can increase their chances of enjoying a bite-free, sting-free 
camping or hiking trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosquitoes, for example, are more active in the summer when temperatures are 
higher and during early evening hours, said Roy Martin, an associate resource 
ecologist for the California Department of Parks & Recreation. They also tend 
to be more prevalent around stagnant pools of water. In areas where abatement 
programs are in place -- including most of Los Angeles County -- mosquitoes are 
less of a problem, said Gail Van Gordon, a public health entomologist with the 
Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity about Lyme disease has made many travelers unusually anxious, the 
experts said. But in Southern California the risk is "extremely low," according 
to Van Gordon. The tick most likely to affect Southern California hikers and 
campers, she said, is the American dog tick, which does not transmit Lyme 
disease. (It does, however, transmit other diseases such as Rocky Mountain 
spotted fever and tick paralysis.) 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of Lyme disease, transmitted by the deer tick and the Western 
black-legged tick, is much greater in areas other than Southern California, 
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher-risk areas include Northern California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. Lyme disease is rare in the Rocky Mountain 
states, as well as in Hawaii and Alaska, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
 Later-than-normal rainfall -- prompting unusually moist conditions -- will 
probably cause the Southern California spider population to swell, Van Gordon 
said. But most spiders encountered in this area are fairly harmless, she said, 
with two exceptions: the female black widow and the South American violin. 
</P>
<P>
 A female black widow is relatively large with a shiny, black, swollen abdomen 
and a red hourglass marking on the underside of its abdomen, Van Gordon said. 
The South American violin spider, which is brown with violin-shaped markings, 
is more likely found in dark basements than outdoors, Van Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to knowing which pests are prevalent and where they are likely to 
be found, dressing properly can help. Wear long pants and long sleeves. Avoid 
wearing cologne, floral-patterned clothing, scented hair spray or scented 
lotions, experts advise, because all can attract insects. 
</P>
<P>
 Insect repellents can help. Those with DEET (N, N diethyl-m-toluamide) are one 
option. "DEET is effective but should not be used in concentrations above 25% 
or 30%," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 For young children and teen-agers, use no more than 10% DEET, Theriot said. 
"Spread it evenly. Don't put it on the hands and fingers of young kids," he 
added. Check with a pediatrician before using DEET or other repellents on 
children 2 or younger, said an American Academy of Pediatrics spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatives to DEET-based repellents are formulas with citronella, the same 
ingredient as is found in patio candles designed to repel insects. Another 
over-the-counter repellent, Natrapel, for example, contains aloe vera and 
citronella but not DEET. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse off all insect repellents when children come indoors, Theriot advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite preventive measures, insect bites will undoubtedly still occur and 
most will prove harmless. If the bite is from a tick, remove the tick as soon 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Early symptoms of Lyme disease include a bite-site rash in the shape of a 
bull's eye or target pattern, experts said. Flu-like symptoms can occur, 
including headache, fever and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers worried about Lyme disease should ask their physician about getting 
a blood test if there is reason to suspect they have been bitten by a tick from 
a location where the disease is prevalent. Oral antibiotics are the usual 
treatment. If there are other unusual symptoms after a tick bite, seeking 
professional help is advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Many spider bites go unnoticed. But bites from a black widow produce immediate 
pain that can travel through the body and affect muscles, Van Gordon said. The 
bite site of a South American violin "looks like acid has been dropped on the 
skin," she said. Get immediate medical help if bites from these spiders are 
suspected, Theriot said.

TAKING THE KIDS: IDEAS FOR SAFEKEEPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

(HarperCollins West, $9.95).

<TEXT>
<P>
 The empty bottle of Dramamine was in 3-year-old Melanie's hand, the 
cherry-flavored motion sickness medicine smeared all over her mouth and shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I not feeling well," she complained. 
</P>
<P>
 It had all happened in a moment. While her dad was busy unloading the minivan, 
Melanie managed to open the glove compartment, untwist the child-resistant cap 
on the bottle and guzzle the pink syrupy stuff that had been stashed there -- 
forgotten since our last big car trip. Of course she'd been told time and time 
again never to take medicine herself. Of course, I shouldn't have left it in 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
 We were just lucky it wasn't a more toxic drug. Still, Melanie and I had to 
spend the afternoon in the emergency room and the night in the hospital's 
pediatric unit where she slept off the drug while being monitored to make sure 
her heartbeat and breathing didn't go haywire from the overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Melanie was back to her noisy, energetic self: She went straight 
from the hospital to her sister's Little League game. I needed longer to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordeal and a late-night chat with the hospital nurses made me realize how 
close we might have come to a real tragedy. Each year nearly 8,000 children die 
in the United States from unintentional injury -- more than from all childhood 
diseases combined -- according to the National Safe Kids Campaign, a nonprofit 
childhood injury prevention program sponsored by the medical supplies 
manufacturer Johnson & Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day more than 35,000 children are injured seriously enough to require 
medical treatment for various injuries including car and bike accidents, burns, 
near drownings and poisonings. Like Melanie, 360,000 are hurt seriously enough 
to be admitted. Another 50,000 are permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer is prime injury season. At this time of year we tend to let down our 
guard, heading outdoors to playgrounds and pools, and on vacation to beaches 
and the homes of friends and relatives. But we need to be extra vigilant. More 
children are fatally injured during the summer than at any other time of year, 
according to the National Safe Kids Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever people make changes from their usual routines -- doing something 
different or being in a different place -- it increases the likelihood of 
accidental injury," said Dr. Mark Widome, a pediatrician, Pennsylvania State 
University medical school professor and safety spokesman for the American 
Academy of Pediatrics. "The most important thing parents can do is plan ahead," 
he said. For example, take a bottle of syrup of Ipecac along on all trips, in 
case a child eats something poisonous or takes someone else's medicine, as 
Melanie did. But don't use it unless directed to by a doctor or poison control 
center expert. 
</P>
<P>
 If the kids are small, ask the car rental agency to provide a child safety 
seat. Check to see if the hotel you are staying in offers child-proofed rooms 
or amenities, such as bed railings or outlet covers. A growing number do, 
including some Embassy Suites and Hyatt properties. Ask about other special 
features for families. Westin Hotels, for example, just began offering 
families, on request, free safety kits complete with children's ID bracelets 
and emergency phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 One tip from Safe Kids Campaign associate director Kathryn Kincaid: Keep hotel 
bathrooms off-limits (as much as possible) to cruising toddlers and 
preschoolers to separate them from Dad's razor and Mom's allergy pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kincaid also suggests that parents discuss safety concerns before arriving for 
a stay at Grandma's or with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask that the hosts move household chemicals, plants, ashtrays and medicines to 
out-of-reach spots. Too many toddlers have landed in the emergency room after 
eating grandma's blood pressure pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't neglect the older kids. No matter how much they beg, never let them swim 
alone. Insist on bike helmets. Make sure they know how to get out of the hotel 
or house in case of fire. Be more circumspect too, when giving them the run of 
the hotel or unfamiliar neighborhood. They may get lost or not be sufficiently 
careful crossing unfamiliar streets. And make sure they have the phone number 
of the place where the family is staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a lot of common sense," said Chicago pediatrician Diane 
Holmes, herself the mother of three. "They might find themselves in situations 
they can't handle."

BOOKS TO GO: WHEN THE WRITE WAY IS INSIDE OUT

 DESTINATIONS PAST; TRAVELING THROUGH HISTORY WITH JOHN LUKACS by John Lukacs 
(University of Missouri Press, $26.95 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 John Lukacs, the distinguished historian, author of such books as "1945: Year 
Zero," "Budapest 1900" and "The End of the Twentieth Century and the End of the 
Modern Age," would probably be the first to tell you that he is not a travel 
writer. He doesn't assemble guidebooks, and he doesn't construct well-rounded, 
comprehensive "destination stories" in any conventional sense. If he's not a 
travel writer, though, he is certainly a writer who travels, and who apparently 
can't resist jotting down his observations when he does -- and then shaping 
them into dense, quirky, highly enjoyable little essays on places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Destinations Past" is a collection of pieces written between 1954 (a brief 
but evocative sketch of Venice and nearby Chioggia) and 1993 (a no-nonsense 
consideration of Zermatt). Most of them have been published previously -- a few 
in travel magazines, but others in such tony periodicals as "Commonweal" and 
"The New Republic." 
</P>
<P>
 As befits a historian, Lukacs includes in his writings a lot of historical 
asides, as well as a good deal of what might be called cultural analysis. He 
certainly knows how to describe the physical attributes of the places he writes 
about -- which range from Warsaw to Philadelphia, from Finland to Andorra -- 
but he seems more concerned with writing about what makes them tick. He gets at 
places not from a respectful distance, with a panoramic view, but from the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS; THE AMERICAN VISIONS GUIDE TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN HERITAGE 
SITES by Henry Chase (Henry Holt, $16.95 paper) and THE JEWISH TRAVELER; 
HADASSAH MAGAZINE'S GUIDE TO THE WORLD'S JEWISH COMMUNITIES AND SIGHTS, edited 
by Alan M. Tigay (Jason Aronson Inc., $30 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Genealogically, few of us can trace our roots back more than half-a-dozen or 
maybe a dozen generations. Our cultural roots, the source of what might be 
called our heritage or patrimony, spread far wider and reach back much further 
-- and are, or ought to be, available to all of us. These two new guidebooks 
take culture, in the broadest sense of the term, seriously, and both should 
prove invaluable traveling companions for anyone seeking to learn more about, 
respectively, the African-American and the Jewish past. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Their Footsteps" confines itself to the United States and (briefly) 
Canada, and lists relevant monuments, museums, cemeteries, churches and other 
sites. Included are notes on everything from the Motown Museum in Detroit to 
the Quantrill Raid Monument in Lawrence, Kan., to L.A.'s own California 
Afro-American Museum and Museum of African-American Art. The entries include 
complete information on location, hours and admission fees, and each 
geographical section is introduced with a well-crafted essay by a noted African 
American writer (among them Gloria Naylor, Ismael Reed and Amiri Baraka). 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jewish Traveler" is worldwide in scope, offering overviews of Jewish 
history and community in well over 100 cities and regions, from Albuquerque to 
Zurich. Included are sightseeing tips, notes on local kosher restaurants and 
recommendations for further reading. The entries are a bit sketchy -- not 
surprising, considering the number of places covered -- but they are full of 
fascinating lore. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick Trips: 
</P>
<P>
 SOJOURN IN GASCONY; PLEASURES OF THE PALETTE by Erasmus H. Kloman (Judd 
Publishing Inc., $11.95 paper). A charming little diary of a stay in 
southwestern France, by a retired corporate-executive-turned-artist. The prose 
is personal and a bit plain, but nicely captures the flavor of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 BLUE GUIDE: SPAIN, sixth edition, by Ian Robertson (W.W. Norton/A.&C. Black, 
$23 paper). Unfashionable, unglitzy, sparsely illustrated, published in type 
that ranges from small to smaller, the Blue Guides are hardly in the forefront 
of the guidebook industry these days. As this new edition of Ian Robertson's 
superbly researched volume on Spain reminds us, though, they are absolutely 
packed with fact and lore and background -- guidebooks for the thinking 
traveler.

 If Las Vegas is the place to check reality at the door, then Reno -- earthy, 
unpretentious and friendly -- is the place to find it. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else would you find a marquee announcing "Restroom Renovation Underway" 
at the performing arts center in the heart of downtown? Or spot a new Ford 
Bronco with "Uzi" vanity plates and a bumper sticker proclaiming "I Love 
Explosives!" One windy morning, while waiting for a taxi at dawn, I stood 
outside a neon-clad casino, lit up like Christmas, and watched as tumbleweed 
bounced across the railroad tracks that cut through town. Even that early, from 
a sidewalk bathed in strips of neon color, I caught the musical refrain of 
coins being tossed rapid-fire into slots: kerplunk! clunk! plink! Call me 
crazy, but there's poetry in a moment like that. 
</P>
<P>
 While glitzy Las Vegas operates at amphetamine speed, Reno is building the 
National Bowling Stadium, due to open this winter. In the past couple of years, 
Vegas has been working feverishly to reinvent itself as a family destination. 
Reno has been family-friendly all along. Cheap too. This is a town with penny 
slots, $1 blackjack tables, all-you-can-eat buffets and activities, many of 
them free for the diaper crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still very much of a Wild West flavor to Reno. Last winter, a friend 
bought an AK-47 clone here for under $300 and, after shooting one, I fully 
understand why the semi-automatic "sporting rifle" is the gun of choice. I felt 
about eight feet tall while I plastered holes all over an abandoned car on a 
gravel road a half-day's drive outside Reno. Bullet holes are part of the 
scenery in these parts. Take a drive past the city limits and I defy you to 
find a Nevada historical marker that hasn't been shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Reno, with its cowboys and coffeehouses, has its own je ne sais quoi . To 
the surprise of Renoites themselves, a recent survey commissioned by the 
National Endowment for the Arts put the "Biggest Little City" on America's 
literary map. More folks read plays, poetry or novels in Reno than in any of 11 
other cities surveyed, including Chicago, Philadelphia, San Jose, Seattle, Las 
Vegas, Winston-Salem, N.C., and Dade County, Fla. (Los Angeles was not among 
the cities polled.) Almost weekly, book signings, readings and lectures draw 
standing-room-only crowds, and the region has become a popular retreat for such 
writers as love guru Leo Buscaglia; longtime Nevada resident, writer Robert 
Laxalt, and Wallace Stegner fellow and novelist Joanne Meschery. 
</P>
<P>
 There are lots of ways to measure a town -- culture, curb-appeal, cuisine, 
among them. But perhaps the truest test is how residents feel when they put 
their town in the rearview. "I get homesick," I heard, again and again, from 
folks who live in this high-desert playground that Rand McNally has dubbed a 
premier spot for "outdoor fun" in the nation. Indeed, Reno is a fine 
jumping-off point for day-trips to such luscious places as Lake Tahoe, Virginia 
City, Lake Pyramid and the Paiute reservation and the ghost town of Bodie. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno is the kind of town you can pinch -- and know it's real. The streets are 
named after families that have lived here for generations. You can still drive 
across town in under 20 minutes, and some visitors find it unnecessary to drive 
at all: The six or so blocks that house the casino corridor also host the 
Truckee River Walk, hotels, restaurants and museums. The cab ride from the 
airport costs about $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently expanded air service has made it easier to get to Reno. More than 30 
flights from the Los Angeles area land at Reno-Cannon International Airport a 
day. Reno Air and Southwest Airlines both offer deals, including a round-trip, 
14-day advance purchase fare of $90-$95, at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer, with temperatures that average in the high 80s, is Reno's busiest 
season. Among this summer's offerings: Aug. 3-7, Hot August Nights, the city's 
most popular event, which celebrates America's love affair with cars and rock 
'n' roll, features entertainers from the '50s and '60s, a classic car auction, 
swap meets and a vintage car show; Aug. 20, Reno Basque Festival; Aug. 20-21, 
Reno Renaissance Fair; Sept. 15-18, National Championship Air Races at 
Reno/Stead Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I flew from Reno to Las Vegas in a tiny Cessna. It's hard to judge a 
place from 3,000 feet, but Reno seems to be a solid sort of place that offers 
up as much soul as slots, as much nature as neon. I know some folks who think 
of Reno as a has-been, but I think of it more as a never-was. It never was a 
Las Vegas. More importantly, it doesn't want to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the difference between Vegas and Reno," explains Larry Henry, 
associate publisher for Nevada Weekly. "People up here wear penny loafers, 
khakis and red-striped ties. In Vegas, you see glittery sweat suits, and they 
seem to have an attitude there about hairdos: the taller the hair, the closer 
to God." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, I threw back a couple of Picon punches at Louis' Basque Corner 
with the regulars huddled at the bar, and learned a new word: ossagaria -- a 
Basque toast meaning "To your health." 
</P>
<P>
 "On Fridays," one of the guys told me, "it's so crowded you can't get in here 
with a whip." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't a place that yields its charms easily; you have to look for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1868 at the crossroads of the statuesque Sierra Nevada and the high 
desert of the scrappy Peavine mountains, Reno grew up as a city of second 
chances, a destination for dreamers, miners, divorcees, gamblers, immigrants -- 
all found their way to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Not in Our Stars," a novel written in 1957, author Jill Stern's heroine 
Sara Winston muses: "In America, everybody had a chance -- and if they muffed 
it there was always the second chance. Reno would give a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, the protagonist, Sara, engages in her musings at Harold's Club, 
one of the first casinos built on Virginia Street, Reno's "Strip." The Art 
Deco-inspired Reno Arch, one of the most recognized city symbols in America, 
spans the downtown casino row and welcomes visitors to what has been nicknamed 
"The Biggest Little City in the World." Reno and neighboring Sparks house 40 
casinos, and it is "the clubs," as the locals call them, that continue to draw 
most folks to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackjack limits tend to be low across Reno: $1 tables can be found at the 
Nevada Club, $2 tables at Circus Circus and the Clarion and $3 tables at the 
Reno Hilton. For penny slots, try the Old Reno Casino and the Nevada Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 5 million people, almost half of them Californians, visited Reno last 
year. A typical visitor is a 52-year-old empty nester with an annual income of 
$42,000. Visitors generally spend an average of $400 on gaming while they are 
here, according to the Reno-Sparks Convention & Visitors Authority. People who 
gamble spend approximately $248 a day, including lodging, on their visits to 
Reno. People who don't gamble spend roughly $95 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Biggest Little City is about to become bigger: $700 million in new 
construction has been slated for Reno in 1994, its biggest building boom in 
years. Almost half of that will be funneled into the city's first themed 
resort, which has yet to be named. A creation of Circus Circus and the Eldorado 
Casino/Hotel, promoters say the resort, scheduled to open in 1995, will 
re-create "The Legend of Old Silver" and will be highlighted by water flumes, a 
water wheel, a 120-foot-high automated mining machine and platforms for musical 
and stunt performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reno renaissance -- in part triggered by competitive considerations 
spurred by the national proliferation of gaming -- includes the renovation of 
the Reno Hilton into a casino themed to focus on the western half of the United 
States; the doubling in size of the Clarion; a $25-million addition to the Reno 
Riverfront, a new retail center, and continuing improvements to Victorian 
Square, an ongoing redevelopment program in Sparks that will feature a 
six-block entertainment area. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the city's best-known restaurants and hotels are associated with 
casinos -- Harrah's, the Eldorado, Circus Circus and John Ascuaga's Nugget and 
the Hilton, among them. Off-season, I have stayed in perfectly fine rooms 
(Fitzgeralds Hotel/Casino in downtown Reno) that cost as little as $18 per 
person a night. For accommodations and visitor information, call 800-FOR-RENO. 
</P>
<P>
 For a look at the real Reno, population 141,000, wander through its 
neighborhoods. This is a university town organized by wide tree-lined streets, 
funky houses and small lakes and parks not far from the city center. 
</P>
<P>
 Several museums are worth a stop and most are in the so-called "89501 Zip 
Code," the arts district that's within walking distance of the downtown casinos 
and hotels. The area is something of a mind-bend: Quarters for the Nevada Opera 
share the same street as the Academy of Casino Careers, and the well-known Park 
Wedding Chapel is within shouting distance of offices that promise "Divorce 
Made Easy." (For information about city walking tours and complete listings of 
cultural events, call the Sierra Arts Foundation at 702-329-1324.) 
</P>
<P>
 A popular stop for tourists, the National Automobile Museum, 10 Lake St., 
demonstrates how the automobile shaped American history. Two hundred vintage 
cars are on display in cleverly designed quarters. The late casino mogul Bill 
Harrah started the collection, which includes Elvis Presley's 1973 Cadillac 
Eldorado and the 1949 Mercury that James Dean drove in "Rebel Without a Cause." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's oldest museum, the Nevada Historical Society Museum, traces the 
region's history. The Nevada Museum of Art hosts a small collection focusing on 
art of the Great Basin Region and 19th- and 20th-Century American art. Works by 
Maynard Dixon, Stuart Davis and Wayne Thiebaud are featured, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more to the landscape here than green felt stretched across a 
blackjack table. Up in the Peavine, among fall's golden aspen groves, the 
slender trunks of the quaking aspen are embedded with carvings made by Basque 
sheepherders, and in canyons outside of town, petroglyphs tell the story of 
Nevada's ancient inhabitants. The alpine beauty of Lake Tahoe is just over the 
mountain and shouldn't be missed if you haven't already witnessed what Mark 
Twain once called "the fairest picture the whole earth affords." 
</P>
<P>
 For a completely different sensory stimulant, point your car north toward 
Pyramid Lake, the haunting desert lake held sacred by the Paiutes. There are 
views here to steal a heart and nourish the soul. Located on the Paiute 
reservation, the lake -- a remnant of the inland sea that once covered 8,000 
square miles -- is the only habitat for the cui-ui, a prehistoric fish 
protected as an endangered species. It is also home to Anaho Island, a rocky 
peak that serves as one of eight white pelican nesting grounds in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 The brown, barren terrain that starts at the Paiute reservation sweeps clear 
up to the Oregon line. In January, I slept on the desolate desert floor for the 
first time and counted stars till I fell asleep. I watched a pair of deer 
saunter down a hillside and heard the soulful lament of the coyote. One 
afternoon, I turned my head toward a shadow and saw an eagle fly by with a 
rabbit in its beak. It is this large land that Wallace Stegner once called 
"Hope's native home." 
</P>
<P>
 In Reno, the day after my first visit to the azure-colored waters of Pyramid, 
I met retired schoolteacher Mayvonne Wilkens, a third-generation Nevada 
resident. "Maybe, to look at, Reno is not love at first sight, but once you're 
here a little bit, you begin to recognize the beauty of the place and the 
people. Folks are friendly here, welcoming." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 By the end of this year, Elderhostel projects that more than 300,000 Americans 
will have participated in its academic programs for travelers age 60 and up and 
their companions over age 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Sites for participation include more than 1,900 colleges, universities, 
museums, national parks, environmental education centers, conference centers 
and cultural institutions in every state, 11 Canadian provinces and 47 foreign 
countries.A wide selection of study courses includes fine arts, local culture, 
language and painting. There is a choice of family home stays in 10 countries 
in Europe, South America, Mexico, Indonesia and India. There are bicycle 
programs in England, France and the Netherlands and study cruises to 
Antarctica, Australia, France, Greece and the Galapagos Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom environments are informal. Most programs in the United States and 
Canada are one week in length; overseas programs run from one to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the States, tuition averages $315 per week, including five days of classes, 
accommodations, meals and course-related field trips or activities, but does 
not include transportation to and from the educational institution. Costs in 
Hawaii and Alaska are slightly higher because some programs run for longer 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosteling participants usually stay on college campuses in rooms with two twin 
beds and bathrooms down the hall. Maid service is not included in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 International program costs usually include round-trip flights to gateway 
cities, room and board with some meals, field trips, extra-curricular 
activities and gratuities. 
</P>
<P>

HIKING: LAKE TAHOE; FAMILY WALKS THROUGH PINES AND MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lake Tahoe's alpine grandeur is easy on the eye, although public access to the 
lake shore is in short supply, hindering development of the kind of intimacy 
that hikers develop with other California scenic gems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Forest Service Visitor Center offers an information desk, 
interpretive displays, naturalist-led walks and six family-friendly Tahoe 
trails. The paths offer a great introduction to the history and ecology of what 
Native Americans called "the Lake of the Sky." 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor center is located three miles north of South Lake Tahoe, off 
California 89. 
</P>
<P>
 From the visitor center, trails radiate outward like spokes from a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow Trail (half a mile round trip) leads from pine forest to a 
wildflower-strewn meadow to the Stream Profile Chamber, an underground viewing 
chamber that offers a fish eye's view of Taylor Creek. Through the chamber's 
windows you can see trout feed and watch other aquatic life. During early 
autumn, you can see the kokanee salmon run. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Tree Trail (a quarter-mile loop) explores a Jeffrey pine forest. Kids 
enjoy the vanilla scent of these dominant Tahoe pines. 
</P>
<P>
 Markers along the Trail of the Washoe (three-quarter-mile loop) tell the story 
of the Native Americans who called Da ow a ga (Lake Tahoe) home for thousands 
of years. (The trail is closed for repairs through the 1994 summer.) 
</P>
<P>
 Smokey's Trail (an eighth-mile loop) shows kids how to safely build a 
campfire. Children who walk the trail (and remember what they learned) receive 
a small award from visitor center staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake of the Sky Trail (half a mile one way) travels north across a wide meadow 
to the lake shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallac Historic Site Trail (one mile one way) leads a quarter mile to Kiva 
Picnic Area, where you'll find picnic tables under the pines, a long sandy 
beach and good swimming. The path continues to the historic site where the 
Baldwin Estate is, now a museum that houses Tahoe and Washoe exhibits. 
California mega-entrepreneur Lucky Baldwin built a turn-of-the-century luxury 
resort here, complete with grand hotel, casino and ballroom. Some foundations 
and a few smaller buildings of the old resort remain, along with the museum 
exhibits, to tell the story of this lake-shore opulence. During summer months, 
history walks and art exhibits take place at the historic site. 
</P>
<P>
 An ideal two-mile loop for families is to follow Lake of the Sky Trail to the 
lake, walk along the lake shore to Tallac Historic Site, then travel southwest 
through the pine forest back to the visitor center. Tahoe Nature Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: South shore of Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 1/8 to 2 miles each round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Lake shore, meadows, Ponderosa pine forest. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Tahoe's history and ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy.

 Shawn Hubler's "Home Away From Home" (June 5) on too-precious-for-words 
Mendocino was your most valuable offering in months. Parents need to be warned 
about these places, just as they need to know about health, weather and war 
zones.Our children have been welcome at restaurants and B&B's in Canada and 
Europe; Mendocino's preponderance of kid-hostile B&B's reflect a deplorable 
attitude more common in some U.S. establishments.

 As one of the innkeepers in Mendocino I realize the importance of catering to 
families. We have tailored a number of our rooms to accommodate families and 
welcome children of any age in our dining rooms. There is so much history in 
our town, and so much beauty, that we would hate for any child not to visit.

 I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoyed reading of Shawn Hubler's trip to 
Mendocino. In fact, I've read it over twice and laughed many times. Many thanks 
for sharing such a delightful vacation with us. I'm going to read it again!

 The column by B. Beyer and E. Rabey titled "There's Always a First Time" (June 
12) is replete with whimsical parodies and trivia, but somewhat short on 
meaningful advice for the first-time traveler to Europe. Despite their claims 
of "living in Europe for five years and returning several times" they show a 
remarkable dissatisfaction for the conveniences in modern European hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 (They complain about) inadequate bedside illumination, saying that 5- or 10- 
watt bulbs are used. I have stayed in about 100 European hotels in the past 10 
years without finding reason to examine the bulbs -- and I am an habitual 
bedtime reader. Secondly, they claim that the cold and hot water flows in 
showers are totally unregulated. This is absolutely untrue in hotel chains such 
as the Best Western and equivalent. Generally one can expect the same standard 
of quality as in comparable hotels in the U.S. The only significant difference: 
One should expect the price to be about 100% more in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it cannot be over-emphasized that detailed planning is the best way 
to avoid disappointments and "culture shocks." Planning requires time and 
thought, but for me the anticipation has always been a part of the enjoyment.

RECLAIMING AFRICA; CONTINENT'S PROBLEMS NEED AFRICAN SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Basil Davidson, Basil Davidson's most recent book on African history is The 
Search for Africa (Times Books). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The really jolting thing about the latest French adventure in Africa is not 
that it has Rwanda as its scene. Even if something has needed to be done about 
Rwanda, the French have never had any responsibility for the affairs of 
tropical East Africa. Nor is it surprising that the United Nations should have 
given France the go-ahead, for the United Nations, as matters stand today, is 
not exactly strong on statesmanship. What is jolting goes much deeper in its 
implications. It is that Africa, as a continental presence in the world, is now 
automatically disregarded and written off. Nobody in the Western seats of 
power, as we see, any longer thinks that Africa's opinion is worth a row of 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, a different point of view was heard, last month, just when 
France had got itself poised to "save Rwanda." A long way from Rwanda but still 
very much inside Africa, 42 African heads of state -- a record attendance -- 
assembled in the sunlit city of Tunis. They were there to celebrate the 30th 
"summit" of Africa's otherwise forgotten continental forum, the Organization of 
African Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 This, in itself, was nothing of interest. For years, the annual "summits" of 
the OAU have come and gone on floods of useless demagogy, junketings that 
barely deserved the briefest mention. The world thought this, and the world was 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time the world was wrong. First, because behind the verbiage of the 
OAU there is now a conviction, growing strong, that Africa's problems need 
Africa's solutions. Externally devised solutions have not worked. Africa's 
poverty and political decay are worse than ever, no matter what claims to the 
contrary are made by great world institutions supposed to handle these 
disasters. And, secondly, there is now in Africa a similarly strong conviction 
that Africa's solutions have to be devised and applied by Africans. Otherwise, 
the material interests of the outside world will continue to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 All this was confirmed in Tunis with a new edge of urgency. There was heard a 
fresh language of flinty realism. And the symbol for this, a splendidly living 
symbol, was the presence at this "summit" of a new head of state, the South 
African President Nelson Mandela, proof in person that Africa's problems can be 
tackled only by Africans applying their own solutions. What peace in South 
Africa was ever even thinkable through all the 27 years that Mandela sat in 
prison, and non-African interests held the stage? 
</P>
<P>
 All through those years, moreover, mockery of the OAU became a knee-jerk media 
reaction. Yet, the economic and technical cooperative projects of the OAU 
achieved a record not so easily despised, whether in the vital fields of 
inter-African communications or in those of banking facilities. Nor were these 
decades disfigured, as in some other continents, by frantic inter-state 
warfare. The peace was not brilliant, but the peace was usually kept. 
</P>
<P>
 A success, therefore, the OAU? No continental organization having to cope with 
the various miseries of the colonial legacy could be that. Yet, the Africans in 
Tunis could still be sure, against whatever "external atmosphere" of 
indifference or scorn, that their OAU remains a necessary and indispensable 
means by which those most concerned -- those, above all, concerned -- can 
lessen these miseries. 
</P>
<P>
 If this still sounds utopian, think back a little. When the OAU was launched, 
in 1963, the proposition that Africa's problems required Africa's solutions, 
and not the outside world's solutions even while the outside world can greatly 
help, was common ground for everyone who took Africa's prospects seriously. Who 
better than Africans could know their own strengths and frailties, who more 
likely to reinforce the first and lessen the second? 
</P>
<P>
 And it stands on the record, through those early years, that this all-African 
forum was repeatedly effective: in settling border disputes between newly 
independent states, in fostering a vivid consciousness of the need for joint 
policies and common action, even in forging useful plans for economic 
expansion. Yet, the legacies of the colonial past, of long years of total 
dispossession by foreign powers, stood powerfully in the way of these bids for 
progress. Increasingly undermined by those legacies after about 1975, the 
politics of Africa have been dragged into catastrophes of brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 With bandits and careerists climbing to power, the OAU and its "summits" 
collapsed into a theater of empty talk, a scenario of the absurd. Patriotic 
Africans had to watch their communities paraded in the flippant images of 
commentating chatterers whose real ignorance of African realities was exceeded 
only by their odious condescension. Spectating from afar, there were even those 
commentators, among the louder-mouthed, who called for a "new colonialism," 
just as if the old colonialism had solved problems instead of creating them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, little noticed outside the continent, a measure of 
the old sense of unity and courage stood its ground. Even in the grim decade of 
the 1980s, however much assailed by home-grown crooks and gunmen, this old 
sense of pride could still exercise a decisive influence for sanity. East 
African neighbors of Rwanda saw this influence at work, in their own 
communities, even while Rwanda and Burundi headed for their entirely 
foreseeable breakdown and disaster. Uganda, next door, produced a new 
leadership with a strong ability for peace and development. Sanity in Eritrea 
won a most humane and hopeful victory over decades of violence and subjection. 
Sanity in Ethiopia, again next door, has had much the same underlying effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Other examples show Africa's problems being staunchly tackled by Africans 
applying African solutions. Liberia's collapse into mayhem during the 1980s has 
engendered one of these examples. If Liberia today has a useful future, it will 
be thanks to the policies and action of West Africa's 16-state Economic 
Community, known as ECOWAS, and its multistate force of intervention called 
ECOMOG. The plans and intentions of and for technical and organizational 
cooperation among the various states of Southern Africa, now including South 
Africa freed from racist government, suggest another opening field of 
developmental initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't myself see such facts, and others like them that I could list, as 
offering any particular ground for optimism. Things in Africa are bad. They can 
easily get worse. All the same, it is just as true that these are facts that 
speak for a power of recovery, for a means of self-restitution. And they point, 
against whatever pessimism, to an unexpected conclusion, which is also a very 
welcome conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 There are serious Africans around, and they are right to be taken seriously. 
They have shown that they are able to reach their own consensus on what to do 
and how to do it. This consensus speaks for capacity and conviction. While "new 
Rwandas" threaten, and new external interventions step forward to carry the 
white man's burden, we shall do well to listen to it. For a change.*

WHAT WE WON'T LEARN FROM OUR RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 None of California's candidates have addressed the most important questions of 
the election: What caused the state's recession? What must government do in 
response? 
</P>
<P>
 To an extent unmatched in the rest of the country, California's recession was, 
first and foremost, caused by its increasingly dysfunctional relationship with 
Washington. Fully 50% of its 600,000 job losses resulted from cutbacks in 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, at a time when Californians could least afford it, the Clinton 
Administration's 1993 budget "reforms" weighed even more heavily against the 
state. "Deficit reductions" were achieved with huge defense cuts scheduled to 
take effect in 1997 -- conveniently after the next presidential election. 
Meanwhile, income and payroll taxes to support Social Security, Medicare and 
Medicaid programs were dramatically increased. Since California is much 
younger, has a higher cost of living and thus generates higher wages than the 
national norm, the new taxes shifted an additional $10 billion to $20 billion a 
year from the state to the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Also damaging was a federal trade policy that severely weakened the dollar, 
reducing the value of California's relatively price-insensitive exports while 
driving up the cost of its imports. Finally, a magnificently ill-timed burst of 
renewed activism by the Environmental Protection Agency took a toll. Recent Bay 
Delta water-policy interventions sent shock waves through such California 
economic mainstays as agriculture, biomedical engineering and textiles -- 
threatening to weaken the state's bond ratings, which are anchored by the giant 
Metropolitan Water District agency. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, home-grown factors amplified California's problems, the most 
important of which was the collapse of its manufacturing sector. A generator of 
2.1 million jobs in its peak year of 1990, manufacturing played a critical role 
in the upward mobility of the state's growing Latino and Asian populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble began in the 1980s, however, when state and local officials enacted a 
series of often counterproductive, fraud-prone environmental, social-justice 
and safety legislation that hit manufacturing particularly hard. Even before 
the recession, manufacturing job growth stagnated during the decade, after 
rising by nearly 470,000 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom fell out when the worldwide recession cut into already razor-thin 
manufacturing margins. Since 1990, California's manufacturing industries have 
lost a staggering 150,000 jobs on top of defense cutbacks. Total manufacturing 
employment fell by 15%, to levels not seen since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 California's political leadership, meanwhile, was so enamored of the fantasy 
of government-subsidized industrial development that it ignored sectors such as 
finance, insurance, real estate and business services that collectively added 
55,000 jobs during the recession. Entertainment, electronics, textile and 
biomedical companies, whose growth might have offset the state's manufacturing 
and defense declines, also suffered from inattention. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a self-destructive publicity campaign, led by defense giants, that 
was eagerly embellished by development officials and media from outside the 
region. As a result, exaggerated accounts of California's decline became 
conventional wisdom throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a region's image crucially affects its international money, trade and 
technology flows, investors shunned California. Typical were the Japanese, who 
shifted thousands of jobs to Mexico, reduced tourism and slashed their 
real-estate investment from $3 billion in 1989 to virtually nothing in 1993. 
Housing and commercial markets dependent on positive expectations nose-dived, 
costing 115,000 construction jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 This profile of California's recession suggests a clear political agenda for 
the state's future prosperity. Most critical is to stop looking to Washington 
for bailouts that almost certainly will never materialize. Instead, 
Californians should press for tax parity, insisting, in the least, that 
increasingly anti-California federal payroll and income levies should be 
indexed to reflect the higher cost of living in the state. And rather than 
further muddy the complex, delicate issues of water policy or urban 
development, the federal government should return to Californians the money and 
authority required for the state to solve its social and environmental problems 
on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 To staunch the decline of the manufacturing base, the state must sharpen its 
regulatory focus and enforce only those measures that unequivocally achieve 
major environmental and social benefits without generating greater offsetting 
costs. Companies that paint, plate or otherwise treat metals, for example, are 
subject to overwhelmingly complicated oversight requirements even though they 
contribute minimally to the state's overall environmental or safety problems. 
Such disproportionate regulatory obsessions cost the state thousands of 
manufacturing jobs and reduce the resources that might otherwise be spent on 
more pressing needs, such as developing non-polluting auto fuels and propulsion 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the state must end its self-loathing and immigrant scapegoating. 
During the last two decades, California has generated greater upward mobility 
for a more diverse population, and fostered more industries competitive in 
virtually every major sector of the global economy, than any other region. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, Gov. Pete Wilson would rather blame Washington's immigration 
policies for his budget woes and, with the approval of Democrats, construct 
economic policies around the mirage of a federal panacea. After misleadingly 
flogging the state's economy as "America's worst," Kathleen Brown offers a 
hodgepodge of new taxes, modest welfare cutbacks and subsidized funds for 
quasi-public industries, all to be paid for with the same kind of bond 
issuances Californians rejected last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the state's voters do want to continue their dysfunctional relations 
with Washington; heap social mandates on their businesses while supporting only 
sectors that draw sustenance from government; wallow in unwarranted despair, 
and push their burgeoning ethnic populations into the dead-end politics of 
poverty. But at least they should have a different choice. Rather than the thin 
economic gruel offered in the current campaign, they deserve a debate about the 
recession that will generate real solutions, not empty style points, for the 
problems that exist in California's still remarkable economy.*

RECLAIMING AFRICA; S. AFRICANS AGREE ON GOAL NOW, HOW TO ATTAIN IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion, 
is author of Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition (Houghton 
Mifflin). He just returned from a monthlong stay in southern Africa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Out of Africa," said the ancient Romans, "there is always something new." 
Recently, the news from Africa has been almost all bad. Famines in Ethiopia, 
genocide in Rwanda; chaos in Somalia and AIDS spread ing everywhere. At times, 
it seems that all of Africa south of the Sahara is headed toward a catastrophe 
of unimaginable proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exception to the dismal trend has been South Africa, where the 
transition to non-racial democracy in the richest sub-Saharan country has given 
new hope for the whole region. Though last week's resignation of South Africa's 
respected finance minister, Derek Keys, shows the new government will not 
escape severe tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative, pragmatic Keys was a major figure in South African politics. 
As a member of the formerly pro-apartheid Nationalist Party, he served as 
finance minister in South Africa's last whites-only government as well as in 
its first multiracial one. In the tough, behind-the-scenes negotiations over 
the budget, he is credited with putting together a tight budget that 
nonetheless increased social spending for South Africa's poor. His continuity 
in office reassured local and foreign investors that President Nelson Mandela's 
government would pursue sensible, pro-business policies -- that although South 
Africa was under new management, it was still open for business. 
</P>
<P>
 His sudden resignation -- for unexplained "personal" reasons -- left Mandela 
with a problem. The president quickly appointed leading banker Christo 
Liebenberg to Keys' post. But even naming the former CEO of South Africa's 
fourth-largest financial-services company couldn't quite calm investor jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, this shouldn't overshadow the main story in South Africa: After decades 
and, in some cases, centuries of conflict, the many ethnic and racial groups in 
the country have reached the conclusion that their common interests are more 
important than grievances and ancient hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years ago, South Africa was at war with itself. Whites, in general, 
hated and feared blacks, and vice versa. But each camp was divided within 
itself as well. Afrikaans-speaking whites and English-speaking whites didn't 
trust one another. Indians and people of mixed racial backgrounds were not 
fully accepted by either whites or blacks. Among blacks, tribal rivalries and 
political infighting divided the liberation movement and created opportunities 
for the government to pursue a policy of divide and rule. As recently as last 
spring, many South Africans feared their country was headed down the road of 
Bosnia and Rwanda.  
</P>
<P>
 But then came the miracle of a peaceful election and the transition to 
majority rule. South Africa is still no paradise, and its divisions remain, but 
out of the chaos and confusion a consensus for democracy and peace has somehow 
emerged.  
</P>
<P>
 The consensus starts with patriotism. White South Africans used to be ashamed 
of their country's isolation; the flag and the national anthem were symbols of 
oppression for blacks. Now all that has changed. White South Africans are 
delighted to find they are no longer international pariahs; and blacks, many 
for the first time, are learning what it means to be free citizens in a free 
country. In squatter camps around the cities, black South Africans talk about 
their new-found pride in a flag and the new national anthem -- a song banned 
under white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The second point of consensus is Mandela. Die-hard segregationists praise his 
political maturity; poor blacks believe him when he says he will do everything 
possible to help them. Along with this trust comes another asset: patience. 
Nobody expects change overnight; and, at least for now, virtually everybody 
trusts Mandela to make the right choices.  
</P>
<P>
 The third consensus point is that something must be done to alleviate the 
suffering of South Africa's poor. Conservative business leaders agree with 
radical activists: South Africa faces a social explosion unless conditions in 
the squatter camps and in the rural poverty zones improve. While nobody likes 
taxes, wealthy South Africans seem to accept the necessity of reasonable 
sacrifices to make the future more secure.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a broad consensus exists that the new South Africa must 
avoid the economic and political errors so many black African countries have 
made. South Africans of all races and political stripes agree, by and large, 
that the state socialist policies of many African governments would lead to 
disaster in South Africa. The other error of so many African nations -- 
substituting a one-party system for democracy -- is also condemned by South 
African society. Recent attempts by, among others, Winnie Mandela to control 
the free press have met with wide condemnation in the African National 
Congress, as well as outside it. 
</P>
<P>
 The final point of South Africa's political consensus concerns South Africa's 
relationship to the rest of the continent. Once again, black and white South 
Africans agree: South Africa can and ultimately must turn its attention to the 
problems of its neighbors -- but not yet. South Africa must solve its own 
problems first; only then will it have the resources to help its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In refusing to send combat troops to Rwanda, and in defusing the expectations 
of neighboring African states for foreign aid, Mandela was expressing the views 
of the overwhelming majority. South African business sees vast opportunities 
for trade and investment in such neighboring countries as Mozambique and 
Zambia, and South Africa's political leaders are grateful for the help they 
received from the "front-line" anti-apartheid states in the long war of 
liberation, but South Africa's people do not want to be dragged into military, 
economic or political adventures until their own situation is more secure. 
</P>
<P>
 For it is not all rosy. The political consensus in South Africa has limits. 
Blacks and whites, farmers and city dwellers, rich and poor remain divided 
about how best to achieve the goals they all agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa also faces daunting economic problems. About 40% of the work 
force is officially unemployed. Living standards for both whites and blacks 
have either stagnated or declined during the last decade. Worse still, the 
scourge of AIDS is making rapid inroads into the population. Up to 1 million 
South Africans are believed to be HIV positive today and, despite education and 
prevention campaigns, the disease is spreading.  
</P>
<P>
 But even with these caveats, the situation is clear: South Africa is the last 
best hope of the African continent for peace and prosperity. If the United 
States is to have any African policy at all, it must begin here: with the 
continent's most promising economy and society.  
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean the United States should shower South Africa with loans and 
foreign aid. South Africa needs two kinds of help from the United States. One 
involves support for South Africa's point of view in such international trade 
forums as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Long excluded from world 
markets, South African industry developed in isolation. The transition to the 
global marketplace will be difficult. South Africa will need friends who 
understand its special problems as it struggles to bring its economy into the 
global mainstream.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond this, the United States can help South Africa by working toward a 
free-trade agreement. Agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement 
do more than open markets; they encourage investment among the partners. South 
Africa needs U.S. investment and markets. A U.S.-South Africa free-trade 
agreement would do more to secure South African democracy than any amount of 
foreign aid. The tension over Keys resignation underlines the need for formal 
economic agreements that will bolster confidence in the Mandela government.  
</P>
<P>
 There can also be a security dimension to the new U.S.-South African 
arrangement. Inviting South Africa to participate in joint maneuvers and joint 
training and planning programs would deepen the ties between the United States 
and South Africa, extend the capacity of the Western world to act beyond the 
limits of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization area and help consolidate 
South African democracy. Just as participation in NATO helped Spain's armed 
forces to accept the end of the Franco dictatorship, so an involvement with the 
U.S. military will help South Africa's armed forces adapt to the new conditions 
in their country.  
</P>
<P>
 The miracle of South African democracy offers the Clinton Administration a 
much needed opportunity for a foreign-policy success. Opportunities this good 
don't come knocking often; let's hope the Administration makes the best of it.*

THE NATION; NEW MEDIA MERGER (YAWN), BUT DOES ANYTHING CHANGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Todd Gitlin, Todd Gitlin, a professor at sociology at UC Berkeley, is the

Albert Einstein (Bantam).

 Not a month goes by without a big corporate move in the powerhouses of media 
-- whereupon the news media dutifully ogle the moguls and declare that great 
changes are afoot. Last week, the splashy story was the CBS-QVC merger. A few 
weeks ago, the big story was the Fox network, through an intermediary, luring 
12 affiliate TV stations away from the majors. A while back, it was the heavy 
bidding for Paramount; before that, the so-called Japanese invasion of 
Hollywood. Next week, the headlines will belong to a new studio chief, or a 
cable-network merger, or perhaps a phone company buying a sports league -- or 
the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, journalists' word processors shift automatically to pre-programmed 
phrases: "telecommunications revolution," "corporate vision," "synergy," "the 
best programmer in the business." In hushed tones, journalists at prestigious 
magazines go behind the scenes for painstaking play-by-play chronicles. (Now it 
can be told: Why Barry Diller was spotted at Black Rock all the while he was 
hotly pursuing Paramount.) 
</P>
<P>
 With each news cycle, watchers and listeners are led to believe that matters 
of great consequence are in progress -- big enough for front pages and lots of 
knowing forecasts from financial analysts, the soothsayers of our time -- whose 
prognostications nobody goes back to check a year down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The moguls are our royals. Media cover media moves as if they were something 
between dynastic wars and succession squabbles. Behold, the Windsors and the 
Hapsburgs arrange an intermarriage! America's inside dopesters apparently never 
weary of rumors that the latest shuffle suggests big changes. Thus, did 
Spaniards pay close attention to insider gossip during the Franco years. Thus, 
did the Central Intelligence Agency and the Russian public worry the question 
of who stood next to the boss at the May Day Parade during the communist years. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, the typical corporate merger is more fun than most action movies. 
The CBS-QVC story does provide welcome relief from the O.J. Simpson saga. The 
mood is more upbeat than in the backstage reports on the vicissitudes of health 
care, or Bosnia. But in the case of CBS-QVC, beneath the jokes about tie-in 
deals linking news shows and fashion sales, there's far less going on than 
meet's the eye. The game is an insider's game. The players are recycled from 
the same dynasties. QVC's Diller comes to CBS via a career at ABC, Paramount 
and Fox. At ABC in the '70s, his main contribution to culture was a rush of 
movies of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The big story is what doesn't change. Under no management is corporate 
television a place where heroic CEO's, like the Medici of yore, hire the best 
artists and give them a wall to work on. Consider two of the most distinguished 
television practitioners in the English language, both of whom recently died. 
Neither America's Marlon T. Riggs nor Britain's Dennis Potter would have been 
of the slightest interest to any of the proprietors of America's cultural

 Riggs, who died April 5, aged 37, of AIDS, gained most of his renown courtesy 
of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) & Co., who took censorious issue with his 
rhapsodic public television hour, "Tongues Untied." Many a local station 
refused to air this lyric of Riggs' gay African American life. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms, of course, missed the point about the show. That it treated a gay 
African American as something other than a freak or a menace was not the most 
notable thing about it. "Tongues Untied" was a wild and desperate, personal and 
poetic essay on film. It devised a film form. With a serious network backing 
him, Riggs might have attempted all manner of unorthodox projects, none of 
which would have been mistaken for anyone else's. He never got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Potter, who died June 7, aged 59, of pancreatic cancer, did make a most 
impressive career writing television plays -- in Britain. Potter was best known 
for "Pennies from Heaven" and "The Singing Detective." The latter, for my 
money, is the most brilliant work ever written for television: part detective 
story, part musical, part psychoanalysis, part rumination on writing and 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 But Potter didn't start off writing these stellar multihour, multiform plays. 
He evolved into them. He was able to work up his craft to the point where he 
could take chances with genre-splicing because the BBC took him on when he was 
just out of Oxford and kept him on, writing plays of greater and lesser 
distinction, for more than 30 years. Potter set out to make a career in 
television, rather than movies or books, because he believed in the popular 
audience. Lucky him (and us): He found a patron that allowed him to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 No one gets to make such a career in U.S. public broadcasting. Almost no one 
in America gets to make a writerly career on commercial TV, either. Rare is the 
writer who succeeds in being patronized for long in any sense. In the land of 
the free, you're up or you're out, period. 
</P>
<P>
 The exceptions -- such as Steven Bochco, most recently auteur of "N.Y.P.D. 
Blue" -- pay their dues writing genre pieces for years until, if they get 
lucky, they get a chance to come up with "Hill Street Blues." Then, if a 
hundred miracles take place -- if the studio is in favor and the executives of 
the moment happen to be receptive and the time slot isn't terrible and the 
network doesn't have anything more remunerative at the moment -- the 
writer-producer gets to slip through the cracks. One commercial success may 
lead through a crack to the next door. Hardly ever does it lead to a career. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem isn't just that all the tycoons want to do is make money -- it's 
that their ideas of how to make money are impoverished. For all their fabled 
genius and commitment to profit, most of what they put on fails on commercial 
grounds. Last year's highly touted genius tycoon is likely to end up the next 
decade's bust. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the fun lasts, today's much-ogled moguls get to make their marks by 
designing new mastheads and stewards' costumes for the Titanic. Diller, 
Laurence A. Tisch of CBS, Rupert Murdoch of Fox -- the line on all of them is 
the bottom line. The most important thing is what they share: a commitment to 
the lowest common denominator, the least objectionable programming, the 
fanciest trash.  
</P>
<P>
 On how the new CBS will differ from the old, David Letterman said it the other 
night: "No matter what, we'll still be working for TV weasels."*

THE NATION; REIGNITING THE WONDER OF APOLLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregory Benford, Gregory Benford is professor of physics at UC Irvine and 
author, among other novels, of Timescape (Bantam). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman Mailer once remarked that "The horror of the 20th Century was the size 
of each new event and the paucity of its reverberation." Apollo sometimes seems 
that way, considering its mythic proportions. I've talked with Edwin E. (Buzz) 
Aldrin Jr. several times this spring, and he, too, seems to feel the odd 
vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 I think Apollo will likely prove to be the enduring image of the century, 
greater even than the mushroom cloud, more lasting because of its immense 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 It had a hugeness even the bomb could not equal. At takeoff, 25 years ago July 
16, the biggest engine in history burned as much oxygen as half a billion 
people, squandering 15 tons of fuel a second, riding an 800-foot spike of 
flame. The roar seemed to turn your entire body into one resonating ear. It was 
a proper instrument for writing our signature on the heavens, big enough to be 
read by God. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked at the mythic level, in unforeseen directions. The ecology movement 
got a huge push from that picture of island Earth -- love for the planet 
ironically boosted by the flight from her. 
</P>
<P>
 Apollo was one of the great public projects, ranking with the Cheops pyramid 
and Chartres cathedral as the focus of a social machine made of intricately 
specialized human parts. Apollo was built of Newtonian know-how, the pinnacle 
of half a millennium. Its price was even moderate; we bet more on horses in a 
year than we spent on all Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the stately adventure also had an air of play. Alan B. Shepard Jr. teed 
off with a credible golf swing; Eugene A. Cernan sang happily, gathering rocks; 
John W. Young and Charles M. Duke Jr. bounced across ancient dust in a moon 
buggy; everybody leaped and yelped and cavorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery, joyful transcendence . . . and then it died. 
</P>
<P>
 Boredom kills more dreams than outright opposition. People couldn't fathom why 
we were doing it (yawn) again. Part of it, surely, was that the moon had the 
ring of death to it -- seas of Serenity and Tranquillity that slept like 
cemetaries half as old as time. No aliens, no air, no ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another way to understand Apollo and see what might come next. 
</P>
<P>
 Once we had a distant, hostile goal, and men threw themselves at it, too: 
Antarctica. Early this century, Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen, with 
whole nations cheering them on, raced for the South Pole. The Edwardian 
Englishman tried to impose his own methods and died. The savvy Norwegian 
adapted to the hostile continent and came through smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Others tried to follow. Ernest H. Shackleton made some progress, and national 
rivalry became far more serious: World War I swallowed up the exploratory 
energies. Adm. Richard E. Byrd and others made headway between the wars, but 
true, methodical Antarctic exploration did not resume in earnest until the 
International Geophysical Year, 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Wars gave the International Geophysical Year teams cheap, reliable air- and 
sea-transport technology. International though the spirit was, national 
territorial claims did not vanish; Argentina and Chile continue to mutter over 
their rights to turf. Still, perhaps the major reason nobody disturbs the 
present high-minded international air is that no serious resources seem at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott-Amundsen: Apollo. Shackleton and Byrd: Voyager and Galileo. The World 
Wars, in this analogy, are like our rising concern with domestic problems -- 
not soaring nationalism, luckily, but at least a deflection of those energies 
to local concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce C. Murray of Caltech/Jet Propulsion Laboratory has pointed out these 
analogies. He remarked that a science-fictional alternate-world scenario can 
illuminate our predicament. Think what our world would be like, he said, if the 
two-term limit on the presidency had not been enacted in the late 1940s. The 
first President it applied to was Dwight D. Eisenhower, still popular in 1960. 
Quite possibly, he could have beaten John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenhower would have presided over the early Space Age, 1957-64. He called 
space programs "pie in the sky," refused to fund research at a fast clip and 
warned us against the "military-industrial complex." In a parallel world with 
Eisenhower in office until 1964, we would have had no brave setting of the 
Apollo goal, no race to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray thinks that, by 1990, we would probably have seen some U.S.-Soviet 
muscle-flexing in near-Earth orbit and probably a few unmanned probes would 
have studied the moon. No "grand tour" trajectory for Voyager, probably no 
Mariner to Mars or any of the rest of it. George Bush's 1989 speech might have 
been a stalwart call for a manned moon landing before the turn of the 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not impossible. One can scarcely argue that such a plausible, 
sensible space program was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 The plausibility of this imaginary history tells us that we have been lucky. 
We lived through dramatic times, Sputnik-Apollo-Voyager, which quite probably 
will be seen as Columbus-Magellan-Drake. Maybe we are now getting back to 
normal. Normal, alas, means dull. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick in using analogies and scenarios is knowing when to stop. How does 
our predicament differ from the past? We must play to those differences if we 
are to steer a better course. 
</P>
<P>
 Large space projects have fed off nationalism. Kennedy sold fears of Soviet 
technology, with an attractive patina of worry over our science education. This 
worked well. Our schoolteachers-in-shuttles agenda, sold the public for so 
long, came out of the Eisenhower perspective -- a go-slow Space Age, elbows 
tucked in, chin down, making no mistakes. How can we counter that? 
</P>
<P>
 First, appeal to the frontier. Young people, not just Americans, want to 
believe in an expansive sense of the future. More than consumerism and the 
Beavis & Butthead worldview. Our time needs heroes -- desperately. Notice how 
the media seize on the merest sign of character, such as Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno's accepting some blame for the errors of her underlings. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders are tuned to sense this better than scientists. That's why 
the emphasis on manned space, which scientists like James Van Allen deplore 
because, after all, it is pricey and returns little for research folk to study. 
Man-in-space is a political event. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the general risk of rocketry plays to this. Danger equals drama. It 
would be a breath of fresh air if the President would simply tell the public 
that every launch is much more like a test-pilot run, with casualties expected. 
No schoolteachers riding a bus into orbit. Instead, gutsy men and women on a 
wing and a prayer. As in "The Right Stuff," "No Buck Rogers, no bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 We'll probably have a shuttle blow-up before this decade is out, a fiery 
finish with grieving widows, and we might as well be prepared. Indeed, the 
deeper lesson we should drive home is that space will never be safe. Adventures 
aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, we should have a clear set of cost-conscious reasons for every 
project. Here the Antarctica analogy helps. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still solid national reasons for space. Nobody thought there were 
good scientific uses to Antarctica when Scott and Amundsen raced across it. We 
didn't see that chilly clime as a lab peculiarly sensitive to the whole 
planetary system. 
</P>
<P>
 All these are policy decisions, but they must be made in light of what 
humanity, as a whole, wants to see in space. Drama. People. Mystery. Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps manned presence should be seen now as intrinsically international, 
because we desperately need lofty aims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magnificent desolation," Aldrin termed the moonscape. The first word is more 
important than the second.*

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; RESTAURATEUR OR ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE? TO THE CITY, IT'S 
THE SAME THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean K. MacPherson, Sean K. MacPherson is co-owner of Olive, Swingers, Jones 
and Small's K.O. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I own three restaurants and one bar in Los Angeles. I employ more than 200 
people and generate hundreds of thousands of tax dollars annually. The backbone 
of my operations is catering to the neighborhood. The morning of the 
earthquake, I had no electricity but I opened my doors for business. I wanted 
my patrons and friends to have a place to convene and discuss their 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants create a sense of community. I have watched marriages being born, 
business deals struck, ideas exchanged and good friends made, all under the 
roofs of my establishments. People do not go out to eat simply for food and 
drink. They go for the comfort, warmth and energy of other people. 
</P>
<P>
 I had always felt fortunate to have grown up in Los Angeles. I knew of no 
other city that so willingly embraced the new. I wanted to open a new bar for 
my generation, but based on the tradition of Hollywood's great watering holes. 
</P>
<P>
 I found the ideal location for my first restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard, at 
the corner of Fairfax Avenue. Built in the 1930s, Lane's was one of the city's 
oldest bars. Its auspicious neighbors included such vintage landmarks as 
Johnny's Diner and the May Co. The building had a beautiful deco facade -- with 
large, black glass tiles and a classic (albeit broken) neon sign, announcing 
"Lane's Cocktails." Opening the door was like opening a Hollywood history book. 
It was all there -- the original brown Naugahyde booths, dark wood-paneled 
walls and mahogany bar. It was a gem in need of polishing. My plan was to 
restore it to its original grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 After leasing the property, I learned that, although Lane's had been in 
existence for more than 50 years, I could not reopen it without obtaining a 
Conditional Use Permit (C.U.P.) from the city. Applying for the C.U.P. turned 
out to be a complicated and difficult process. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw the restoration and reopening of Lane's as a small step toward the 
recoronation of the Miracle Mile. The city saw it as a detriment to the 
neighborhood -- and disallowed my C.U.P. With a heavy heart, I watched the 
building sit idle for more than a year. Then I watched as the facade was torn 
down, the interior gutted. Lane's became a discount futon store. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I was discouraged, I was determined to open a place of my own. I 
believed I could open a place that would be an asset to the community. Building 
four establishments over the last five years, I have now learned how to 
navigate the permit process. And I have witnessed the key role restaurants and 
bars play in the social cohesion of a neighborhood. But, sadly, I have also 
discovered that, in Los Angeles, the authorities treat restaurateurs as guilty 
until proven innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 I've now owned and operated Olive Restaurant on Fairfax Avenue for the last 
four years. But after I encountered problems with my lease, I recently set out 
to move to a new location. Within walking distance, I found two possible sites 
-- the former Golden Temple Restaurant on Third Street and the Spanish Kitchen 
on Beverly Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Temple is on a desolate strip of Third Street, where virtually 
every other storefront is vacant. The only activity at the space over the last 
three years has been the periodic appearance of graffiti. The Spanish Kitchen 
is a legendary restaurant that suddenly, and mysteriously, closed its doors 60 
years ago. The only life at the Spanish Kitchen has been the changing of music 
and movie posters. These are both derelict buildings with the potential of 
becoming beautiful, functioning restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that the City Council, with its economic distress and purported 
concern for building a community, would want to see Olive stay in the community 
-- as well as allow one of these forsaken buildings to come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 I arranged a meeting with a city councilman's office, where I explained that 
rather than close Olive down, I would like to continue operating in the 
neighborhood. I discussed the number of jobs and tax dollars at stake. I 
mentioned that, in four years, I hadn't had one police, fire department or 
neighbor complaint. Finally, I stated that Olive had become a viable part of 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The city councilman's office politely, but sternly, informed me that 
restaurants that serve liquor are perceived as liabilities to the neighborhood 
-- they breed crime, traffic and degeneracy. I was treated as if I had applied 
to build a jail in the district -- the plan may seem fine on paper, but we 
don't trust it, and we don't want it in our neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 I stated how restaurants help build a community. I said City Restaurant, now 
closed, was instrumental in transforming La Brea Avenue from a nondescript 
thoroughfare to an important and vital walking and shopping street. To this, 
the City Council again politely, but fiercely, explained that an 
alcohol-serving restaurant was not the type of business they could "support." 
But is it better for the city to watch these buildings sit idle?  
</P>
<P>
 The City of Los Angeles seems to view any night life as intrinsically evil, a 
cancer that, if it cannot be eliminated, must be stringently contained. 
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles is to be a city, it must understand what being a city is. Los 
Angeles is spread out in such a way that discourages walking. Unlike most other 
big cites, we do not have widely used public transportation. We have less space 
dedicated to parks than almost any major city in the country. We are exiled to 
our cars. In the nation's second-largest city, you can go days without even 
seeing your neighbors, and lifetimes without getting to know them. We seem to 
have all the woes of a city, with few of the joys. 
</P>
<P>
 Only look to the overwhelming popularity of City Walk, the Santa Monica 
Promenade or the Venice Boardwalk to recognize the craving Los Angeles has for 
social interaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Are restaurants and bars really so evil? Do we, as a city, benefit from 
policies that encourage owners to let buildings sit vacant rather than become a 
restaurant or bar? By allowing these establishments to exist, we encourage the 
public to connect with one other. This social interaction fosters much needed 
compassion and humanity. Without this cohesion, we cease to be a healthy 
community. Until the city understands the role restaurants and bars play in 
society, we will have to sit on the sidelines and watch the proliferation of 
graffiti and discount futon stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lane's is not entirely gone. In honor of what could have been, I named my 
company "Cocktail Lane's."*

THE NATION; CONFRONTING THE MATTER OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James A. Baker III, James A. Baker III was the 61st secretary of state. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's elites have decided that personal responsibility's time has come. 
Major print and electronic media feature virtue as the subject of cover 
articles and lead stories. In the political arena, Democrats from the President 
on down, long reluctant to embrace an issue more often associated with 
Republicans, can hardly step to a podium without invoking values. 
</P>
<P>
 This public focus is welcome, as well as overdue. But, in truth, personal 
responsibility's time never went. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of Americans of all faiths, races and political persuasions 
try today, just as they always have, to live according to standards of behavior 
as old as civilization. They obey the law, work hard, respect their neighbors 
and raise their children to do the same. For five years or more, almost 
unnoticed by the media, local communities have been working to return character 
to our schools and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: According to a recent poll, 73% of Americans worry that 
the nation is experiencing a moral decline. They are right to be concerned.  
</P>
<P>
 The symptoms of America's social decay hardly bear repeating. The explosive 
rise of illegitimacy since 1960 has plunged millions into material poverty and 
moral dependence. An epidemic of crime has created a climate of fear in many 
neighborhoods and schools. Much of our popular culture is dominated by 
promiscuity, violence -- or both. Worse yet, our judicial and education systems 
often seem helpless to stem the rising tide of social decay. 
</P>
<P>
 The manifestations of America's crisis in values may be complex. But its cause 
is clear. It embodies the idea that somebody else is responsible for our 
actions and reflects a rejection of personal responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 The price of this denial of personal responsibility is staggering. By some 
estimates, crime alone costs the American economy more than $600 billion a 
year. Substance abuse and illegitimacy add countless billions more. But the 
human cost paid in death, ruined lives and dashed hopes is far higher. And it 
falls, in cruel disproportion, on our most vulnerable.  
</P>
<P>
 It would be folly, however, to identify today's crisis in values solely with 
America's most disadvantaged, the "underclass." Whatever the outcome of the 
O.J. Simpson case -- and it is important to recall his presumption of innocence 
under law -- Nicole Brown Simpson's history of abuse at her husband's hands 
reminds us that domestic violence crosses economic lines. Denial of 
responsibility has tainted all levels of American society, especially its 
young. Teen-age drug and alcohol abuse are major problems in the poshest of 
suburbs. Sexual promiscuity is not limited to the inner city -- nor is the 
disease and illegitimacy that go with it. 
</P>
<P>
 America's crisis in values is so pervasive that no single approach can address 
it. Public policy can and indeed must play a part. But so, too, must community 
action and individual engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the government level, statehouses are leading the way. Legislatures across 
the nation have passed measures -- including mandatory sentencing and "three 
strikes, you're out" provisions for repeat violent offenders -- that will help 
put the onus of crime where it belongs: on the criminal. Republican governors 
in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and New Jersey are pushing innovative welfare 
reforms designed to return responsibility to the system through strict work 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Washington's record is more mixed. A tough crime bill has still not 
received congressional approval, because of efforts by liberal House Democrats 
to scuttle it. The President's much-touted plan to "end welfare as we know it" 
is short on both details and teeth -- it won't even apply to two-thirds of the 
5 million American families now on welfare. The Administration's health-care 
plan -- with employer mandates, price controls and a huge bureaucracy -- marks 
a step away from personal responsibility and toward the "government knows best" 
philosophy that landed America in so much trouble in the first place.  
</P>
<P>
 But communities are not waiting for Washington. Groups like the Character 
Counts Coalition, representing 27 organizations and led by actor Tom Selleck 
and former Rep. Barbara Jordan, are working to put personal responsibility back 
where it belongs: at the top of the nation's youth agenda. School boards are 
considering ways to strengthen curricula, with a new emphasis on old virtues 
like trustworthiness, respect and citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
 These local efforts don't begin and end in the classroom. The idea of 
community service for young people -- of giving to, as well as taking from, 
society -- is being put into practice around the country. So, too, are 
innovative programs aimed at preventing teen-age pregnancy through responsible 
behavior, before it produces more fatherless families and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, more than legislation and community action will be needed if the slide 
in American morals and morale is to be stopped -- much less reversed. Here, the 
individual as role model remains key. 
</P>
<P>
 This must begin at the top, with public figures. True, scandal among the 
elite, whether in sports, the arts or politics, is nothing new. Nor is the 
general public's fascination with it. If scandal becomes widespread enough, 
however, it can begin to fray a society's moral fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what the "character" question is all about: not so much the character 
of a single individual, but the standard of laxity -- whether in terms of 
individual integrity or personal veracity -- that he or she sets for society at 
large. Yes, public figures have a right to privacy. But they also have a 
responsibility to serve as models of personal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The current crisis in values reaches back to the 1960s, when cultural 
relativism, moral permissiveness and a willingness to blame society for 
individual behavior began to shape elite opinion and undermine the concept of 
personal responsibility. In the years since, there were those who recognized 
these trends and called for remedial action. These critics, usually 
conservative, were condemned for what liberals called their intolerance, 
alarmism and, above all, lack of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be farther from the truth. Now as then, the conservative 
critique of American society is grounded in a profound sympathy for society's 
less fortunate. But that sympathy is tempered by two truths. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is the demonstrable inability of government programs to serve as 
cure-alls for social ills. Indeed, some of the most ambitious Great Society 
programs of the 1960s, most notably in welfare, actually hurt those they 
intended to help. The second is the link between personal responsibility and 
individual opportunity. The "American dream" -- of a rewarding job, a home and 
a family and community to take pride in -- cannot be conferred by government 
fiat. It must be earned, as it has been by generations of Americans, through 
diligence and honesty -- in short, by personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 America began its disastrous experiment in social permissiveness 30 years ago. 
It may take another three decades to reverse the process. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing, however, will ensure that we fail in this endeavor: a general 
retreat from the public sphere. Faced with societal decline, there is a great 
urge to withdraw into family and career. Ironically, this temptation is felt 
most strongly by the majority of Americans for whom personal responsibility is 
an important part of their lives. We often hear the question, "Where are 
America's role models?" "Behind locked doors and barred windows," is too often 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of a turn away from civic life remain strong. Voter participation, 
despite its upturn in the 1992 election, continues down. Disillusion with 
public institutions is at an all-time high. Washington, in particular, has 
become a byword for feckless action and fatuous rhetoric. Ultimately, however, 
attempts to escape the moral crisis confronting America will be futile. Social 
decay is intruding on our streets, in our schools and on our TV screens. 
Engagement by individual Americans remains crucial. And it must be on the 
widest possible front: in local communities, church groups, civic organizations 
and the broader political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Without sustained engagement by Americans, the current focus on virtue and 
values could prove just this month's media cause celebre. America cannot allow 
this. Personal responsibility is what made us a strong nation. A continuing 
crisis in values will reduce us to a weak one.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; JACQUES TOUBON; DEFENDING THE FRENCH LANGUAGE 
AGAINST ALL INTERLOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Kraft, Scott Kraft is Paris bureau chief for The Times. He interviewed 
Jacques Toubon in the minister's Paris office. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent editorial cartoon in Le Figaro, the Parisian daily, showed an 
American soldier, circa 1944, stumbling in terrible French to greet an 
attractive young Frenchwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can just say 'Hello, Baby,' " the young woman tells her suitor. "Jacques 
Toubon is only 3 years old!" 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the barbs being fired by newspapers and radio stations in France 
these days into the thick skin of Toubon, France's 53-year-old minister of 
culture. In just 15 months on the job, Toubon already has drawn flak for taking 
steps to protect the French language from the intervention of foreign, and 
especially English, words. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loi Toubon , passed last month by the National Assembly, requires 
companies to use French in advertisements and contracts. As a result, Nike, the 
athletic-wear manufacturer, has to find a suitable translation for its slogan, 
"Just Do It," and MacDonald's will have to find a new name for "cheeseburger." 
("Hamburger" is OK; it's considered part of the French language.) 
</P>
<P>
 A second Toubon-authored law, which will take effect in 1996, will require 
radio stations to devote at least 40% of their music air time to French songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new attempt at language protectionism has made Toubon the butt of 
countless jokes in the media. Some disc jockeys have begun referring to the 
minister as "Monsieur All Good," his last name roughly translated into English. 
</P>
<P>
 But this bothers Toubon not at all. He remains convinced that most people 
support his attempts to keep French pristine. His detractors, he contends, are 
a minority group of intellectuals and newspaper writers for whom "it is 
fashionable to insert foreign words into their speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Toubon is a longtime member of the conservative Gaullist party. Known for his 
harsh tongue on the National Assembly floor, he is viewed as a skillful 
political organizer. But, outside the law-making body, it is his considerable 
charm and dimpled smile that is most often mentioned by those he meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Toubon was born in Nice, the son of a croupier in a Riviera casino. His first 
marriage ended in divorce; he has remarried. He works from an ornate suite of 
offices where the Duke of Orleans and, later, Napoleon's brother lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Already a powerful figure in the government, Toubon will be a key figure in 
the coming year as conservatives begin choosing their candidate for president 
to replace the retiring Francois Mitterrand. Toubon will have to choose between 
his prime minister, Edouard Balladur, and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, who 
helped Toubon get his start in national politics more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Let's begin with the Toubon Law to protect the French language. Why 
is it necessary?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are two objectives. The first is an intrinsic one: to develop a 
way of guaranteeing that everything said and written in France can be 
understood by the entire French population. The Toubon Law will ensure that 
instruction manuals and explanatory leaflets for all products, whether domestic 
or imports, be translated into French. Contracts will be written in French so 
workers are able to understand them. And at scientific conferences, the 
French-speaking attendees will have to speak in French. 
</P>
<P>
 Our second objective is broader -- to develop French translations for words 
used in industries such as electronics and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Language is an irreplaceable capital for all peoples. If it is not preserved 
and modernized, it will no longer allow the people to express themselves, to 
understand each other or to communicate with the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In many fields, English has become virtually a world language. You oppose 
that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We support the concept of linguistic pluralism. If, one day, all mankind 
spoke in one language, or rather in one international code, this would lead to 
a dramatic impoverishment of culture and cultural exchange, and, finally, it 
would mean a regression of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not think having everybody speak English or American English would be a 
sign of progress. On the contrary, progress is when each individual expresses 
his identity through his culture and through the language that is its 
foundation. This law is our long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But does the problem really exist? Is anyone in France confronted with a 
situation in which they are not able to speak their language?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, yes. There are a lot of companies, French and foreign, who hire people 
with contracts written in English. This is discrimination -- and it's illegal. 
It's the same for instructions for appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it happens every day. When you arrive at Roissy (Charles de Gaulle) 
Airport, you can see billboards written entirely in English. Many foreigners 
tell me that when they come to France, they want to change their environment -- 
not find the same one they have at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're speaking now of advertising billboards for companies such as 
American Express. But their audience includes Americans. Surely, you don't 
intend to stop them from reaching their clients.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Of course, we will not prohibit American Express from directing their ads 
to their English-speaking clients. But what we are saying is that for every 
billboard written in English, there should be one written in French. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the words "American Express?" Those are English words, too.  
</P>
<P>
 A: American Express is a trademark, and we accept trademarks. No problem. 
Generally speaking, we accept all trademarks. Hamburger. Hot Dog. Pizza. There 
is no French equivalent, because they are American or Italian specialties. Or 
let's take goulash, the Hungarian national meal. Goulash is goulash. There is 
no word in French. 
</P>
<P>
 The same rule applies to the names of restaurants. A Pizzeria will still be 
called a Pizzeria. Tandoori, for an Indian restaurant, will be still be called 
Tandoori. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, some foreign words are OK and others aren't?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The issue here is not so much that a foreign language be used. On the 
contrary, I would like to see French people speak more foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem is that French people no longer speak French properly. And we 
are afraid that they may express themselves with the vocabulary, the syntax and 
the spirit of another language. 
</P>
<P>
 Some English-speaking people also worry that other English-speaking people 
distort the English language, what you call "Basic English." We want each 
language to remain a living language and not have a two-track system where we 
would have one international code for communications and the national language 
only for administration, education, etc. That would destroy languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me take a more concrete example. The word site in French means a beautiful 
place, a memorable place with historical value. This word has a positive 
meaning. But, more and more, the word site is used with the English meaning. A 
"site" has become just a place. An industrial site, for example. It is a 
distortion of its usage, and now it has lost its actual impact. Now, when one 
uses the word site no one knows exactly what it means. Is it something 
beautiful or something ugly? It would be better for everyone if the French 
person is capable of expressing himself by using words from the French 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does this issue make you feel personally? Do you get angry when you 
hear English spoken by French people?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I'm not worried. I know full well that when it comes to the usage of 
language, only the French people and society make the rules. However, I think 
the state is responsible for the patrimony of a country. The responsibility of 
the state is not to police the usage of language. 
</P>
<P>
 All my law says is that, in certain cases, French must be used. The law 
doesn't fix rules of usage. That is the responsibility of the French Academy, 
the intellectuals and the popular users. The state's role is to increase 
people's awareness and, most of all, the awareness of young people -- for whom 
the good usage of language is a vital skill. Let me take a concrete example. 
Today, unemployment is particularly high for young people just coming out of 
school. We have noticed that their major handicap is language skills. They do 
not know how to read or write properly, or even to write their own resumes or 
fill out an application. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not only culture that is at stake here. It is the lives of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But isn't your example more a question of education? Isn't this law too 
late?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I don't think so. The law and the debate around it is leading to a 
greater awareness, and this awareness will fall upon the parents, on the 
teachers, on the pupils. I have met several people who are now interested in 
knowing how their children are taught French. It's primarily a law against 
indifference, against negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you explain what the media thinks about this law? I have seen many 
articles poking fun at your law.  
</P>
<P>
 A: The people who are opposing me on this issue belong to a minority group of 
intellectuals, for the most part, and for them, language is not an issue. For 
them, it is often fashionable to insert foreign words in their speech. We have, 
on the contrary, other groups who agree that language is a means of social 
integration. This is the case of many young immigrants for whom the usage of 
French is a type of passport necessary to enter French society. The majority of 
the population is in favor of this law, but most often this majority is silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have insisted that this law is not directed only at English, and yet 
most French people see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
 A: This is not an attack against the English language. My law will essentially 
affect the English language, but it is not against English. It is intended to 
preserve the French language. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if we have a new concept to name, we should not use the English 
language to name it. In France, we have never said "computer." We use the 
French word ordinateur . The same goes for AIDS. We say "SIDA," even if the 
disease was first discovered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that, if we make an effort, we can speak French without having to 
use English. Hence, I think, there is a bit of a misunderstanding. English and 
American newspapers say the French are doing it again -- that we want to be 
different. But 120 countries already have such a law and many other countries 
are in the process of passing such a law. Moreover, 15 states in the United 
States also have linguistic laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will there be fines for language offenders?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In order for laws to be respected, there must be sanctions. These sanctions 
will be adapted to each case. If, for example, a working contract is not 
written in French, it will not be a legal document. If an ad is done in a 
foreign language, it will not be publicized on radio or television. 
</P>
<P>
 Fines will not be given for language misuse. It is only in a case of violent 
attempts to prevent the law from being enforced that a jail sentence will be 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can you impose sanctions on advertising?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There will be fines, similar to tickets for speeding. A fine per billboard. 
But, most important, the objective is to encourage companies to make a French 
equivalent for every billboard made in a foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, you don't really mind if someone on the street says "cool?"  
</P>
<P>
 A: Cool. Yes, well, nowadays people think everything modern or young comes 
from foreign words. It is a trend from high school. I think we should try to 
show our young people that by using the word decontracte , instead of "cool," 
they are saying the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Television is imposing a cultural model made in the U.S.A. For example, the 
trend at the moment is to play street basketball, and this leads to children 
dressing like the American basketball players, walking like them and using the 
same vocabulary. This phenomena has always existed, but I think this may cause 
our society to break down into tribes. The ultimate risk would be that our 
Republic, our common thing, disappears. There is a lot at stake here.*

WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE ANTI-MARRIAGE?; STATE INTRODUCES 'WEDFARE,' ADDS NEW 
LOGIC TO SOCIAL POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California is again taking a leading role in welfare reform. Its new "Wedfare" 
approach will allow poor single mothers who must leave welfare because they 
have married or have returned to an estranged spouse to keep child care and 
medical benefits for 18 months. This incentive is the same one that is allowed 
welfare recipients who go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit state Sen. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena) with this worthy change, which 
is intended to encourage marriage and family unity. He got the sensible notion 
from welfare directors, case workers and women who receive Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children. They told him over and over: Welfare discourages marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift centers on single-parent families. Whether created by unwed 
motherhood, separation or divorce, these families are more likely than others 
to live in poverty and need welfare. The unfortunate fact is that the helping 
hand extended by the government becomes a trap when a woman on welfare wants to 
marry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under previous policy, a welfare mother lost benefits when she married a 
working man or returned to a spouse who had a job even if that job paid 
poverty-level wages and provided no health insurance. For those poor families, 
marriage meant the automatic loss of welfare checks and Medi-Cal coverage. 
Should any child need to suffer merely because his or her parents marry? 
</P>
<P>
 The reform reduces the marriage penalty. It allows a recipient forced to leave 
welfare because she married to keep state Medi-Cal health benefits for her 
family for 18 months. She (most recipients who would benefit are poor women) 
also keeps child care subsidies, enabling her to work outside the home. In 
addition, the legislation eliminates a common source of welfare fraud: the lie 
that men and women live when they falsely claim separate addresses to get 
welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure did not take the usual route from bill to law. Instead, Thompson, 
a member of the Senate-Assembly conference committee during the state's 
tortured budget process, succeeded in incorporating the change into the 
language of the California budget. That approach allowed him to skirt political 
obstacles from both sides of the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson insisted on the change because he wanted some rewards to encourage 
women who are on welfare to change the way they live. The legislator rightly 
argued that the budget contained only penalties, including still another cut in 
welfare checks -- the fourth in four years -- and the loss of additional 
benefits when more children are born to a welfare recipient. That, he 
contended, provided too much stick and no carrot to encourage recipients to 
leave welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, whose father was a county welfare director, pushed "Wedfare" as a 
way to strengthen families, to reduce welfare dependence that extends sometimes 
for generations and to give children a better start. He's on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 This change, however, isn't a cure-all. No one in Sacramento knows how many 
families will benefit. Perhaps a modest few; perhaps many more. Whatever the 
result, the incentive is worth trying. It is another incremental step in the 
state's fight to reduce the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember: The point of welfare is to help get people on their feet. Washington 
should take note of California's "Wedfare" when the debate on national welfare 
reform finally starts in Congress.

THE WORLD; IN JAPANESE POLITICS, OIL AND WATER ARE MIXING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Blaker, Michael Blaker, a senior research associate in the Program 
on U.S.-Japan Relations at Harvard University, is completing a book on 
contemporary Japanese diplomacy titled Back Door to Power. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Certainly, the inauguration of a Japanese Socialist prime minister atop a 
conservative Cabinet -- including, of all people, Makiko Tanaka, daughter of 
the late conservative strongman and former premier Kakuei Tanaka -- has to 
notch at least an eight on the 1994 bizarre-happening scale. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Socialists and Liberal Democrats (conservative in political 
orientation despite the name) have been the oil and water of Japanese politics 
for 40 years. They have differed sharply over fundamental issues -- defense, 
the constitution, fiscal policy and participation of Japan's military forces in 
U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, Japan is a 
consensus-driven society, conservatives dominate its politics, the Cold War is 
over and the Socialists hold just 15% of the seats in Parliament. So what's 
with a Socialist running the government? 
</P>
<P>
 "Abnormal," "farcical," "laughable" were the most common reactions in Japan to 
the new lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Tomiichi Murayama, famous in Japan for his craggy eyebrows, 
certainly raised more than a few when he unexpectedly defeated conservative 
retread and former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu for the nation's top job. 
Murayama's Cabinet, formed the next day, included five geriatric Socialists 
(average age 70) in minor posts, 13 Liberal Democrats in the most powerful 
slots and two from the New Party Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? The same political deck has been shuffled and reshuffled so 
many times this past year -- the Murayama government is the fourth -- one 
wonders what game is being played, who's dealing, the stakes and whether Japan 
is ever playing with a full deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans project onto Japanese politics U.S.-style debates over principles, 
causes, purposes and policies. While analysts may want Japanese politics to be 
about these things, a desire furthered by the Japanese media, wishing does not 
make it so. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, what passes for a grand debate on Japan's world role these days 
centers on the ideas of one politician, Ichiro Ozawa, onetime protege of 
strongman Noboru Takeshita. Ozawa bolted the Liberal Democratic Party, assumed 
the role of political reformer, preaching widely and loudly against 
irresponsibility and corruption in Japanese politics and urging Japan to become 
an activist "normal" country, even a "mini-superpower" in global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. Then recent political developments stem from this debate, with one camp 
supporting, the other opposing, Ozawa's bold visions? Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 These events reflect a continuing Japanese political evolution. What's 
happening concerns politics, personalities, winning elections, gaining and 
maintaining political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's political-correctness code is another key to understanding the events. 
Deeply rooted in Japanese political culture are norms against self-serving, 
autocratic, overaggressive conduct. Ironically, Ozawa, renowned for his 
political instincts, skills at gauging votes and winning, was hoisted by his 
own petard. His "in your face" campaign to recruit Socialists and Liberal 
Democrats to Kaifu's side "went too far," crossing the line of acceptability 
and alienating many key players. Anti-Ozawa sentiments were the glue binding 
the pro-Murayama coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, one pressing concern will be political stability. Not 
that Japan is at all unstable. There are no riots in the streets. The nation is 
scarcely in "crisis." But the past year's political turmoil has exacted a toll. 
Legislation has stalled, official trips have been canceled, key decisions are 
on hold. No immediate end seems in sight for the turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are serious doubts about the new government. Past coalition 
governments have not lasted. Another red light is public support for the new 
government -- the third lowest recording ever. And, despite a display of unity, 
can the opposition-prone Socialists seize this chance to show leadership and 
purpose? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fledgling Murayama government has an edge over its predecessor 
coalitions. Among the reasons: its three-party coalition won nearly 55% of last 
July's popular vote; savvy conservative politicians familiar with their 
ministries hold key portfolios; conservatives dominate the Cabinet, veteran 
politicians who have worked together via formal and informal networks; the 
Socialists are the top party in the upper house and a Socialist is speaker of 
the lower chamber; a workable right-center coalition has been in place for 
years, and while the Communists, with 15 lower-house seats, have become 
politically irrelevant, the Socialists have turned more pragmatic -- a 
development that sharing power in the new government should hasten. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate question seems less whether than when to hold a general 
election. Reform legislation aimed at overhauling campaign financing and 
restructuring election districts from multimember districts to a single-member 
constituency system passed the Diet in January and will go into effect this 
fall. The best guess is that the Murayama government will not call a quick 
election under the old system but will delay an election until redistricting 
becomes a political reality. While a U.S.-style two-party system may emerge 
from the next election, a three-party structure is as likely, and a multiparty 
system, with shifting coalitions and alliances, seems most probable. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the anti-Liberal Democratic parties are in disarray. 
"Conservative " is out. "New" is in, to the point of exhausting the Japanese 
vocabulary for expressing it. Perhaps the "new life party" (Ozawa's Shinseito) 
may metamorphose into the "new-new life party" to satisfy the public's 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideology matters less than ever, not because ideas are unimportant, but 
because the status-quo consensus is so solid on fundamentals -- prosperity at 
home and stability abroad -- that parties differ less and less on policy, 
particularly foreign policy, substance. It is hard to rally a country or a 
political party around the status quo. Despite the fervent wish for national 
purpose, identity, leadership and vision, these remain desirable, not feasible 
or realistic, goals in today's Japan. No crystal ball is needed to predict that 
what changes do occur will unfold through the gradualist, reactive, 
risk-minimizing processes of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Its unorthodox composition notwithstanding, Japan's new hybrid government is 
perhaps better equipped to address the economic and social issues facing Japan 
than were the ragtag coalitions running Japan since last July. One should bear 
in mind, too, that it took a decade for Japanese politics to stabilize after 
World War II. However transitional the arrangement may prove to be, by burying 
the hatchet and agreeing to share power, two former political rivals have 
demonstrated the depth of Japan's political consensus and the decline of the 
ideological left as a factor in post-Cold War Japanese politics.*

MAY DUNKENTALL

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Too bad it took a drive-by shooting to find out about the Watts matriarch 
May Dunkentall (July 2).Why don't we read about such colorful community figures 
before they die? I live in a "good area," Playa del Rey, yet no one cooks soul 
food for the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunkentall did more for Watts than all the city politicians and bureaucrats 
combined. She showed she cared, she created community. More articles about 
people like her, community heroes, would encourage more people to follow her 
role model. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to see an article about a community hero on the front page every day.

OWENS RIVER GORGE RESTORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your July 2 article concerning the restoration of water to the Owens River 
Gorge brought back a flood of memories. 
</P>
<P>
 My father, James C. Kerr, was employed by the then Southern Sierras Power Co. 
in Riverside. His position required occasional visits to the many power plants 
owned by the company, including Bishop Creek and beyond into Mono County. 
</P>
<P>
 My father used to tell me of the boundless beauty of this country with its 
flowing streams teeming with wild trout. Although he didn't fish, his stories 
to a lad 10 years old fired an imagination that to this day is vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 As time went on, the thought of this beautiful, untamed land would not leave 
my mind. I planned that the next time my father would make a trip to the 
Sierras I would go with him. And so it was. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the power plants on his itinerary was the plant at the bottom of the 
Owens River Gorge. In order to reach it, it was necessary to take a very steep, 
precipitous road which wound down breath-taking turns. Usually, only the heavy 
four-wheel-drive vehicles could make this trip. However, on this occasion we 
traveled in a Chrysler passenger car, which at that time was supposedly the 
only domestic vehicle with four-wheel brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after many frightening minutes of blind curves and fear of dropping 
into the chasm below, we reached the bottom of the gorge and the powerhouse 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 As one could imagine, the scene was unforgettable, with the turbulence of the 
raging water and the sound of the generators driven by the huge "Pelton" 
wheels, which were like giant waterwheels. The whole thing was so spectacular 
that for several hours I forgot all about the fishing for which these waters 
were famed. 
</P>
<P>
 The healing of the great Owens River Gorge is also the healing of lost 
memories of those distant days of the past.

 * Despite the fact that the climb out is too steep and I'll probably never get 
to fish there, I helped open the Owens River Gorge and I couldn't be more 
proud. I wholeheartedly supported the Federation of Fly Fishers, California 
Trout, Trout Unlimited, the California Sportsfishing Protection Alliance and 
all the other Davids who fought and beat Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 So, let's drink a toast of gratitude to Barrett McInerny, the conservation 
attorney who virtually single-handedly brought the DWP to the mat; to Dick May 
and Jim Edmonston of CalTrout, to Mike Jackson and Bob Baiocchi of the CSPA and 
to all the fly-fishing club members, who volunteered a gazillion hours to give 
the Owens River Gorge back to the people of California, the United States and 
the world.

GIVING TAIWAN AN EVEN BREAK; ONE-CHINA POLICY, SURE; BUT LET'S NOT FORGET A 
VALUABLE TRADING PARTNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's reported interest in warming up U.S. relations 
with Taiwan is yet another reminder that in foreign relations even the most 
apparently settled policies are sometimes -- and quite properly -- subject to 
revision. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case the changes being considered, as Times staff writer Jim Mann 
reported the other day, fall well short of being radical. Basically, they aim 
at making more convenient and effective the conduct of a continuing if 
deliberately understated relationship. Among the ideas being considered is to 
allow Cabinet officers from the two governments to visit each other's country, 
something that has pretty much been banned ever since Washington officially 
extended diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1979 and ended its formal ties 
with Taipei. Additionally, Taiwan's liaison offices in Washington and other 
U.S. cities would be allowed to identify themselves more precisely. For the 
last 15 years those offices have been designated the Coordination Council for 
North American Affairs, a name so semantically insipid and politically neutered 
as to leave all but specialists baffled about what it is they do. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials emphasize that the modest upgrading in Taiwan's status that is 
being pondered doesn't affect Washington's one-China policy. Since 1972, when 
President Richard Nixon's visit to China ended a 23-year freeze in bilateral 
relations, U.S. policy has accepted that Taiwan is part of China, and that it 
is up to the Chinese to work out their political future. In fact, in recent 
years Taiwan and the mainland have greatly expanded relations in such areas as 
trade and tourism, though their political differences remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has become Taiwan's foremost trading partner, while Taiwan 
is now the sixth-biggest market for American products, including hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year in military supplies. Putting relations on a more 
open basis certainly is worthwhile and can be done without downgrading 
relations with Beijing or compromising previous agreements. China may not like 
it, but the question is what kind of policy best serves overall U.S. interests. 
The answer in this instance is a policy whose chief purpose is to make it 
easier to carry on regular business with a key trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The see-no-Taiwan, speak-no-Taiwan policy of the last 15 years has sometimes 
been carried to self-humiliating lengths. Thus when Taiwan's President Lee 
Teng-hui two months ago asked permission to rest for a night in Honolulu while 
on a flight to Central America the State Department refused, fearing that to 
grant permission might upset Beijing. If a new approach to Taiwan does nothing 
else than put an end to such indefensibly craven behavior, it would have to be 
considered a plus.

THE STATE; HOW CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTES TO ITS OWN IMMIGRATION PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Edward J. Lynch, Edward J. Lynch, who teaches at the Institute of World 
Politics, directed the office of strategic planning at the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service from 1989-93. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's recurrent request that the federal government compensate 
California for its spending on illegal immigrants is certainly appealing. But 
immigration is rarely so simple, and before Congress con siders reimbursing 
California, it should analyze the role various Californians have played in 
mitigating, or exacerbating, the local effects of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's recent record begins with an amendment to the Immigration Reform 
and Control Act of 1986 that was sponsored by Wilson when he was a U.S. 
senator. The provision enabled immigrant agricultural workers to apply for 
legalization if they had entered the United States as late as 1986. By 
contrast, amnesty was granted to other foreign-born nationals only if they had 
resided continuously in the United States since 1982. More than one million 
"special agricultural workers" took advantage of the amendment's offer; the 
overwhelming majority of them now reside in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Other California congressional members have supported measures to ensure that 
their state benefits from immigrants. In March, 1990, several House members, 
including Reps. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Don Edwards (D-San Jose) 
and Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose), participated in a meeting in the office of 
Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer (D-Ohio), during which Gene McNary, then commissioner of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, was asked to suspend enforcement 
activities while the 1990 census was under way. This would strengthen the 
possibility of a "full and accurate" count, the congressmen contended. At the 
time, it should be noted, legislation passed by the Senate and pending before 
the House would have instructed the Census Bureau to count only people legally 
in the United States. The inclusion of illegal immigrants in the 1990 census 
contributed to California's gain of seven congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is not the only place where Californians' actions affect the 
state's appeal for immigrants. San Francisco, for example, enacted city and 
county resolutions that prohibited spending to assist immigration enforcement. 
These provisions were part of "sanctuary" ordinances passed, at least in part, 
to protest U.S. foreign policies. Los Angeles and San Diego also adopted 
resolutions restricting cooperation with immigration-law enforcement until the 
Legislature repealed all such measures last fall. Although some dispute the 
constitutionally of the local resolutions, their symbolic message for 
immigrants seemed clear: "welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of California's public and private institutions, as a result of U.S. 
Supreme Court decisions, serve migrants regardless of legal status. Wilson has 
seized on this to claim that two-thirds of the babies born in Los Angeles 
County hospitals are children of illegal immigrants. But the National Center 
for Vital Health Statistics, an agency of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, reports that births to citizens of other nations are declining -- 
even in the four states that border Mexico. Where these states annually 
reported more than 10,000 such births in the late 1970s, in 1990 they counted 
fewer than 5,000. Discrepancies in the data are difficult to evaluate, to be 
sure, because California (and nearly all other) hospitals do not inquire about 
the legal status of patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when Los Angeles County tried to calculate the costs of illegal 
immigration, directors of local housing and education agencies informed county 
supervisors that they do not, under current legal guidelines, seek the 
immigration status of any students and/or residents. As a result, all such 
estimates must be based, at best, on secondhand sources, all of whom share 
interests in securing additional resources to extend their operations to 
additional clients. 
</P>
<P>
 California's bureaucratic support for illegal immigration is reinforced by its 
courts, which have ruled that illegal immigrants admitted to the state's 
college system can qualify for in-state tuition. This curious legal reasoning 
extends to citizens of Tijuana benefits that are unavailable to residents of 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants undoubtedly travel to California in greater numbers because 
the state, for many years, provided more employment opportunities. But who 
provided the jobs to illegal immigrants who became California residents? 
Federal agencies require background checks on applicants, a substantial barrier 
to employment for illegal immigrants. The market for nannies, gardeners, fruit 
pickers, waiters, busboys and similar personnel is overwhelmingly a private (if 
not underground) market. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is right to support more funding for the Border Patrol. But to 
adequately address California's problems, enforcing employer sanctions and 
prosecuting visa violators will require a backup to the patrol. He is also 
right to seek repeal of federal mandates that extend benefits to illegal 
immigrants, but this, too, would fall short of addressing the core problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Before asking Washington for financial help, California should take strong 
measures to eliminate any incentives in its own back yard that might attract 
illegal immigrants. Curiously, Wilson never mentions deportation of anyone but 
criminal immigrants, but effective action against illegal immigrants must 
eventually include such responses, or illegal entry becomes merely a first step 
in a legal war of attrition aimed at securing a place here. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as U.S. citizens continue to provide jobs for those who enter 
illegally or overstay their visas, policy changes in Washington will never 
compensate for the burdens that illegal immigration can impose on communities. 
Authorizing funds that Washington doesn't have might ease California's budget 
problems, but it will also reduce Californians' incentives to do something 
themselves. No enforcement program mandated from Washington can effectively 
close doors that citizens in local communities decide, in myriad daily actions, 
to keep open.*

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Civil Rights -- the Graying of a '60s Dream," by Jonathan Freedman, 
Column Left, July 3: 
</P>
<P>
 How could Freedman not see that policies allocating economic and educational 
opportunities by ethnicity and gender would inevitably produce a fraud-ridden 
ethnic spoils system far from affirmative action's original intent of fostering 
individual equal opportunity? Indeed, Freedman is so annoyed with whites' 
reverse discrimination complaints that he ignores how affirmative action quotas 
pit black and non-black minorities against each other. (Ironically, affirmative 
action can now harm blacks as their quotas shrink to accommodate those of 
burgeoning immigrant groups.) 
</P>
<P>
 Affirmative action was corrupted from within by crafty judges and bureaucrats 
eager to expand the policies beyond narrowly tailored remedies. For example, 
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act did not set hiring goals, as Freedman 
asserts; on the contrary, Title VII's section 703j expressly stated that the 
act did not require employers to give ethnic preferences to balance their work 
forces. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan subverted the obvious intent in 
Weber vs. Kaiser Aluminum in 1979 by slyly noting that the act did not prohibit 
employers from imposing "voluntary" quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 Such legal trickery, as well as secretive, exclusionary procedures -- such as 
set-asides and "race norming" of employment exams -- earned affirmative action 
its tarnished reputation.

institutes programs (i.e., affirmative action) that offer entitlements to 
groups based solely upon the color of their skin? 
</P>
<P>
 It is indisputable that today there is less racism and more opportunity for 
minorities than at any time in history. No individual (black or white) can 
realistically blame racism or lack of opportunity for his or her own failure to 
succeed in this society. It is a very conscious choice to become a criminal in 
America.

HAMILTON HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Another school year has ended and although there is talk of a teachers' 
strike, the world somehow needs to know that so many forces for good are 
pulling together to give our children exemplary experiences in education. As 
the principal of the Hamilton High School Complex, I will never forget this 
June's commencement and the honor of whispering in each student's ear as he/she 
came to the podium "Go forth into this world and make a difference . . . do 
good." Much of the emotion of that moment came not only from the affection I 
feel for these students, but also from the commitment and inspiration from the 
many LAUSD teachers and support personnel who were my companions on this 
10-month journey. Under the extraordinary circumstances of earthquakes and 
urban tensions, we still got through "Gravity's Rainbow," the last chapter in 
the calculus text, and prepared students for the transition to work or college. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this school year ending even more sweet is the knowledge that 
corporate benefactors, 20th Century Fox (Peter Chernin and Dennis Petrosky) and 
Westwood One (Norm Pattiz) will provide us funds to go forward in the 
development of our music and film arts programs. We begin the building of a new 
film/communication arts center at Hamilton this summer. These fine men helped 
to garner over $400,000 from other music and film industry benefactors. And 
lastly the social stability that we enjoyed on campus this year was largely due 
to the efforts of the Martin Luther King Mediation Center, the Urban League, 
Project 10, the Coalition of Christians & Jews, the Constitutional Rights 
Foundation, the Parent Booster Club, the Parent & Student MultiCultural 
Coalitions and our new Alumni Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 There is great community in Los Angeles, and we are blessed that so much of it 
came together on the Hamilton campus.

MUTINY AND RACIAL INJUSTICE; THE PRESIDENT SHOULD EXPUNGE THE CONVICTIONS OF 
BLACK SAILORS IN WORLD WAR II INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has an opportunity to right a racial wrong that lingers from 
the days of the segregated military during World War II. Next Sunday marks the 
50th anniversary of an accidental explosion that killed 320 servicemen loading 
ammunition for the Pacific theater on a dock at Port Chicago in Concord, Calif. 
On July 17 the National Park Service will dedicate a memorial to the dead and 
injured at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is much more to the story. Most of the dead were black sailors, 
working in segregated units and usually given the most menial and dangerous 
tasks in those days. When their unit was ordered back to loading live shells 
two weeks after the deadly blast, 258 black sailors refused, calling the 
conditions unsafe and their training inadequate. They were convicted at 
courts-martial, 50 of them for mutiny and sentenced to 15-year prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, the secretary of the Navy commuted their sentences to 16 months 
and the men ultimately were given honorable discharges; some continued to serve 
in the military. And, indeed, the case became a turning point for civil rights 
and was a key factor in President Harry S. Truman's historic decision to order 
the desegregation of the armed forces in 1948.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet the convictions still blot the records of the men, many of whom are still 
alive. After a lengthy review, Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton upheld the 
convictions last Jan. 6. He admitted the black seamen had been assigned the 
hazardous ammunition work because of their race but denied that prejudice 
played a role in their courts-martial. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an unsatisfactory finale to the painful Port Chicago episode. Sens. 
Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Reps. George Miller, Ronald V. Dellums, 
Pete Stark and Nancy Pelosi, all of California, have asked President Clinton to 
expunge the convictions. We agree.

SUFFERING THE SLINGS AND ARROWS OF PLUPERFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SOLLISCH, Jim Sollisch is a writer in Cleveland. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a writer and former college English instructor, I am often asked to settle 
heated disputes, to provide a clarifying and measured opinion, to be a voice of 
reason in the passionate debate of issues that divide us. Just the other day, I 
was asked to decide a matter of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does the term brain dead require a hyphen?" a troubled colleague inquired. 
</P>
<P>
 My response to these kinds of perplexing questions is almost stock now. "Ah, 
good question," I say, to show I don't think the inquirer a dull-witted 
numskull for not knowing such grammar rules. Next, I ask for the context. Once 
established, I press on: Is the term being used as a compound adjective, or is 
the noun brain being used here as an adjective to modify dead ? If the bandying 
about of rudimentary grammatical terms such as adjective fails to scare off the 
seeker of truth, I bring out the heavy artillery. Soon, the seeker is bombarded 
with objects of prepositions, participial phrases and that most feared 
author-slayer, pluperfect tense. 
</P>
<P>
 While these terms may have little to do with the question, they do conjure up 
images of curmudgeonly schoolmarms diagraming sentences on blackboards while 
little boys and girls snigger. Now, one of these same little boys or girls, all 
grown up, stands before me, wishing they hadn't sniggered so much. And I, the 
one who eagerly answered Miss Participle's every rhetorical question, who sat 
sniggerlessly in the front row -- now I am Master of the Word, Guardian of 
Truth and Verity in Things Grammatical, Soldier of Syntax and the Status Quo. 
But dare I risk disturbing the Ghost of Participle Past by admitting that I 
don't really care whether brain dead is hyphenated. It could be 
hyphen-impaired, a-hyphenated or simply un-compounded -- as long as I can grasp 
the meaning, I'm happy. 
</P>
<P>
 To communicate or not to communicate, that is the question. Communication is a 
form of magic. To startle someone without raising your voice. To move people 
without touching them. To make a cynic laugh without coming out from behind 
your writing to tell the joke. These are no small miracles. And to pull them 
off, you use whatever you can get your hands on. Sentence fragments are my 
personal favorite. A little jolting. Like a ride on a linguistic roller 
coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 While I am admitting my prurient interest in deviant grammatical behavior, let 
me confess further: I love when rappers turn boring nouns like disrespect into 
verbs. As in, "You disrespected me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," I shout, excited to be witnessing the birth of idiom right over my 
radio. I also delight in the slang form, as in "You dissed me." Listen to it 
hissing at you snake-like, hurled through clenched teeth with pure disdain. 
It's almost onomatopoeia, a word Miss Participle loved to roll around her 
tongue on lazy summer afternoons.  
</P>
<P>
 And I respect writers who shun the awkward but politically correct "his or 
her" construction to match a singular noun, as in, "Everyone is entitled to his 
or her opinion." I prefer, at times, the grammatically incorrect but more 
natural, "Everyone is entitled to their opinion." The truth is, English 
desperately needs a gender-neutral singular pronoun: a hiser, a he/she , an it 
-- only more human. Until someone invents one, their will do quite nicely.

Mormons to "come back," or return to fellowship. Yet more than half of the 9 
million church members can never participate fully because they are women. To 
find reconciliation, Mormon women must look to the past.  
</P>
<P>
 The historical relationship of men and women in the Mormon church is a 
conflicted one. In 1992, I published a book that explores long-ignored aspects 
of that history and attempts to retrieve the soul of Mormon women's spiritual 
life. For that, I was accused of apostasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon women obtained authority early in the history of the church and then 
fought a losing battle to keep it. Their concerns were not taken seriously, so 
men's authority prevailed. Feminism emerged in the struggle, in the energy of 
women's rhetoric and work and in their resistance to male agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormon women exercised considerable religious authority in the LDS Church for 
100 years and maintained some autonomy for 140 years. During the first 20 years 
of Mormonism, from 1830 to 1850, women received authority for blessings, 
healing and prophecy; priesthood keys, powers and rituals; and missionary 
calls. Women clashed with male leadership and lost authority at the turn of the 
century and again in the 1970s. Since 1991, Mormon feminists have encountered a 
backlash against their attempts to reclaim women's authority. Today's church 
holds that women cannot exercise priesthood, therefore women are not "ordained" 
but only "set-apart" to church positions. As a full-time LDS missionary, I 
sensed I had priesthood, but spent 19 months being denied the right to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although women's authority is plainly evident in Mormon history, today's male 
church leaders won't acknowledge it, for that would mean having to take 
responsibility for the sins of their fathers and grandfathers who revoked that 
authority. Instead, they blame Christ. Over and over again, male leaders assert 
that female priesthood is "contrary to the Lord's plan" and that today's church 
"follows the pattern the Lord has set."  
</P>
<P>
 The extreme gender imbalance in Mormonism re-emerges in Utah's masculinist 
culture, where government, education and business are run by Mormon men in the 
shadow of Salt Lake's tallest building, the LDS church offices. In Utah, women 
as well as men repress the feminine, starve it and then overcompensate: We 
crave sweet and fatty foods for comfort; we gain weight to feel loved; men act 
effeminate and women self-destruct with prescription drugs, obesity, depression 
and too many kids. Hostility to women manifests in subtle and shocking ways. 
Apostle Boyd Packer said, "I could tell most of the secretaries in the church 
office building that they are ugly and fat. That would be the truth, but it 
would hurt and destroy them." 
</P>
<P>
 Male-dominant culture offers women a choice between female powerlessness or 
male-identification. A respected local therapist told me that she sees many 
Mormon women who "actually believe they are men." My book was an attempt to 
heal, by moving beyond male-defined identity to a place of female 
identification, definition and power, and by removing obstructions to women's 
relationship with God. 
</P>
<P>
 My feminist views were never welcome in church, so I turned to the public 
marketplace of ideas. Yet for two years, church leaders threatened me not to 
speak publicly about Mormon feminist issues. Excommunication was a small price 
to pay for my voice. It didn't take away my theology or my spirituality, which 
the church does not control. God's spirit cannot be homogenized, mass-produced 
and marketed by blue-suited septuagenarians from a high-rise in downtown Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 I was told that my feminist ideas were "contrary to the laws and order of the 
church." I agree. My excommunication was justifiable. Still, these are men's 
laws and men's orders, not women's. In 1884, Eliza R. Snow, "prophetess" and 
president over all women and girls in the church, made it clear that the 
women's Relief Society, which she headed, was "designed to be a self-governing 
organization. "If difficulties arise," she wrote, ". . . the matter should be 
referred to (the) president and her counselors." Later, when men assumed 
governance over women, they usurped women's authority. I cited Snow to the 15 
high priests set to judge me, but it had no impact on them. It did, however, 
liberate me from participating in their illusion. They excommunicated me to 
silence feminists and send a message of fear to Mormon women, but their action 
had the opposite effect: Visibility and discussion soared, and my book is in 
its second printing. 
</P>
<P>
 So, where does this leave Mormon women? They have a strong feminist tradition. 
Whether today's women can reclaim their authority and priesthood in the church 
and fully participate remains a question; first, they must find authority 
within themselves. But I will not "come back" to a church that crushes female 
authority and individual conscience.

JURORS, JURISTS ALIKE ANGRY OVER UNUSUAL COURT SETUP; JURISPRUDENCE: 
REORGANIZED SYSTEM INCLUDED REQUIRING FELONY JUDGES TO HANDLE PRELIMINARY 
HEARINGS INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM HEARD IN MUNICIPAL COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Robert Wehger does not mind doing his civic duty -- except when it comes to 
jury service. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old Thousand Oaks man believes court officials have little regard 
for his time -- a notion that was confirmed when he sat on a jury in a 
child-molestation case last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-week trial could have been heard in four days if court had not started 
so late every day, said Wehger, a retired musical-instrument sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't start most days until 10 o'clock, 11, 11:30," Wehger explained. 
"One day it was 1:30 in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not unusual for jurors to gripe about their time being wasted, 
court officials say such complaints in Ventura County have become more routine 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 A reorganization of the county courts system, implemented April 4, has led to 
many jury trials lasting twice as long as normal, according to lawyers, judges 
and jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem stems from a component of the new system that requires felony 
judges to conduct their own preliminary hearings -- a rarity in other courts 
around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before, felony judges in the Superior Court relied on their brethren in the 
lower Municipal Court to handle the time-consuming hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 The new setup has become such a drain on judges' time that court officials 
have reversed themselves and will stop using the system Monday, said the 
presiding judge of the Superior Court, Melinda A. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The time constraints not only affected jurors, but infuriated judges, said 
Johnson, an architect of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was something worth trying," Johnson said. "I have no interest 
in making judges unhappy or driving them crazy. The job is already enough." 
</P>
<P>
 When she assigned the preliminary hearings to felony judges, Johnson had no 
idea so much time would be stolen from trial work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juror Wehger said the return of preliminary hearings to Municipal Court is the 
right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said jury service can be a financial drain on citizens -- especially those 
whose employers only pay them for their first five days of service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know when I was working, there were times when I just had to beg off jury 
duty because there was no way I could do it," Wehger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another juror, August Hardy, 59, spent seven weeks hearing an emotionally 
charged child-abuse case that was originally estimated to last four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involved defendant Charlotte Russo, an affluent Westlake mother who 
was accused of forcing her daughter to live in the family's back-yard 
racquetball court. She was convicted of misdemeanor child abuse and pleaded 
guilty to a felony child-abuse count. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy credited Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. with running an 
efficient courtroom, but he still criticized late starting times. Never once 
did the trial begin before 10 a.m., said Hardy, who considers himself an early 
riser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a person who likes to start something late," said Hardy, of Simi 
Valley. "If I'm going to court, I want to go early. I'd like it to be early in 
the morning. Period. That's the way I see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and defense attorneys also criticized the relatively late starting 
times for trials in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It clearly was causing more problems than it was solving," Chief Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Kevin J. McGee said. "It was creating a nightmare for the court, for the 
jurors, for the attorneys, for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said preliminary hearings have no business in felony courts 
on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were delayed in virtually every trial," Deputy Public Defender Bryant 
Villagran said last week. "Since this has been in effect, I have been in court 
at least twice as long each morning. You can't get the attorneys and judges in 
the same courtroom because the attorneys have had to cover their prelims." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most dramatic examples of the system gone awry occurred June 30. In 
that case, a jury trial never started all afternoon, as jurors waited patiently 
in a courthouse hallway for a preliminary hearing to end. 
</P>
<P>
 That jury was scheduled to report to Superior Court Judge Allan Steele's 
courtroom to begin hearing the grand theft case at 1:30 p.m. Steele could not 
start the case in the morning because he was conducting a preliminary hearing 
in a fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing, originally scheduled for two hours, lasted more than 
five. After 3 p.m., the judge -- visibly irritated at the unexpected length of 
the hearing -- finally sent his waiting jury home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was estimated at two hours," he angrily pointed out to the lawyers in 
the fraud hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor McGee said the trial delays could have caused some jurors to lose 
confidence in the local courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the person who is doing the jury duty," he said, "it makes them wonder 
what's going on and why things can't go smoother." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In most other counties, preliminary hearings are generally kept far away from 
judges trying felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento County, for instance, officials reserve two of their 48 
courtrooms specifically for preliminary hearings. And "the system works 
marvelously," said Frank Martinez, acting executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ventura County will reserve one of its 30 courtrooms for the same 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said local court officials are to be 
applauded for looking for ways to improve the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems to me that it was something where they tried to be more 
efficient but the obstacles were too great," he said.

VENTURA URGED TO BUY BANKRUPT RV PARK FOR USE AS NATURE SANCTUARY; ENVIRONMENT: 
SITUATED ON FLOOD PLAIN NEAR THE OCEAN, IT WAS DEVASTATED IN '92 FLOOD. BUT 
COST IS QUESTIONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city of Ventura should consider spending millions of dollars to purchase a 
bankrupt trailer park, the site of disastrous floods in 1992, and convert it 
into a nature sanctuary alongside the Ventura River bed, some City Council 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that owns the Ventura Beach RV Resort, Hubbard Family Corp., filed 
for bankruptcy last January, and Sumitomo Bank of California is in the process 
of taking over the property, said Ventura City Atty. Peter Bulens. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Hubbard, who manages the corporation, declined to comment Saturday on 
the bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreational vehicle park made national headlines in the 1992 floods, 
which destroyed or damaged 40 of the 57 motor homes parked at the site on West 
Main Street and washed one vehicle under the Ventura Freeway and out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster reignited a debate between the park's owners and 
environmentalists over why the park was built on an 18-acre section of river 
bottom and flood plain, nearly skimming the western bank of the Ventura River 
and only a short walk from the ocean shore. 
</P>
<P>
 With the resort facing possible sale, City Council members Gary Tuttle and 
Rosa Lee Measures said this may be the city's best chance to obtain it for 
environmental purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be callous and take advantage of somebody's misfortune," 
Tuttle said. "But this could be a neat opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, however, are unsure how the city would pay for the land. 
Between retiring the debt Hubbard owes and the actual price of the property, 
the price tag could run above $5 million, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said perhaps the Coastal Conservancy, a state agency charged with 
restoring and enhancing natural resources, could contribute funds to help the 
city purchase the land and add it to the larger Ventura River Estuary 
rehabilitation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, the conservancy and the state parks department will spend about 
$750,000 over the next few years to restore the river's primary mouth to its 
original condition.  
</P>
<P>
 Measures said she would like to relocate the RV park, though she is not sure 
where it could go. "It would make a lot of sense to have that land as an 
estuary," she said of the resort's current property. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Gregory L. Carson said the city, which may also commit large 
sums to two proposed projects, a marine center and a county minor league 
baseball franchise, may not have the money left to buy the resort. "I guess we 
kind of have our resources tied up in other places," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Jim Monahan and Jack Tingstrom said they would like to see another 
private operator purchase the park from the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the tax revenue we're getting from it," Tingstrom said. "The business 
was approved by the city, and it should stay in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett and Mayor Tom Buford could not be reached for 
comment.

GROWTH DRIVING PUSH FOR MORE LINKS IN COUNTY; RECREATION: WHILE MIGRATION IS 
HELPING FUEL DEMAND FOR GOLF COURSES, PRIVATE CLUBS ARE FINDING TIMES TOUGHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Call it golf mania. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, there are seven public and private golf courses in eastern 
Ventura County. And there are plans for more -- 11 more, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf experts say there is plenty of room for growth, citing the area's close 
proximity to Los Angeles County, its comfortably cool climate and the high 
median income -- about $45,000 -- of homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Population shifts are also driving the demand for more courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the stream of migration continues west into Ventura County, the need for 
more courses becomes evident," concluded a 1992 study commissioned by the 
county. "This condition of growing golf demand is expected to continue for the 
next 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rubenstein, executive director of the Thousand Oaks Chamber of Commerce, 
said he is not surprised at the large number of courses being proposed for 
eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Southern California are suddenly discovering Ventura County as a 
very safe environment," he said. "And golf is a sport that seems to keep 
growing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rubenstein said he welcomes the addition of new courses in the region because 
of the economic benefits they would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very beneficial," he said. "They bring a certain type of person, at a 
certain socioeconomic level, into the area." 
</P>
<P>
 He credited the area's existing golf courses with helping local businesses 
while promoting the county as a great place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people come out they always stop at a restaurant either coming or 
going," he said. "They also discover the area and they will do a lot of 
promoting for us by telling people, 'I was in a real nice, safe and secure 
area.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not all is well on the fairways, however. 
</P>
<P>
 While the three public courses in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks accounted for 
more than 250,000 rounds of golf shot last year, private clubs in the same 
cities have been forced to slash their membership fees by half or more to 
attract new patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 And the future of the Wood Ranch Golf Club remains in limbo since its owner 
defaulted on a $15-million loan in 1992. The club, which has been taken over by 
Wells Fargo Bank, has stopped selling its $25,000 memberships until it can find 
a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The private side of the market has totally collapsed," said Blake Boyle, 
manager of the county Department of Recreation Services, which owns two public 
courses. "There's not a lot of people with $40,000 in their pocket to play 
golf." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more of the "golfing elite" are now teeing off on public courses, 
where a round of golf can run as little as $12. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the public courses are seeing more of the guy who was at the private 
club, but who is now having to cut back," said Robert Meyer, director of Los 
Robles Golf Course in Thousand Oaks. "If you were a private club member, you 
may have been paying $500-a-month dues. But you may also be out trying to find 
a job." 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Robles has always been busy, Meyer said. Situated along the Ventura 
Freeway, the 18-hole championship course averages more than 100,000 rounds a 
year. In 1991-92, nearly 115,000 rounds were shot there, making it one of the 
top 10 busiest public courses in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 To help control overcrowding, the city this year implemented a new fee 
structure and scheduling system to give more priority to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Local players were issued golf cards that entitle them to a $3 discount during 
the week, and $5 on weekends. Residents are also allowed to make reservations 
eight days in advance, as opposed to seven for non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's still very hard to get on the course," Meyer said, noting that there 
are 4,500 local card holders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Business is also good at two public courses in neighboring Simi Valley. Simi 
Hills averages about a 100,000 rounds a year, and Sinaloa Golf Course, a 
nine-hole facility, more than 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do 70,000 rounds a year, you're busy," Meyer said. "All these public 
courses are doing plenty of play and could do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Revyrand, manager of Simi Hills, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great demand for golf out here," Revyrand said. "I can see that 
just by how busy we are. I think there are enough golfers out here to support 
another course or two." 
</P>
<P>
 But exactly how many new golf courses -- whether public or private -- the 
region can support remains in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are plans for two new golf courses in Simi Valley that would 
be built as part of an exclusive community for seniors at the foot of Whiteface 
Mountain. One of the courses would be private and the other semiprivate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, there is a proposal to develop an 18-hole public course 
either at Hill Canyon in the Santa Rosa Valley or Broome Ranch at the 
southwestern edge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of both sites, however, have come out strongly against the proposals 
because of environmental and traffic problems that could result from the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials defend the need for another course, which they say would 
have little impact on the environment while at the same time generate 
additional revenue to acquire and maintain more open space. They say a second 
public course is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear from golfers in the city all the time who want to know when we're 
going to get another golf course," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "They don't 
want to hear that we're working on it. They want to hear that we're going to 
break ground." 
</P>
<P>
 At the far eastern end of the county on the Ahmanson Ranch, two courses, 
including one public facility and one PGA tournament course, are also planned 
as part of a massive housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Moorpark, which has no golf courses, there are proposals for six 
courses on the table -- four of them tied to housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 William Sherman, a San Rafael consultant who conducted the 1992 golf course 
study for the county, said it is doubtful that all of the courses being 
proposed will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, there's too many," Sherman said. "There's too much that would 
have to happen for them to all be built, especially if they are part of a 
residential development. . . . It's not as easy to get a golf course built as 
it was 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the potential for several new links is good, Sherman said. Currently, 
Ventura County has 21 golf courses, including 12 public facilities. Sherman's 
1992 study found that the region could absorb as many as seven additional 
public courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County ranks very well" in terms of growth because of its location, 
size and affluence, Sherman said. "It has a lot of potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Some developers, however, are proceeding cautiously with their plans. The 
Messenger Co., which initially proposed to build two golf courses as part of a 
3,200-dwelling project in Moorpark, so far has applied to build only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some questions as to whether a second course is viable with all the 
other courses being talked about," said Gary Austin, vice president of 
Messenger. He said a state park agency has expressed interest in buying a 
portion of the land where the second course would be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Bollinger Construction Inc., a Westlake Village developer, could be the first 
to build new courses in Moorpark. The company has proposed to build two public 
links, including one that would be turned over to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Aguilera, director of community development, said the city is in the 
process of hiring a consultant to conduct a feasibility study of the two 
proposed courses, which could be operating within two years. He said the study 
would also include information on other links proposed in and around Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of our minds, we're concerned with who goes on-line first," 
Aguilera said. "We want to know how many courses are being proposed (in the 
area) and how close they are to fruition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, developer Ralph Mahan proposed to build two 18-hole public courses 
on part of Happy Camp Regional Park just north of Moorpark. If built, county 
officials estimate the project could generate about $250,000 per year for the 
county Department of Recreation Services. 
</P>
<P>
 County and city officials agree that municipal golf courses can be good 
moneymakers. This year Simi Hills is expected to generate nearly $140,000 in 
net revenue, and Los Robles between $400,000 and $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle said the county receives about $400,000 annually from leasing land for 
Soule Park Golf Course in Ojai and about $100,000 from Saticoy Regional Park 
Golf Course in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Simi Hills and Los Robles, the two county courses are run by private 
firms. Boyle said private firms tend to provide better management and upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of our courses operated at a loss when they were run by the county," he 
said. "That goes to show you what private firms can do with public courses. 
It's not so much that there is an increase in play, but that they are more 
efficiently run." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle said the county is looking at developing another public course. He said 
the Department of Recreation Services wants to contract with a private firm to 
build and operate a new course at Camarillo Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 While all agree on the demand for new golf courses, Boyle said the courses 
developed at the earliest possible date will have the best chance of economic 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of who builds first," he said. "There may be 20 or 30 courses 
in the talking stage, but the market will determine how many actually get 
built." East County Golf Courses 
</P>
<P>
 There are currently 17 golf courses in eastern Ventura County, with proposals 
for 11 more.

HARBOR SITE REELING THEM IN -- FINALLY; RETAIL: VILLAGE CENTER MERCHANTS CREDIT 
NEW OFFICIALS WITH LURING CROWDS AFTER YEARS OF MANAGEMENT TROUBLES AND 
DWINDLING SALES.

<P>
 The Trevetts had such a blast visiting Ventura Harbor two weeks ago that last 
week they returned to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom, Dad, twin pre-teen daughters and grandmother, visiting from Houston, all 
crammed into the family car and scurried right out of broiling Lancaster, 
heading straight for the sprawling Ventura Harbor Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was packed the last time we were here," explained father Jamey Trevett, 
36, slurping a scoop of ice cream nestled in a waffle cone. "There were people 
flying kites, people in powerboats. That's why we came back. There were things 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahh -- music to the merchants' ears. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of dwindling sales and slow foot traffic, the community of 
specialty shops and seafood restaurants along Ventura's lone harbor has 
suddenly latched onto a spark of vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Every weekend this summer, Harbor Village has been jammed with hundreds of 
tourists and locals dining at the eateries, shopping at the boutiques and 
renting the paddle boats that once lay idle on the docks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants would point to the economy, which they say is finally picking 
up after the devastating recession that left hardly anybody with pocket cash to 
blow at the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But many would also credit the new manager, Oscar Pena, and his marketing 
director, Judie Amendola. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost since Harbor Village opened for business 11 years ago, merchants have 
grumbled that management ignores their needs and fails to market the shopping 
center effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pena, hired by the Ventura Port District two years ago to be a buffer 
between the government agency and shopkeepers, really listens to the tenants, 
local merchants say. And Amendola, who came on board last October, organizes 
small, colorful events every weekend that attract droves of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest entrance to summer I've ever seen," said Patrick Ryan, 
the manager of Village Kite and Toy Store. "Every weekend is perfect."  
</P>
<P>
 Today, for example, is the second day of a pirate festival Amendola organized 
for the village, arranging for an old-fashioned ship to sail back and forth 
just off the shore. Themed food and drink booths crowd the lawn, and swarthy 
actors sporting three-cornered hats and eye patches strut about the walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hit so far this season, Amendola and shopkeepers agree, was the 
Children's Festival the last weekend in June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It drew hundreds of families here to see the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, 
and then the families stayed all day," Amendola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena explained the key to his marketing director's success. "Judie now has 
entertainment spread out in different parts of the village, so it forces people 
to mingle around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The retail hub of Ventura Harbor, the village is owned and operated by the 
Ventura Port District. But it wasn't supposed to be that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Services Corp., a private development company, offered nearly 15 years 
ago to build a Mediterranean-style shopping center and aquarium at the end of 
Ventura's Spinnaker Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The company broke ground on the project in 1981, financing the construction 
with money generated by selling bonds in the port district's name -- bonds that 
held the district liable in case of default by Ocean Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Ocean Services filed a lawsuit accusing the port district of 
violating its lease by failing to dredge the harbor, raising the rent and 
blocking its development plans with other landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, $5 million in debt, Ocean Services filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks soon foreclosed on the loans that built the village -- indeed, until the 
port district took over as sole owner a year ago, Great Western Bank owned half 
the buildings in the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the port district itself, having lost the lawsuit against Ocean 
Services, filed for bankruptcy in the face of a $15.6-million debt it could not 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, merchants were left with more questions than answers. Where 
was the aquarium and all the tourist attractions Ocean Services promised them 
when they signed their leases? Why were their rents so high? 
</P>
<P>
 Where were the freeway and street signs, directing people to their 
out-of-the-way center? What about some more marketing or some better 
advertising? 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the lack of progress, merchants filed suit against the port 
district and other entities for failing to finish what Ocean Services started. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, with operating costs scaled down significantly since the port 
district and the bank stopped duplicating maintenance and security expenses, 
with a promising marketing strategy beginning to show results, many store 
owners are still grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The port district is always going to be the way it is," said Steve Gates, the 
owner of the Spinnaker Seafood Broiler, which opened at the village eight years 
ago. "It's a government entity." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Gates would like to pay less rent and get more directional signs 
out on the roadways. He would also like to have more contact with Richard 
Parsons, the district's general manager, to tell him what's really on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parsons said he prefers to leave day-to-day management of Harbor Village 
to Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we hired Mr. Pena for," said Parsons, adding he visits the Harbor 
Village nearly every day to meet with Pena and discuss developments at the 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Many village merchants say that Pena is quick to consider their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's here almost every day," said James Smith, owner of Ventura Dive and 
Sport. "He has his finger on the pulse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pena acknowledged that when he took over management of the village two years 
ago, the shopkeepers' morale was in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the first people to sit down with the tenants and resolve some of 
their problems," he said. "Really, much of it was just listening to them." 
</P>
<P>
 On the tenants' advice, Pena recalculated some rents and lowered upkeep 
expenses all around by searching out the best bargains for all the services. 
This year, again trying to respond to the tenants, Pena and Amendola are 
sketching out a new logo for the village and working to get the long-awaited 
signs displayed on nearby streets and the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said it may be impossible to win over every shopkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, in a popularity contest, the landlord loses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even longtime Harbor Village critics like Gates, who has done his share of 
griping against the port district, are gradually converting to optimism.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Pena) is a great guy and he does a great job," Gates said. "It's going to 
turn around, slowly but surely."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MAN INJURED IN CRASH OF PLANE AT AIRPORT

<P>
 A man flying an experimental single-engine plane crashed Saturday shortly 
after takeoff from Camarillo Airport and was hospitalized with minor injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's engine started sputtering when the aircraft was about 200 feet off 
the ground, said Capt. Tom Kruschke of the airport fire station.Then the plane 
suddenly dropped, landing hard on its left wing in an agricultural field 
between the runway and an airplane taxi strip, Kruschke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Michael Thomas, 38, suffered cuts and possible broken ribs in the 
accident, which occurred about 5 p.m. Authorities said they did not know where 
Thomas was from, but that he was not a local resident. 
</P>
<P>
 He was listed in stable condition at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; UNHEALTHFUL SMOG LEVELS ARE REACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smog levels in Simi Valley and Moorpark soared into the unhealthful range 
Saturday, prompting the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District to issue 
a health advisory warning residents to curtail outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
 A health advisory was not expected for today, but smog levels were predicted 
to remain high, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county issues health advisories when ozone levels exceed 138 on the 
pollution standard index. Saturday, ozone levels in the Simi Valley and 
Moorpark areas reached a high of 146 on the index, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The forecast will be in the unhealthful range unless conditions change," said 
Gary Arcemont, an air pollution meteorologist for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's increased smog levels resulted from a shift in wind direction, when 
sea breezes from the west were replaced with winds blowing east from the San 
Fernando Valley, Arcemont said. 
</P>
<P>
 All Simi Valley and Moorpark residents, including healthy adults and children, 
were warned not to partake in vigorous exercise or outdoor activities that 
would greatly increase their breathing rate. Activities such as jogging, 
soccer, calisthenics and competitive swimming were discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercising when pollution levels are high can lead to headaches, burning eyes, 
difficulty in breathing, or more serious consequences in the elderly or those 
who suffer from chronic respiratory problems, officials warned. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: NEIGHBOR SAVES WOMAN FROM BURNING HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An 81-year-old Simi Valley woman was rescued from her burning house by a 
neighbor during a fire Saturday that nearly destroyed the small home, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured woman, Mary Snider, was the only person home when the blaze broke 
out at 11:40 a.m., authorities said.She suffered smoke inhalation and was 
admitted to Simi Valley Hospital for observation, authorities said. She was in 
fair condition late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Fire Department officials believe the fire was ignited by a 
cigarette left smoldering on a couch. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor observed smoke pouring from the small house in the 900 block of 
Vallejo Avenue and alerted firefighters, authorities said. The male neighbor 
who rescued Snider, whose identity was not available late Saturday, coaxed the 
woman out of the smoke-filled house, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was roaring," Snider said in a brief interview late Saturday. "This man 
next door came over and got me. I was crying because I wanted to go back in." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities credited the unnamed neighbor with saving Snider's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had not done this, it definitely would have been a fatality," a Fire 
Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze caused about $30,000 worth of damage, mostly to the contents of the 
house, firefighters said. The woman's roommate was not home at the time of the 
fire, authorities said. TRACY WILSON

 An 80-year-old Ventura woman was killed in a head-on collision on California 
118 near Grimes Canyon Road early Saturday morning when her car crossed over 
the double yellow line and struck a tractor-trailer, the California Highway 
Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnie Jones died instantly when her car crashed into the truck, Deputy 
Coroner Dale Zentzis said.CHP officials did not know what caused Jones' car to 
swerve into oncoming traffic at about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the tractor-trailer, Scott Garrett, 35, of Hemet, was not 
injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Both lanes of the freeway were closed for about three hours while crews 
cleaned up an oil leak from the tractor-trailer. The spill spread about 50 feet 
and was six feet wide, CHP officials said. TRACY WILSON

THE GROWING PROBLEM OF GUNS AND VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Ron Yorke writes (Letters, July 3) that fewer than 1% of all guns are ever 
used in crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Every hard-core gang member has an arsenal that would rival a small army.There 
are tens of thousands of gang members in the L.A. area. 
</P>
<P>
 How do they get the weapons? The federal government issues a gun retailing 
license to anybody that sends $10. So many people sell guns on the street that 
a 12-year-old can buy a gun as easily as a Popsicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The more criminals that have guns, the more law-abiding citizens feel they 
must have them. The gun business rakes in big bucks, and the gun lobby can 
finance more "persuasion" for elected officials to water down legislation to 
deny easy access of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor is naked, and I'm getting tired of gun battles in my neighborhood.

O.J. SIMPSON SAGA IS NOT FAR-FETCHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Michael Connelly (Valley Commentary, June 26) must not have been a very busy 
crime reporter if he found it far-fetched that a man with a violent history of 
beating, harassing and terrorizing women was accused of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no surprise if O.J. Simpson did commit these murders. In fact, it 
would make for a very predictable movie.

WHO ARE THE HOMELESS? PEOPLE WITH FACES, FEELINGS AND FUTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who are the homeless? Well, it can be pretty easy, these days, to be fed up 
with the subject. Perhaps it also seems as though the problem cannot be 
escaped. Not only do you have to endure that long commute home, there's someone 
at the freeway entrance, begging for money. Perhaps you barely notice their 
faces. Perhaps you resent the intrusion. Perhaps you just don't need someone 
else making you feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Panhandlers can seem to be everywhere: near the automated bank teller, outside 
the convenience store, stationed between the parking lot and your favorite 
restaurant. It's easy to look the other way and assume that the few coins you 
offer would surely go toward drugs or alcohol. It's easy to be disdainful. As 
one comedian put it: "They keep asking me for spare change. Why don't they find 
a spare job?" 
</P>
<P>
 We ought to know by now that the homeless are often hard cases that defy such 
simple rationalizations. According to a seminal work by the Washington, 
D.C.-based Urban Institute, about 20% of the homeless -- nationwide -- have 
been mental hospital patients at least once in their lives. As many as 
one-third suffer from schizophrenia or manic-depressive psychosis. One in five 
have attempted suicide, and nearly half have suffered from depression serious 
enough to require immediate clinical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 35% of the single homeless adults, according to the institute, have 
reported some inpatient treatment for chemical dependency, usually alcoholism. 
At least one-fourth of the homeless are families, most headed by single women. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the people who are now homeless shared their most recent housing 
with someone else. Only 13% said they were formally evicted. About 5% left 
condemned buildings. Nearly one-fourth said they were thrown out or could not 
get along with those they lived with. More than 60% cited other reasons: drug 
addiction, a lost job, leaving town to look for work and finding none, leaving 
to enter a treatment program, jail or prison, or leaving or escaping a 
relationship with the person who had paid the mortgage or the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 6% of the homeless held steady work. One-fourth of them had earned cash 
during the most recent month from working at odd jobs. The median monthly 
income for single adults was $64. For families with an average of three 
members, their median income was $300 a month. Half of that came from various 
forms of public assistance. About 25% of that money came from working. 
</P>
<P>
 These are national figures but the numbers still help put a face on the San 
Fernando Valley's homeless. A more personal look is even better. It is 
important to note that most of the Valley's homeless were born here, went to 
school here, and held down jobs and active lives. Recent stories by Times 
reporters Susan Byrnes, Jeannette Regalado, Eric Slater, Jeff Schnaufer and 
Kurt Pitzer tell us even more. They might even soften your heart on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Marlene Dallugge of Canoga Park, for example. On one of this homeless 
woman's recent treks on the street, in search of collectibles, she found a 
$25,000 check. So what if no one would have mistaken her for Henry Spitzer, 
president of Topco, Inc. (It was his check.) Who cares that the payment on the 
check was stopped on the day that it was lost, making it worthless. Dallugge, 
who has lived in her car since the Northridge quake, only wanted to return it 
to its rightful owner. She did. 
</P>
<P>
 For Steve Coughlin, another of the Valley's homeless and a regular at the 
Sherman Way off-ramp of the San Diego Freeway, the money he receives each day 
is the difference between another night on the street or the safer surroundings 
of a cheap Sepulveda Boulevard hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Scott of North Hollywood gave up the best job that she had ever had, 
her home, her savings and her possessions in the effort to raise her two 
grandchildren after her daughter failed to provide for them. She was homeless 
until a shelter known as the Women's Care Cottage in Van Nuys helped her regain 
her stability, and her independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Such stories help counter the image of the homeless as irreparably damaged, 
indolent and dishonest. And a related story points up our short-sighted 
hypocrisy on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another community in Van Nuys that had long ago soured on the common 
sight of panhandlers and vagrants. So what happened when a proposal surfaced 
for a 150-bed shelter that would have removed some of those folks from the 
streets? It was so stridently opposed by residents that the idea was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 At such times, its important to remember folks like Samantha Scott. Without 
the brief respite of shelter, she might still be a homeless grandmother, 
struggling to raise two children and facing long odds.

THE FEATHER TRAIL; SACRAMENTO CRIES FOWL AFTER QUAKE BOND MEASURE FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you San Fernando Valley residents have heard more than a few clucking 
noises lately, or have noticed the nearby settling of piles of a particularly 
non-aerodynamic form of feathers, we have reassuring news. Relax. You're not 
losing your mind. It's just those chickens coming home to roost from Sacramento 
after the Northridge quake. They don't fly, so it's taken this long for them to 
arrive. To explain, a chronology is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature had a sound way with which to raise state 
funds for earthquake recovery. As had been done for San Francisco after the 
Loma Prieta quake, a temporary tax increase could have been enacted. It could 
have taken the form of a quarter-cent boost in the sales tax, and/or a 
temporary rise in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
 That pay-as-you-go method would have been eminently efficient and fiscally 
sound. It would have served California well in providing its 10% share of the 
cost of repairing or rebuilding schools and other public buildings, utilities 
and roads damaged in the temblor, and in providing its 25% share of the costs 
of upgrading public buildings in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. The 
federal government is providing the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson and the Legislature cut a wide berth around the temporary tax idea, 
relying instead (and without a Plan B to fall back on) a much less fiscally 
sound and more expensive bond issue called Proposition 1A. You could rightly 
ask how reasonable it was to expect folks in the far reaches of this huge state 
to vote in favor of such a thing. (They didn't. It failed.) You could also 
question the mathematics, as perhaps the voters did: That $2-billion bond issue 
was going to cost taxpayers as much as $3.6 billion over the 25-year life of 
the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the fallout, or the chicken feathers, if you will, are landing all over 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels was already confiding to 
people in January that insufficient revenues were going to send the state's 
transportation program "off the cliff" in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the failure of Proposition 1A "shoved the program over the precipice and 
into a free fall about six months sooner than expected," according to Arthur 
Bauer, executive director of Californians for Better Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 We are referring, among other things, to the most recent estimate of the 
number of highway overpasses around the state that will have to be retrofitted 
to withstand the next major earthquake. The cost is currently believed to be 
$1.05 billion. Sixty-one of those bridges are on the Golden State Freeway, and 
another 20 are on the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson has now said that such retrofitting will get first priority on the 
already scarce transportation funds. Well, that's not exactly reassuring. Even 
on an accelerated basis, the retrofitting isn't expected to be complete before 
1997, and other road and rail projects will have to be delayed to make way. 
</P>
<P>
 What types of things figure to get delayed? Oh, just the kinds of projects 
we've been touting as necessary for the creation of a regional transportation 
system that is less vulnerable to natural disasters, the kinds of projects that 
are more environmentally sound and more oriented toward mass transit, the kinds 
of projects that will make life easier on commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 In our region, for example, one project that might get delayed is the widening 
of a 36-mile stretch of the Antelope Valley Freeway from the Golden State 
Freeway in Santa Clarita to the Avenue P-8 overpass in Palmdale. Even funding 
for the planned east-west San Fernando Valley rail line could be postponed, 
especially since no decision has been made on where that line is going, and in 
what form. Estimates of the delays range from one year (very conservative) to 
much, much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 When it finally comes to the hard choices of what must be put on the back 
burner in terms of funding, just remember that trail of chicken feathers. It 
leads back to Sacramento, and the failure to enact the minor tweak of a 
temporary increase in the sales tax or gasoline tax.

NEEDS DICTATE HOW MUCH WAS ALLOCATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The board of directors of United Way of Greater Los Angeles has approved the 
distribution of $46 million to support health and human services in the 
community in 1994-95, including $29.3 million to United Way agencies and 
organizations. An important point that was left out of Doug Smith's recent 
article ("United Way Cuts Grants," June 26) is that this is the same amount 
distributed in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Our 400 community volunteers who participated in United Way's fund allocations 
process were committed to directing the available dollars to programs that 
address the most pressing issues in local communities. Their decisions were 
based on the findings of local needs studies conducted by United Way's six 
regional operations in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the multi-regional agencies that received funding cuts from the United 
Way North Angeles region received increases in funding from other United Way 
regions. The North Angeles region endeavored to support the current member 
agencies and at the same time provide flexibility to respond to emerging needs. 
All local United Way regional offices have discretionary funds available to 
make periodic grants throughout the year to agencies serving the priority needs 
of specific local target populations. Some of these discretionary funds will be 
used to make emergency grants for unforeseen calamities and technical 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Above and beyond the funds that were distributed to agencies through the 
regular allocations process, United Way contributed to agencies providing 
services to victims of the Jan. 17 earthquake. Since the earthquake was 
centered in the service area of United Way's North Angeles region, a high 
percentage of these funds were allocated to agencies serving the Santa Clarita 
and San Fernando valleys. Additionally, we work diligently with the American 
Red Cross and other organizations to encourage philanthropic giving and to 
build an awareness of available services. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer was correct in pointing out that in times of expanding needs and 
fewer dollars available to support agencies providing such vital community 
services, United Way volunteers have had to make some difficult funding 
decisions. These volunteers and the regional staff that support them should be 
commended for their leadership and dedication to expanding caring and 
compassion in the greater Los Angeles community.

TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY

 * Three cheers for Rich Sybert (Valley Commentary, June 26.) 
</P>
<P>
 His analysis of the overwhelming cost of caring for illegal immigrants is 
right on the nose, especially the cost of illegitimate births among illegals 
and the cost of bilingual education of the offspring of illegals. The illegals 
have destroyed the social safety nets that have existed for legal Americans.

3 CHEERS FOR UPLIFTING STORY OF L.A. PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I just wanted to let The Times staff know how nice the feature was on the 
family of firefighters ("Firefighter Tradition Spans Three Generations," July 
3).Very rarely do you see a whole page devoted to a group of people who take 
pride in what they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters are a special breed. They risk their lives for strangers and 
protect the city they call home. I think that's a great example of L.A. pride.

ASSIGNMENT FOR PARENTS IS TO FIND BEST TEACHER; BY SELECTING THE PEOPLE WHO 
WILL INSTRUCT THEIR YOUNGSTERS, ADULTS CAN HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THEIR 
EDUCATION THAN BY SELECTING WHICH SCHOOL THEY WILL ATTEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE MACK, Adrienne Mack of Shadow Hills teaches high school English in 
the Los Angeles public schools. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new law gives California parents the right to choose their children's 
schools, putting us among an increasing number of open-enrollment states. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to raise educational quality by creating competition among 
schools. It's the same theory that was behind last year's unsuccessful school 
voucher proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school district officials told me the new program didn't generate 
as much interest as they had anticipated. Most parents opted to remain close to 
home -- probably because the bill doesn't provide for transportation, possibly 
because they are happy with their neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, not all the L.A. schools had openings, and of those that did, some, 
like Welby Way Elementary, had more applicants than space. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents shouldn't feel guilty if they have decided not to send their kids over 
the hill or across the Valley, and they shouldn't feel too disheartened if they 
tried to switch to a popular school but couldn't. The best educational 
opportunity might just be at their neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, education happens in the classroom. Every school can boast of some 
great teachers. Even the schools with the best reputations have some poor 
instructors. Selecting children's teachers can have a greater impact on their 
education than selecting the school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I spoke with several local school districts about this, and none actually has 
a policy limiting the parents' right to select their children's teachers. They 
leave it to the principal, and I've never met a principal who wouldn't go out 
of his or her way to please a parent. So if you want your kids to receive the 
best education available, find the best teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you go about it? Typically, kids and teachers are assigned to one 
another in Los Angeles schools. Pupils can request specific teachers, but 
whether the request is honored depends on the counselor and whatever rules the 
principal may have laid down. It would be best to pick teachers the year before 
your child is in their classes, but you may have to wait until September when 
the semester has started. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange to meet with the teacher at a time convenient to both of you -- then 
be prompt. Teachers' days are ruled by the school bell, which waits for no one. 
</P>
<P>
 As a parent, you have a right to know about the teacher's college degree, 
teaching credential and experience. But don't arbitrarily rule out 
inexperienced teachers who might make up in creativity and enthusiasm what they 
lack in experience. Some of the teachers with the most years in the classroom 
are among the most burned-out, the least willing to adapt to the newer school 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretend you are conducting a job interview -- in a way you are. Is the teacher 
happy about being a teacher? What's the best part about teaching? The worst? 
Listen to the response. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the teacher do to stay abreast of new developments in education? 
Read professional journals? Take courses? Attend conventions? Is the teacher 
interested in education reform? 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about the subjects the class will cover, but keep in mind that the 
specific material may be less important than the methods employed. "Take the 
professor, not the course," wise college students tell one another. What's 
important -- learning facts or exploring ideas? Giving the expected response to 
a piece of literature or developing an individual viewpoint? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ask about discipline, homework, how absences and tardiness affect the class 
work and the grade. Try to ferret out whether the teacher has any 
predispositions which might favorably or unfavorably affect your child. Perhaps 
the teacher loves children who can enter a room without making a sound. Maybe 
creative children a little out of the mainstream are valued most. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, ask yourself if this is someone your child would want to spend 
time with every day and then ask yourself why. A lot will depend upon how well 
you know your child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of choice, how about choice for teachers? I'd willingly put in even 
more unpaid overtime than I do now if I could handpick my students. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't necessarily seek out the brightest kids. I value students who want 
to learn, who make a commitment to attend school daily and who try their best. 
I would look for parents who understand that teachers can't do it alone but 
need support from home. 
</P>
<P>
 As a parent, you will have to push the system a bit, but you may be surprised 
at how much teachers welcome your involvement and how much it will help your 
child learn. When kids come to school prepared and go home to an environment 
that values education, great things can happen.

INDUSTRY DRAWS ON AREA'S TALENT; THE GROWTH OF INTERACTIVE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY 
HAS CREATED DEMAND FOR ARTISTS WHO CAN PRODUCE SOFTWARE THAT IS BOTH 
ENTERTAINING AND EDUCATIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KALHENBERG, Richard Kahlenberg of North Hollywood writes regularly 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently in Burbank I visited an artist in his studio, 1990s style. Jim 
Bumgardner motioned me to a chair where I could look over his shoulder at the 
computer monitor on his workbench. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is now the hot spot in the home computer industry, 
especially Universal City, La Crescenta and Burbank. Bumgardner is in the 
middle of the action, creating sophisticated computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 Games, for want of a fancier word, are where it's at. While infopundits 
rhapsodize about an infosociety that is hungry for information, it's well to 
remember that, for the present, 90% of the software sold is still -- games. And 
things that feel like games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumgardner, who was trained as a composer, is taking matters to a higher 
level, and he has won awards as a sort of producer-director of CD-ROMs. His 
compact disk work includes "Desert Storm" (the player re-fights the Gulf War), 
"The View From Earth" (explores the solar system) and "How Computers Work" 
(learns just that -- it's the best such disk on the market). While he switched 
on his various Macintosh machines, I saw that the walls of his windowless 
cubicle on Olive Avenue were decorated with Idaho stuff: postcards, posters, 
windup plastic potatoes. It's an inside joke, he explained. Idaho is the 
nickname of a computer programming system he has created for his employer, Time 
Warner Interactive. 
</P>
<P>
 From a source I couldn't see came a pleasant piano solo. Then, on the monitor, 
various elegant, richly colored moving patterns and letters appeared, matching 
the notes I was hearing. A delightful effect. Glenn Gould? I decided I wouldn't 
mind a very big dose of this electronic son et lumiere and even began to 
fantasize that I was learning to read music as I watched the synchronized 
letters on the screen. It looked like "Fantasia." 
</P>
<P>
 What I didn't notice was that Bumgardner had reached out of my line of sight, 
and he was playing the music. The computer was turning notes, their duration 
and volume into images. He seemed to be having as much fun as his guest. "I'm 
incredibly lucky to have this job," he said. "I'm paid to play, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Bumgardner ventured a theory of why the flow that used to carry the creative 
types north from Burbank to San Jose Airport now runs in the reverse direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming here for that human-generated element," he said. "The amount 
of that in PacMan wouldn't fill a teaspoon. But you need gallons of it" for the 
new interactive medium. 
</P>
<P>
 His professional development is a compact version of what's happening 
industrywide. As a music major at Cal Arts in Valencia, Class of 1984, he had, 
as one might expect, an anti-technology streak. Then "a class in counterpoint 
got me going to K mart to get a computer. Why should I do all that 
time-consuming stuff when I could write a program to do that?" he recalled. A 
computer can do counterpoint, but it's not very good beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 On a computer, "I could get 98% of a Gregorian chant and emulate the style of 
Palestrina," Bumgardner said, "but only 20% of anything like Bach and 10% of 
the quality of Mozart. Musically, we've evolved. Jazz is much more complex than 
Palestrina. There's no set of instructions for jazz. I tried to pile up the 
instructions. I obsessed for 36 hours straight. Someone's just got to play 
jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a neat explanation of why filmland, with its artistic types, is rising 
to the top in computerized software. What you see on the screen is what the 
artists dared to think. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumgardner said he has created entertainment programs that computer users 
enjoy because his games let players feel they're controlling their destinies. 
"They want to get to a point where they cease to be controlled by the program 
and become the author." 
</P>
<P>
 The new challenge Bumgardner has recently taken on is to "provide ease of use 
and ease of learning so that you can ignore the specific content -- which might 
be educational -- and parents can send their kids electronically to France, in 
French because they learn as they go, or Mathland, where fun is math." 
</P>
<P>
 Bumgardner used the e-word, educational, which isn't seen much on disk 
packages -- it scares off sales. But it's concealed in a lot of what's going 
on. In best-selling "Math Blaster," children ages 6 to 12 have to learn 
fractions to save earth from the Trash Alien. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg's business foray into educational software in Knowledge 
Adventure of La Crescenta shows that the muse has been firmly enrolled on the 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumgardner's personal plans for the future changes from day to day. Right now 
he's interested in simulating human flight, like Superman's. "I'd like to make 
a place where people could go to fly together with their friends and it 
wouldn't seem like they were using a computer," he said.

CONTINUED POST-DISASTER FEDERAL AID IS A BAD IDEA; PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT 
WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF RELIEF AVAILABLE WOULD ALSO REDUCE HOMEOWNERS' 
INITIATIVE TO SAVE AND TO INSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SVORNY , Shirley Svorny is a professor of economics at Cal State 
Northridge and a research associate at the Milken Institute for Job & Capital 
Formation in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few have questioned the role of the federal government in providing disaster 
assistance to homeowners in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. A common 
theme in discussions about assistance from Washington is that there is not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the available aid is substantial. Homeowners with losses benefit from 
federal tax relief; they may write off non-reimbursed casualty losses greater 
than 10% of their adjusted gross incomes. They also receive benefits from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster housing assistance program and 
are eligible for low-interest loans offered by the Small Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that this relief is not sufficient, California politicians are 
rallying behind proposed legislation to eliminate the 10% floor in 
presidentially declared disaster areas. The bill, proposed by Sen. Barbara 
Boxer (D-Calif.) and Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), is widely supported 
by California Democrats and has considerable Republican support as well. Both 
major-party candidates for Congress in the West Valley's 24th District support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 In my view, such subsidies to homeowners are undesirable. I am concerned that 
public disaster relief reduces homeowners' initiative to save and to insure 
against disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals who live on flood plains, along the beach, in fire-prone 
neighborhoods and in seismically active areas have elected to face unusual 
risks. Normally, the purchase of private insurance forces them to confront the 
inherent dangers. When government disaster relief is available, people will 
build with diminished regard to the damage potential and may not take 
reasonable measures to reduce risk. 
</P>
<P>
 When I question government disaster relief, I am commonly told, "We pay 
taxes!" What many people fail to realize is that government "insurance" is 
costly. Incentives that encourage efficiency in the private sector are absent 
in the public sector. Insulated from competition and managing someone else's 
money, government employees lack the incentives that motivate private sector 
efficiency in providing services. And government insurance isn't equitable. 
When the government acts as a universal insurer, everyone pays premiums in the 
form of higher taxes, even those who have chosen not to live in high-risk areas 
or have purchased private insurance. As things stand now, an uninsured family 
that has a $100,000 earthquake loss -- given the current tax deductibility of 
casualty losses and depending on its tax bracket -- may reduce its combined 
state and federal tax liability by more than $30,000. Congress' Joint Committee 
on Taxation estimates that the tax deductibility of uninsured casualty and 
theft losses reduces federal revenue by an average of $500 million a year. If 
the 10% floor is eliminated, the cost is expected to increase by more than $20 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses are also covered by FEMA's disaster housing assistance program, which 
issues checks in amounts up to $12,000 to cover uninsured quake-related losses. 
These checks are distributed without regard to income. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, all or part of repairs related to uninsured losses may be financed 
with subsidized low-interest loans from the SBA. For the $100,000 loss, this 
amounts to a subsidy of several thousand dollars a year for the length of the 
loan, depending on the interest. Because these programs exist, it is not 
surprising that many homeowners choose not to insure their homes, choose large 
deductibles when they do buy insurance and fail to set aside savings that would 
help them cover their uninsured losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A pessimistic assessment is that these benefits are with us for the long term. 
Once the government bails people out, they come to expect it. It becomes 
politically impossible to change the benefits, no matter how costly they are to 
society. Because many remain uninsured, a major earthquake on the San Andreas 
Fault will burden state and federal budgets far in excess of the Northridge 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 If I could change things, here is what I would propose. Beyond the immediate 
provision of basic rescue services, disaster assistance programs should require 
a financial means test, with all but the poorest excluded. Tax deductions for 
uninsured losses should be eliminated. Homeowners should assess their own 
willingness to bear risk and purchase the appropriate level of private 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 These changes would shift the provision of protection from natural disaster to 
private markets, reducing the growing dependence on government disaster relief.

MIKE DOWNEY: IT'S TIME TO SHUCK THE CORN IN COBB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Only heterosexual volleyball players are welcome in Cobb County, Ga.  
</P>
<P>
 They don't want you in Cobb County, Ga., if you're gay and play.  
</P>
<P>
 They only want straight setters and straight servers in Cobb County, Ga., the 
home of heterosexual volleyball here in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, this being America, as a citizen and taxpayer of Cobb County, Ga., you do 
have every right to state your candid opinion on the serious danger that 
homosexual volleyball represents to this great nation of ours. 
</P>
<P>
 I know for a fact that in Cobb County, Ga., there are people who lie awake at 
night, the poor dears, worrying their little hearts out about homosexual 
volleyball.  
</P>
<P>
 But it so happens that Cobb County, Ga., is the chosen site for volleyball's 
competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 And the people of Cobb County, Ga., well, a majority of these folks, passed a 
resolution about a year ago, voting that, by gum, they just didn't believe in 
this nonsense about gay people having rights. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they said in Cobb County, Ga., if gay people feel they absolutely must 
have equal rights, then let them have equal rights, but let them have equal 
rights someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
 A gentleman (cough) named Gordon Wysong from the Cobb County board of 
commissioners is the fellow who wrote this resolution, and old Gordon is proud 
to have put his old John Hancock on it. 
</P>
<P>
 And old Commissioner Gordon was even prouder just last week, when the Cobb 
County commishes put their heads together to vote on whether they would be 
willing to strike a compromise on their anti-gay resolution, because they 
voted: No, no, a thousand times no. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on behalf of all the straight shooters in Cobb County and 
gay-volleyball bashers everywhere, old Gordon reaffirmed this week that there 
would be no more pussyfooting around on this issue, because, well, to quote old 
Gordon: "That settled the matter!" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I feared that perhaps this would put an end to this heated controversy 
in Cobb County, Ga., until, lo and behold, Greg Louganis spoke up and told them 
to take their county and shove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Louganis, the four-time Olympic diving gold medalist, "outed" himself as a 
homosexual at the Olympic Festival in St. Louis the other day, after having 
participated in the recent Gay Games in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 And in so doing -- right on the mark, Greg -- he had a few choice words for 
the commissioners of Cobb County, Ga., asking that the Olympic volleyball event 
be moved from there, maybe to some neighboring county where human beings could 
be treated like human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 For it had become obvious to Louganis that where Cobb County, Ga., is 
concerned, "Some athletes are not welcome here." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that he was terrified at finally acknowledging publicly what those 
close to him have known all along, Louganis told his audience, "I am proud to 
stand before you as an openly gay athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Louganis is a bright, sociable, popular and accomplished fellow of 34 who 
would like to believe that he could function freely in Cobb County or any other 
county without being denied the deed to a home, medical treatment, access to 
churches and schools or a lousy plate of eggs at the local diner. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but for some crazy reason Louganis doesn't happen to think that the 
Atlanta Olympic Organizing Committee, the U.S. Olympic movement or the 
International Olympic Committee should be rewarding the county of Cobb, state 
of Georgia, with one of the venues for the 1996 Summer Games when the voters in 
this county don't want "his kind" anywhere in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 And other athletes are offering Louganis their support, such as Olympic 
champion speedskater Cathy Turner, who said of Cobb County's twice-confirmed 
attitude toward gays, "It's like racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I guess everyone who plays volleyball in Cobb County, Ga., will be asked 
to submit to questions from local officials, such as, "Do you play men's 
volleyball or do you play real men's volleyball?" 
</P>
<P>
 I guess every Olympian who sets foot in Cobb County, Ga., will be asked, "Are 
you a modern Olympian or are you one of those funny 19th Century 
compete-in-the-nude Olympians?" 
</P>
<P>
 I guess every volleyball match in Cobb County, Ga., will be supervised by a 
big old sheriff who makes sure that nobody does any of that patting-on-the-butt 
stuff after a great spike. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, I can see Atlanta mounting those billboards: 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the Host City of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Proud to Host Most of 
You." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if they really want to show their contempt, Gordon and the Cobb County 
commissioners can do their tomahawk chops with limp wrists. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't be prouder of Louganis for doing what he is doing, and I couldn't 
agree more with Louganis on what he is saying. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd add maybe one thing, Greg. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Gay Games? Hold them in Cobb County. 
</P>
<P>
 With permission or not.

JIM MURRAY: WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; THE GAME HAS TIED HIM OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I never thought I'd live to say this, but I've grown to love World Cup soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as deliciously wacky as a Keystone Kops movie. The Marx Brothers have a 
ball. Everything but the pie in the face. What they used to call in Carole 
Lombard's day screwball comedy.  
</P>
<P>
 You watch the World Cup and you figure the guy got the idea for it from "Alice 
in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
 Get a load of these guys! I ask you, was Chaplin ever funnier? 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, did you see in the papers the other day where a referee 
apologized to the world for making a bad call? And not just any old bad call, a 
call that cost a country, Belgium, its place in the tournament! 
</P>
<P>
 I ask you, did you ever hear of a zebra in the NFL or an umpire in a World 
Series who admitted he ever made a bad call, never mind apologize for it? This 
poor guy will never again officiate a World Cup game. My guess is, he'll be 
standing outside a Russian restaurant in Paris in a fur hat, opening limo doors 
for guys in tuxes and ladies in evening gowns. I mean, I don't have to tell you 
they don't forgive boo-boos very easily. 
</P>
<P>
 And how can you top a headline that says, "Bulgaria Beats Mexico, 1-1?" Like, 
you want to say "How's that again? You want to run through that for me one more 
time?" 
</P>
<P>
 How do you beat somebody, 1-1? Well, in the World Cup, it's easy. Seems they 
decide games nowadays by penalty kicks after regulation and overtime end tied. 
Kind of like showdown poker where you cut cards for the pot after all-night 
dealing hasn't run anybody out.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's such a wimpy way to decide a world championship that the governing 
body in soccer, FIFA, chooses to ignore it. It recognizes the lunacy of 
spending two hours to run up two goals -- and then scoring them in bunches in 
about 29 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 See what I mean? Should these guys go around in Napoleon hats or what? There's 
a part for Jack Nicholson in this farce. I love it! 
</P>
<P>
 And I love the way they ignore injured parties. They step right over them as 
if they weren't there. The clock keeps moving. The guy's on his own. He might 
be dead or dying, but that doesn't matter. If he gets in the way, presumably 
they'll kick him. The show must go on. Carmen was announced, Carmen will be 
sung. Get that stiff off the field before I red-card him. Don't you love the 
way they gravely give you cards for misbehavior? Much more ominous than the way 
umpires give the old heave-ho, just throwing their arm in the air and abusing 
you verbally. Their way is almost like a Frenchman handing you his card as a 
challenge to a duel. Very polite and civilized. None of this, "Yer outta here, 
busher!" 
</P>
<P>
 In this sport, the ref doesn't always have to red-card you. Your team will do 
it for him. Take the case of the star player for Germany who, walking off the 
field, gives the finger to the crowd in Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
 And his own coach not only kicks him out of the game, he kicks him out of the 
tournament! Match that around New York! Imagine the Philadelphia Phillie 
manager kicking his own player out of a game for flipping off the crowd. I seem 
to remember Ted Williams spitting at the fans once. Vince Coleman threw a small 
explosive at them. I don't even want to remember the things John McEnroe used 
to do to a crowd. With impunity. What this guy did wouldn't even make the 11 
o'clock news after a Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 I also love the fact that you have no idea how much time there's left in a 
game. It's a kind of important statistic and, in a 90-minute game, there is 
some time to be added to make up for injury time.  
</P>
<P>
 The only trouble is, they don't tell you. Only the referee knows. It's his 
secret. It's for sure he doesn't let the crowd in on it. It reminds me of the 
scene in "Guys and Dolls" in which Big Julie holds a crap game in his hat. You 
throw the dice and only he can see them. "You lose," he tells you. All the 
shooter can do is say, "Tell me, was they five-and-twos or four-and-threes er 
what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Time's up," says the World Cup referee. Oh? 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a great game or what? I ask you! 
</P>
<P>
 And, get a load of the "injuries." These guys should get Oscars. One minute, 
they're writhing on the ground, clutching their legs or arms or heads in 
terminal pain. They get carried off the field still as death. Until their 
opponent gets a red card. Then they jump off the stretcher like Lazarus, run 
out on the field and pick up where they left off.  
</P>
<P>
 Red cards mean you're through for the rest of the game, all of the next one 
and maybe the rest of the tournament. If our baseball had them, think you'd 
find all those guys charging the mound? I love red cards.  
</P>
<P>
 What I think I like best is the way these guys run up and down the field all 
day and nothing happens. They never score. It's almost as if they have a pact 
not to score. As if the sport would die of embarrassment if it had a 10-9 game, 
or 11-11.  
</P>
<P>
 The reason they don't score is, they never try to! I mean, they have this big 
yawning net and it's like putting a ball in the Grand Canyon. The damn thing is 
eight yards wide, for cryin' out loud! And eight feet high. How tough could it 
be to get a spheroid the size of a beach ball in there? But when they get down 
in front of it, they stop, get the ball between their insteps and start looking 
around for someone to pass the ball to. You want to scream, "Kick the damn 
ball! Net it!" 
</P>
<P>
 They don't. They act as if they have to have a letter from God. Most games, 
the goalkeeper has an easier job than a guard at a railroad crossing with two 
trains a week.  
</P>
<P>
 But I don't want to quibble. Who needs scoring when you've got this lovely 
bunch of eccentrics? Still, the goalkeeper should bring a book.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the international aspect of this thing that adds its spice. Playing for 
one's country is a bigger responsibility than playing for Green Bay. Of course, 
you look at the Swedish team, for example, and you can tell right away some of 
them aren't Swedish. But so what? The Irish national team had a Protestant for 
a coach. And the star player on the Italian team is a Buddhist.  
</P>
<P>
 Did I tell you this sport was fun? You think I'm making this up? 
</P>
<P>
 And the press? None of this "journalistic objectivity" for these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to this -- by a writer named Pete Davies in his book, "Twenty-Two 
Foreigners in Funny Shorts":  
</P>
<P>
 "He was Diego Armando Maradona; he was 25, he was 5 feet 6 inches of 
jet-propelled muscle, and he was the greatest player the world had seen since 
Pele. He was also, unfortunately, an arrogant little twerp whose career would 
feature petulant farce and peerless genius in equal parts." 
</P>
<P>
 There! Anything else you wanted to know? I wish we could get this guy over 
here. There's a few guys in our sports I'd like to turn him loose on.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, I don't know about you but I'll miss these arrogant little twerps. It's 
too bad the Brits didn't qualify. They would have brought another dimension -- 
hooliganism. This seems to mean an excess of rooting that leads to raucous, 
dangerous, aggressive advocacy. Ruffian behavior. Root for their team or they 
break your kneecaps. They should have come anyway. They could have gone to 
Raider games.  
</P>
<P>
 I love the way they spotted the games. I mean, putting a game in Orlando in 
July is an idea worthy of the Marquis de Sade. But then, you have to remember 
this is a sport that put one of the qualifying games in La Paz, Bolivia. 
Bolivia beat Brazil, 2-0, in what was billed as a wild upset. I don't think so. 
La Paz is 12,000 feet high. Eagles walk at that altitude.  
</P>
<P>
 They shouldn't give these guys a Cup. First prize should be a cuckoo clock.

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: $1 MILLION PER YEAR IS ENOUGH; FREE ENTERPRISE? NOT 
MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS; LET'S INVEST SOME OF THOSE BILLIONS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the world's greatest ballplayer, Babe Ruth, got a raise one year during 
the Great Depression, his annual salary jumped to an outlandish total: $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president of the United States only makes $75,000," a hostile reporter 
reminded him one day at Yankee Stadium. "Why should you get more than Herbert 
Hoover?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ruth, "I had a better year than he did." 
</P>
<P>
 All these decades later, it's a bit harder to understand why hundreds of 
athletes have begun to make not thousands but millions more than America's 
president -- whose annual salary, since 1969, has held at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody contends that ballplayers deserve 10 or 20 times as much as a president 
-- or deserve 100 or 200 times as much as the country's many underpaid, 
hard-working teachers, nurses, and others. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is it happening? 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Rafael Palmeiro getting $5,406,603 from the Baltimore Orioles for a 
six-month job? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the Dodgers handing over $2 million or more to each of eight players 
this season -- for working three hours a day -- and $3 million or more to each 
of four? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the nation's baseball, basketball and football teams paying the 
average athlete more than $1 million every year? 
</P>
<P>
 A simple, two-part answer covers all of the above: 
</P>
<P>
 * This is a sports-mad country whose many sports fans stand ready -- day and 
night -- to spend big money for tickets and for the products advertised on 
radio and TV by game sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sports teams are unusually profitable because their proprietors enjoy an 
unusual monopoly. With few exceptions, the men and women who own the 108 
National League, American League, NFL, NBA and NHL teams enjoy, in their sport, 
the only game in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempt from the kind of free-enterprise competition that constrains and 
disciplines other businesses, they have been able, as a result, to accumulate 
the millions of dollars that the courts have in recent years forced them to 
share with the help. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows that athletes who are skilled in the the sports that fascinate 
America -- football, basketball and baseball -- are just cashing in. 
</P>
<P>
 They are no more talented than skilled volleyball players -- or teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are simply cogs in the pastimes that are American passions. 
</P>
<P>
 And they should be paid accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Raise your hand if you agree: 
</P>
<P>
 No ballplayer is worth more than $1 million a year. A PLAN FOR THE '90s 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the least doubt, U.S. sports fans have cleared up two things. They will 
pay for big league games -- paying a fortune for tickets -- but they are angry 
that so much of their money is going into the pockets of the players and 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a better idea: 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit annual salaries in team sports to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit each club's annual profits to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put the surplus into public education. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether accomplished as a result of fan boycotts or by governmental action 
or with the voluntary, altruistic approval of the players and owners, that is 
what ought to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 For the only time in the world's history, a nation has developed a large, 
inbred, highly trained class of high-salaried specialists -- athletes and their 
administrators -- who keep producing so much wealth that they can support 
themselves comfortably and still spare millions for the fight against 
humanity's greatest enemy: ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Minus free-enterprise controls last year as usual, the sports industry 
generated $55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The American scene is increasingly ironic: In an era of proportionately more 
and more money for sports, there has been proportionately less and less for 
schools, which, in so many districts, need funds for everything from 
instruction and counseling to construction and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in a word, a crisis calling to mind Thomas Jefferson's warning that 
the future of democracy depends on well educated people. 
</P>
<P>
 And the choice is real: 
</P>
<P>
 Should the billions that sports generates be used, to the last dollar, to make 
the athletes and their administrators richer and richer? 
</P>
<P>
 Or should some of this vast sum -- all of it contributed by the public -- be 
used for a cause as priceless as the public's education? 
</P>
<P>
 One day, perhaps, it will be generally understood that all of the billions 
that Americans are willing to pay for sports events needn't be frittered away 
on overpaid infielders, and that a portion should be invested in America's 
under-educated school children. 
</P>
<P>
 And in time, perhaps, Americans will be able to identify major league sports 
as one of the saviors of the nation's future. SPORTS AS A LABORATORY 
</P>
<P>
 America in the '80s and '90s has been in the grip of a lie: that the basis for 
an ideal society is personal greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, that was demonstrably not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, U.S. voters kept a nice balance between individual rights and group 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In those earlier generations, me-first people were always prominent, naturally 
-- but they weren't in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Those generations built streets and highways and schools and magnificent 
campus buildings that were the envy of the world. They launched municipal parks 
and national parks -- from Central Park to Yosemite -- that are still the envy 
of the world. And, among other group obligations, they accepted the 
responsibility for shelters, such as poor farms, where the homeless could work 
and live. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters of a more recent vintage, unhappily for America, have started to think 
of schools and parks as a burden. They have even been reluctant to repair the 
streets that others built -- or keep them clean if it costs too much -- 
although, they reason, the streets are good enough for the homeless, because, 
after all, the streets are paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, America is capable of better than that. And conceivably, today's 
second basemen could show us the way to something better. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports could be the laboratory for a national experiment testing whether the 
real America is represented by the me-firsters of the '80s and '90s or by the 
kind of men and women who in the 19th and early 20th centuries built the 
schools and the nation's infrastructure in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 If it turns out that .300 hitters will hit .300 as readily for $1 million as 
for $5 million, they can help turn the tide against greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Would they play as hard -- try as hard -- for less money? It seems likely. 
Until recent years, big leaguers stood in line to play for $15,000, $17,000, 
sometimes $25,000 
</P>
<P>
 Before greed changed the face of America with the ripening of the me-first 
generation in the 1980s, most ballplayers, though radically underpaid by 
today's standards, whistled while they worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in other fields have also often signaled that salary is hardly the first 
of their values. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one chief executive officer has confessed that he ranks money 
fourth, a distant fourth, to power, prestige and the fun of it all, and that he 
demanded $55 million only because he knows he's smarter than a pal getting $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one home run hitter has demanded $3.2 million only because he knows 
he's a better ballplayer than a pal getting $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost always it turns out to be not money but pride of accomplishment, in 
combination with the thrill of the game, that drives CEOs and shortstops alike 
-- not to mention Hollywood directors, U.S. senators, managing editors, and 
other powerful or creative people. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, Rickey Henderson of the Oakland A's, probably the best 
leadoff hitter of the century, said it again: "It's not the money. Ballplayers 
love the game. This is why we stick around." 
</P>
<P>
 A national experiment would doubtless show that for most people, in fact, 
money is just one of the values. SPORTS: WORLD OF CARTELS 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have suggested that rock stars, rappers and other entertainers 
ought to be grouped with pro athletes in the grossly overpaid department. 
</P>
<P>
 And many are overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a distinction to be made, though, between free-enterprise 
entrepreneurs and salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most rappers are entrepreneurs. They may distress you, but their income, 
contrasted with that of a salaried employee, isn't automatic. They must please 
a number of listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Any entertainment entrepreneur can be very good for the country. On tour, 
Madonna meets a multimillion-dollar payroll. It would be counterproductive to 
limit her income -- or to cripple any other enterprising business man or woman 
whose vision in any field leads to more jobs for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the United States since about 1865 is conclusive that 
free-enterprise business entrepreneurs have made this the land it is. 
</P>
<P>
 But people in sports leagues are different. 
</P>
<P>
 A center fielder's salary, for example, compared to a rock star's income, 
isn't nearly as contingent on his own personal contribution. If baseball were 
as unproductive, financially, as volleyball, center fielders would be 
unrewarded, too, regardless of the richness of their talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is generally true of others on salary. An American reality is that 
even CEOs -- who, along with athletes, are so often vastly overpaid -- are 
company men. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more clearly, NFL and NBA club owners are just riding along. 
</P>
<P>
 To buy in today, they must be very rich. But once in, they make no original or 
unique contribution to the financial success of their clubs. Their role is 
simply to hire reasonably competitive talent. Their income is generated not by 
responsible business practices but by their seat in a monopoly game that 
fascinates the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Their financial success rests essentially on league membership. For, as 
business units, sports leagues are actually cartels. They are associations of 
financially non-competitive business firms maintaining similar pricing plans, 
making joint revenue arrangements, and accepting the other fruits of monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 Because that is so, and because of the national public school crisis, would 
not America be a happier land if the pro clubs contributed some of their 
earnings to education? 
</P>
<P>
 That would work no real hardship on the teams' owners, who, in any case, earn 
a pittance at the gate compared to their clubs' annual appreciation. The 
American League's Baltimore Orioles, in a typical escalation, sold in 1979 for 
$12 million, in 1988 for $70 million, and recently for $173 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's Dallas Cowboys are already worth $50 million more than the record 
$140 million they cost in 1989, according to a Financial World survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's economists note that the value of most U.S. sports teams jumps 
about 15% a year, doubles every five years, and "will rise to unthinkable 
levels" in the next 10 years regardless of anything that their quarterback or 
shortstop or club president does. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a world, $2-million profits seem about right. 
</P>
<P>
 And in such a world, $1-million salaries are surely about right for America's 
finest athletes, most of whom, in their early 30s, must walk away -- giving it 
all up for life. 
</P>
<P>
 What's absent in such a world -- what's needed -- is a way of thinking and 
behaving that balances individual rights for Americans with group concerns for 
America. And the overriding concern is, or should be, the country's future.

CAMP BEGINS TODAY FOR SOME OF RAIDERS; PRO FOOTBALL: ROOKIES, FREE AGENTS AND A 
FEW VETERANS WILL REPORT FOR TRAINING AT OXNARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For those tired of World Cup soccer and uninterested in baseball, good news is 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will kick off a new football season today when rookies, free 
agents and some selected veterans report for training camp at Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing with a 10-6 regular-season record and reaching the second 
round of the AFC playoffs before losing at Buffalo last season, the Raiders 
made several key moves during the off-season that has made them one of the 
favorites in the AFC to reach Super Bowl XXIX. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the additions we've made really have improved our team," said Raider 
Coach Art Shell, who is entering his sixth season. "With the addition of some 
proven veterans and of our draft choices, I think that we're headed in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the players expected to report today will be two former Kansas City 
Chiefs -- running back Harvey Williams and cornerback Albert Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who signed a one-year deal worth about $500,000 in May, has been 
brought in to bolster a running game that struggled at times last season. With 
Greg Robinson, who led the team in rushing as a rookie last season, still 
sidelined because of a knee injury and Tyrone Montgomery expected to be used 
mainly as a third-down back, Williams will get a chance to become the team's 
main ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, a four-time Pro Bowl choice, is expected to challenge Lionel Washington 
for a starting position, but more importantly give the Raiders added secondary 
depth for their nickel and dime pass coverages. 
</P>
<P>
 To compensate for the losses of defensive tackle Howie Long, who retired; 
tight end Ethan Horton, who signed as a free agent with Washington, and 
fullback Steve Smith and linebacker Joe Kelly, who were released because of 
salary-cap problems, the Raiders also added several other free-agent veterans 
in defensive tackle Jerry Ball, tight end Jamie Williams and fullback Derrick 
Gainer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders selected linebackers with their first two picks in last April's 
draft in Rob Fredrickson of Michigan State and James Folston of Northeast 
Louisiana, but the linebacker all eyes will be on this week will be Greg 
Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 Biekert, a seventh-round pick from Colorado in 1993, is expected to replace 
Kelly as the team's starting middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in the same position I was in last year in that he's a question mark 
because he's stepping in as a new starter," said Derrick Hoskins, who replaced 
Ronnie Lott at strong safety last season. "The Raiders would not have him in 
there unless they thought that he could do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Another key addition was free-agent guard Kevin Gogan from Dallas. With 
veteran Max Montoya expected to retire, the Raiders hope Gogan will be able to 
help their running game, which averaged only 89.1 yards last season -- second 
lowest in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that we have a good team that has a lot more depth than we had a year 
ago," said Shell, who has a 47-34 record as head coach. "I'm just excited about 
this team. We have a good group of players who all expect big things this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will practice at Oxnard until July 25 before leaving for Barcelona 
to play Denver on July 31. They will return to practice at Oxnard on Aug. 2 and 
will play exhibitions at Dallas and Pittsburgh before playing the Rams at 
Anaheim on Aug. 20.

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; COMMENTARY; IF YOU'RE NOT A ONE-NAME HERE, 
YOU'RE A NO-NAME

 In a thoroughly L.A. move, most Brazilian soccer players are known simply by a 
single name. This is the height of Hollywood hip. The Brazilians, indeed, look 
cool, play cool, dress cool, talk cool, sweat cool. They were grunge before 
grunge, funky dunky before Funky Dunky. And the Brazilians understand that, 
when you're really big here, you need only one name. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna. Cristophe. Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you have a full name, but you reach that status in which folks just 
refer to you by your first name. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic. Mark & Brian. Fritz. (Ugh!) 
</P>
<P>
 Also, at the highest levels of Hollywood business, superstars at their peak 
routinely are just called by their first names (Eddie, Arsenio), then, once in 
free fall, these same icons are referred to by their full names (Eddie Murphy, 
Arsenio Hall). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in this town, Jack will always be Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen of the 22 Brazilian World Cup members go by a single name: Jorginho. 
Aldair. Leonardo. Mazinho. Dunga. Zinho. Bebeto. Romario. Cafu. Zetti. Gilmer. 
Branco. Rai. Muller. Ronaldo (I), Ronaldo (II). Viola. (Curiously, the players 
all must answer to one Carlos Alberto Parreira, but then again, they probably 
just call him Coach.) 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the most famous athlete of his time was a Brazilian -- Edson Arantes 
do Nascimento, better known as Pele, whom many Americans credit with starting 
the single-name boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Judas, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam & Eve, Abraham, Cain & Abel, Jezebel, Samson & Delilah, Job, Jacob, 
David, Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebuchadnezzar! 
</P>
<P>
 Satan, Lucifer, Mephistopheles, Roseanne. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think anyone would remember Noah's Ark if it were Noah Chomsky's Ark? 
</P>
<P>
 (Heck, it was so much easier to use directory assistance back then. 
</P>
<P>
 You dial 411. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Esther. What city, please?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, can I have a listing in Canaan for Moses?") 
</P>
<P>
 Ajax, Aphrodite, Hercules, Zeus. 
</P>
<P>
 (Hey, don't get me started on the Greek gods.) 
</P>
<P>
 Socrates, Aristotle, Plato; Fonzie, Potsie, Chachi. 
</P>
<P>
 (Actually, this single-name notion is as much a part of the Los Angeles and 
Las Vegas entertainment worlds as any other institutions: L.A., because 
television and film lend themselves to characters easily recognized by just one 
word; Las Vegas, because when you're putting a headline act's name up on a 
marquee in cazillion-point type, SIEGFRIED & ROY fits a lot easier than 
SIEGFRIED FISCHBACKER AND ROY HORN.) 
</P>
<P>
 Euclid, Archimedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Quincy, M.E.; Magnum, P.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbo, MacGyver, Spenser. Honorable mentions to Mannix, Kojak, Baretta, 
Cannon, Banacek, Eischeid, Hunter, Ironside, Longstreet, Starsky & Hutch and 
Cagney & Lacey, all of whom had first names used about twice a season (or after 
every 15th crime committed). 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie from "Charlie's Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinbad, Gallagher, Bozo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dracula, Frankenstein, Lurch.

 Aesop, Sophocles, Raphael, Moliere; Beavis, Butt-head. 
</P>
<P>
 Nostradamus, Kreskin. 
</P>
<P>
 Popeye, Sulu. 
</P>
<P>
 (Let's go back to the Pele thing for a second. It is fairly common in 
Portuguese to be identified by one name. "Yes, it is used overwhelmingly in 
soccer," said Francisco Marcos, the Brazilian team liaison, "but it is 
something as much a part of Brazilian culture as it is soccer. Sometimes it's 
just the diminutive version of your first name; sometimes it has nothing to do 
with your own name, just that you look like somebody else. Pele was by no means 
the first, he was simply the most famous.") 
</P>
<P>
 Zero, Zorro, Zsa Zsa, Zamfir. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito, Titian, Tiny Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 Attila, Godzilla, Rush; Napoleon, Mao, Dave. 
</P>
<P>
 William the Conqueror, Carlton the Doorman. (Historical note on William: As a 
boy, he was known as Billy; then, as a young man, as Bill. After becoming king 
of England, he switched to William. And after the Norman Conquest, his spin 
doctors suggested he make it William the Conqueror in order to discourage 
rebellions and to generate some heat, media-wise. Behind his back, he often was 
called, "Bully.") 
</P>
<P>
 Blondie, Prince, Enya, Sade, Seal, Slash, Sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazel, Benson, Alice, Beulah, Rochester, Eldin, Hop Sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassie, Benji, Marmaduke, McGruff, Snoopy, Astro, Checkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipper, Alf, Thing. 
</P>
<P>
 (Actually, there has been a reverse trend recently in Hollywood in which 
vainglorious TV producers, in order to confer themselves a greater artistic 
status, have taken to using their middle names as part of their noms de plume. 
Guilty as charged: Gary David Goldberg, Paul Junger Witt and Glenn Gordon 
Caron.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sleepy, Dopey, Grumpy, Bashful, Doc, Happy, Sneezy; Tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Iago, Falstaff, Hamlet, MacBeth, Othello, Gallagher. (Gotcha.) 
</P>
<P>
 Penn & Teller, Amos 'n' Andy, Laverne & Shirley, Mork & Mindy, Kate & Allie, 
Bob and Ray, Ben & Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
 Musso & Frank, Mujibur and Sirajul. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilligan, Jeannie; Mikey, Urkel. 
</P>
<P>
 Superman, Shaft, Shane, Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldo, Oprah, Cristina, Xuxa. 
</P>
<P>
 (These daytime talk-show hosts commonly become known by a single name. But it 
doesn't always take. You'll hear these promos, 'On the next "Maury" . . . Oh, 
no. Maury, my foot. He can try that Maury business all he wants, he's still 
Maury Povich, plain and simple, unless you just consider him Connie Chung's 
husband.) 
</P>
<P>
 Twiggy, Vendela, Iman, Fabio; Cinderella, Rapunzel, Angelyne. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry, Moe and Curley; Manny, Moe and Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 Babe, Sugar Ray, Wilt, Arnie, Reggie, Sugar Ray, Magic, Michael, Bo, Deion, 
Shaq. 
</P>
<P>
 That Verne guy, Herb. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogie, Olivier, Keanu. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard (the weatherman), Willard (the rat man). 
</P>
<P>
 Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. 
</P>
<P>
 Romeo and Juliet, Regis and Kathie Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 (Remember "Bridget Loves Bernie?" In real life, they had full names and 
divorce lawyers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sybil, Roseanne. 
</P>
<P>
 Groucho, Bijan, Garp, Lazarus, Tonto, Buddha, Boy George, Bullwinkle, Scrooge, 
Marilyn, Ivanhoe, Gallagher. (That's the grab-bag group. And, yep, there's 
Gallagher again.) 
</P>
<P>
 Liberace. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, to change your name legally in Los Angeles County, the cost is 
$182. This might seem pricey, but if your moniker happens to be Maria Rosario 
Pilar Martinez and you want it to be Charo, you gladly pay it.

<P>
 Betcha she's a soccer fan, too.

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; ROMANIA HOLDING UP WELL; SOCCER: CONTROLLED 
APPROACH GIVES TEAM HEALTHY CHANCE AGAINST SWEDEN, WHICH COULD SUFFER ON 
DEFENSE BECAUSE OF INJURIES.

<P>
 It is a team that has been described in terms generally reserved for an 
especially cranky rodeo bull: tempestuous, emotional, unpredictable, dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, a team of self-described hotheads expected to self-destruct, has 
instead been a marvel of smooth deportment and professional focus -- an 
experimental approach for the Romanians that has borne such sweet fruit, a 
place in the World Cup quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, which had been considered a failure during the last World Cup because 
of its performance in the face of high expectations, will play Sweden today at 
Stanford Stadium. The winner of today's game will play Brazil on Wednesday at 
the Rose Bowl in one of two semifinal games. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's successful run largely has been credited to its most bullish player, 
the highly volatile Gheorghe Hagi. Hagi has overcome moody and indifferent play 
to lead Romania with three goals and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Few have questioned Hagi's talent, but many have questioned his effort. His 
yeoman's work during this World Cup might serve to forever (or, until the 
Italian league begins) rid Hagi of that reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hagi has proven to be among the best players in the tournament," Sweden Coach 
Tommy Svensson said. "I knew he was a strong player before. But I have never 
seen him work this hard." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Hagi's performance has not surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my value to the team and how well I would play," Hagi said. "I knew I 
would play well in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi has not done it alone. He teams with Ilie Dumitrescu on a deadly 
give-and-go the two learned as teammates at Steaua Bucharest. The combination 
will become more dangerous with the addition of high-scoring Florin Raducioiu, 
who had been serving a one-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu would not discuss his lineup Saturday, except 
to say he expected to play many of the same players who played in the opener 
against Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst possible scenario for Sweden is likely to present itself -- team 
captain Jonas Thern is not expected to play. The midfielder suffered a knee 
sprain against Saudi Arabia last week and Svensson does not usually allow 
players who are not fully fit to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Thern, who plays for Napoli in the Italian league, is considered Sweden's best 
player in a decade and provides his team with an emotional anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one Swedish soccer writer: "There is no hope for Sweden if Thern does not 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Also doubtful is defender Joachim Bjorklund, who has a groin pull. But both 
the defense and the midfield will be bolstered by Stefan Schwarz, whom many 
consider to be the best defensive midfielder in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 If Romania relies on counterattacking, as it has in four previous games, 
Sweden will be ready, having beaten the Saudis, 3-1; a game in which Romania 
successfully handled a relentless Saudi counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more dangerous than Saudi Arabia's because they don't go to counter at 
every moment," Svensson said. "They wait until they see they have the 
opportunity. If not, they keep the ball in their possession and they defend 
with nine or 10 men. We must be careful when we go to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 On the attack, Sweden has many potent weapons. Martin Dahlin has scored four 
goals in three games and Kennet Andersson has three in four games. Andersson, 
the striker, has been something of a surprise, but Dahlin has not. He scored 
seven goals in Sweden's nine qualifying games and has distinguished himself in 
this tournament with his assurance with the ball and in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sweden, where humility is prized above all other virtues, Dahlin's 
confidence is sometimes viewed as being arrogant. He does not agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweden is the only country where it is considered a bad characteristic to be 
sure of yourself," Dahlin said before the World Cup. "Why should we always be 
ashamed of what we can do? Why should we not instead be proud?"

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; PRESSURE STILL ON GERMANY; SOCCER: DEFENDING 
CHAMPIONS MUST GET PAST STOITCHKOV AND BULGARIA TODAY TO REACH SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bulgaria's coach, Dimitar Penev, well remembers the last and only time his 
country played Germany in a World Cup game. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in Leon, Mexico, in 1970. Germany was still West Germany in those 
days, of course, but it made no difference. The Germans were still an 
irresistible force going up against a decidedly movable object. 
</P>
<P>
 Penev was a defender on the Bulgarian team that afternoon at Guanajuato 
Stadium, and the Germans made it a long and frustrating game for the 
Bulgarians, scoring a 5-2 victory, with German forward Gerd (Der Bomber) 
Mueller netting three of his World Cup-record 14 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two other players on the field that day who also will be involved 
in today's rematch at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Berti Vogts, now the German coach, was a defender that afternoon, playing in 
front of goalkeeper Sepp Maier, now Germany's goalkeeping coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's where the similarities stop and the differences begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the second-round game attracted 12,700 fans. Now, the teams' 
quarterfinal meeting will attract more than 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Bulgarians were headed nowhere in a hurry. Now, they have a chance 
to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Germans went on to finish third and, four years later, to win the 
World Cup. Now, they are trying to defend the trophy they won four years ago in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany might still be the irresistible force, sparked by forwards Juergen 
Klinsmann and Rudi Voeller, but Bulgaria is not anything like the team it was 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of communism and the subsequent move of many of the country's leading 
players to top clubs in Western Europe has added invaluable experience to the 
Bulgarian lineup. No fewer than 13 of the players on Penev's team earn their 
living abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous of these, of course, is Hristo Stoitchkov, the 28-year-old 
forward considered to be the greatest player Bulgaria has ever produced. 
Exactly who will be assigned to stop him Vogts is not saying, but whoever is 
given the task is in for a long afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware there is more pressure on Germany than on us," Stoitchkov said. 
"We hope to exploit that." 
</P>
<P>
 So far in this World Cup, Stoitchkov has baffled defenders and dazzled fans 
with his spectacular left-footed goals. The temperamental Barcelona star has 
scored four, two against Greece and one each against Argentina and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But the German defense will also have to contend with forward Emil Kostadinov, 
who plays his club soccer for FC Porto in Portugal and is a capable scorer in 
his own right. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the keys to the game, however, is likely to be the way Germany handles 
midfielder Krasimir Balakov, whose intelligence, vision and dribbling skills 
make him the creative force behind Bulgaria's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of Thomas Haessler on the other side of the field. The 
diminutive German, sometimes nicknamed Tom Thumb in the British press, gets 
nowhere near the attention his play deserves. He is a nonstop runner who often 
seems to be in two places at once, here one moment setting up a goal for 
Klinsmann with a pinpoint pass, there the next leaping to head the ball away 
and thwart an opposing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany comes into the game as the favorite, as befits the reigning world 
champion, but its defense will have to be particularly watchful. The Germans 
are susceptible to fast counterattacks, as was shown by the South Koreans, and 
Bulgaria knows how to play that game. Just ask Argentina, which was beaten, 
2-0, by the Bulgarians. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the defensive responsibility will rest on the shoulders of German 
captain and sweeper Lothar Matthaeus, who will be playing in his 21st World Cup 
match, tying the record shared by his compatriot, Uwe Seeler, Poland's 
Wladyslaw Zmuda and Argentina's Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans have had six days' rest after defeating Belgium, 3-2, in Chicago 
last Saturday. The Bulgarians have had three days' rest after a two-hour 
struggle with Mexico, which they tied, 1-1, and then won on penalty kicks, 3-1, 
last Tuesday. The difference could be the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the Bulgarians to play a defensive game, attacking only on the break 
and, if they can get a tie, relying on goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov to provide 
the heroics when it goes to penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the Germans to attack and for Klinsmann to get his sixth goal of the 
tournament, moving him into a tie with Russia's Oleg Salenkov for the scoring 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The last word belongs to Penev, who does not foresee Bulgaria folding as it 
did against the Germans 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to play against them like we did against Argentina," he said. "If we 
do that, we could win."

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; SOUTHERN COMFORT; IN ORLANDO'S FAIR CITY, THE 
FESTIVE IRISH FANS FOUND A HOME

<P>
 Two days after Ireland had been eliminated from the World Cup, Danny McFadden 
was still in Orlando, Fla., drunk as a skunk down at Katie O'Brien's. 
</P>
<P>
 It was midafternoon, Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden was clad in an Orlando Police Department uniform shirt and, well, he 
was sort of handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems McFadden had shackled one of his hands and then lost the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "Know any locksmiths out there in L.A.?" he slurred into the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden thought he was on a radio talk show and wanted to inform the other 
coast what a great time the Irish were having in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you listeners in L.A., this city is the best, the cops are the best," 
McFadden blathered on. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando and the Irish, of course, have a history dating back, oh, weeks now. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the World Cup has been an interesting experiment in cultural 
cross-pollination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian team trained at a community college in Aptos, Calif., eight miles 
south of Santa Cruz. You imagined the team bus passing UC Santa Cruz and the 
following exchange: 
</P>
<P>
 Russian: Nice school. What is nickname? 
</P>
<P>
 Translator: Banana Slugs. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the Romanians roamed Irvine, in which no borough of Little 
Bucharest is known to exist. The Bulgarians trained at Southern Methodist 
University in Dallas; the jet-setting Saudis dropped the Louis Vuitton at 
Catonsville) Community College in Baltimore; the Germans set their watches to 
the cafeteria clock at Hinsdale Central High in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pairings worked out better than others. The Russians were largely kept 
under wraps and not allowed so much as a dip in the blue Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were mysterious," said Dale Murray, the Cabrillo College athletic 
director who served as team liaison. "I had very little interaction with the 
players, by design. They chose not to use our lockers. They changed clothes at 
the hotel and their bus drove right up to the practice site." 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine, the Romanians brought their own chef. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were pretty demanding," Paul Hope, the university's facilities 
coordinator, said. "They were very good people, but they wanted the field 
watered prior to practicing, something that we never do. One day, one of our 
guys had to go out and hand-water it. Those kinds of things. Pretty picky, but 
they're a world-class soccer team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Romanian team stayed at the swanky Newporter Inn in Newport Beach and 
quickly took to the Southern California lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their fans were greatly outnumbered during Rose Bowl games, Romanian 
players went out of their way to thank their small but devoted following. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling here is very good here for us," Gheorghe Hagi, the star Romanian 
forward, said. "Everyone who surrounds us has been very supportive. Many 
teammates have remarked that once they step on the field they feel like they 
are at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the team-city pairings, however, perhaps no two took to each other as 
did the Irish and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 There are really no ethnic or logical connections. So few Irish reside in the 
area that the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau could not 
break down the demographics into percentages. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Orlando was nervous when the World Cup draw handed it games featuring 
the party-hearty Irish and Dutch teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But fears were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Months before, we heard about there being violence, rioting, cars 
overturned," said Petra Leonard, an Irish bartender from New York who came 
south to tend bar during the World Cup. "They talked about spending money on 
tanks. I think they were confusing all of Europe, thinking the English 
(hooligans) and Irish are all the same." 
</P>
<P>
 After Ireland's second game at Orlando last Monday, a 2-0 loss to the 
Netherlands at the Florida Citrus Bowl, dozens of fans of both teams exchanged 
caps with Orlando officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The partying was heavy but seldom destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wit Tuttell, public-relations representative for the visitors' bureau, 
estimated that Orlando absorbed 45,000 tourists during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were not exactly typical visitors," Tuttell said. "It was not families 
seeing theme parks. But if you owned a bar, you did much better than expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttell said about 2,000 kegs of beer flowed at Church Street Station during 
the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 McFadden, a transplanted Irishman who works as a horse-and-carriage driver in 
New York's Central Park, said he was personally accountable for many of those 
kegs. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the way, he exchanged his shirt and caps with an Orlando cop. 
Then, McFadden ended up in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a fantastic party, unbelievable," McFadden said from his bar stool 
at Katie's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it's coming to an end." 
</P>

HITS THE JACKPOT

 For Italy, it was yet another journey to the edge of the precipice and yet 
another last-minute escape. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just as it had been against Nigeria four days earlier, it was Roberto 
Baggio who rode to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 A goal by the ponytailed Juventus star in the 88th minute earned the Italians 
a deserved, albeit belabored, 2-1 victory over Spain on Saturday and a berth in 
the World Cup semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio, who scored the tying goal in the 89th minute against the Nigerians and 
then the winner in overtime, again will be hailed from one end of Italy to the 
other for his heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be very wrong to suppose that this was a victory due to the 
brilliance of a single player. Italy had many heroes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of them was the bald guy in sunglasses and a light blue shirt down 
by the Italian bench. Coach Arrigo Sacchi has survived a perilous trip through 
the soccer minefield during the last three weeks, but he has managed to stay 
one step ahead of disaster all the while. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he took several more risks by tinkering with his lineup for the 
umpteenth time. 
</P>
<P>
 He put goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca back in the nets for the first time since 
Pagliuca had been thrown out of the game against Norway on June 23. All 
Pagliuca did was come up with a couple of critical second-half saves when the 
Spanish appeared to be getting the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He put Dino Baggio into the starting lineup after the midfielder had been used 
only as a substitute against Nigeria. All Dino did was score the opening goal 
with a rocketing first-half shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He put Roberto Signori on the bench, then sent him in for the second half. All 
Signori did was cause panic in the Spanish defense and provide the decisive 
final pass that resulted in Roberto Baggio's game-winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad afternoon's work for Sacchi, who continues to defy the odds and now 
is only two victories away from joining Vittorio Pozzo (1934, 1938) and Enzo 
Bearzot (1982) as coaches to win the World Cup for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's game, played in front of 54,605 on a hot, muggy, overcast afternoon 
at Foxboro Stadium, never rose to any great heights. The first half, in 
particular, was a largely tedious affair whose lone bright spot was Dino 
Baggio's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Italian Olympic team star was on both ends of the goal, initiating 
the play and finishing it. In perhaps Italy's best passing move in five games, 
the ball was relayed from Dino Baggio to Roberto Baggio to Daniele Massaro and 
back to Dino Baggio to Roberto Donadoni to Dino Baggio, who fired a screwball 
past Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, the opening 45 minutes was a stupefying exercise in futility. 
</P>
<P>
 Things brightened somewhat in the second half, especially after Spain had tied 
the score on midfielder Jose Luis Caminero's shot that deflected off a defender 
and into the roof of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 That instigated a period of Spanish dominance, and Italy was somewhat 
fortunate to survive without giving up another goal. The Italians always had 
the numerical superiority because Spain was reluctant to commit too many 
players to the offense for fear of exposing itself to the counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Pagliuca was called on to make a desperate tackle in front of his 
goal to deny Julio Salinas a shot and, less than a minute later, tipped a 
fierce shot by Fernando Hierro over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 With overtime looking inevitable, the Spanish pressed for the winner, but, as 
Coach Javier Clemente acknowledged afterward, they made the "lamentable 
mistake" of leaving their defense momentarily undermanned. 
</P>
<P>
 One moment was all it took as Signori and Roberto Baggio combined to end 
Spain's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Italy win when many of the pundits had predicted a Spanish victory? 
Courage was one reason. Sacchi said his players were "exhausted" in the second 
half after their two-hour battle with Nigeria earlier in the week but endured 
to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck was another reason. Hungarian referee Sandor Puhl either did not see or 
chose to ignore the elbow that Italian defender Mauro Tassotti used to break 
Spanish forward Luis Enrique's nose during a penalty-box scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition is a third reason. Italy is a three-time World Cup winner. Spain has 
never won the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 History might well be on the Italians' side in this tournament. They lost 
their opening game to Ireland, remember, and the last time they failed to win 
their opening game was in Spain in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the last year they won the World Cup.

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; FANS GLAD THAT SAACHI IS LUCKY AND GOOD; 
ITALY: BELEAGUERED COACH MAKES ALL THE RIGHT MOVES AGAINST SPAIN, EVEN IF HEAT 
THROWS OFF HIS PLANS IN THE SECOND HALF. 
</P>

 It was only a few minutes after the game when Arrigo Sacchi arrived for his 
customary inquisition by reporters, and in the stands of Foxboro Stadium, 
thousands of people wrapped in red, green and white were bringing folk opera al 
fresco to the Boston suburbs. Jumping, cheering, yelling, weeping, they danced 
in free-verse pandemonium to drums, cymbals, bugles and their own hoarse 
chants. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration was for Italy, but not necessarily for the almost mystical 
coach whose talent-laden team advanced to the World Cup semifinals Saturday on 
a foggy, almost ethereal, afternoon with a 2-1 victory over Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very satisfied," Sacchi told reporters. "We were good, and we were 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough game, he said, thanking everyone "who supported us through such 
anguish." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before the game, more than 80% of Italians polled said they 
thought the 48-year-old former coach of AC Milan should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 He will have fewer critics now, but as coach, Sacchi still lacks -- an 
occupational hazard -- the credibility that Italians habitually accord their 
national team's players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sacchi's a lucky son of a gun," said Giorgio Chinaglia, the retired star who 
is Italy's Pele. "(Julio) Salinas in front of the goal for Spain and doesn't 
score. We touch the ball twice in the whole second half and score a goal. With 
luck like that, we might win it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning it all is what Sacchi had in mind when he built a team around Juventus 
wizard Roberto Baggio, filled it from a rich crop of world-class players and 
stitched it together with heavy threads of tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of Sacchi grew when Italy failed to gel in Cup qualifying play, or 
in lackluster first-round games, or until the last-gasp end of the match 
against Nigeria in which it staggered into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Italian soccer analysts (there are, after all, 57 million of them) bemoan 
what one prominent commentator among them calls Sacchi's "pseudo culture," 
arguing that Italy is over-coached. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half Saturday, Sacchi was vindicated. The second half belonged to 
the naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
 With a revamped lineup -- four of the starters against Nigeria were benched -- 
Italy played its best 45 minutes of the Cup to earn a 1-0 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the four new starters, Dino Baggio, was reinstalled at midfield in 
place of Nicola Berti. He scored the goal, and in Sacchi's judgment was the 
best player on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started out in the first half extremely fast," Sacchi said. "This is how 
we planned to play for 90 minutes, but we just couldn't manage to do it because 
we were completely exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Roberto Baggio: "The heat was scary."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Giuseppe Signori, benched for the first half but inserted when the second 
half began: "We were suffering at the end. It was very humid." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat and the pace of the game unraveled Sacchi's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played our way tactically for the first half," Sacchi said, "But in the 
second the players couldn't respond, they were so tired. We lost strategy, we 
lost ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain dominated. With the game plan out the window, Italy played slower, more 
instinctive soccer. And it was a pass from Signori that Roberto Baggio 
converted into one of the tournament's prettiest goals. "A champion's goal," 
Sacchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again Baggio shows us that even when he is tired and it is late in the 
game, he is cool-headed," said commentator Roberto Beccega, a former Italian 
national team player. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi says that tactically every game is different and that the personnel 
should match the circumstance. On Saturday, he restored goalkeeper Gianluca 
Pagliuca, who completed a two-game red-card suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 And there in the second half, with the score 1-1, was sure-footed Salinas, 
beating defenders and bearing down on Pagliuca. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I watched him come I thought about a return trip home," Pagliuca joked 
afterward. Then, reflexively, with a skill born not of planning or strategy, 
but of practice and patience, "I made the save."  
</P>
<P>
 For Italy then, the victory was another Sacchi answer to critics who will not 
be assuaged until Italy wins the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask those who criticize Sacchi what they think now," said Antonio Matarrese, 
president of the Italian Soccer Federation. "He built the team around Roberto 
Baggio. Sacchi has faith in him despite the critics. Bam, Baggio scored. Bam, 
we won. Bam, we are at the summit of world soccer. I've always said Sacchi was 
unpredictable. He is unpredictable."

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; COMMENTARY; DUTCH WAIT, BUT WHISTLE STAYS 
SILENT 
</P>

<P>
 Dutch midfielder Rob Witschge was shirtless by the time he hit the tunnel, the 
"Clockwork Orange" turned "A Whiter Shade of Pale." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the face. 
</P>
<P>
 The face was tri-colore -- crimson, scarlet and red -- and it seemed to send 
off steam as Witschge was asked by a FIFA interpreter to assess this 
just-completed World Cup quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly translated, Witschge charged the officials with stealing the shirts 
off the Netherlands' backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says it is terrible," the interpreter said. "He says the linesman is 
blind, absolutely blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says the Brazilian player was three yards offside -- a terrible way to get 
a second goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says, 'We got into it pretty good after that, but it is something you 
never get over.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He says it is one of the saddest things in his career." 
</P>
<P>
 Witschge was talking about the second mute whistle to silence a Benelux 
country in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it was a non-call on the foul in the penalty area in the game against 
Germany that eliminated Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday at the Cotton Bowl, it was a non-call on an apparent offside before a 
goal by Brazil that halted Holland, 3-2, in a wild quarterfinal that Dutch 
Coach Dick Advocaat said had "all the elements football should contain. Strange 
calls, tension -- this game had it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Strange non-calls, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil held a 1-0 lead when Brazilian defender Branco won a head ball at 
midfield and lofted a pass over the heads of two Dutch players trying to work 
an offside trap on Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Valckx and Ronald Koeman appeared to pull it off splendidly, too. Up went 
the ball, up stepped Valckx and Koeman . . . and there was Romario several 
yards back, all by his lonesome. Had this been the kind of football normally 
seen inside the Cotton Bowl, Romario would have signaled for a fair catch. 
</P>
<P>
 But Romario knows his futbol -- and he also knew that trusty sidekick Bebeto 
was angling into the clear on the right flank. As the pass began to slice 
toward Bebeto, Romario, camped in center field, started to walk away from the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a leisurely stroll, and Romario will tell you with a wink that he had 
it planned all along. Assuming Romario was hopelessly trapped offside, Valckx 
and Koeman froze and waited for the whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 As they fly back to Amsterdam, Valckx and Koeman are still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball landed just beyond the two Dutchmen with a plop, accompanied by no 
other sound than Bebeto's feet. 
</P>
<P>
 He swooped in, pounced on the loose ball and took it home -- drawing Dutch 
goalkeeper Ed De Goey out of his box and tapping into an open net. 
</P>
<P>
 The play sent Bebeto into a double-fisted jockey ride around the Dutch half of 
the field, in jubilant celebration of a 2-0 Brazil lead. But elsewhere, the 
reaction was delayed. In the press area, two Brazilian journalists leaped to 
their feet, then began to grimace. 
</P>
<P>
 "No goal," one of them told an American writer with glum shake of his head. 
"Romario was offside." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the scoreboard showed Brazil 2, Netherlands 0 and it wasn't going away. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been no linesman's flag thrust into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been no referee's whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal stood. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sideline, Advocaat was aghast. On the field, Dutch players stood with 
hands on their hips in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Offside is often a judgment call -- and referee Rodrigo Badilla Sequeira went 
to brink on this one. Because he was walking away from the play, Sequeira 
ruled, Romario was not involved in the play, and consequently, irrelevant to 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusion: No offside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrible," Witschge said again and again. "All of a sudden, there's a 
different rule for offsides? If you're walking, you can go off?" 
</P>
<P>
 From behind the podium, Advocaat bit his tongue so hard that it should drawn 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't said anything about the referees so far in the World Cup," Advocaat 
said when asked about the play. "I won't start now." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Advocaat was asked again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about the referee," he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a call that would have crushed most teams in this tournament. With 28 
minutes to play, the Netherlands was down, 2-0, to the consensus World Cup 
favorite, a team that had yielded but one goal in its first four games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Netherlands came back to tie, pairing goals by Dennis Bergkamp and 
Aron Winter in a span of 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Six minutes later, Branco busted through the Dutch wall with a blistering free 
kick, Brazil had regained the lead and the non-whistle was ringing louder than 
ever in Dutch ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams played evenly well," Advocaat said, straddling the diplomatic 
tightrope. "But, the most lucky team won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil would, no doubt, argue the point, but Advocaat will stick with that 
story. Call it a judgment call.

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; DUTCH ARE DOWN -- AND OUT OF TOUCH; SOCCER: 
AS LONE NETHERLANDS PLAYER TO COMMENT, WITSCHGE LAMENTS BLOWN OFFSIDE CALL; 
ADVOCAAT PREFERS TO PRAISE BOTH TEAMS.

<P>
 They went down fighting -- and for once, they weren't fighting each other. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Netherlands World Cup team, that was a considerable achievement. Not 
as great a feat as getting to the final would have been, but exiting on a sad 
yet harmonious note will have to stand as Holland's crowning achievement in the 
1994 tournament after its 3-2 quarterfinal loss to Brazil on Saturday at the 
Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 So distraught were the Dutch players afterward, only one player, left 
midfielder Rob Witschge, was composed enough to talk with reporters. The rest, 
according to Coach Dick Advocaat, were "down and out." 
</P>
<P>
 Witschge was certainly down. And he lamented that the Dutch were out of the 
tournament because of a missed offside call. 
</P>
<P>
 Witschge contended that Bebeto's goal, scored in the 62nd minute to give 
Brazil a 2-0 lead, should have been nullified because another Brazilian 
forward, Romario, was offside. Despite the players' vehement arguments and 
Advocaat's stony stare from the sideline, the goal stood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are crushed," Witschge said. "It's terrible to lose like this. It is one 
of the saddest moments of my soccer career." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocaat politely and repeatedly refused to comment on the goal. "It's on my 
tongue to say it was offside, but I'm not saying that," he said. "I haven't 
said anything about the refereeing in the World Cup and I wouldn't like to 
start now." 
</P>
<P>
 He preferred instead to praise his opponent and his team. The Netherlands' two 
goals were the most scored against Brazil in this tournament so far and it 
marked the first time any team had scored twice against the Brazilians in a 
World Cup game since the 1982 tournament in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil is world class," Advocaat said, "and if you consider the way Holland 
played Brazil, I think that is a compliment to my team." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a compliment to Advocaat's coaching too. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocaat, who was a steady but average midfielder in his playing days in 
Holland and the North American Soccer League, had to fight to win his players' 
respect. Some wanted former star Johan Cruyff to coach them, and midfielder 
Ruud Gullit had so little respect for Advocaat that Gullit refused to play for 
the team, returned, and then left again. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing Gullit's playmaking was a blow, but Advocaat didn't concede. He 
tinkered with various lineups until he found a mix of energetic attacking and 
judicious defense, waiting patiently while striker Dennis Bergkamp found his 
stride and winger Peter van Vossen found his rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocaat got his team a round deeper into the tournament than it advanced four 
years ago in Italy, but Brazil proved too formidable an obstacle for Advocaat 
to take one more step into the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I leave the World Cup with good feelings," said Advocaat, whose contract runs 
through 1998. "The Dutch team played very well. . . . We can leave America with 
our heads high. I am very proud of my boys." 
</P>
<P>
 They gave him reason to be proud Saturday, as they did in their victories over 
Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Ireland and their 1-0 loss to Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Brazilian defense neutralized the speed of winger Marc Overmars 
and rarely allowed Bergkamp an uncontested inch of grass, the Dutch clawed back 
to erase a 2-0 Brazilian lead in the second half and pulled even with less than 
15 minutes to play. "Brazil was handling the ball too much. We didn't have too 
many chances," Advocaat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes after Bebeto's goal, Bergkamp dodged Brazilian defender Marcio 
Santos to score the Netherlands' first goal and his third goal of the 
tournament. Their hope rekindled, the Dutch kept pressing and tied the score in 
the 76th minute when Aron Winter outjumped a crowd of defenders to head a 
corner kick by Overmars into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed that if we have to, we can change the game (around), like when we 
came from 2-nil to make it 2-2," Witschge said. "We just wanted to go on and 
create more possibilities to score goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The only goal scored after that, though, was Branco's blast through the Dutch 
defensive wall. "Giving up that goal on the free kick, that killed us," 
Witschge said.

WORLD CUP USA '94: QUARTERFINALS; BRANCO IS MR. DESTINY FOR BRAZIL; SOCCER: 
REPLACEMENT FOR SUSPENDED LEONARDO GETS WINNING GOAL AFTER SPENDING FIRST FOUR 
GAMES ON BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 So this is punishment? 
</P>
<P>
 On July 4, at Palo Alto, a Brazilian named Leonardo jarred Tab Ramos of the 
United States with an elbow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans will remember the call for a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, however, it might now be remembered as a call to destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 In a World Cup chain reaction that set off sirens and sambas, Ramos went down 
with a concussion, Leonardo went to the bench after FIFA handed him a four-game 
suspension and Branco, his replacement, went on to make history. 
</P>
<P>
 Branco, almost forgotten in Brazilian soccer lore, scored the decisive goal 
Saturday on a booming, 30-yard free kick in the 81st minute to lift Brazil to a 
3-2 quarterfinal victory over the Netherlands at the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Branco, who had not played in nearly a month, almost scored twice, deprived 
earlier by goalkeeper Ed De Goey, who leaped to deflect another free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, Branco marked Marc Overmars out of the game, sticking to the 
forward like Dutch Boy paint on plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 All because Leonardo whacked Tab Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Destiny wanted it to be like this," a humbled Branco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the best coaching decisions are ones thrust upon you. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Alberto Parreira, scrutinized in Brazil for everything down to his 
toothpaste choices, was under pressure in Brazil to not play Branco, a two-time 
World Cup veteran with a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Branco, critics suggested, would be a monkey wrench in the 
Brazilian offense. The vertebrae in Branco's back, in fact, have eroded to the 
point that his left leg is slightly shorter than his right. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rest of his team prepared for the World Cup, Branco soaked his 
sacroiliac in the whirlpool under the care of Dr. Lidio Toledo. Since 
participating in club championship matches in Rio de Janeiro more than 40 days 
ago, Branco had played one half of soccer -- in a June 12 friendly against El 
Salvador in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo's suspension made Parreira's decision to insert Branco an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 True, there were a lot of miles on this Branco, but experience counts in big 
games and the defender was a veteran of nine World Cup games, in 1986 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Branco has always possessed a lively free kick. His bio sheet notes that he is 
"exceptionally threatening in free-kick situations, having scored from 
seemingly safe distances outside the box." 
</P>
<P>
 It perfectly described Saturday's game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Branco set himself up for the kick by baiting Wim Jonk into a foul, a subtlety 
teammate Leonardo has not quite mastered. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, from well beyond the penalty arc, Branco let go with a left-footed blast 
that found a hole in the Dutch wall and the upper-right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struck the ball with a lot of confidence," Branco said. "Before I hit the 
ball, I looked up at the scoreboard and saw there were 10 minutes to go. I got 
it in my head, it was the right moment." 
</P>
<P>
 With the shot, Branco said, he silenced most of his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a game in which everyone was worried if I was ready to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overmars could attest to his opponent's fitness. Branco was not shy in saying 
he "annihilated" the Dutch forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Branco said he was not nervous before the game: "To the contrary, I was very 
much at peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his defensive performance, he said. "I had to mark perhaps Holland's best 
player. I don't think he had anything to do with the game. I thank God I had a 
great role in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly tired, Branco left the game in the 89th minute to a hero's welcome 
on the Brazilian bench. Had he been wearing a cap, Branco would have tipped it. 
</P>
<P>
 The game over, as the impact of the goal began to set in, Branco allowed 
himself to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was for everything that I had to go through," he said. "To go from 2-0, to 
2-2 and then 3-2, it was a thing of destiny. If one did not cry, one would not 
have emotions."

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; NEW COACH MEANS NEW ATTITUDE FOR WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything was great. Quincy Watts was in high gear, sprinting through an 
account of his rebirth as a dedicated and responsible track star, when his 
coach interrupted in mid-sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not in great shape," Bob Kersee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," Watts countered. "I feel great." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beside her husband at an Olympic Festival news conference late last 
week, Jackie Joyner-Kersee smiled knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the most minor details, it's Bob's way or the highway. Watts was 
learning quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months ago, Watts, the 1992 Olympic 400-meter champion, left coach John 
Smith and put himself under Kersee's tutelage -- and his alert eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't get away with anything anymore," Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that's one of the reasons he said he made the coaching switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts, who will run a leg in the Olympic Festival 4 X 400-meter relay at 
Southern Illinois University today, is coming off a disappointing 1993 season 
that many track experts attribute to his being out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
 With his weight near 215 pounds, Watts was fourth in the World Championships 
in Stuttgart, Germany, struggling to the finish after part of his shoe came 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
 The broken shoe heel allowed Watts a ready-made excuse, but he knew better. 
The celebrity of being Olympic champion was slowing him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to learn time management," he said. "I was letting what I was doing off 
the field interfere with my track time." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts, NCAA 400-meter champion for USC in 1992, stopped short of blaming Smith 
for his downfall but said, "There comes a point where an athlete hits a dead 
stage and he needs something new, or somebody new, to motivate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kersee, Watts said, gets after him "about three times a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever works. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite fighting a series of nagging minor injuries, Watts weighs 197 pounds, 
the same as two years ago at a similar stage in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm way ahead of last year," he said of his conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 With more intense training ahead, Watts anticipates competing in the Goodwill 
Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, later this month at about 195 pounds, his 
"fighting weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Watts was held out of the U.S. nationals in Knoxville, Tenn., last month, but 
he has pronounced himself fit enough to run a sub-44-second leg in today's 
relay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 Olympics, Watts ran a 43.1 -- the fastest relay leg ever -- as the 
U.S. team wiped out the oldest world record in the books. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't regained that form yet, but he's getting there. And still only 24, 
he figures to have several prime years left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned not to put my track secondary to anything anymore," Watts said. 
"This is what I do. This is the way I make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Now rejuvenated, Watts finds himself motivated in a year with no World 
Championships or Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm already looking forward to next year," he said, "but it's still exciting 
for me now. I come out to work and I'm excited. I get pushed every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be an off year for everybody else, but it's an interesting year and a 
fun year for me because I'm being taught a different philosophy and approach." 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In track, Ronnie Harris of Rialto won the men's 5,000-meter race in 13:52.62. 
Other medal winners included Rodney Lewis of Los Angeles, a silver in the 100 
meters, 10.28; Devon Edwards of Los Angeles, a silver in the 400 meters, 45.76; 
and Crystal Irving of Long Beach, a bronze in the 400 meters, 53.10. . . . In 
judo, Amy Liou of Granada Hills, Christine Shiosaki of Torrance and Yvette Gray 
of North Hollywood won bronze medals. . . . Jason McEntee of Loyola Marymount 
and Neil Mendel of Cal State Long Beach played key roles as the North defeated 
the East, 16-14, 8-15, 15-12, 17-15, in the gold-medal men's volleyball match. 
McEntee had 25 kills and 13 digs. Mendel added 12 kills, 11 digs and a 
team-high five blocks. . . . In weightlifting, Bill Gabriel of Costa Mesa won 
the silver medal in the 182 3/4-pound class with a career-best 617 1/4-pound 
total.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * AIR'S ADIEU? Michael Jordan will not appear in Monday's Southern League 
All-Star game, but the hot rumor is that he will use the schedule break to 
announce his baseball retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he discouraged with his sub-.200 batting average? Is he returning to 
basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 The key, sources say, is that Jordan has simply wearied of the daily autograph 
barrage -- by fans and players alike, before games, after games, during games 
and that he is signing off. 
</P>
<P>
 * FILL-UP: Of his record 6-million-plus votes in All-Star balloting, Seattle 
Mariner center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. referred to Texaco's sponsorship and 
said, "Well, this was the first year you could drive up for gas and vote for 
the All-Star team at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD MARINERS: Amid the unraveling season, Seattle has recalled 18-year-old 
Alex Rodriguez, the No. 1 selection in last year's draft, to play shortstop, 
with Felix Fermin moving to second. The Mariners led the American League in 
fielding last year but are last this year, their 65 errors through Wednesday 
having led to 57 unearned runs, only one fewer than they gave up all of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's recall represented a victory for Manager Lou Piniella, because 
General Manager Woody Woodward and double-A manager Marc Hill ostensibly 
opposed it, Hill saying Rodriguez is not ready offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Piniella said he cared only about Rodriguez's fielding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the major leagues, and if you want to win you've got to make plays," 
he said. "I've tried everybody they've given me in the middle of the infield. 
What it comes down to is you've got to make a trade for somebody to catch the 
ball or get help from the minors." 
</P>
<P>
 Traded Mariners, second baseman Brett Boone and shortstop Omar Vizquel, are 
hitting .300-plus with first-place teams: Boone with the Reds and Vizquel with 
the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 * NO HELP: If the Chicago Cubs' 34-47 record at midseason wasn't dismal 
enough, their seven farm teams were a combined 53 games under .500 at their 
halfway points. No wonder that General Manager Larry Himes will assign Manager 
Tom Trebelhorn and his coaches to the minor leagues if there is a work 
stoppage.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want them out there showing our young men how to play this game," Himes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * GOT THE MESSAGE: Thinking that 22-year-old right-hander John Roper had "big 
leagued it" last year while going 2-5 with the Reds and needed a change of work 
ethic, Manager Davey Johnson included Roper among the first players cut in 
spring training. The shock treatment worked. Roper opened the season 7-0 with 
Indianapolis and is 5-0 with the Reds. The two teams

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; DODGERS' FIRST HALF HELPS GLOSS OVER STRIKE TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In between the faxes and conference calls and other ways the owners follow the 
apparent meltdown to a strike, Peter O'Malley looks at the National League West 
standings and feels good about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very bright," the Dodger owner said of his club's future, if not 
baseball's. 
</P>
<P>
 First in the West Division at the All-Star break, the Dodgers can't be sure 
how long the race will last or if the playoffs will be wiped out by the latest 
labor problems, but O'Malley's optimism is based on the team's nucleus as much 
as on victories, defeats or the 1994 situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibility of an interruption is not pleasant, regardless of where we 
are in the standings, but I think everyone in the organization has to feel good 
about where the club is and how it sets up for the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farm system is producing again. The flow of talent is there again. We may 
have a third consecutive rookie of the year (in Raul Mondesi), and no club has 
ever done that (actually the Dodgers had four consecutive rookies of the year 
from 1979-82). We have two outstanding young pitchers in the minors (Chan Ho 
Park and Darren Dreifort)." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, now with double-A San Antonio, is sidelined because of a sore 
shoulder. Some believe that he, as a first year pro, was used inconsistently 
and indiscriminately as a relief pitcher whose role was not clearly defined 
(see closer Todd Worrell's recent complaints regarding his string of two-inning 
assignments). Some also believe Dreifort's current problem, which the Dodgers 
do not consider serious, was inevitable because of that pattern, a potentially 
costly leak in the redeveloped flow that includes a stockpile of promising 
young outfielders in triple A and more home-grown players on the major league 
roster than any club in either league. 
</P>
<P>
 The flow was interrupted for much of the '80s because of bad draft picks and 
the pressure of inconsistent opportunities for several young players who 
eventually were successful elsewhere. Now the composition might be more 
impressive than the competition. The Atlanta Braves moved East, and the San 
Francisco Giants have faltered. The Dodgers lead a four-team division with 
basically the same record that left them buried at last year's All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Can they play it out? Will there be baseball in October? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers seem as uncertain as O'Malley's position in the festering labor 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, he supports the Player Relations Committee's salary-cap proposal. 
Privately, however, he is linked to a big-market coalition that could live with 
the status quo and opposes a long work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone loses, particularly the fans," he said of a strike. "I'm optimistic. 
I think there's enough time to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a crisis environment yet. I mean, there's a lot of 
positioning on both sides. Don't be misled by the rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent rhetoric has included statements by Chicago White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf that surprised O'Malley. Reinsdorf said a strike has the potential to 
wipe out the 1995 season and extend into 1996, so determined are the owners to 
impose a salary cap and the players to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there have been no substantive negotiations. A crisis atmosphere seems 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The union flatly opposes a salary cap and has been unable to get answers, it 
insists, to the most basic questions pertaining to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Don Fehr, the union's executive director: "We're doomed to play out the 
scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing the owners will declare an impasse and unilaterally impose their 
salary cap if there is no agreement by the end of the World Series, the union 
contends its only leverage is to strike at some point in August or September, 
threatening the owners' postseason TV revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The union believes that the owners want a strike, which would make the players 
appear as bad guys and might challenge the solidarity that has held together 
through seven previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's executive board will meet in Pittsburgh on Monday, but a strike 
date is not expected to be set until after the union makes its own proposals -- 
designed only to make minor changes in the status quo -- late this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners wasted 18 months before making their salary-cap proposal. The union 
knew what was coming. Why has it waited so long before offering its own 
proposals? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the ones talking about how much the world has to change," Fehr said. 
THE RACES 
</P>
<P>
 It is a portrait in mediocrity, but the new division alignment and playoff 
format have given the owners what they wanted, even though it is in jeopardy. 
Using a 10-game deficit as the cutoff, 21 of the 28 teams reach the All-Star 
break with a shot at a division title or wild-card playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners receive an estimated 75% of their TV revenue from postseason play, 
but Reinsdorf was quoted in the Chicago Sun-Times as saying that the scenario 
he fears most is a strike that erases only the crucial games of September. He 
estimates that the White Sox would lose $10 million in potential revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would vote for almost any reasonable settlement," he said. "But I can't 
live with a half strike. By that, I mean a strike of a month, after which we 
come back for the postseason." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if the players go out, he would rather they stay out? 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf didn't say, but his thinking seems to be: If they go out, they 
should be allowed back only wearing the salary cap. HOPELESS HALOS 
</P>
<P>
 Before Buck Rodgers was so rudely interrupted by the Angels, he was saying how 
difficult it was to put together a rotation of pitchers who had been released 
by other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Honesty proved to be a bad policy for Rodgers, whose public comments were a 
factor in his firing. But has anyone since noticed that General Manager Bill 
Bavasi and staff obviously agree with Rodgers? 
</P>
<P>
 One released pitcher, John Farrell, has been re-released; a second, John 
Dopson, has been put on the disabled list; and two others, Joe Magrane and Mark 
Leiter, have been demoted to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there has still been no explanation or justification for Rodgers' 
firing. And don't look for one in the midseason standings. The Angels are 20-27 
under Marcel Lachemann after having gone 16-23 under Rodgers. Same basic team. 
Same basic results. 
</P>
<P>
 All the firing did was camouflage ownership's refusal to pay for another 
proven hitter in the middle of their basically young lineup and Bavasi's 
inability to deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing also took Plan A with it, which was to play Eduardo Perez at first 
base and Damion Easley at third. Now, J.T. Snow is again hitting .190 at first 
base and Spike Owen is risking life and limb at third while Perez -- who has 
gone from third base to left field to first base to third base again -- 
prepares to risk his fragile elbow there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels current plan? 1 -- Pursue the salary cap. 2 -- Build from within. 3 
-- Check with the accountants.

 have won 16 of his 18 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * ROYAL PAIN: The noose may be tightening for Hal McRae as the Kansas City 
Royals experience another disappointing season in his third full year. In 
response to boos from the home crowd when he changed pitchers Tuesday night, 
McRae said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous. They can boo me if they want, but if they're booing the 
strategy, they are the dumbest fans in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Royals heading for a third consecutive season under 2 million in 
attendance, General Manager Herk Robinson swallowed hard and said, "You can't 
condone Hal's remarks. They were inappropriate. I think he's remorseful, but 
that doesn't give him the right to be critical of our fans. We have good fans. 
We need our fans." 
</P>
<P>
 * JUICED: The strike zone is smaller and the pitching clearly thinner, but 
evidence also continues to point toward a livelier ball. With every team having 
played 80 games, one shy of half a season, major league home runs were up 416 
compared with last year and runs were up 848, including a staggering 677 in the 
punch-drunk American League. 
</P>
<P>
 The average batting average in the AL was .274, compared to .265 last year, 
and the NL was up only from .265 to .266. The attack has taken an obvious toll 
on earned-run averages. They are up in the AL from 4.29 to 4.87, and in the NL 
from 4.05 to 4.23. HALFWAY HONORS

</P>
<P>
 AL: Mike Hargrove, Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 NL: Felipe Alou, Expos. NO-WIN SITUATION 
</P>
<P>
 With fans electing the starters and every team required to have a 
representative, All-Star managers remain in an untenable position, unable to 
take every deserving player or avoid controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep adding teams, but the rosters remain at 28," American League 
Manager Cito Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to expand the rosters, whether every player gets in the game or not, 
he said, suggesting it is enough of an honor merely being there. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston was criticized last year when he selected four of his Toronto Blue Jays 
in addition to three who were elected as starters. He has been criticized again 
this year for selecting Paul Molitor and Pat Hentgen from his last-place Blue 
Jays, in addition to starters Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston acknowledged that the snubbed Jose Canseco and Julio Franco are as 
deserving as Molitor, who will be limited to pinch-hitting because of a sore 
shoulder and the absence of a designated hitter in the National League city, 
but added, "Molitor, after all, is a world champion, the most valuable player 
in the last World Series. The point is, you could avoid most of the problems if 
the roster was larger." 
</P>
<P>
 National League Manager Jim Fregosi, who selected pitchers Danny Jackson and 
Doug Jones from his Philadelphia Phillies in addition to starters Mariano 
Duncan and Lenny Dykstra -- still recovering from an appendectomy and replaced 
Friday by Marquiss Grissom of the Expos -- also took some heat, primarily in 
Cincinnati, where fans and players of the first-place Reds believed first 
baseman Hal Morris and second baseman Bret Boone should have been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you have to win a pennant and have your manager select the team," 
Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cincinnati outfielder Kevin Mitchell: "They took (Pittsburgh's) Carlos 
Garcia over Bret Boone? Hal Morris didn't make it? Man, this world needs an 
enema."

SHAKEN HEARLIHY SHAKES HERSELF; ALEMANY: AFTER A SEASON FLAWED BY EARTHQUAKE 
AND ONE DEFEAT, SHE PRESSES ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alemany High girls' basketball Coach Melissa Hearlihy gazes into her mental 
rearview mirror at the past season, marked by the birth of her first child and 
the greatest coaching success of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 And she shudders, seeing traumas that are closer than they appear. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of an unfulfilled season still gnaws at her, and she is reminded 
of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake at the end of every day, when she walks 
into a home that is not hers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the violent earthquake pitched Hearlihy and her 1-month-old son, Joshua, 
through a glass coffee table, Hearlihy refused to re-enter her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 She, Joshua and her husband, Bill, live in the home of one of her former 
players, but the memory of that horrifying night lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think was that (Joshua) was going to die," Hearlihy said 
recently, sitting in her school office while Joshua slept at her feet in a baby 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 She was nursing him that night when the earthquake hit, and she protected him 
by cradling him in her arms and shielding him with her body as they fell 
through the glass table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just remember screaming, and it was like the devil," she said. "The fright 
of it all and the terror of it all, I'll never forget. It traumatized me." 
</P>
<P>
 Less traumatizing but similarly memorable was the end of her team's turbulent 
dream season in the semifinals of the State playoffs in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-point defeat to Irvine Woodbridge was Alemany's only loss of the 
season and prevented the Indians from achieving their goal of advancing to the 
State championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the remarkable accomplishments: How Hearlihy led Alemany to the 
Southern Section Division II-A title and the most successful season in school 
history -- despite undergoing a Cesarean section birth in December, and then 
navigating her team through chaotic post-earthquake waters when the school and 
its gym were closed because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Hearlihy still focuses more on that one loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still bitter about it," she said. "I'm mad as hell because I think I 
should have been (in the State final). 
</P>
<P>
 "And when people say, 'You had a great season,' at some point I'll look back 
and reflect that yes, we did. But I just feel like we didn't do what we set out 
to do. I'm not sure we gave it our all, and that's the part that bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an interesting mix: unyielding pursuit of perfection and very human 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a State playoff game last season, Hearlihy politely shook the hand of 
each opposing player and wished her luck. After the last player turned away, a 
serious look crossed Hearlihy's face and she said to no one in particular: 
"That's the end of all the niceties. It's time to kick some (butt)." 
</P>
<P>
 And after that same game, she grew teary-eyed talking to reporters because of 
the unexpected success of Kathy Reith, a seldom-used Alemany reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 That combination of drive and compassion has catapulted Hearlihy from her 
starting point as an untried assistant 10 years ago to her place as one of the 
top young girls' coaches in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy, 32, has compiled a 200-47 record in nine seasons at Alemany, winning 
two Southern Section titles and twice leading her team to the State semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has created the Alemany name," said senior point guard Kathy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alemany name is synonymous with Hearlihy, the tall, goody two-shoes 
athlete from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Whittier, she moved with her family to Dallas when she was 6 years 
old. Her family moved a few more times and she ended up in Alvin, Tex., for 
junior high and high school, where she was a standout athlete in track and 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 She received early life lessons in overcoming adversity and caring for others 
-- lessons that serve her well as a coach -- by growing up with an alcoholic 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very fortunate that he was not a violent alcoholic," Hearlihy said. 
"But he definitely had a mean streak, in that he would come home mad a lot and 
my mother would have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Billie, was "the perfect role model," Hearlihy said, and she 
patterned herself after her mother by always looking after her younger 
siblings, Doug and Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never go out with my friends unless Doug and Stephanie came along, 
and my friends would get mad, but I would say, 'Tough.' I always took care of 
them and I think it made me a stronger person." 
</P>
<P>
 She also felt a desire to tread the straight-and-narrow path in high school: 
excellent grades, excelling in sports and -- because of her father -- shunning 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading her basketball team to the State playoff semifinals and 
finishing fifth in the state in the discus, she accepted a full scholarship to 
play basketball at Henderson County Junior College in Athens, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had to accept her parents' divorce while in college -- with 
surprising difficulty, considering her father's drinking problem and its effect 
on the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I had wanted my mother to do that, when it finally happened it was 
very hard to deal with," Hearlihy said. "That you were finally a statistic that 
everybody talked about -- that one in three people get divorced." 
</P>
<P>
 One pleasant recollection of her father -- whom Hearlihy has not seen in more 
than two years -- is his prediction that she would eventually become involved 
with kids and coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 She pooh-poohed the notion until she worked at a summer camp in college where 
she discovered the fulfillment and joy of working with young people. 
</P>
<P>
 So after playing her final two seasons of college basketball at the University 
of San Francisco, Hearlihy worked as a graduate assistant at UCLA for one year, 
and learned a valuable lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot about what college athletics are like, and I really didn't 
want to be a part of it," she said. "The things that are important to me -- and 
that is developing people and relationships -- are much more important at the 
high school level than at the collegiate level, where the athletic part of it 
is more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, a chance offer to coach in a girls' summer league led to an 
assistant's job at Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Nancy Graziano left after that season to take a college job, Hearlihy 
-- then Melissa Melton -- was a head coach at 23. 
</P>
<P>
 That first season, the Indians lost in the first round of the section 
playoffs, the earliest postseason exit in Hearlihy's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has steadily improved and Alemany has advanced to a Southern 
Section final for three consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy is a striking figure on the bench, standing 6-feet tall with long 
blond hair, and often screaming in a high-pitched voice at her players. 
</P>
<P>
 But her demanding coaching style pales in comparison to the commitment and 
caring she lavishes on her players. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can be a sister, a mother, a teacher," Brown said. "She seems to relate 
well to me, and she's got a sense of humor and she's very intelligent. She's 
the first to admit her own mistakes; she's not so high and mighty." 
</P>
<P>
 And though the accolades and awards now roll in with increasing frequency, 
Hearlihy counts her true success on the personal relationships she's cultivated 
through coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven of the 12 players on her first Alemany team attended her wedding in 
1992. She took wedding photos at the house of a player's parents, and the 
reception was held in the school's gymnasium, which her players and their 
parents spent two days decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest honor is not the championships and all that stuff on the walls," 
she said, indicating plaques and trophies. "What's important to me is when all 
those kids (from past teams) come back to watch the playoff games." 
</P>
<P>
 She said about 30 former players showed up for the Indians' section 
championship game. Hearlihy has engendered such commitment and sense of family 
by putting her players first. 
</P>
<P>
 She scheduled her 1992 wedding to make sure it would not interfere with the 
playoffs, and two months ago delayed a trip to celebrate her second anniversary 
to be present at The Times' All-Valley awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most striking example of her dedication came last winter when Joshua 
was born. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians left town for a preseason tournament in early December and 
Hearlihy had to remain behind because Joshua was due any day. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we pulled out of the driveway, she was in tears," Brown recalled. "It 
was like she was sending her 12 babies away to have another one." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wouldn't be easy. She spent three days in the hospital while doctors 
induced labor, but Joshua still wouldn't come. She returned after a day's rest 
to try again. No go. 
</P>
<P>
 So she underwent a Cesarean section birth, and Joshua was born on Dec. 15 
weighing 10 pounds 1 ounce and measuring 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 She told doctors and nurses she planned to coach again inside of a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They laughed at me," she recalled. "But this year, I felt like that was my 
commitment to get back to be there with them as soon as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later she prowled the sidelines during a game at the Simi Valley 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody in the gym was wondering what I was doing," she said. "But 
I wasn't going to let something get the best of me." 
</P>
<P>
 That self-reliance was sorely tested in the coming months. The exhaustion of 
staying up with Joshua every night after a full day of work was grinding her 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the earthquake hit, not only jolting her own life but those of her 
players as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of her players -- including Samantha Rigley, The Times' Valley player 
of the year -- had to move from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the school's campus and its gymnasium were closed due to structural damage 
(they have yet to reopen).  
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the Indians had no home court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearlihy spent as much time securing practice courts, game sites and driving 
the team to them as she did coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were snags. The day before Alemany's Southern Section championship 
game, the fifth-ranked team in the state practiced on an outdoor court. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Hearlihy would not let the team falter. Led by Rigley, Carly 
Funicello, Kelly McKay, Zevette Mitchell, Jen Stoughton and Brown, the Indians 
continued to win. 
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't playing as well as they did before the quake shook them to 
their core. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mater Dei coach (who saw Alemany early in the season and in the playoffs) 
said we were two different teams," Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I know, but what can you do?' The kids had no normality in their 
lives. We just had to the best we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Their best was good enough to win their first 30 games, but not the State 
championship. That fact still rankles Hearlihy and she readily admits it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she is putting it behind her. She and Bill are looking for a new 
home, summer league play has begun, and philosophic perspective is big on her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this was a little thing to make me go back," she said. "How great would 
it have been after this year to just quit and have a family? I don't know if I 
would have done it, because I do it for the kids and not for the championships, 
but it's like it was just enough to light a fire under me to show me how much 
hard work it takes no matter how good you are."

ALEMANY HIGH ATHLETIC PROGRAM IS ON THE BUBBLE; GYMNASIUM: DOMED TEMPORARY 
FACILITY GIVES INDIANS A PRACTICE FLOOR TO CALL THEIR OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It looks like a huge white caterpillar and the temperature inside is 
unbearable. There are no windows, and the only way in or out is through a 
stubborn revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Alemany High's temporary gymnasium, just one of the legacies the 
Northridge earthquake left after it rolled through the campus on Jan. 17 and 
caused over $6 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 With the old gym deemed unsafe and funds for repairs to the campus in limbo, 
Alemany administrators decided to erect the temporary facility 10 minutes away 
near the school's seminary at a cost of more than $150,000, according to 
Athletic Director Dudley Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been coming up with some names for this place, but some of them are 
unprintable," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new gym, which seats around 400, is enclosed by a canvas-like material 
that is inflated to form a dome over the court. People squeeze in one at a time 
through a revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, they must deal with daytime heat and the noise of a large fan that 
continuously blows air in to keep the dome inflated. Lighting is provided by 
high-powered lamps that shine through the bubble from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 AirDomes Inc., a Beaverton, Ore.-based company, produced the dome and a 
similar one for L.A. Baptist High. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer monitors changing weather conditions and adjusts the air pressure 
inside the bubble to withstand them. Otherwise, "it's really just like any 
brick-and-mortar building," said Jeff Hopkins, co-president of AirDomes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing touches, such as a cooling system, scoreboards and basketball 
backboards, still must be put in place, but when construction is complete, 
Alemany basketball, volleyball and wrestling teams will call this place home 
for at least the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you can call us the Bubble Boys," said Robert Webb, Alemany boys' 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Four teams -- boys' basketball, girls' basketball, wrestling and boys' 
volleyball -- were forced to practice and play home games elsewhere last winter 
after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We traveled to practice, traveled to games -- it was incredible," Webb said. 
"Logistically, it was such a problem because we had to travel every day." 
</P>
<P>
 None of Alemany's games were postponed, though, thanks to help from 
neighboring schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of positive experiences that came out of this for us," 
Rooney said. "There was a great spirit of cooperation from all the schools that 
helped us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sports that are currently in the middle of summer programs, such as boys' and 
girls' basketball and girls' volleyball, have to look for places to practice 
every day until finishing touches can be put on the temporary gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a tough time, but we're fighting through it real well," said junior 
Adrian Pantoja, captain of the boys' basketball team. "We're showing a lot of 
pride and we're playing really good under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney has asked Webb if his team would play in the makeshift gym this season, 
but Webb said he would not decide until he sees the gym himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we wouldn't play there," Webb said. "It's just that we can't 
expect league teams to play in a place that is less than acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany High officials will not know when repairs on the campus will begin 
until the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and Federal Emergency Management Agency 
finish negotiating a final dollar figure for aid to the school. Funding for all 
of the school's temporary facilities has been provided by the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, damage to the campus has not hurt the Catholic school's enrollment, 
with 410 freshmen expected to join the 1,650 student body next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what's going on with repairs, but we sell Alemany as an 
academic school and a people school," Rooney said. "We don't look at Alemany as 
just a bunch of buildings."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; IT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME HE WATCHES IT

 He watched the catch on replay about four times Friday night, then a few more 
times at home, then got up Saturday morning and watched it again. "I've seen it 
about 10 times," said Brett Butler, referring to a spectacular over-the-wall 
catch he made in Friday night's game to rob Todd Hundley of a three-run homer 
and preserve a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, is you walk through it every time," Butler said. "I want a tape 
of it, obviously, to show the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler has never won a gold glove and never been voted into an All-Star game 
in 14 seasons. "I've wondered why, but after 14 years, you just stop 
wondering," he said. In 1991, Butler was named to the All-Star team as a 
reserve.

 Mike Piazza is the Dodgers' representative at the players' association meeting 
Monday in Pittsburgh, but he believes he will still be able to participate in 
the home run contest that day during All-Star festivities. "I can't do any 
worse then last year," said Piazza, who was shut out last year. "I think it's 
just a mental thing. It was so new to me I really wasn't comfortable, but I 
still enjoyed it." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi did not make the National League All-Star team and said there are 
people in the Dominican Republic who were angry about it. He's not, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked it, and I think I have done well," Mondesi said. "I think 
I have the numbers -- hitting over .300 with 14 home runs and 45 RBIs. But 
Andres Galarraga (not making it) is the one I don't understand. How could he 
not make it? But it's my first year. I have a lot of years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday's game, Mondesi ranked in the top 10 in the league with a .322 
batting average, 106 hits, five triples and 13 assists. MARYANN HUDSON

 The American League office can't stand the thought of it, but here it is, the 
All-Star break, and the worst fears are realized. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not a team in the American League West with a winning record. The 
teams are a cumulative 46 games below .500. It is so bad that the Texas 
Rangers, who are in first place with a 42-44 record in the AL West, are 9 1/2 
games behind in the wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
 It brings back memories of the 1973 National League East race, when the New 
York Mets were 70-75 on Sept. 12 and won the division with an 82-79 record. 
Although the Mets were the only team to finish higher than .500, five teams 
finished within five games of first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember as much talk about the futility as there is right now," said 
former Angel manager Gene Mauch, whose Montreal Expo team finished 3 1/2 games 
out in '73. "There isn't one team in that whole division that seems to have a 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of teams develop a personality as the year goes on, but I don't see one 
from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Mark Leiter, on Ken Griffey Jr.'s pursuit of Roger Maris' 
home-run record: "I find it difficult to believe that he'll do it, but I wonder 
what they'll say if he hits 63 homers and Frank Thomas hits 61. What if you 
have 10 guys hitting at least 50 homers? 
</P>
<P>
 "After the owners get done paying those guys, maybe then they'd do something 
for the pitchers. Believe me, this isn't all about a lack of pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Leiter still is perplexed as to why he was taken out of the starting 
rotation, and still would love a shot at the closer's role, he says that he 
won't go into Manager Marcel Lachemann's office and request it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the manager was so easy to go talk to," Leiter said, "you'd have nine 
cleanup hitters on the team and everybody would be a closer or starter." BOB

THESE MATES KEEP OPPONENTS IN CHECK; NELSON, DUESLER BEAT DOUBLES COMPETITION 
WITH WELL-PLACED SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They like to call it chess tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the 100 m.p.h. serves and the blazing forehand shots that lift players 
off their feet. Those are for the kids, the would-be pros. For the top senior 
players, it's a lob here, a drop shot there, and a tough-to-reach angle shot 
when it's least expected. And there's always plenty of good-natured banter in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you want to see two of the best practitioners, look no further than the 
doubles team of Jim Nelson of Irvine and Bob Duesler of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you can call us finesse players because we don't play with a lot of 
power," Duesler said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have a lot of fun with it," Nelson said. "The camaraderie and the 
competition is what's important since none of us at our level are making a 
living at the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, they've certainly taken success in the senior game to a high 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 They are ranked No. 1 in the nation by the United States Tennis Assn. in men's 
55 doubles. Nelson is No. 2 in 55 singles and Duesler is seventh. Together 
they've won so many championships that they no longer keep track of the exact 
number, and they'll be going for another one when the National 50-55 Hard 
Courts are held July 18-24 at the Lindborg Racquet Club in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Both also have played frequently on the U.S. Dubler Cup and Austria Cup teams, 
which compete internationally in senior tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob and I started playing doubles together in 1982, and we had real good 
success right away," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's putting it mildly. That first year they had a grand slam in the USTA 
national championships in the 45-and-over division. They won on grass at 
Philadelphia, on clay at Sarasota, on the hard courts at La Jolla and indoors 
at Salt Lake City. They've continued to play together since, although both have 
teamed with other partners during that span as well, primarily when their ages 
don't match up for the division at any given time. Nelson is 58, Duesler 57. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have done well with other partners. Nelson played the USTA national 
tournament circuit with Lenny Lindborg of Laguna Niguel in 1990, and they won 
all four of the major tournaments in the 55s. Nelson then rejoined Duesler when 
Duesler became eligible for the 55s. Duesler also has been successful with, 
among others, Hank Leichtfried of Irvine. Leichtfried and Lindborg, owner of 
the tennis facility where the nationals will be held, also have played together 
with considerable success nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nelson and Duesler are like interchangeable player parts," said Newport Beach 
senior player Earl Philpot, who has competed against both and watched them 
through the years. "They both have the kind of ability to turn whoever they 
play with into a really good team." 
</P>
<P>
 An important asset for both is that they've maintained their speed and 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both still have the wheels," Philpot said. "They have excellent foot 
speed, which can be a big factor in senior tennis. And they move well together 
on the court and always seem to know what the other player is going to do 
before he does it." Nelson and Duesler also feel they've been fortunate to have 
avoided injuries through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really helped," Nelson said. "A lot of guys our age are coming up with 
bad knees and bad hips, so I have to be grateful for being healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindborg said the success of the Nelson-Duesler team is as much mental as 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't just play one type of game," Lindborg said. "They're able to do a 
lot of different things. Jim can really pick out an opponent's flaws and then 
work on them. Playing Nelson is like trying to get a gnat off your back, and 
Bob is really consistent. And I think Jim is tougher than anybody on the big 
points." Both of them can change a game on a moment's notice with their lobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're two of the best lobbers to come down the pike," Philpot said. 
"I remember a match they played against (Ron) Livingston and (Dick) Leech in 
the finals of a national tournament at Lindborg in the late 1980s when they 
must have thrown up a hundred lobs. When that match was over Leech could hardly 
lift up his arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Duesler was a star player in high school and was the No. 1 singles player 
later at Purdue. Nelson also played in college, but didn't come into his own as 
a top player until later when he was in the Army. "They pick six guys for the 
all-Army team and I made it my second year," Nelson said. "That got me a lot 
more interested in tennis. Later I started playing some national tournaments in 
the 35s, but I didn't win any. At that point, I still was on a learning curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a stock broker, took advantage of the early start of his workday 
because of the market's opening to get on the tennis court frequently in the 
late afternoon, and his game kept improving as he moved into his 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teacher at Marina High in Huntington Beach, Duesler also was able to 
spend the summers later in his teaching career working on his game. He recently 
took early retirement, which now will enable him to travel to more tournaments 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to that," said Duesler, who is planning a trip to Europe 
next month to play in three clay court tournaments, two in Germany and one in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and Duesler don't appear to have lost any of their enthusiasm for the 
game. Nelson, in particular, also is active in various tennis organizations. 
"Tennis has been very good to me over the years, and I want to contribute that 
way, as well." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no danger of burnout for either one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still really fun," Duesler said. "And we try to keep it that way."

THE FIRST PENSION FALLOUT IN O.C.; LITIGATION: SUPREME COURT HAS LIMITED SUITS 
BY DEFRAUDED INVESTORS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES. BUT A LOCAL BANK AND A THRIFT ARE 
STILL WORRIED ABOUT POTENTIAL LIABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of First Pension Corp.'s failure, some companies that did business 
with the Irvine pension management firm are worried that investors who lost 
money in the collapse might try to put part of the blame on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in April that limits lawsuits by defrauded 
investors against third parties -- lawyers, accountants and bankers -- 
CommerceBancorp of Newport Beach and Monarch Bank of Laguna Niguel, both of 
which held funds for First Pension, are concerned about their exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done fairly exhaustive legal and audit work to recover records. I went 
through every wire transfer myself," said Lynn Caswell, president of Monarch, a 
two-branch community bank founded in 1980. "The cash assets are all accounted 
for, and we don't think we have any liability." 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBancorp went even further. On June 27, the thrift, which is 
undercapitalized and at risk of being taken over by federal regulators, put off 
a $14-million stock offering that would have brought in badly needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We postponed it until we can quantify what liability exists," said Dale E. 
Walter, the thrift's president. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers' concern is that people who used First Pension to direct their 
retirement investments may take legal action against not only the management 
firm's owners but also against companies with which it had dealings. Lawsuits 
by investors in securities fraud cases in the past have targeted "deep pocket" 
companies -- such as banks, law and accounting firms hired by the perpetrators 
-- because the promoters were broke, having either spent or lost the money they 
gained illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While there is some comfort in the Supreme Court decision, it does not erase 
the banks' fears that they might be caught up in costly and time-consuming 
First Pension-related litigation that could be damaging even if they are 
cleared, a banking attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with the recent ruling, bankers take this very seriously," said Thomas 
J. Prenovost, a banking attorney in Santa Ana who is helping to evaluate 
Monarch's situation. "I think the dollar amounts involved with First Pension 
make it much more of a concern, and I think that's why Commerce pulled their 
stock offering."  
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that First Pension operated 
an elaborate pyramid scheme, misleading clients into investing in nonexistent 
mortgages. As much as $124 million of investors' money may have been lost to 
fraud and outright theft, the SEC has said. The company, which had an estimated 
8,000 clients and accounts valued at $350 million, filed April 22 for 
liquidation under federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James Krause, who filed a class-action lawsuit for First Pension 
investors on Thursday against the investment company's owners, said the court 
ruling does not give banks immunity from investor lawsuits. He expects more 
legal action to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we can still sue them, all third parties, if they did something 
wrong, but it may be for state negligence or other viable claims," Krause said. 
"If we think there was a legitimate cause for claims, we would take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two Orange County financial institutions, CommerceBancorp, which held 
about $10 million in First Pension deposits, would appear to be at greater risk 
because of its precarious financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 With assets of about $158 million, the thrift, as of March 31, had a 
capital-to-assets ratio of just 2.14%, far below the 6.5% required by federal 
law. The company's stock was taken off the Nasdaq trading system earlier this 
year and now trades on Nasdaq's SmallCap Market, a system for companies with 
little capital and low stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bank has postponed its stock offering, it cannot beef up its 
capital as planned. "The longer the delay, the greater chance of actions taking 
place" by regulators, Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bank were seized by regulators, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
might cover any existing First Pension deposits for up to $100,000 in each 
account, depending on the circumstances, said Andrew Porterfield, spokesman for 
the FDIC in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may cover for fraud after the bank is closed, but it would depend on many 
factors, such as how the deposits are booked and what the collateral was," 
Porterfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch Bank officials express confidence that they will not be harmed from 
their business association with First Pension, for which the bank served as a 
trustee from July, 1992, to September, 1993, Caswell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say we have no concern whatsoever," bank President Caswell said, "but 
as far as we can tell, every penny that we handled is accounted for." 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew Snyder, trustee for Summit Trust Services, the custodian bank 
formed by Cooper in Denver to handle First Pension retirement funds, said he 
was examining wire transfers from Monarch to other First Pension entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not yet in a position to say that everything is kosher with Monarch," 
Snyder said. Monarch, which held as much as $5 million in First Pension funds 
at times, Caswell said, is also planning a stock offering, a $2.5-million issue 
that it would use for a five-year expansion plan and to raise its capital 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Monarch had more than a custodial relationship with First Pension. One 
of First Pension's three principals, Robert E. Lindley, was Monarch director 
from January, 1992, to January, 1994, and owned 4% of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindley left the board three months before First Pension's bankruptcy filing, 
citing business troubles and saying he was moving to Arizona, Caswell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot of due diligence on Mr. Lindley before he joined our board. We 
came up with nothing," Caswell said. "He seemed like a straight arrow and was 
well-known in the business community in south Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Another company that could be affected by First Pension's failure is the 
national accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, which was listed in promotional 
material as a reference for the investment management company. It is not clear, 
however, whether the firm ever actually audited First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony to the SEC, Ana Maritza Golan, First Pension's operations 
manager, said: "We have never been audited by anyone since I've been here, 
which is in my opinion a slight miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 And a former employee of First Pension's brokerage division, Roger Rusch), 
told the SEC that he requested a "full-blown" audit of the investment firm's 
mortgage pools several times. But William E. Cooper, one of First Pension's 
principals, stalled, Rusch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every justification that you could think of . . . over a period of time was 
used," he told the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Several investors stated at a recent First Pension bankruptcy hearing that 
Coopers & Lybrand did, in fact, audit one of the company's mortgage pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Garrett, general counsel for Coopers & Lybrand at its New York 
headquarters, said last week that he was not familiar with the First Pension 
situation and that, as far as he knew, the accounting firm had no connection 
with the pension fund administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will put our names down for the damnedest things," Garrett said. "They 
list us as a reference, and we don't even know about it. As far as I know, 
we've never been dragged into a legal case when we've just been listed as a 
reference." The First Pension Pyramid 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension Corp. operated through a tangled maze of affiliated companies, 
allegedly operating an elaborate pyramid scheme that resulted in the 
disappearance of more than $124 million in retirement money.

</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based First Pension Corp. is accused of defrauding thousands of 
investors of more than$124 million in what officials described as an elaborate 
Ponzi scheme. A chronology of events: 
</P>
<P>
 1980 
</P>
<P>
 * May 8: First Pension Corp. is incorporated with the California Department of 
Corporations. Co-owner Valerie Jensen is listed as the registered agent. The 
other owners are William E. Cooper and Robert Lindley. 
</P>
<P>
 1987 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 12: First Pension files notices with a California agency, contending 
that each of 23 virtually identical real estate investment pools are exempt 
from regulation as a public securities offering because they would be offered 
to no more than 35 sophisticated investors. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 10: Summit Trust Services, a company in Denver created by First 
Pension's chairman Cooper to manage client funds, purportedly holds its annual 
board of directors meeting in Aliso Viejo at an address that an investigation 
later revealed was actually a Mailboxes Etc. location where the company had a 
registered postal box. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 5: Jensen, First Pension's president, resigns, citing job stress. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 21: Colorado banking regulators seize Summit Trust. Regulators appoint 
Andrew C. Snyder to take charge of the assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 22: First Pension files for protection from creditors in an Orange 
County federal bankruptcy court. Stunned investors flood the firm's switchboard 
with calls. 
</P>
<P>

First Pension used a massive pyramid scheme to defraud investors out of as much 
as $124 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 26: A preliminary injunction requested by the SEC is issued to freeze 
First Pension's assets along with the assets of its three principals. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 31: Approximately 150 angry investors pack federal bankruptcy court in 
Santa Ana. Snyder, the court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust, tells 
investors that only about 30% of investor funds are accounted for.  
</P>
<P>
 * June 1: Investigators reveal that Cooper, Jensen and Lindley have signed 
agreements to cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, while 
also agreeing to plead guilty to as-yet-unspecified fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 10: SEC officials ask a federal judge to jail First Pension owners 
Cooper, Jensen and Lindley for contempt of court for refusing to turn over 
financial records under a court order. The request is subject to a hearing 
scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 28: CommerceBancorp in Newport Beach postpones a stock offering that 
would have brought in desperately needed capital, citing liability concerns 
over its past business dealings with First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 7: Investor group files a class-action suit against First Pension in a 
Santa Ana court, hoping to regain some of the money they lost in dealings with 
the failed pension management firm.

JAMES FLANIGAN: ETHANOL PROMOTER UNDERSTANDS ECONOMIC ENGINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Money is the mother's milk of politics," the late Jesse Unruh, California's 
powerful Assembly speaker, used to say. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you want to see how right he was, take a look at the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's recent ruling that oxygen compounds from renewable sources 
must be added to gasoline next year in Los Angeles and other smoggy cities, 
including New York, Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling means, in effect, that ethanol -- an alcohol fuel derived from corn 
-- will be a gasoline additive beginning next year, opening up a new market for 
250 million bushels of corn, or 3% of the U.S. corn crop. 
</P>
<P>
 It also will mean a 3-to-5-cents-a-gallon rise in gasoline prices, despite a 
tax exemption for ethanol. 
</P>
<P>
 Howls of protest greeted the EPA's June 30 ruling. Environmentalists sneered 
at ethanol's ability to clean the air. The oil industry complained that 
methanol from natural gas was not mandated for use. And skeptics everywhere 
smiled at the politics of the Clinton Administration buying farm votes by 
supporting a corn-based fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the usual arguments and half-truths from Washington, ethanol 
offered an even better story of how the U.S. economy really functions. It's a 
pertinent story whether you are in business or an investor or simply an 
interested citizen and taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no better weekend to think about such matters, because President 
Clinton and the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, plus 
Russia's Boris Yeltsin, are meeting in Naples, Italy, arguing over charts and 
graphs about how to improve the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 They're wasting their time. The U.S. economy doesn't run on charts and graphs 
or economic theories, but on the visions and actions of energetic human beings, 
who pursue ambitious goals with single-minded intensity -- and considerable 
help from government. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind ethanol's growing place in U.S. energy stands Dwayne Andreas, 76, 
longtime friend of U.S. Presidents and chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, a 
$10-billion-a-year grain-processing company. 
</P>
<P>
 ADM produces more than 60% of the nation's ethanol, and Andreas has made a 
career of promoting its use. It was noted in newspaper stories last week that 
he and his company have become generous contributors to the Democratic Party, 
the implication being that ready cash got results in the EPA ruling.  
</P>
<P>
 But it takes more than a couple of cash donations to make national policy. It 
takes work and clout -- and cash donations. Ethanol got the nod because it is 
derived from corn, and therefore has a strong farm vote behind it -- and 
because Andreas persuaded the Bush Administration, to which he was also a major 
financial contributor, to give ethanol a waiver making it acceptable under the 
Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethanol's credentials are ambiguous. As an alcohol, ethanol evaporates more 
quickly than petroleum fuels, so environmentalists say it adds to air quality 
problems. But it also alleviates them by adding oxygen to gasoline, thus making 
combustion more complete and reducing carbon monoxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Denver uses ethanol in 70% of its gasoline in winter, says Barbara 
Charnes, head of Coloradans for Clean Air. "It has reduced carbon monoxide 
dramatically," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientifically, methanol from natural gas would also reduce carbon monoxide, 
but politically, natural gas doesn't have scores of farm state congressional 
votes or Dwayne Andreas behind it. Nor does it arouse Midwestern excitement 
about new business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ethanol could create a whole new industry," says William Biederman, vice 
president of Allendale Inc., an investment firm in Crystal Lake, Ill. "We've 
had visitors come through here from Taiwan, Japan and Mexico, very interested 
in using grain to make fuel."  
</P>
<P>
 Amid enthusiasm, the difficulties for ethanol should not be overlooked. Its 
exemption from excise taxes on gasoline will come under attack. Court 
challenges from oil or environmental interests are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's to be expected among the contending forces that make up the U.S. 
economy. And ethanol, as the first of many fuels from renewable sources, will 
probably hold its own -- Andreas knows his way around courtrooms too. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time Andreas has created a business. He pushed fructose 
corn syrup as a sweetener for soft drinks in the 1970s -- a good business for 
ADM because its plants produce corn syrup in summer when drink sales are high 
and ethanol in winter when fuel needs are greater. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he could sell syrup to soft drink makers, Andreas had to lobby in 
Washington to keep quotas on cheap, imported sugar. He did so successfully, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreas -- who left Wheaton College in Depression-era 1936 to go to work in 
agribusiness and has amassed a fortune of more than $300 million in the stock 
of ADM -- goes away back with politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Minnesota, he was a good friend of the late Hubert H. Humphrey and was 
also a friend of the late President Richard Nixon -- as well as every President 
back to Harry Truman. (Andreas recently gave $1 million to the Center for Peace 
and Freedom at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda.) 
</P>
<P>
 But how do you become a friend of Presidents while making a fortune and 
building an industry? You work at it. Andreas was a pioneer in pushing grain 
sales to the Soviet Union in the 1970s, creating an export business that has 
benefited the whole U.S. farm sector. He remains a leader in helping 
agriculture in the former Soviet lands. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pushed the use of soy-based protein foods to alleviate hunger in India, 
and marketed Harvest Burgers to cholesterol-conscious Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a force for good in agriculture," says analyst George Dahlman of 
Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, a Minneapolis investment firm. His critics put it 
differently, if no less admiringly: "You have to respect Andreas' ability to 
milk the system," says one. 
</P>
<P>
 More accurate to say that Andreas has contributed to the U.S. economic system, 
and the system has rewarded him. And while it may not always be rational or 
theoretically pure, that's how the U.S. economy works. Jess Unruh and Dwayne 
Andreas understood that without becoming cynical, and so should we.

THE DEATH OF A FACTORY; ALCOA CLOSURE BEGS THE AGONIZING QUESTION: COULD IT 
HAVE BEEN AVOIDED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the shock, it is a blue-collar lament heard many times before: A 
once-bustling factory shuts its doors and a swarm of jobless workers hits the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But if each shutdown is its own tale of agony, the impending death of Alcoa's 
56-year-old Vernon Works plant, near Downtown Los Angeles, is extraordinary 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Because in the dreary litany of plant shutdowns in Southern California, it 
appears that this one factory might have stayed open -- the jobs saved and the 
anguish avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there were charges of broken trust, an outpouring of anger and, 
ultimately, a labor-management rift that grew wider than the 50-acre plant 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like we're getting shut down because people won't talk," laments 
George Rodriguez, 36, a furnace operator and one of more than 600 aluminum 
workers who will lose their jobs as the plant closes, probably by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the factory complex has been a sturdy fixture on the gritty 
industrial landscape near the Long Beach Freeway. Recession, defense cuts, 
competition -- the Vernon Works had survived them all. Its high-strength metals 
were used in aircraft, racing cars, softball bats and other products. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant employed parents and children, aunts and uncles -- among them 
reportedly a grandfather, son and grandson from the same family. 
</P>
<P>
 Many identified closely with the factory, where union salaries enabled 
ordinary working people to afford a house, a new car, maybe college tuition for 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Roberts, 61, moved from the coal country of eastern Pennsylvania to the 
factory world of Southern California in the 1950s. He was able to support a 
family of six on his Alcoa pay. It was an era when workers often felt loyalty 
toward their employers and typically were rewarded with wages affording a 
rising standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times have changed," Roberts says. "People have changed, and I think Alcoa's 
corporate thinking has changed. Personally, I feel sorry for the younger 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, the situation in Vernon took a crazy turn. Pittsburgh-based 
Alcoa abruptly asked the United Auto Workers to reopen the three-year contract 
signed in June, 1993. The workers were flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mind-boggling!" said Gene Hurd, president of UAW Local 808, describing 
Alcoa's bid to start the bargaining all oover again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mind-boggling!" William R. Kvochak, a plant general manager and vice 
president, said of the union members' answer. It was no. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time Aluminum Co. of America had asked its employees for 
concessions, and the Vernon workers believed they had made their share of 
sacrifices over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the union reluctantly accepted a two-tier pay system under which new 
hires' wages often would be $3 an hour less than those of others doing the same 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor and management also had cooperated on disciplining workers who played 
hooky and on improving workplace safety. They had agreed to reduced vacation 
benefits and changes in employee medical coverage. Since the mid-1980s, the 
Alcoa workers had endorsed contracts with raises that barely kept them ahead of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the UAW and Alcoa agreed on a three-year contract, the 
employees expected their jobs to be safe for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa even awarded a $1,300 bonus for accepting the agreement, under which 
wages ranged from $8 to $16 an hour. Rodriguez went out and bought a house in 
Riverside. Some of his co-workers bought new cars and other costly items. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we had three years" of job security, Rodriguez says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, grave problems continued to endanger the health of the plant. 
Powerful global market forces were buffeting Alcoa. Russia was flooding the 
West with aluminum, battering the corporation's bottom line and disrupting the 
entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon, meanwhile, was competing with non-union shops in Anaheim and Santa Ana 
that reportedly enjoyed a $10-an-hour advantage on labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Alcoa executives were increasingly disappointed with the pace 
of jetliner construction in recent years. The lull meant declining orders for 
aluminum from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and other airplane builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business just kept deteriorating," said William R. Kvochak, a vice president 
and general manager at the plant. "We really had no choice but to see if, 
collectively, we could save the business." 
</P>
<P>
 In several meetings in the second week of March, company officials warned the 
workers that refusing to reconsider their wages and benefits could trigger a 
shutdown. Alcoa did not spell out what concessions it was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, about 400 members of UAW Local 808 gathered in Paramount to 
decide on a response. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of bitterness filled the union hall, some who attended recall. The 
workers felt betrayed, and the tension was also awkward for the UAW hierarchy, 
which has seen the union's overall membership slip from 1.4 million in the late 
1970s to 800,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
 UAW International representatives from Detroit, backed by regional union 
officials in Artesia, drew an angry response when they recommended that the 
workers hear what the company had to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were screaming like crazy," recalled Rosa Nunez, a Vernon plant 
employee for six years. "It wasn't communication." 
</P>
<P>
 There was another kind of uneasiness in the hall as well. A schism between 
generations was felt by at least some of those present. 
</P>
<P>
 One in three members of the local was qualified for retirement benefits. For 
the younger employees, however, plant closure was a tougher proposition, albeit 
cushioned by jobless benefits for 18 months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunez, 40, says she holds no ill will toward older colleagues, but she offers 
a blunt analysis of what happened at the fateful meeting:  
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, you're going to vote not to open the contract -- because you're going 
to go home and rest and watch TV and get your check every week." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the vote to reject Alcoa's request was made by a unanimous show of 
hands and supported by workers young and old. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends told me, 'You're going to be in trouble if you leave your arm 
down," ' says Nunez, who is now working to start a child care business. "I felt 
the pressure, and I put my arm up." 
</P>
<P>
 That Monday, in compliance with a 1988 federal plant-closure law, Alcoa 
announced that it planned to shut down the Vernon Works. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not an epic event in California industry. Los Angeles County alone has 
lost 167,400 of its high-paying industrial jobs since early 1990 -- and more 
than 250,000 jobs since the peak in 1979 -- as employers leave the region -- 
and often the nation -- in pursuit of cheaper labor, less red tape and other 
cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more famous names survive as relics on the map: Firestone 
Boulevard, and now Alcoa Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 South Gate was walloped by closures of a Firestone tire factory and a General 
Motors assembly plant in the early 1980s. Ford in Pico Rivera, Chrysler in 
Commerce, Kaiser Steel in Fontana, GM in Van Nuys -- the stories are similar. 
</P>
<P>
 According to labor economist Goetz Wolff, who compiled the Los Angeles 
figures, closure of the Vernon Works "illustrates the bleeding" that continues. 
</P>
<P>
 But if many mourn heavy industry, others warn against getting sentimental: The 
future, they say, belongs to newer, more competitive manufacturers in Southern 
California that make everything from designer drugs to specialized software. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of an Alcoa or a GM may be distressing, but it falls within the 
normal flux of a dynamic economy, they assert. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Alcoa -- a powerhouse whose growing empire employs 63,000 people 
at 164 operations in 24 countries -- was acting in line with other U.S. 
corporations that have sought changes to improve productivity. Layoffs, 
consolidations and other measures have won plaudits from economists who believe 
that U.S. industry has gained muscle in the painful process and that the nation 
ultimately will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa "can't control the price of aluminum," notes Charles A. Bradford, an 
analyst at UBS Securities in New York. "The real key is to be the low-cost 
producer. Otherwise, you're not going to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nagging questions make it difficult to write an obituary for the Vernon 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the workers make a grievous mistake and doom their own jobs by refusing to 
reopen the contract? Did Alcoa, bent on cost cutting, plan to unplug the 
factory no matter what? 
</P>
<P>
 Threatening to shut down a factory is a classic form of management pressure 
used at contract time, one that leads to a perilous game of who-blinks-first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies say this all the time. Sometimes they mean it and sometimes they 
don't," says Richard Rothstein, a research associate at the Economic Policy 
Institute and a former labor negotiator. "Sometimes unions guess right and 
sometimes unions guess wrong. Sometimes companies guess right and sometimes 
companies guess wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 As some employees see it, one part of Alcoa's explanation for wanting to 
reopen the bargaining -- the aerospace slump -- is dubious because that slump 
had been going on for years. Surely, the workers figured, aerospace ups and 
downs were built into Alcoa's thinking long before 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't trust them any longer," says Rodriguez, a father of three who makes 
$13.70 an hour. "Alcoa is a big corporation. If they give us a signing bonus in 
July and then come right back to say, 'We need concessions,' something smells." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the workers interviewed said they believed the shutdown ultimatum was 
just talk, or would apply only to the least profitable sections of the factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was the anger. Many employees felt they had been asked for 
concessions "one too many times," says Hurd. 
</P>
<P>
 From the management side, a profoundly different view emerges. 
</P>
<P>
 Kvochak is a soft-spoken manager whose three stints at the plant add up to 18 
years. He maintains that the beleaguered factory could have been rescued with a 
new labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent stroll through one of its cavernous buildings, now mostly vacant 
except for scattered piles of shiny metal tubes and other unfinished materials, 
Kvochak points to a $200,000 concrete floor that was installed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was some predestined plan to shut this place down, we wouldn't have 
spent the money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the labor-management breach, Kvochak speaks with affection of his 
former employees and the factory complex that was their home for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great place," he says, walking past furnaces and machines that are 
mostly silent now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are great people. It's really sad. Really sad." Factory Jobs 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has lost more than 250,000 manufacturing jobs since its 
all-time peak in 1979, while non-manufacturing jobs have increased. Heavy 
industry, including many high-paying unionized jobs, has been hit the hardest. 
In the job index below, 1979 = 100.

Aluminum Prices 
</P>
<P>
 As the Soviet Union fell apart, Russia flooded the West with aluminum in a bid 
to earn hard currency for its battered economy. Worldwide aluminum prices 
collapsed in 1990 and remain at low levels. Quarterly prices per pound, in 
cents:

THE SELLING OF THE STATE; AS RUSSIA ENTERS PHASE TWO OF PRIVATIZATION, JURY 
STILL OUT ON WHETHER ECONOMY CAN BE SAVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting in 1917, they took it all away. In history textbooks of the future, 
1994 will probably be marked as the year they gave it all back. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian reformers recently completed the first phase of the most colossal 
program in history to sell off state property to new private owners. The heirs 
to the Communist regime that snatched almost all private property after the 
1917 Bolshevik Revolution are now on a crash program to create a new 
bourgeoisie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin handed out 148 million vouchers giving each Russian a piece of the 
country's wealth; it turned 15,000 factories from state vassals into something 
approaching corporations; it transformed its smaller businesses into hundreds 
of thousands of mom-and-pop outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale and complexity of the privatization program, seen as the best-run of 
the Kremlin's reforms, are astounding. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing remains unclear. Did it succeed? Will this Gargantuan effort save 
Russia's shattered economy? 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus among observers is that it is too early to tell. But if it 
doesn't work for Iosif Bakaleynik, Harvard Business School honors grad, 
international finance maven and familiar face at the massive Vladimir Tractor 
Works, it won't work for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Privatization has already shown its worth in that it brought Bakaleynik, a 
calm, bespectacled 42-year-old, back from a cushy job at International Finance 
Corp. in Washington. What drew him was the promise of a chance to buy a big 
chunk of the 10,000-worker factory if all goes well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be interested in being here under the old system," said 
Bakaleynik, at work despite a wicked head cold in his dim, spacious new office. 
"And I wouldn't be needed." 
</P>
<P>
 But the real test comes now, in the second phase, when the process shifts from 
a largely political sop to a drive to make Russia's factories run efficiently 
and gain the investment they desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that privatization so far hasn't done enough," Bakaleynik said. 
"Even just to consolidate its political gains, it must bring economic gains." 
</P>
<P>
 The great Russian selloff began in October, 1992, after Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin announced that every man, woman and child in Russia would 
receive a privatization voucher, a certificate with a face value of 10,000 
rubles -- then about $32 -- that could be sold or invested. 
</P>
<P>
 The vouchers were meant to make Russians feel as if they were getting a piece 
of the country they had helped build during the Communist years, when the state 
owned everything. They also aimed to widen the political base for Russia's 
market reforms by making people feel like owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The voucher scheme was far from ideal. Even Anatoly Chubais, the privatization 
czar who has rammed the program through against great opposition from 
entrenched factory directors, said at one point that he himself opposed 
vouchers -- but "you have to do what's necessary, not what you feel like." 
</P>
<P>
 What was necessary was to start the process fast even though there was little 
money floating around to buy up state enterprises, and to do it in a way that 
Russians, with their keen sense of social justice, saw as fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff turned largely into a giveaway, the greatest bargain basement of 
all time. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures vary, but it appears that the 70% of Russian industry privatized in 
the last two years -- sold in part for vouchers and in part at low prices to 
the personnel of the factories up for sale -- has brought to state coffers the 
measly sum of about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the vouchers are no longer valid in most places, and the remaining 20% of 
Russian factories to be privatized -- 10% are considered too strategic to be 
let out of government hands -- will go for cold cash. Also, workers and 
directors will no longer get special deals allowing them to grab a big chunk of 
their own factories. 
</P>
<P>
 This, Russian commentators say, will be the moment of truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only now will we see how much property is in the hands of directors," 
columnist Vladimir Gurevich wrote in the Moscow News. "Who are the real, and 
not sham, owners? " 
</P>
<P>
 At Vladimir Tractor Works, Bakaleynik, too, is approaching a moment of truth. 
From the textbook case studies of troubled businesses he worked on at Harvard, 
he has moved to a whopper of a real-life problem, though he describes the 
challenge in mundane terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking the standard procedures any Western company that hit problems 
would take: reorganization, looking at the balance sheet, deciding which assets 
are worth keeping and which are not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakaleynik's job would have been much easier if he had taken over a year ago, 
when the Tractor Works was not on the verge of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new stockholders held their first meeting last year, workers voted to 
retain their old boss of 18 years, Anatoly Grishin, a classic "red director" 
who ran the factory Soviet-style, providing workers with cradle-to-grave 
guarantees of jobs, housing and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakaleynik, who had served for seven years as chief economist of the factory, 
was dismissed as a Westernized upstart who, Grishin claimed, did not know 
enough about production to run a factory. 
</P>
<P>
 But by January, the Tractor Works was deep in debt and hardly anyone wanted 
its mini-tractors. Grishin resigned in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 When the stockholders met last March, Bakaleynik won almost unanimous support. 
He agreed to return, warning that life would not be easy. Workers, now worried 
about whether the factory would survive at all, welcomed him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakaleynik is now working on refinancing the company's incompetently managed 
debt at much lower interest, developing a marketing strategy aimed at small 
farmers across Russia and the world, and seeking millions of dollars in 
investments and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Bakaleynik is not doing, unlike the red directors, is moaning that 
the government must keep this flagship factory afloat with cheap credits. This 
is how privatization works in the ideal. The change in ownership leads to more 
rational economic behavior and takes the burden off the government Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, Vladimir Tractor Works appears to be more exception 
than rule at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, stockholder behavior has changed, said Valentina Sadovnikova, 
privatization overseer for the Vladimir region some 120 miles east of Moscow. 
At first "everything was unanimous and there were no secret votes. Now meetings 
have more and more secret votes on directors and many other questions," she 
said. Meetings that used to take an hour or two drag on for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if people have only a very small (portion), they're interested in how 
things are being run," Sadovnikova said. 
</P>
<P>
 But is that enough? Prominent economist Stanislav Shatalin and his think tank, 
known as Reforma, fear it may not be. In the most over-arching critique of the 
privatization program to date, the group's report points out in capital letters 
the whole concept's major flaw: "THERE IS NO CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN 
EFFICIENCY AND FORM OF PROPERTY." In other words, private does not necessarily 
mean better-run. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the large industrial enterprises has become more efficient due to 
privatization," Shatalin said. However, Reforma allows that it may simply be 
too early to assess privatization's effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, a loud "Did privatization succeed?" debate is under way in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 As Chubais put it, privatization "has been crowned with unqualified victory. 
But since its completion, an equally important fight has started over the 
assessment of the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the loudest critic of Chubais' program is Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, 
who denounced the program for selling off much too cheaply. He demanded that 
the capital sell shares in its businesses, many of which sit on prime real 
estate, for money rather than vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others caution that Russians will feel duped when they realize that most of 
their vouchers, whether deposited in special investment funds or in factories, 
will not bring them any of the promised dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the popular attitude from the start was relative skepticism toward 
the vouchers, and it remains so. While most people were happy to receive even a 
small gift from the government, they were also convinced that privatization 
would mainly lead to the enrichment only of the elite few. 
</P>
<P>
 A nationwide poll by the independent Mneniye service found that 26% of 
respondents had sold their vouchers for cash, while 30% deposited them in an 
investment fund and 13.6% held on to them. Only 25% agreed that the voucher 
would "give every person a share of state property." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, privatization backers say, at the very least the program 
has developed a capitalist mentality among Russians, bringing words such as 
dividend and share into the vernacular and giving a giant push to fledgling 
stock and capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
 They note too that privatized companies are far more attractive to foreign 
investors -- who were allowed to purchase vouchers -- and could even pull some 
of the billions of dollars in flown Russian capital back home.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: THE DILEMMA OF THE NON-WORKING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A broad-based coalition of industry and political groups, charging that U.S. 
tax law is discriminatory against women, is sponsoring a bill that would allow 
homemakers to boost contributions to individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, non-working spouses can deduct just $250 in annual contributions to 
an IRA, contrasted with $2,000 in deductible contributions allowed for working 
people who are not covered by company pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 By and large, non-working spouses are women. And some members of the coalition 
maintain that "tax discrimination" is one of the reasons women are twice as 
likely as men to die in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 However, others maintain that the financial deck is stacked against women in 
more ways than one. Because women are the primary care givers in families, 
they're more likely to have their careers interrupted to tend to children or 
ailing parents. They earn less, on average, than their male counterparts. And 
they live about seven years longer than men, making it more likely that they 
will die poor or disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the tax change, if successful, would address only one of 
women's many money troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But, law or no law, women can act now and significantly raise their chances of 
living out their golden years comfortably, experts say. Here's how. 
</P>
<P>
 * Save. Homemakers without outside income rarely save money in their own names 
because they're focused on doing nice things for others rather than for 
themselves, says Henry Zimmer, the Calgary, Canada-based co-author of "Becoming 
the Wealthy Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Women must learn to be a little bit selfish, Zimmer says. Take a small portion 
of each month's housing allowance and put it in a bank account in your own 
name, he suggests. If necessary, ask for a housing allowance "raise" so you can 
build a nest egg of your own. 
</P>
<P>
 At least treat your retirement savings like you do all other household 
expenses, says Kathy Hopkins, executive vice president of Fidelity Investments 
in Boston. Realize that financing your retirement is a necessary expenditure, 
just like buying groceries or paying the mortgage. Pay yourself first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Start early. Women live longer than men, on average. That means they'll need 
a larger savings account to finance a longer retirement. Since women also earn 
less than men on average, they probably cannot afford to simply save a larger 
amount of each month's wages. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the answer? Save small, but start early. If you start saving $25 a 
month when you're 20, you'll have $131,863 when you're 65, assuming an 8% 
average annual return. But if you wait until you're 45 to start saving, you 
must save $224 a month to get the same result. 
</P>
<P>
 * Invest wisely. Women tend to invest more conservatively than men, putting 
more money in super-safe investments such as Treasury securities and federally 
insured certificates of deposit than in riskier corporate stocks. Some experts 
theorize that women do this because they're less savvy about investing than 
men. Others say it's because the investment world is biased against women, with 
brokers and financial planners offering women less information and advice. 
Whatever the reason, ultraconservative investing is the wrong tack, 
particularly for those who are starting early. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? While the stock market is risky and volatile over short periods, the 
market's long-term performance is fairly consistent, according to Ibbotson 
Associates, a Chicago-based investment consulting firm.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1926, large company stocks have earned a compounded average annual 
return of 10.33%. Small-company stocks have earned a compounded average annual 
return of 12.36%. Treasury bills, on the other hand, earned just 3.69% on 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: If you invested $1 in Treasury bills in 1926, you would have 
$11.73 today. If you invested that dollar in small-company stocks instead, 
you'd have $2,757, according to Ibbotson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manipulate income. Not everyone will have this option, but homemakers who 
are married to self-employed men -- or men who work at smaller, entrepreneurial 
firms -- may have the ability to earn wages for helping their husbands, says 
Philip J. Holthouse, a partner with Holthouse Carlin & Van Trigt in Los 
Angeles. The impact on your husband's company or his employer would be 
negligible. But the result for your family could be boosted retirement savings, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a hypothetical couple, John and Jane Brown. John earns $50,000 as 
marketing director for a small manufacturing firm that does not offer a company 
pension plan. Jane helps out by typing and editing John's reports, but she 
earns no wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this arrangement, John can contribute $2,000 annually to an individual 
retirement account. But because Jane has no earned income, she can contribute 
only $250 annually to a "spousal IRA." Together, the Browns get $2,250 in 
deductible IRA contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if John asks his employer to shift some of his income to Jane for 
the work she's doing for John? Assuming the employer agrees, John's income is 
divided, with John earning, say, $42,000 and Jane getting the remaining $8,000 
for her part-time help. The Brown's family income remains at $50,000 and the 
employer's expenses are identical, except for a modest increase in bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Browns are surprisingly better off. Because both now have earned 
income, both qualify for $2,000 in tax-deductible IRA contributions.  
</P>
<P>
 Their boosted contributions save them $490 annually in federal and state 
taxes, assuming a combined 28% rate. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Browns earn 8% annually on their money over a 20-year period, they will 
have $196,340 in IRA savings. If they'd been able to contribute only the $2,250 
annually -- the maximum deductible contribution for a one-income family -- 
they'd have $110,441 in 20 years.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: GIFTS OF MONEY NOT ALWAYS TAXABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. Will you please explain how the gift tax system works and what its 
rationale is? I gave my grandson $15,000 to buy a car. I consider it a personal 
expense, and it was made with after-tax money; it was not a deduction. So why 
the gift tax? Isn't this double taxation? -- D.C . 
</P>
<P>
 A. First, let's explain what the so-called gift tax is really all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Our current tax system essentially treats the transfer of wealth -- up to 
$600,000 a person -- the same whether the transfer was made during the donor's 
lifetime or posthumously. Taxpayers are permitted to give away up to $600,000 
during their lifetimes, or after death, without either the recipient or the 
donor owing any tax on that transfer. (Of course, this money has already been 
subject to taxation once, for the year it was accumulated.)  
</P>
<P>
 Once the $600,000 limit is crossed, donors are liable for taxes -- you're 
right, this is now double taxation -- on the amount in excess of that maximum. 
Tax rates start at 37% and are graduated up to 55% (on $3 million). These 
limits and rates are the same, whether the gift is given during the donor's 
lifetime or not. If a gift comes after death, the donor's estate pays any 
applicable taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Now to your gift. Remember, all taxpayers are allowed to give away up to 
$600,000, tax-free, in their lifetimes or at death. In addition, each of us may 
give any other person up to $10,000 a year over and above that limit. 
Two-thirds of your $15,000 gift to your grandson -- $10,000 -- is covered by 
that annual gift provision. The remaining $5,000 counts against your $600,000 
lifetime limit.  
</P>
<P>
 You must file gift tax Form 709 with your income tax return, but you owe no 
tax on that gift, unless -- and this is unlikely -- you have already given more 
than $600,000. Once you file Form 709, the government notes that your remaining 
exemption stands at $595,000. The same process is followed every time you 
exceed the annual $10,000 per-capita limit. Then, at your death, any bequest 
beyond the remaining limit is subject to taxation. Deducting Losses on IRA 
Accounts 
</P>
<P>
 Q. In a recent column, you said that taxpayers are allowed to deduct losses on 
after-tax contributions to individual retirement accounts. Can you explain the 
rules governing these deductions? -- R.A.C . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The Internal Revenue Service has established strict guidelines governing 
the deductibility of losses sustained by after-tax IRA investments. It wants to 
prevent abuses and ensure that Uncle Sam gets his full share of tax-deferred 
retirement savings.  
</P>
<P>
 Under these guidelines, taxpayers must, in essence but not in reality, 
aggregate all their IRA investments -- pretax as well as after-tax -- to 
determine if their IRA withdrawals add up to less than the total tax basis of 
all the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, a deduction is not allowed until all the accounts -- pretax as 
well as after-tax -- have been fully depleted. Deferring Tax on Land Sale 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have 7.5 acres that I want to sell. Must I reinvest my proceeds in more 
land to avoid a big tax hit? What are my choices? C.R . 
</P>
<P>
 A. To defer taxes on your immediate gain, you may enter into what is known as 
a Section 1031, or Starker, exchange. This program, explained in Section 1031 
of the Internal Revenue Code, extends to investment property the same 
tax-deferral benefits that homeowners enjoy. The program allows you to roll 
over your proceeds into any type of real estate within a prescribed period of 
time. You would be wise to consult a real estate attorney or accountant for 
professional advice before proceeding with an exchange. Installment Sale: You 
Pay Now and Later 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am thinking of selling a piece of commercial property I purchased five 
years ago through a 1031 exchange. I estimate that at the net sales price we 
are considering, $610,000, I will have a gain of about $93,000. The sale 
proposal calls for the buyer to assume our first-trust deed of $375,000 and for 
me to take back a second deed of trust of $225,000.  
</P>
<P>
 The buyer's $150,000 down payment will go toward reducing the first deed by 
$100,000, to $275,000, and closing costs. I will not be realizing any cash out 
of the sale until the note is paid off, in three to five years. When do I have 
to pay taxes on my gain -- now, or when I get the cash from the note? -- P.M.L 
. 
</P>
<P>
 A. This deal is an installment sale. You are liable for taxes now on a portion 
of the sales proceeds, and you will be responsible later for taxes on the 
remainder as you receive it. Here's how to figure it all out, a process you 
will re-create when you complete IRS Form 6252: 
</P>
<P>
 First, calculate your gross taxable gain by deducting your tax basis, as 
adjusted by improvements and depreciation, from your net sale price. You say 
your figure is $93,000. Then you must calculate what percentage of the deal 
this profit represents compared to your initial investment. This is done by 
dividing your gain, $93,000, by the contract sale price. (The latter is 
calculated by subtracting the debt relief of $375,000 from the net sale price 
of $610,000, yielding $235,000.) This gives you a ratio -- or what the IRS 
calls your "gross profit percentage" -- of 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine how much you owe the government for the year of sale, you apply 
40% to the down payment of $150,000, meaning $60,000 of the down payment is a 
taxable gain and subject to the maximum 28% capital gains tax. The same 40% of 
all future repayments of principal will also be subject to capital gains tax. 
The remainder is considered a return of your investment and is not taxable. Of 
course, any interest payments you receive on the second trust deed are all 
taxable.

A COOL CRUSADER; YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE NAME (GREG LAURIE), BUT HE'S THE GUY 
BEHIND THE HARVEST CRUSADE. HIS HUMOR AND MTV-STYLE SPIN ON CHRISTIANITY DRAW 
IN THOUSANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has a Harley in his garage, LSD in his past and a "liveskunk" he 
occasionally holds in his lap aboard airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks up Jesus at stadiums and on surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
 And he gets letters threatening his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Laurie, the man behind all those Harvest Crusade bumper stickers, has 
carved out an unusual niche among evangelists. With his goofy humor and 
penchant for quoting Madonna (the singer, not the one at the manger), he has 
put a hip spin on conservative Christianity and led thousands to declare their 
faith in Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been called the MTV-savvy minister, the baby boomers' Bible answer man. 
Or even -- in some circles -- the next Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of that, however, he remains surprisingly unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Laurie's spiritual journey began on the lawn of Newport-Harbor High 
School in 1970. At that time, Laurie says, he was a rebellious, cynical 
17-year-old searching for "meaning and purpose in life." 
</P>
<P>
 The product of a troubled home -- his mother divorced and remarried five times 
-- he had been in and out of a military academy, lived in half a dozen cities 
across the country and grown up surrounded by adults who seemed to drink a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real question . . . was not so much, 'Is there life after death' but 'Is 
there life during life?' " he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 When friends promised that drugs would expand his awareness, Laurie dropped 
some acid and smoked a lot of pot. Sure enough, he says, "I did become more 
aware -- of how empty I was." But Laurie steered clear of religion because "in 
high school, it was social suicide to walk around talking about God." Whenever 
he went to the beach and saw Christians prowling the sands, "hunting for 
sinners," he ran into the surf: "I knew they wouldn't come into the water 
because they didn't want to get their Bibles wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day, eating lunch on the grass at high school, Laurie listened in on 
a meeting of the campus Christian club. Someone quoted the Bible passage where 
Jesus says, "You are either for me or against me," and Laurie froze: "I 
wondered: 'Could I really be against him?' 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I knew, I was up there praying with these people (asking Jesus 
into my life), and it was almost like I could feel a weight being lifted off 
me. . . . It wasn't a physical sensation or an emotional one. It was 
spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie adopted the long hair and beard that was de rigueur at his new home -- 
Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, a stronghold of a fundamentalist, 
Armageddon-is-near brand of Christianity that attracted legions of hippies and 
young people during the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 He also put his drawing skills to use -- at that point, he wanted to become a 
newspaper cartoonist -- creating a comic-strip pamphlet designed to reach 
"other people like me, people who were not religious and were maybe a little 
cynical." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Pastor Chuck Smith remembers meeting Laurie later and seeing the 
tract. "I saw he had a talent for (presenting the Christian message) in a very 
attractive way. I had him redraw it . . . and we took it down to PIP printers 
and had 10,000 copies made up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first night that we put them out for the kids, all 10,000 were gone. 
Ultimately, we printed over 1 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie soon became such a fixture at Calvary that in 1972, Smith asked him to 
take over a small youth Bible study at an Episcopal church in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-person class mushroomed to 300 members in less than a year. Laurie, 
only 19 and with no college or formal training, had to educate himself with 
books, tapes and lessons from other Bible studies to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1974, the Bible group was bigger than the church's congregation -- and 
Smith, to the dismay of the Episcopalians, bought Laurie an abandoned Baptist 
church in Riverside, gave him a certificate of ordination and had him start his 
own Calvary-affiliated flock. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also played another critical role in Laurie's early Christian 
experience. The two were at a retreat when Laurie, still in his teens, asked 
Smith for a cup of punch: "I'm standing there, sort of awe-struck, and he's 
pouring, and I'm thinking, 'Oh, what a man of God,' and he's still pouring, and 
I'm still standing there, and then suddenly my cup starts overflowing and punch 
is running down my arm. And he just starts laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie, a veteran prankster who thought he would have to drop his high jinks 
now that he was a believer, learned a lesson that guides him to this day: 
"Being a Christian doesn't mean you have to give up your sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Laurie starts ironing his shirt in the private, cowhide-furnished 
lounge where he camps out every Sunday, a line has already formed for the first 
of four regularly scheduled services at his Riverside church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baptist chapel that he started in 20 years ago has long since been retired 
in favor of a department store-sized sanctuary built atop a nearby granite pit. 
And the congregation, Harvest Christian Fellowship, has grown into one of the 
10 largest Protestant churches in the country, with an estimated 12,000 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Bible in hand, skin slightly orange from TV makeup, Laurie strolls across the 
parking lot to a back door at the church. As the musicians crank up onstage, he 
and several others munch doughnuts, pray and watch the proceedings on 
closed-circuit TV in a waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie gets up, wanders outside and returns a few moments later, crashing 
loudly into the door and holding his head in mock pain. It is a running gag. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's time for the sermon, the humor continues. In the past, Laurie has 
referred to inactive Christians as "pew potatoes," compared Solomon to Donald 
Trump and joked that "going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more 
than going to McDonald's makes you a Big Mac." 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, he ribs St. Peter. Recounting the apostle's seemingly inane 
remark after witnessing the transfiguration of Jesus and the appearance of 
Moses and Elijah on a mountaintop (Peter said, "Lord, it is good that we are 
here"), Laurie wonders if Moses and Elijah leaned over to Jesus and asked: "Who 
is this guy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie uses the line to make a point: Just as Peter wanted to stay on the 
mountaintop with Jesus and Moses, modern Christians "tend to want to withdraw 
into our own subculture. . . . 'If only there were a Christian city,' they say. 
'It'd be great.' There's just one problem. Somehow, we'd foul it up. . . . We 
have to come down from our mountaintop experiences and live this Christian life 
in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 The message is very similar to a chapter in one of Laurie's books. He later 
says that the borrowing was unintentional, but acknowledges that he recycles 
themes and ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 In his laptop computer, Laurie stores hundreds of quotes and news articles for 
use in his sermons. There's an "Emptiness of Elvis" file, a Kurt Cobain file, a 
crime statistics file and a compendium of quotes that includes everyone from 
Ben Franklin and Madonna ("I'm a very tormented person; I have a lot of demons 
I'm wrestling with") to Mel Brooks and Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always on the hunt for information that will reinforce what I'm saying," 
Laurie explains. "One of the worst things you can do, especially if you're 
trying to relate to young people, is be irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 The formula is especially obvious at the Monday night Bible study he leads at 
mentor Smith's Calvary Chapel. A few months after Laurie took over in 1989, 
attendance reportedly jumped from several hundred to 2,500, with overflow 
crowds spilling into the gym to watch on closed-circuit TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions, broadcast live on Christian radio and taped for television, are 
perhaps as close as Laurie comes these days to his original ministry. The crowd 
is young, the music powered by electric guitars and the clothing decidedly 
casual. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, at the Riverside church -- where volunteers sell biscotti and 
designer coffees between services -- aging baby boomers dominate the 
congregation, the music is tame and Laurie long ago dropped the 
Levi's-and-tennies look for pressed shirts and jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Calvary on a recent Monday, Laurie wears cowboy boots, black jeans and 
a dark shirt buttoned to the collar to deliver a primer on the do's and don'ts 
of evangelizing non-Christians, including some advice about small black mammals 
with white stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever pulled out a Bible aboard an airplane?" he asks. "Some people 
look at you like you've pulled out a live skunk." But Laurie says the method, 
which he uses on occasion, can invite discussion about God. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most people, there's a loneliness and an emptiness that marriage can't 
fill, friendships can't fill, not even your dog can fill," he says. "A lot of 
people think, 'If I just had the right relationship . . . or if Ed McMahon 
would just call me and tell me I'd won, everything would be great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the emptiness lingers. Quoting actor Woody Harrelson ("No matter how many 
beautiful women I was with, it was never enough") and reciting the lyrics to 
Simon and Garfunkel's "I Am a Rock," Laurie urges Christians to appeal to that 
internal void. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider how Jesus dealt with the Samaritan woman at the well, he says: "He 
didn't begin with 'Are you saved?' or 'Did you know you're going to hell?' " (a 
point apparently lost on some audience members at Calvary, who are later heard 
uttering those very words to visitors). 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he asked for water and talked with her about her life. And Laurie 
says Christians should do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier interview, he says he hopes a similar philosophy carries over to 
his own ministry: "I've read numerous surveys in which non-believers say they 
would go to church if they could find someone to discuss their doubts and 
questions with." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the pulpit, Laurie is shy and guarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, he moved his wife and two sons from Riverside to San 
Clemente, in part to gain a little anonymity. But the job seems to follow him. 
"I've even been recognized when I'm out surfing," he says. "Or I go to buy a 
loaf of bread and someone will have a spiritual question." 
</P>
<P>
 When things get too intense, Laurie escapes to the desert with his white 
Harley-Davidson. Then he gets antsy a day or two later and checks in with the 
office for something to do. "I was never really successful at being a hippie," 
he says. "I'm a little too hyperactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at home, he works out of an airy office with skylights, walls of books, 
Disney memorabilia and a sword once worn by a member of Haile Selasse's honor 
guard (a gift from Billy Graham's son, Franklin). 
</P>
<P>
 He also has an affinity for cowhide upholstery (even on the Harley), Mexican 
paver tiles and battered leather briefcases ("I think a briefcase takes on more 
character if it's thrashed," he says of the valise he carries around Riverside 
-- and of the matching collection of thrashed briefcase cousins it has at 
home). 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Cathe, spends much of her day home-schooling their 8-year-old son, 
Jonathan (older son Christopher, 19, attends Biola University). Laurie says the 
arrangement ensures a better education, allows the family to be together when 
he travels and is more convenient than the church school, which is an hour from 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The family togetherness stands in contrast to Laurie's chaotic upbringing -- 
and even to his early relationship with Cathe. She was 15 and Laurie 18 when 
they met at a Bible study he taught at Calvary. He drove her to coffee 
afterward in an old Corvair and they started dating a few weeks later. But it 
was stormy. "We fought a lot," Cathe Laurie says. "He was strong-willed and so 
am I." 
</P>
<P>
 They finally smoothed things out after a series of breakups and married right 
after her 18th birthday -- over the objections of her devout Catholic mother 
and worried father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greg can come across as cold at first," she says. "It takes time to see his 
compassionate side." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents didn't really come around until after the birth of Christopher, 
she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other old wounds have also lessened with time. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, while preaching in New York City, Laurie looked up the long-lost 
stepfather who had adopted him decades earlier and given him his surname. "I 
went to his house in New Jersey -- he had just had a heart attack while driving 
-- and met with him and his wife," Laurie says. "She was Catholic and was very 
interested in my testimony (about) how I'd become a Christian and a pastor and 
so forth. . . . But (during the conversation) my dad said not a word." 
</P>
<P>
 The old man remained silent until the next morning, when he took Laurie for a 
walk and asked: "What do I need to do to accept Jesus Christ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie could scarcely believe it: "It brought closure on my life a little bit, 
to go back to something that hurt and see it healed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Chuck Smith decided to try a little experiment with his protege. He 
rented the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa for five nights, signed up some 
Christian rock artists and put in Laurie as the featured speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 It was billed as a sort of sanitized Woodstock and christened "Summer Harvest 
Crusade." About 90,000 people showed up over the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie's pitch for the Lord was so persuasive that a mass baptism for 1,000 
people was held later along the shore off Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, with additional churches joining as sponsors, the crusade 
expanded to San Diego and Honolulu. And Smith confided to reporters that he 
hopes Laurie might someday succeed Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its fifth year, the Harvest Crusade (which concludes at Anaheim Stadium 
tonight) has toured five Western states, logging total attendance of 750,000 
(many of them repeat visitors from night to night or year to year) and 60,000 
"registered commitments" to Christ. Locally, some 500 churches are 
co-sponsoring the event, blanketing Orange County with a million flyers, 
120,000 bumper stickers and 30,000 T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia University religious history professor Randall Balmer says crusade 
organizers are effective at reaching the MTV generation: "You have this very 
old form -- the evangelistic sermon -- that has been appropriated for modern 
culture," he said in an interview last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a mix of celebrity testimonials (such as former baseball player 
Dave Dravecky), Christian musicians (including Ricky Skaggs, Deniece Williams, 
Crystal Lewis and former '60s pop stars Gary Puckett and Richie Furay), 
canned-food drives for the poor and hard-sell preaching. Bible verses flash 
across scoreboards, volunteers conduct prayer vigils in press boxes. And 
separate children's events -- featuring huge, Macy's Parade-style balloons -- 
encourage youngsters to commit to Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie receives no pay for his crusade work, and he waives any royalties from 
book sales at the events. During Harvest's first two years, he also banned 
collections to dispel the image of evangelists just being in it for the money. 
(Smith paid for everything.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the crusade's success remains difficult to gauge. Skeptics say such 
events are largely ineffective -- serving more as a faith booster to believers 
than as a means to win converts. Also, attendance has been uneven outside 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest hurdle is Laurie's lack of name recognition -- even among those 
who follow the evangelical scene. In interviews with religion observers, 
professors and evangelism experts across Southern California and the nation, 
nearly everyone said they had either never heard of him or didn't know enough 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Christianity Today Editor David Neff says, "All I know about Greg Laurie is 
what I read in his own publicity . . . (and that) certainly does puff him up." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Laurie's publicist concedes that he didn't know the evangelist's name 
until being hired by him about 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But that could be a good sign, says Carl George, director of the Charles E. 
Fuller Institute, a pastoral training organization in Pasadena: "I'm impressed 
that he's carried off this (crusade) several years without becoming a household 
name. It shows that it's not completely personality-driven." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood Wirt, former editor of Billy Graham's Decision magazine, predicts 
that Laurie, 41, will be "one of the great evangelists of the early 21st 
Century." And Tom Phillips, another longtime Graham associate who now runs a 
ministry to foreign students, credits Laurie with helping to "invent the 
future" of American preaching. By balancing stadium evangelism with pastoring a 
church, Phillips says, Laurie "could well be a model for (new) evangelists." 
</P>
<P>
 (Graham himself doesn't comment on other ministers, but his organization has 
employed Laurie at its pastor training center in North Carolina.) 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie -- whose office walls are decked with photos of him with Graham -- 
shrugs off the hype. At the Calvary Bible study, when some youths come up and 
ask him what Graham is like, Laurie deadpans: "He slaps you around. He slapped 
me and said, 'Who do you think you are?' " The youths are speechless. Then 
Laurie grins, "Just kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, on a more serious note, he says nobody can replace America's preeminent 
evangelist: "Billy Graham has been set apart by God in a singular way. . . . Do 
I think I'm his heir apparent? Absolutely not. I hope to be one-tenth as 
effective with my generation as he is with his." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Laurie adds, "I'm not a statesman. . . . I don't see myself strolling 
into the White House and being a counselor to Presidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "I don't want that kind of fame. When I've been with Billy Graham, 
if he just walks through a hotel lobby, you can hear people audibly whispering, 
'That's Billy Graham.' Who wants to be gawked at and stared at all the time?" 
</P>
<P>
 But even Laurie's limited exposure carries a price. He is approached by all 
manner of kooks and has even received death threats, he says. "I turn those 
over to police . . . but what can you do? You just go on and trust God to 
protect you." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of his ministry has wrought other changes, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie's ragged Corvair has been replaced by a Jeep Grand Cherokee (purchased 
for him by his church), the hippie commune house where he and his wife first 
lived has been traded for a two-story, ocean-view tract home in a gated 
community in San Clemente, and his original $30-a-week salary -- which he 
supplemented by moonlighting as a graphics artist -- has soared to $115,000 a 
year. (By comparison, Billy Graham's pay package is $135,000, including a 
$34,000 housing allowance, and Jerry Falwell's is $125,000, plus a car.) 
</P>
<P>
 But other things aren't any different at all. 
</P>
<P>
 When Laurie and another pastor went out for pizza recently in Newport Beach, 
he bumped into a high school friend at the next table. "You still getting into 
trouble all the time?" the old pal asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Laurie answered. "I'm a Christian. In fact, I'm a pastor." 
</P>
<P>
 The friend shook his head: "I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 They chatted a bit longer and then both returned to their meals. A few moments 
later, however, when the pastor Laurie was with got up to use the restroom and 
Laurie dumped hot peppers all over his pizza, the high school chum whirled 
back: "I guess you haven't changed that much after all, have you, Greg?" Greg 
Laurie 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 41 
</P>
<P>
 Native: Yes. Born in Long Beach. Raised in Corona del Mar, Costa Mesa, South 
Gate, New Jersey and Hawaii. Lives in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married Cathe Martin in 1974; two sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Sharing Jesus Christ with baby boomers and young people, collecting 
Disney memorabilia, riding motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 On the different ways people perceive sermons: "I'll go into this detail about 
what some Greek or Hebrew words mean, and then afterward I'll stand at the back 
and someone will say, 'You know, I liked it when you told that story about the 
dog.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On attitudes toward God: "Many people today want a user-friendly God who will 
not challenge their lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 On irrelevance in the church: "Preachers are answering questions that no one 
is asking, and missing the questions that are being asked." 
</P>
<P>
 On other denominations: "I find I have more in common with a committed 
Catholic than a liberal Protestant."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: ACCIDENT LEFT HER WITH SCARS ON INSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheila Styron was on a sidewalk in West Los Angeles when it happened. A bus, 
she says, angled in over the curb, and in one terrifying instant, caved in her 
upper front teeth, bruised her from head to shin and knocked her off her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But that, she says, wasn't the worst part. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting hit by a bus forced Sheila Styron to face two simple and profound 
facts about herself: She is blind and because she is blind she is vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Those facts may seem obvious to anyone who does not rely on a guide dog to 
avoid banging into tables in restaurants or tripping over bumps in the 
sidewalk, but the truth is, until she was hit by a Santa Monica city bus in 
February, 1991, Sheila Styron -- accomplished musician, singer and composer -- 
never accepted that her life could be circumscribed by her inability to see. 
</P>
<P>
 And now she does. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life before this happened to me, I really had made an incredibly major 
point of being Super Blind Person," said Styron, 40. " 'I can do everything. 
Don't patronize me.' It was a real major part of who I was and how I kept my 
confidence and self-esteem up. No matter what, I wanted to maintain my 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
 You could call it a form of denial. And it is. But when properly employed, 
denial can be a powerful and positive coping mechanism. According to a 
psychologist who will testify on her behalf in a lawsuit she has filed against 
the city of Santa Monica, denial is what kept Sheila Styron functioning so well 
for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he'll maintain, it is what she was stripped of by the right front side of 
a 16-ton bus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In settlement conferences, Santa Monica offered Styron $70,000, then $140,000. 
Styron's attorney countered with a demand for $200,000. The city, however, 
withdrew its offer when the attorney for Santa Monica, Conrad Kohrs, found a 
bus passenger who will support the city's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Styron's attorney, Barry Novack: "There were five eyewitnesses who said 
Sheila was standing there and got hit by a moving bus. Now they have come up 
with a new witness who said the bus was stopped and Sheila walked into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohrs said he will argue that Styron was at fault in the accident, that her 
injuries were minor and that she has suffered no lasting psychological damage. 
He will argue that she and her attorney are exaggerating the effects of the 
accident for monetary gain. 
</P>
<P>
 After many delays, the trial is slated to begin in October. Both sides will 
trot out their bus experts, their psychologists and their witnesses. A jury 
will decide whether Styron is entitled to damages and, if so, how much. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which promises to be almost as bruising to Styron as the accident, 
got as far as jury selection in Superior Court in Santa Monica last month 
before being bumped for a criminal proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 During pretrial motions, Kohrs asked the judge not to allow jurors to see 
Styron approach the witness box with Nicole, her yellow Labrador guide dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are obvious sympathy factors in this case," Kohrs said. "A a blind, 
blond plaintiff and a blond dog that wags its tail." 
</P>
<P>
 Styron, who was in the courtroom, was so offended by the motion that she had a 
hard time restraining herself. "I was trying not to scream," she said. "This is 
my right! I am allowed to have this dog everywhere. In my opinion, the dog is 
not a sympathy factor, the dog makes me look independent and capable. That dog 
is my means to my dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge agreed that the jury would not be present when Styron approaches and 
leaves the witness box. But she agreed that Nicole could remain in the 
courtroom during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the first year after the accident, Styron said, she rode buses like a 
madwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, 'Get back on that pony and ride.' " She almost never brought it 
up with friends because she was embarrassed. "I couldn't believe this awful 
thing had happened to me, and I hate it when people feel sorry for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, Styron said, she slipped into a depression. "I started to 
just question the whole way I had done everything in my life as a blind person. 
I went from feeling confident about traveling on the buses to being at a party 
and feeling like I didn't reach for a potato chip the same way as everyone 
else. I was just feeling very blind." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, she said, she has been feeling as though she is coming to some kind 
of accommodation between her denial and her feelings of vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I didn't like to deal with my blindness," she said. "I brushed it 
away like a fly. Now, I am trying to put it into a healthy, moderated place in 
my life. Yes, some bad things have happened to me because of my blindness, and 
I have to talk about it with people, and it's important for me to admit certain 
needs that I have." 
</P>
<P>
 The psychologist who examined Styron for the city of Santa Monica suggested 
that she might benefit from "desensitization" sessions in which she is taught 
how to relax when she finds herself feeling anxious about a bus hitting her 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel I will ever feel safe and secure about traveling," Styron said. 
"I was doing nothing wrong and a bus hit me. How can desensitization training 
convince me that won't happen again?" 
</P>
<P>
 And how can a woman who experienced sightlessness as a mere inconvenience for 
most of her life ever perceive it that way again?

GALLERY: BACK STREET HUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too often, alleys are thought of as dark and forbidding back streets, stifled 
by odor.But, really, they're just passageways, and the alleys of Melrose Avenue 
lead to a place that pulsates more from vibrant color than from shopping 
droves. 
</P>
<P>
 Just look. Down these alleys are sights out of time and sites out of place. 
Exposed pipes scream orange against the industrial gray of a forbidden parking 
place. A lone lock secures a latch among a riot of hues. One home's back door 
projects the seaside serenity of a Cape Cod cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second face of Melrose, but in typical Melrose style -- offering art 
where the Dumpsters should be.

RSVP / THE SOCIAL CITY; MAKING SURE ART IS FUN TO ENSURE HELP AMONG THE YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southland's cultural institutions know the future will be determined by 
the degree of commitment from younger generations. Thus, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art has announced formation of a membership group -- LACMA Muse -- 
for museum members in their 20s, 30s and 40s. They numbered 100 of the 1,000 
who turned out last week for the opening of the Mike Kelley exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muse idea will be to make art relevant as well as fun, social, educational 
and cultural. Among the leaders are Libby Applebaum, Mark Beskow, Lara 
Edelbaum, Brooke Glassman, Jason Grode, Shanta Sullivan and Hannah Yi. They've 
made an ambitious schedule of exhibition parties and gallery tours with artists 
and curators. And they'll sponsor a New Year's Eve ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Debs, Stags and El Cholo: Las Madrinas, the prominent Childrens Hospital of 
Los Angeles support group that has raised millions through its Christmas 
debutante ball, has indoctrinated debutantes in the good deeds of the hospital. 
But, stags, the young men invited to the ball, have sometimes been less 
knowledgeable about why they're spiffed up in white tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap was rectified: Las Madrinas members and their husbands -- Nancy and 
Jim Birdwell, Kay and Steve Onderdonk, Pat and Tom Rauth, Kathy and John 
Russell, Laney and Tom Techentin, Jenni and Michael Todd, and Brooke and Jim 
Young -- invited the young men to tour the hospital and have Mexican food on 
the patio of El Cholo on Western. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 took the late afternoon tour, among them Nick Techentin, Scott 
Birdwell, John Onderdonk, Will Smith, Eric Pinckert, Davey Olson, Court Young, 
Greg Todd, Mike Russell, Brian Crumrine and Ryan Myers. (Tom Rauth arrived late 
from his Santa Monica lifeguard job.) Their favorite stop: the gait lab where 
children with walking disabilities are videotaped and their gaits restructured 
using computer images. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Good: The deteriorating 17th-Century limestone statues on the North 
Vista of the Huntington Library silently watched over the picnic honoring the 
library's 75th anniversary committee. That's the committee planning the Blue 
Boy Ball, Sept. 17th. None too soon. The 28 sculptures, as well as the 
tempietto and the fountain at its northern end, are badly in need of 
restoration, and the ball will provide the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball goal is $250,000, and things are looking good. The 75th Anniversary 
Celebration co-chairs, George and Mary Lou Boone, who were in France and missed 
the picnic, have made a leadership gift for the restoration. Ball chairmen 
William G. Steele Jr. and Boyd S. Smith, sipping gazpacho, were upbeat about 
the three ball sponsors -- J.P. Morgan, Tiffany & Co. and Times Mirror Co. Said 
Smith: "Tiffany does only one national benefit a year, and we beat out the 
Boston Library for their approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Opera and Sunsets: Angelenos have been prominent in New Mexico for the opening 
of the Santa Fe Opera, chaired by Nancy Zeckendorf of New York, and for 
festivities including the Opera Ball and pre-opera dinners. Angeleno Cleon T. 
(Bud) Knapp is a new board member and major donor. He and wife Betsy were 
honored at a dinner hosted by Jimmy Seitz. Joining in festivities were Warner 
and Carol Henry and Tom and Travis Kranz. Elsewhere on the Social Circuit 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura debutante curtsies attracted more than 300 at the Ventura Doubletree 
Hotel. Las Patronas, an auxiliary of the Assistance League of Ventura County, 
presented 12 -- Devon Brown, Allison Brunner, Erin Carmody, Melanie ChieuQ, 
Erin Darby, Kathryn Donovan, Michelle Giordano, Alexis Kleiman, Sarah Kleiman, 
Megan Van Gundy, Stephanie Waldo and Jennifer Yuja. Heading the 37-year 
tradition was Las Patronas Chairwoman Peg Armstrong and ball chair Mary Massie. 
In March, Nancy Huntsinger feted 100 at a deb tea in her Ventura home. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Joffrey Ballet opening last week, Northrop executive Kent Kressa 
stressed that the Music Center provides 12,000 performances yearly in city 
schools. Table conversations then expanded to what a pity there are not more 
funds provided by schools for choirs, orchestras and arts, as in years past. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circle these dates: "The Who's Tommy" opening July 15 at Universal 
Amphitheatre benefits two groups -- Education First! (which considers education 
the nation's top public policy priority) and Children's Action Network (the 
entertainment industry's advocacy for children, supporting such efforts as a 
national immunization campaign). Carole and Jerry Isenberg, Lynda and Peter 
Guber, Lorraine and Sid Sheinberg, and Kate Capshaw and Steven Spielberg are 
co-chairs . . . Another date: the July 17 "Festival of Chefs" fund-raiser in 
which 22 Long Beach restaurants will donate house specialties in an afternoon 
of culinary delights to aid the Long Beach Youth Home. Carol and Ralph Webster, 
Fern Marsh and Target Stores are lending support. 
</P>
<P>
 * Starlight dining and dancing at the Black and White Bash will benefit the 
exhibition and education programs of Newport Harbor Art Museum on July 30 in 
the Neiman Marcus courtyard of Fashion Island. It's as simple as strolling 
entertainers, a fashion show and edibles from area restaurants arranged by 
Michael Kang. Co-chairs Susan Porter and Gene White have persuaded merchants to 
deck the fashion mall in black-and-white. A lively committee: Chris Collett, 
Alison Frenzel, Bill Griffin, Mark Kehke, Lorie Dewhirst Porter, Michael Porter 
and Jennifer Van Bergh. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plaudits and kudos: To Vista Del Mar Child & Family Services's "Day at the 
Races" on July 14 at Hollywood Park with new board president Donald S. Wolf 
greeting . . . To the Nancy Reagan Breast Center at Simi Valley Hospital, 
dedicated to honor the former First Lady this week . . . To Lucy Ann Toberman 
McBain, Woman of the Year at Marlborough School . . . To the Pacific Asia 
Museum opening its unique "Games of the Asian World" exhibition in Pasadena.

WHEN DO WE CAST OFF OUR AWE OF NATURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was intrigued by the article "Where the Wild Things Are" (June 15). I spent 
a portion of my childhood in Montana among the wonders of the natural world.My 
parents, however, brought the family to Southern California, where I grew up in 
a populous urban environment where the wild things are not. Eventually, I 
became a biologist, a teacher and an ardent lover of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, virtually all my relatives who remain surrounded in natural 
richness could not care less. To them, natural resources are for economic 
exploitation. Any suggestion of preservation stirs anger, and even to mention 
the Endangered Species Act brings near rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Trimble and Gary Paul Nabhan, co-authors of "The Geography of 
Childhood," might do well to initiate a study of the transformation of human 
beings from the child's wonder at nature to adult indifference and outright 
rejection of natural values.

 Re "Snooze Alert" (June 21): What an interesting article. I always thought 
that "three o'clock slump" was somehow my fault, not a part of a normal 
circadian cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 I never gave in to the impulse to nod off at my desk because at most 
companies, such behavior is grounds for instant dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if the day will ever come when management people realize that people 
are not windup machines, all alike, perfect and predictable. Maybe they have, 
and that's why so many jobs have been taken over by automatons.

JUST WHAT IS MESSAGE BEHIND MAGAZINES?

<TEXT>
<P>
 I had to laugh at Jack Smith's piece on Playboy and the women's magazines 
("And You Think Playboy Is Sexy?" June 27). The last time I was solemnly 
assured men pick up Playboy to read the articles, I was 16 years old and the 
callow youth speaking to me was barely shaving. I didn't buy it then; no sale 
now, either. 
</P>
<P>
 I am all for freedom to uh, read, Playboy. Heck, if this guy in the firehouse 
wants to look at Little Lulu comics, I don't care, as long as he puts out the 
fire when my house is burning down. Personally, I would be somewhat embarrassed 
to go before the world in a court of law and proclaim that this was the 
intellectual level I found most comfortable, but, hey, the battle for D.H. 
Lawrence ended a few decades ago and we can't all be big thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the women's magazines Smith mentions, the articles on sex appearing in 
them suggest that all is not well in America's bedrooms, and that maybe some 
improvement is in order. Is it possible that these macho, Playboy-perusing 
hunks aren't performing as well as one might desire? Call me crazy, but working 
to improve your relationship with another human being seems to make more sense 
than communing with a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Face it, what men who buy Playboy really want is something they're probably 
not getting -- a grinning twentysomething naked bimbo with supernatural hooters 
who never talks back and never says, "I don't want to" or "When was your last 
shower?" 
</P>

<P>
 Women's magazines differ from Playboy in their purpose and their sexual power. 
The point at which they differ is the photography. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's magazines such as those mentioned in Jack Smith's column -- Ladies 
Home Journal and Redbook -- do not print photos of naked men in provocative 
poses. 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy portrays women as desirable objects of lust for men to gawk at and 
admire. This is what creates a hostile environment for women to work in. This 
is what the women firefighters struggling to fit in at the "boys club" fire 
stations should not have to live with. 
</P>

<P>
 My company in a small town in Connecticut was right next to a fire station. I 
was appalled one evening when I looked out our front window and witnessed the 
sale of several magazines to some firefighters loitering in front of the 
station. The magazines were wrapped in brown paper and something tells me they 
probably weren't issues of Field & Stream. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very generous of Jack Smith to donate his back issues of Playboy to the 
firefighters. How about donating some literature while he's at it -- perhaps a 
complete set of Dickens? Or maybe something a little racier, like Vonnegut. 
Surely these men can stretch their minds beyond those informative "articles" in 
Playboy.

THE BUZZ / SOCIAL CLIMES: TAMMY FAYE'S LOOK IS FOREVER 
</P>

 Just when you thought it was safe to put on your eye makeup: Makeover magazine 
(a summer magazine special from the people who bring you People) certainly 
lives up to its name. Everyone and everything gets made over in these pages -- 
celebs, twins, living rooms, future daughters-in-law, contents of 
refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 But one person the magazine didn't -- or couldn't -- mess with is Tammy Faye 
Messner (tack "Bakker" on instead of "Messner" and you'll recognize her). Who 
would dare tamper with those Betty Boop eyelashes or cache of ultra-perky wigs? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Tammy Faye has taken it upon herself to improve on her own unique 
style -- she's had her makeup tattooed on. Yep, no more smears and smudges for 
this gal. Permanent eyeliner, lip liner and eyebrows have made her life that 
much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most wonderful thing," she confesses, "is waking up and not having your 
eyebrows rubbed out on the pillow." 
</P>
<P>
 Kind-of Crime and Punishment: While perusing the shelves of our favorite 
bookstore megaplex the other day, we saw a father lightly admonish his toddler 
son not to throw his baseball cap at the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't throw the cap," he said. "Don't throw the cap. C'mon, don't throw the 
cap." 
</P>
<P>
 His pleading was for naught; the boy kept throwing the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a dad to do then? Revert to threats. But nothing as predictable as "No 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers for a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, no, this was a dad of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throw the cap and you're not going to college," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the Night Life: An awards ceremony with the grandiose title "Heroes of the 
Night" might be expected to honor paramedics, emergency room doctors or 
Domino's pizza deliverers. Instead it was the first salute to local night life. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those recognized at Tatou last week by a panel of "trendies, players and 
regulars of the L.A. night scene" for making Los Angeles a more desirable place 
to prowl after dark were: 
</P>
<P>
 Best Club: House of Blues 
</P>
<P>
 Best Bar: The Whiskey at the Sunset Marquis 
</P>
<P>
 Best DJ: Doc Marten 
</P>
<P>
 Best Party of the Year: D.A.S.K. on Memorial Day in Palm Springs 
</P>
<P>
 Best Promoter: Brent Bolthouse 
</P>
<P>
 Best Doorman: Rudy Mattea, at the House of Blues 
</P>
<P>
 Best After-Hours Club: Prague (now on hiatus) 
</P>
<P>
 Best Weekly Event: Wednesdays at the Gate 
</P>
<P>
 Tatou's creative director, Rudolf, said the reaction of the winners "ranged 
from total surprise to 'this is a confirmation of my birthright,' with the 
majority in the latter category. Nightclubs are a big-ego industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Top This, Barbara Bush: One more way the current First Lady has distinguished 
herself from Barbara Bush is that there's now a 32-page newsletter devoted to 
her life. Written with an indulgent tone (the feeling is, she's our Hillary, 
warts and all), the Hillary Clinton Quarterly covers a beat that might get lost 
in normal news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an item about the founders of a Hillary Clinton Fan Club, who were 
"very excited" to get a personal call from the object of their admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the poem "Our Hillary V" ("She seems to rise from the chair like 
Aphrodite"), a four-page analysis of her relationship with her Methodist faith, 
and a fictional story that explains the First Lady's interest in baseball by 
revealing she had once been drafted by the Detroit Tigers.

UP ALL NIGHT / SOCIAL CLIMES: THE BOAT WITH A BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By night, the Long Beach Harbor is a watery enchanted forest. The oil rigs and 
refineries sparkle with lights. A delicate mist rises from the waves, glowing 
faintly with moonlight. Against this eerie background, freighters loom like 
ghostly drifting skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
 In startling contrast, Star Party Cruises' Reggae Boat teeters merrily along 
its meandering course, a thimble of a vessel rolling over the waves to the tune 
of "One Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100 or so boisterous reggae enthusiasts on-board hoot and holler when they 
catch sight of a sailor peering over the towering bow of a Polish freighter as 
the little boat passes below. The tiny figure keeps looking down but doesn't 
wave back, apparently puzzled by this strange nautical phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-decker cruise ship embarks at 10 p.m. every Saturday for a 
three-hour harbor cruise that offers dancing to a top reggae band such as Urban 
Dread or Kindred, plus cocktails and scenery that includes unique views of the 
downtown skyline, the Queen Mary and the dome that formerly housed the Spruce 
Goose, in addition to the industrial fantasyscape. Other weekend cruises 
feature live blues music. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat is surprisingly roomy. On the first level, a semi-enclosed space 
shelters the stage and a small dance floor, the bar and some benches, while the 
big deck upstairs is open to the sky. Women in shorts and bustiers better 
suited to a steamy indoor venue like Glam Slam seem oblivious to the chilly 
breeze, while a couple in grunge-inspired lumberjack shirts seems to huddle 
together for warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 A man on a bench talks into his cellular phone while his date gazes out across 
the water. Later they leave, and another man sits down and whips out his phone 
while his date sighs and stares. But most people are dancing and cuddling by 
turns, sipping tropical cocktails and singing along to the sounds of Urban 
Dread. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an eclectic crowd -- young, well-heeled and multiethnic. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come from all over, from as far away as Riverside and San Bernardino," 
manager Carin Lundahl says. "It's a special occasion for most people, a lot of 
birthdays. Sometimes the band plays a little calypso, and when that happens, 
someone always says, 'Let's limbo!' and they get out the broom we keep behind 
the bar. We also have some regulars. One couple came on their first date, then 
came back the next weekend. Later they got engaged on the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bob Kimall is qualified to perform marriages, and if you reserve in 
advance, he'll wear his dress uniform for the occasion. Conversely, if your 
date is not working out, he'll let you visit with him in the cockpit and even 
try your hand at steering the boat in open waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Holidays are big, and reservations are already being taken for this year's 
Halloween Party, which will be the first cruise to use a new 300-passenger 
boat. "The costumes always get really outrageous," Lundahl says. "It's the 
event of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Let all be forewarned that the Reggae Boat is uncharacteristic of most reggae 
events in two vital respects: One, there is positively no hemp smoking aboard, 
and two, this boat leaves on time. "Anyone caught smoking anything but tobacco 
will be dropped off at the harbor patrol office," Capt. Bob announces as the 
boat pulls away from the dock at exactly 10:02. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever gets seasick," Lundahl says. "Well, except on Valentine's Day, 
when we give each couple a bottle of champagne." 
</P>
<P>

TELEVISION; JUST CALL HIM BANKABLE BOY; ADAM SANDLER HAS PARLAYED OPERA MAN, 
SHAKY LIPPED GUY AND OTHER 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' GUISES INTO THREE-DEAL DUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, Chris Willman is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On this sunny late spring day in Manhattan, a boy's thoughts should be turning 
to Heather Locklear, especially when the boy is "Saturday Night Live" cast 
member Adam Sandler and Locklear will soon be hosting the late-night show's 
season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some reason, Sandler is focusing on the none-too-likely chance he'll 
get to interact on camera with that same episode's musical guest, Janet 
Jackson. It seems they share a talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm great at humping a chair," he claims. "That's what got me 'Saturday Night 
Live.' I was in Lorne's office humping his chair and he said, 'My god , that's 
funny, you're hired -- seven-year contract.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sandler "does" his boss, "SNL" honcho Lorne Michaels, as a sort of effete New 
England intellectual enthusing over the bathroom humor of his young charges. 
Otherwise, Sandler doesn't really do many impressions (with famous exceptions, 
like Eddie Vedder and Axl Rose), and he certainly doesn't impersonate brainiacs 
or snobs as a matter of course, rather carrying with him a weirdly off-center 
dunce gallery nonpareil. 
</P>
<P>
 And though it's certainly not over till the Opera Man sings, plenty of folks 
think this 27-year-old -- with a hit comedy album still on the charts, and 
three movies on the way -- is the hottest breakout prospect among the younger 
"SNL" cast members. 
</P>
<P>
 On this Saturday in spring, though, with the season accelerating toward a 
wrap, Sandler is trying to concentrate on the remaining shows at hand before he 
goes back to Los Angeles to work on two movies over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the infernally messy office he keeps in the "Saturday Night Live" dorm -- 
er, wing -- of Rockefeller Center, he considers the possibilities for error 
that exist in the heat of live broadcasting. Like if -- Lorne forbid -- the 
crazy tics of one character should start to bleed over into the feeble 
idiosyncrasies of another. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in a lot of stuff in one show, it's hard to all of a sudden get 
into the next guy," says Sandler, parting the clutter to find his couch between 
dress rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time, I did Shaky Lipped Guy on that Halloween show, and then I did 
Canteen Boy, and in the middle of Canteen Boy I started shaking my lip. 
Everyone was looking at me like 'What are you doing ? Canteen Boy doesn't shake 
his lip!' " He shudders to recall the accidental osmosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The obsessive-compulsive details may differ from weird character to weird 
character. But Sandler's creations do mostly share an inability to fire up all 
their synapses in a linear row. His most popular recurring part on the show, 
Opera Man, is a tenor who sings in satirical non sequiturs. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it's downhill on the evolutionary scale, as Sandler's other 
increasingly popular personas -- Cajun Man, Canteen Boy, the Herlihy Boy, et 
al. -- seem very probably in-bred, like maybe they're tremulous-voiced distant 
cousins to both Jerry Lewis and that banjo-playing "Deliverance" kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers are his specialty. The strangest thing is his knack for creating 
imbeciles that the audience can feel compelled to laugh at and feel a little 
sorry for too. Even their creator takes pity on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do, I do," he says. "After I've seen it on tape, I'll laugh, but I'll say, 
'Oh, the poor guy -- Canteen Boy's having a rough day today.' I feel like 
people will respond to it because they know people like that or they've seen 
them growing up. The Canteen Boy, the reason you feel bad for him and you can 
laugh is because he, and I guess a lot of my characters, they don't notice 
they're getting made fun of. So they'll say something back that's not that 
great a quip, but in their mind they won the argument. Does that make sense?" 
</P>
<P>
 There may be something in this rough justice: Although Sandler's humor can be 
as coarse, profane and puerile as any other young comic's -- especially in the 
high school shenanigans of his recent album, "They're All Gonna Laugh at You" 
-- there is also something unusually sweet about it at times. He has a real, if 
absurdist, affection for the pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, Sandler says, "I had my moments of being humiliated, and then I 
had moments of doing something humiliating. I'm glad I lived out both roles. 
But as an almost-adult -- I'm supposed to be an adult, but my head is not quite 
there yet -- and as I get smarter, I do realize how much more I like people who 
get humiliated or have a tough time. I'd rather write about them. I don't know 
why. It's more interesting than a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the losers get lucky sometimes. Although the Canteen Boy isn't scheduled 
to get his own "SNL" spinoff film anytime soon, Sandler does have three feature 
films on the way in which he'll essay less exaggerated, more mainstream misfits 
with milder social adjustment problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First out of the docket -- opening Aug. 5 -- is "Airheads," a rock 'n' roll 
comedy from director Michael Lehmann ("Heathers") that stars Sandler alongside 
Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi as members of an unsigned band who take a 
radio station hostage to take their tunes directly to the masses in a desperate 
end run around an uncaring music business. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Lehmann: "There's something that he really brought to the part he plays 
in the movie that wasn't in the script. Because his character was one that was 
written as being the cute, good-looking member of the band that gets all the 
girls, he was supposed to have long, flowing hair and a really cute face. When 
I met Adam, I thought, 'Women find him attractive, but he's not by any means 
what you would call cute in the Davy-Jones-of-the-Monkees sense.' We tried the 
long wig, but it looked like a wig on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we shaved his head instead, and we ended up doing things that took away 
from what would normally be his attractive qualities. But because of his 
innocent charm, combined with that 'loser' kind of quality, the way it worked 
is that you could believe that when people pointed to him and said that girls 
really like him, it was both funny and also somehow rang true." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the feeble-mindedness of so many of Sandler's characters hasn't 
impeded the comic's apparent sex appeal. Testament to this is found in the fan 
letters that come into "SNL," such as the long appeal mounted on his office 
wall from two teen-age girls in New Hampshire imploring Sandler and office mate 
David Spade to be their dates at their high school prom. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't take them up on the invite? "No. I wanted to. I guess they were 
playing some cruel joke on us because we called and they said, ' Ewwww !' " 
</P>
<P>
 But, seriously, "I'm not Joey Lawrence, you know," he says. "It's not 
everywhere I go people going Ah-dam! Just nice people talking. When I do 
stand-up shows at colleges, girls will talk to me after the show, and that 
always feels good. I like talking to them. I like girls. Girls are soft and 
pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 "My girlfriend's cool about it. My girlfriend's hot-looking. I could have 10 
girls talking to me and then one guy comes up to her and says, 'How's it going' 
and I'm like ' What'd that guy say to you ? Well, next time don't look at him ! 
You looked at him !' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sandler met his love interest at a comedy club in New York five years ago, 
before he moved West to work the clubs in Los Angeles, where he was discovered 
by Lorne Michaels' conduits and dispatched back to Manhattan. Sandler zooms in 
on the phrase "five years," counting every season precious at his ripe old 23 
as his voice gets all craggy: "I feel like an old man. I've got so much to 
give, though. I hope the Lord lets me live long enough ." (A new shtick -- 
Elderly Boy -- in the making?) 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Sandler is holed up in a trailer thousands of miles from 
home in Venice, Calif., waiting for his call on a movie shoot. It's 
"Lifesavers," a Nora Ephron project set around (and due for release at) 
Christmastime, which would explain the huge tree in the middle of a blocked-off 
ocean-side avenue and the thousands of lights incongruously adorning the 
adjacent shops. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, which focuses on goings-on surrounding a Venice suicide hot line 
office on Christmas Eve, Sandler is playing a goofball (surprise) with an 
unrequited crush on Rita Wilson, who really has Steve Martin as her love 
interest. Sandler's role was originally intended as a small one, but Ephron 
liked what he was doing so much that she let him improvise additional material. 
He even gets to serenade Wilson on the ukulele with love ballads of his own 
earnest, warped composing. (Wilson appeared in Ephron's "Sleepless in Seattle," 
which starred her husband, Tom Hanks -- who, coincidentally, hosted "Saturday 
Night Live" the night Sandler made his first appearance.) 
</P>
<P>
 Has his part been bolstered to help ensure the movie's youth appeal, maybe? 
"Juliette Lewis (playing an ex-con) will do that," he responds. "I'm just 
padding. But Nora's kids did tell her that they would go if I was in the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin stops by the door of Sandler's trailer and sees he's doing an 
interview: "So you're representing your dark side to them? Or gonna go with the 
straight side?" Then he whooshes off. 
</P>
<P>
 Demons, he said? "There is a body under this trailer," Sandler announces, in 
the wake of Martin's departure. "That's our little secret." But from all 
indications, Sandler doesn't appear to have much darkness or straightness to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Manchester, N.H., wonder years he describes have an idyllic glow, at least 
in the shorthand form he presents them in: lots of friends, lots of 
girlfriends, fairly supportive parents, an older brother who inducted him into 
the ways of music and comedy and a town full of folks willing to indulge his 
juvenile experiments in laugh-getting, mostly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved being funny in class," Sandler says. "But I tell you, the funniest 
stuff I did when I was little, first to sixth grade, was at movie theaters, 
screaming at the screen and making the whole theater laugh. I'd always say like 
five jokes, and there would be four power laughs. And then the fifth one I 
would say, 'Hey, nice hair!' or something like that, and somebody would go, ' 
Hey, shut up ,' and then it would just take away the other four jokes I killed 
on -- everyone turned on me. But that was definitely the place where I was 
funny." 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid, Sandler says, he usually fell asleep somewhere around the sports 
roundup during the weekend late news when trying to stay up for "Saturday Night 
Live." Meanwhile, it was really a Rodney Dangerfield record, he says, that 
turned him on to comedy as a preordained vocation, along with Cheech & Chong 
albums and repeat viewings of "Caddyshack" that he memorized to impress his 
older brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caddyshack" seems to be regarded by Sandler as the touchstone of all 
contemporary filmic comic art. And the influence is obvious in many regards, 
none more so than the fact that the Bill Murray character there could be an 
older relative to some of Sandler's recent characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl the assistant greenskeeper? Yeah, he would be good friends with the 
Canteen Boy," Sandler agrees. "Except Carl had a violent streak in him. He said 
he would slice the guy's hamstring. The Canteen Boy has never hurt anyone in 
his life. He's afraid of violence -- he's a peacemaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandler, on the other hand, did not shy away as a youngster from punching out 
his fellow schoolchildren in certain instances. In the one blemish on the rosy 
childhood he paints, he admits using fisticuffs on occasion to settle scores 
that might begin with an anti-Semitic comment whispered as he walked the length 
of the bus to get off in front of the temple for Hebrew school. Manchester was 
not a very Jewish town, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, his was not to be a bitter or angry kind of comedy. He tried 
being nasty, because that's what the other comics were doing, but just "wasn't 
very good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not great at putting down people," Sandler says. "Like if someone heckles 
me in the audience when I do stand-up, I was never like 'Hey, nice shirt, bla 
bla bla,' because I never could think of anything. It would be more like 
(whining) 'Please, I'm trying to speak.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A stand-up showcase landed Sandler a gig as an "SNL" writer, though his 
sketches were often too eccentric for others to make their own. He soon became 
a "featured player" on the show before the success of Opera Man persuaded 
Michaels to make Sandler a regular a season or so ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as a cult star of the younger set waiting for establishment on the big 
screen, Sandler is just sage enough to know these are the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a dumb guy with my career, and I know that this is the neatest part, 
of just getting discovered," he says. "People like you the most when they're 
discovering you, because you're their discovery. You didn't get forced on them, 
there was no network that said, 'Watch this guy, watch this guy.' I was in and 
out of skits and people started saying, 'Oh, I like this guy.' Now when I play 
these colleges, they're all my generation and they all feel like we connect, so 
it's a fun time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I know it's going to go away, that connection. Someone else will 
come along. So right now I feel like it's the best time." 
</P>
<P>
 After he wraps the Ephron picture, Sandler's summer responsibility is carrying 
a film for the first time, in the form of the starring vehicle "Billy Madison," 
which he co-wrote with longtime friend Tim Herlihy. It's about a thoroughly 
spoiled scion who tries to convince his retiring dad that he's worthy of taking 
over the family business by repeating his whole education, taking Grades 1 
through 12 for two weeks each. Universal liked the project so much that the 
studio even acceded to Sandler's suggestion for director, Stephen Kessler, a 
buddy known primarily for commercial work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such is Sandler's star power now that he can already dictate his choice of 
directors to a major studio, successfully? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right. It's not star power, it's physical power," he corrects. "I 
walked into the office -- I had Hal Lieberman, one of the heads of Universal, 
in a full nelson, and I said, 'This is the way it's gonna go,' and he said, 
'Please, just don't hurt me !' Yeah, it feels good -- that's why you get in 
shape, that's why you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The production call to continue shooting the Ephron picture comes from 
somewhere down Venice's Santa Claus Lane, and Sandler adjusts his wardrobe once 
more in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look good, huh?" A little self-affirmation; Stuart Smalley would be proud. 
"This is what I do before every scene: 'You deserve this, Adam! You've worked 
hard! You've showed them aaalll! Those kids, that guy at the movie theater who 
told me to shut up, he won't tell me that now .' 
</P>
<P>
 He breaks character. "I've gotta take this earring out." A painful 
miscalculation. "Ow! You know why I take the earring out?" he asks, not missing 
a beat. "Two reasons: continuity in the movie, and just in case my dad stops 
by."*

TELEVISION; SHE'S KEPT HER EYES ON THE PRIZE; MYRLIE EVERS, WIDOW OF THE SLAIN 
CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER, IS WORKING TO KEEP HIS MEMORY ALIVE. AS HBO PREPARES TO 
AIR A NEW DOCUMENTARY ON HER LATE HUSBAND, HER CHALLENGE IS TO MAKE SURE YOUNG 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE INTOLERABLE CONDITIONS THAT BLACKS OVERCAME IN THE SOUTH

<P>
 It was supposed to be the end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Myrlie Evers' determined fight to help convict the accused murderer of her 
husband, civil rights leader Medgar Evers, ended in February, won in the same 
Mississippi courtroom where it had first been lost 30 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Newscasts showed a joyous and tearful Myrlie Evers jumping in the air after 
the guilty verdict, letting out a celebratory shout and looking toward the 
heavens as she proclaimed: "Medgar, I've gone the last mile of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 With that pronouncement, Myrlie Evers declared herself free from the ghosts of 
injustice. The agonizing emotional pain would evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so she thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In early June -- little more than four months after aging white supremacist 
Byron De La Beckwith was found guilty of assassinating Medgar Evers outside his 
Jackson, Miss., home on June 12, 1963 -- Myrlie Evers; her daughter, Reena 
Evers-Everett, and her second husband, Walter Williams, were the guests of 
honor at a gala screening of the HBO documentary "Southern Justice: The Murder 
of Medgar Evers." 
</P>
<P>
 The screening of the film, which chronicles Medgar Evers' bold crusades 
against segregation in the South and the frustrating efforts to bring Beckwith 
to justice, was held at the National Press Club in Washington to commemorate 
the 30th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to have been an evening of somber recollection and jubilant 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 And then Myrlie Evers saw the black-and-white images of Medgar, the 
quiet-spoken field secretary of the Mississippi division of the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, on the screen. She noticed clips she had 
never seen before -- glimpses of her late husband giving instructions, talking 
with fellow civil rights advocate Roy Wilkins, sitting alone on a stool. A rare 
clip of him smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 And all of the emotion, the hurt, the volatile mixture of love, anguish and 
anger, came crashing back into her heart and mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so terribly emotional for me, I had to quickly shift from just looking 
at the film to becoming a critic of the production, analyzing the film," Evers 
said recently at a Beverly Hills hotel. "All these years, I had to develop 
survival tactics, and I found myself doing that again to keep myself from 
breaking down. My daughter was crying and my husband was wiping away tears, and 
all I could think was, 'I can't cry, I can't cry, I can't cry.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew then that it will never really be over," Evers, 61, added quietly. 
"I'm free, but nothing removes the pain of losing Medgar and the manner in 
which he was lost. The wound is so deep that it doesn't heal." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Evers and others find themselves embroiled in another struggle on behalf 
on Medgar Evers. They feel that his accomplishments and actions have too long 
been overshadowed by the deeds and dramatic demeanors of more widely known 
civil rights pioneers such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
 While they greatly respect those leaders and don't want to take anything away 
from them, they said it is time that young and old realize that Medgar Evers 
should also be placed among the key figures who fought overwhelming forces in 
the struggle to win equality for African Americans during the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a thorn in my side, but not in the sense of not wanting Martin 
and Malcolm to have their due," Evers said. "It just strikes a bad-sounding 
chord within me to see that period written about or portrayed on television and 
in movies and not see Medgar mentioned at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern Justice: The Murder of Medgar Evers" is the first step to reverse 
the oversight. The co-production of HBO and the British Broadcasting Corp., 
narrated by civil rights activist Julian Bond, premieres Monday on HBO at 10:05 
p.m. under its "America Undercover" documentary banner and will air several 
times this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Myrlie Evers is also overseeing efforts by Tougaloo College in Mississippi to 
turn Evers' former Jackson home into a cultural and social change center. She 
hopes to write how she fought to see justice done in her late husband's murder. 
The NAACP at its upcoming convention in Chicago will also introduce an annual 
Medgar Evers Award that will be given to three young people who draw a picture 
or write a poem or essay about his achievements and philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NAACP certainly recognizes the contributions of Medgar Evers, that he 
gave his life in the fight to get equal rights for blacks," said Terhea 
Washington, national public relations director for the NAACP. "African 
Americans have the right to vote because of him. We will make sure that his 
legacy is not lost." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 British filmmaker Christopher Olgiati, who wrote, produced and directed the 
one-hour, six-minute documentary, gave one reason for Medgar Evers' relatively 
low profile: "He was quiet, modest and did not want to draw attention to 
himself. Medgar operated in the shadows, and was motivated by the awful things 
that he saw. He did not want personal glory, and that's why he was eclipsed by 
history. But he showed more imagination in coping with the situation than most 
other civil rights leaders, and he did incredible things. He never got the 
attention he deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Evers' accomplishments were given little national coverage. The exposure of 
blacks at the time, especially those fighting against the system, was already 
limited. And the white-controlled media in Mississippi did not want news of 
Evers' triumphs to get beyond the "cotton curtain," Olgiati said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance screenings of the documentary to groups and media around the country 
have been marked by tears from audience members, as well as outraged shouts at 
some of Beckwith's racist statements. Myrlie Evers and Olgiati said they have 
already received a surprising response from teen-agers and young adults who 
said they had never known about Medgar Evers and want to learn more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a classic story of good versus evil," Olgiati said. "It's a story that 
illustrates the blind inhumanity of hatred and racism as well as anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Myrlie Evers has also been approached by a Hollywood producer about a possible 
television film on Medgar and the long legal battle, but, she added, no deals 
have been officially announced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Medgar Evers was shot in the back as he returned home from a civil rights 
rally. Myrlie Evers and her three small children were inside the house when the 
shot rang out. After crouching on the floor for a few minutes, the family 
emerged from the house to find him bleeding on the front porch. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith was immediately fingered as the suspect. A committed member of the 
racist White Citizen's Council, the outspoken tobacco and fertilizer salesman 
had made no secret of his hatred of Jews, blacks and, particularly, the 
integrationist tactics of Medgar Evers. His gun, an Enfield 30.06 rifle, was 
discovered in a honeysuckle thicket nearby. One of his fresh fingerprints was 
on the scope. Prosecutors also said that a bruise around one of his eyes could 
have been caused by the recoiling weapon. And witnesses testified that they had 
seen a car that looked like Beckwith's near the Evers home around the time of 
the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beckwith argued that his gun had been stolen and that he was 90 miles away 
in Greenwood, Miss., at the time of the shooting. The testimony of three police 
officers -- including one who said he strongly believed in segregation -- 
corroborated Beckwith's story. Two all-white juries failed to reach verdicts, 
and Beckwith was set free. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the atmosphere in Mississippi during the 1950s and 1960s, the 
outcome was not surprising. As Bond says in the HBO documentary, "Entering 
Mississippi at that time was like leaving America behind." It was a time not 
only of rampant segregation but also violence, when a white man who killed a 
black man could get away with murder. Lynchings, death threats in the night, 
burning crosses, twilight visits by the Ku Klux Klan were a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a time when a 14-year-old boy, Emmett Till, was murdered for 
asking out a white woman, when a man named Mack Charles Parker, who was accused 
of raping a white woman, was taken from his jail cell by a white mob and 
lynched. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken Evers took it upon himself to become the conscience for racial 
justice in Mississippi. By night, he disguised himself as a poor sharecropper 
and investigated the murders of Till and other slain blacks. By day, he 
spearheaded voter-registration drives for black people, urged boycotts of 
stores that would not hire blacks and campaigned to end segregation of schools 
and public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 His activities brought attention to Till's death and made him a hero with 
Mississippi blacks. It also made him a target among angry whites, a certainty 
that he seemed resigned to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Southern Justice," Olgiati uses vintage film clips of Ku Klux Klan 
rallies, Citizen's Council programs and interviews with residents to bring the 
era of the sweaty South to life. One of the clips showed then-Mississippi Gov. 
Ross Barnett strolling into the courtroom during Beckwith's first trial and 
shaking his hand in front of the all-white jury in a show of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going to the Delta, wondering how could I make this hatred and 
suppression into a film," Olgiati said. "I drove around endlessly, and suddenly 
it all just came alive to me, the whole air of how it must have been." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with Beckwith's release and the stifling conditions of the South, 
Myrlie Evers packed up her children and moved to Claremont, Calif. In 1967 she 
wrote a book, "For Us the Living," about her and Medgar's involvement in the 
civil rights struggle; she later became director of planning and development at 
the Claremont Colleges, helped found the National Women's Political Caucus and 
was appointed in 1987 as a commissioner on the Los Angeles Board of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 But Myrlie Evers never lost sight of Beckwith and was determined to bring him 
back into court for her husband's murder. That opportunity came in 1989, when 
the Jackson Clarion-Ledger reported that high-level Mississippi officials had 
played an influential role in Beckwith's defense. The Sovereignty Commission, a 
group led by the governor, attorney general and other government officials that 
was dedicated to the preservation of segregation, had screened jurors in the 
second trial to find Beckwith supporters.  
</P>
<P>
 A Clarion-Ledger story in 1990 reported that a book written in 1965, 
"Klandestine," quoted a former Klan officer as saying that Beckwith told him 
after the second trial that he had killed Evers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Killing that nigger gave me no more inner discomfort than our wives endure 
when they give birth to our children," Beckwith was reported as saying. He was 
arrested in December, 1990, at his Signal Mountain, Tenn., home and a third 
trial was eventually set. An appeal of his conviction is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Olgiati's 1990 jailhouse interview with Beckwith is a key element of the 
documentary and has provoked some of the most vocal responses from audiences. 
During the interview, Beckwith refers to blacks as "beasts" and is unrepentant 
about his views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that is against the right white Christian side is evil, and we won't 
tolerate it," he says at one point. "We're going to get the white man out of 
the closet." 
</P>
<P>
 When Myrlie Evers viewed the documentary and heard Beckwith's statements, it 
brought back a strong clash of emotions. She had felt the same clash when she 
saw Beckwith at the third trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rage and hatred have been unwanted partners in my life ever since Medgar's 
death," she said. "My parents had always told me not to hate, that I would 
become a lesser being by hating. But that first year after Medgar was shot, 
rage and hatred was the main force that kept me going day to day. Then I saw 
that there were three children who were looking at me to be a role model, and I 
had to learn to change the negative to a positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, when I have seen interviews with Beckwith over the last five years, 
there would be times when that rage would come back. I saw that he was the 
strong motivating force in my life. His hatred and sickness made me realize 
that something had to happen to show that he was wrong. I felt pity for him at 
a brief moment, but then I just wished he had never existed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the footage of Medgar in "Southern Justice" that brought back her 
personal pain of the wrenching human and domestic drama behind the civil rights 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very jealous of the time that Medgar was spending on the job," she 
said. "He would tell me, 'I want to make a better life for you, make this a 
better place for you and our children.' I told him, 'I would rather have you 
than freedom.' He would look at me sternly and say, 'Don't you understand what 
I'm doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Evers recalled one of the more heated arguments she and Medgar had during his 
first year at NAACP headquarters: "I really got on him, saying, 'How much time 
are going to spend on your job? We need you here too.' I was really, really 
upset, and he said, 'Myrlie, I cannot fight white folks 24 hours a day, 
struggle to pull our people along and come home and fight you here. Either 
you're with me or you aren't.' Well, I was just incensed at this. How dare he 
try to make me choose! 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I realized that he really did not belong to me, and that ours was not a 
typical marriage. The movement had first claim on him, and I had to accept that 
I came third, after the movement and the children." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Medgar Evers' achievements should have a special resonance for young 
black people, especially rappers who talk about how hard it is to grow up in 
the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when I feel like saying to this generation, 'You don't know 
how good you have it,' " she said. "We lived in homes where windows were 
broken, where dresses were made out of flour sacks, there were no paved 
streets, we had to walk for miles and pass by the good white schools to get to 
the poor black schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "But back then, we didn't have drugs like there are now, and the family unit 
was much stronger. I just hope that young people find out this part of history 
that might make them feel better about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Evers currently runs a speakers bureau, Evers and Associates, and has 
residences in California and Oregon. She and Williams, a retired longshoreman 
and former union organizer, recently celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 As for her struggle on behalf of her first husband, it continues. But she has 
a renewed strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have kept my promise," she said. "The wound may be deep, but I know I will 
not let anything take away the victory of that verdict."* 
</P>
<P>
 * "Southern Justice: The Murder of Medgar Evers" airs Monday at 10:05 p.m. on 
HBO.

FILM COMMENT; HOW WE'VE LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE REISSUE; THE 
RESTORED 'DR. STRANGELOVE' REMAINS A POTENT FILM AFTER 30 YEARS.; THE KUBRICK 
CLASSIC, TAKEN WITH THE DECIDEDLY MIXED PLEASURES OF 'EASY RIDER,' ILLUSTRATES 
THE BLESSINGS OF RE-RELEASES AND THE DIFFERING PHILOSOPHIES THAT MOTIVATE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, Kenneth Turan is The Times' film critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a time, says the Bible, which ought to know, for every purpose under 
heaven, and in the world of theatrical movies, the past several years have been 
the time for elaborately ballyhooed re-releases of classic films. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Disney, with its practice of periodically unleashing the gems of its 
animation library, has been re-releasing for decades, it was Columbia's 
decision to give new life to "Lawrence of Arabia" in 1989 by adding 
once-discarded footage that probably kicked off the current craze. 
</P>
<P>
 And a craze it's been, with the list of films getting a second chance, with or 
without restored scenes, including "A Streetcar Named Desire," "Midnight 
Cowboy," "Blade Runner," "The Guns of Navarone" and "La Strada." Both 
"Woodstock" and "McCabe & Mrs. Miller" are currently playing in Los Angeles in 
new prints, and "The Conformist," "Mickey One" and "They Shoot Horses, Don't 
They?" are due in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 Even given this logjam, this coming week is a banner one for the cause. For, 
to mark the 30th anniversary of "Dr. Strangelove" and the 25th of "Easy Rider," 
new prints of both films will get first-run theatrical treatment, the former at 
the Nuart in West Los Angeles starting Wednesday and the latter at the Sunset 5 
in West Hollywood starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both films share more than their concise 90-something-minute length. Each has 
Terry Southern as one-third of a screenwriting team (he was Oscar-nominated 
both times), and each contains one of the great symbolic images of the decade: 
from "Easy Rider," Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda riding their outlaw choppers 
across the American landscape, and from "Dr. Strangelove," the irrepressible 
Slim Pickens as Maj. T. J. (King) Kong grandly waving his Stetson and riding a 
nuclear bomb like a bucking bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 In other ways "Dr. Strangelove" and "Easy Rider" have surprisingly little in 
common, though, and taken together they point out both the blessings of this 
wave of reissues as well as the different philosophies that motivate a film's 
revival. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" 
is concerned, a respect for quality is the driving force. In a new print made 
from a negative created from director Stanley Kubrick's personal copy, it 
emerges as, if anything, a more potent piece of filmmaking than it appeared 
three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing it today, with all its audacious black humor undated, one is not 
surprised that "Dr. Strangelove" is cited by directors as dissimilar as Steven 
Spielberg ("one of my favorite movies of all time, without a doubt") and Oliver 
Stone ("I suppose many of our fears of big government are rooted in that theme, 
in Kubrick's paranoia") as a key career influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kubrick scholar Norman Kagan notes that the director "had been interested in 
the problems of the nuclear arms race for six years before starting 'Dr. 
Strangelove,' including reading over 70 books on the subject of nuclear combat 
and control, and subscribing to Aviation Week and the Bulletin of the Atomic 
Scientists." 
</P>
<P>
 But though Kubrick's initial thought behind buying the rights to "Red Alert," 
Peter George's thriller about accidental nuclear war, was to make a serious 
film on the subject, he found he simply couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea of doing it as a nightmare comedy came in the early weeks of working 
on the screenplay," Kubrick told one interviewer. "I found that in trying to 
put meat on the bones and to imagine the scenes fully, one had to keep leaving 
out things which were either absurd or paradoxical, in order to keep from being 
funny; and those things seemed to be close to the heart of the scenes in 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 From its opening sequence of the midair refueling of a giant B-52 bomber 
played against a soft instrumental version of "Try a Little Tenderness," the 
film's strength is this ability to be at once funny, chilling and 
intellectually engaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the story line is more than unnerving. A rogue American general in 
the Strategic Air Command decides on his own initiative to send planes to 
attack the Soviet Union and is able to do so just as that country secretly 
activates a doomsday machine that will automatically destroy the world if so 
much as one bomb falls on the U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this horror funny is the controlled comic exaggeration of both the 
Kubrick-George-Southern script and the acting that animated it. As a satire on 
the military mind, filled with lines like "Gentlemen, no fighting in the War 
Room," "Strangelove" is one of those rare Hollywood scripts, both pithy and 
outrageous, that was not second-guessed by studio worriers. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the acting, starting with Peter Sellers and his celebrated 
trio of roles, all the principals manage to be both outrageous and in control. 
From Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, worried about a plot to impurify 
our vital bodily fluids, to George C. Scott as the befuddled Gen. Buck 
Turgidson and Keenan Wynn as Col. Bat Guano, more concerned with protecting 
private property than stopping nuclear catastrophe, everyone has an 
understanding of the pitch this roguish script ought to be played at. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, it was just this mixture of serious subject matter with 
maniacal humor that infuriated many critics on the film's initial release. The 
New York Times' Bosley Crowther said it was "defeatist and destructive to 
morale"; the Los Angeles Times' Philip K. Sheurer called it "an evil thing 
about an evil thing," and others followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even with the abeyance of the Soviet threat, "Dr. Strangelove" seems 
continually relevant. What is especially poignant about the film today is 
realizing the difficulty something this politically engaged would have getting 
made now and how unlikely it would be, given what he has done lately, that the 
talented Kubrick would be the person to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the fuss made about it, "Dr. Strangelove" was not as big a hit in 
its time as "Easy Rider," which shocked the studio Establishment by earning 
more than $50 million domestically on a budget of $375,000. Though nowhere the 
artistic accomplishment that "Dr. Strangelove" was, it definitely touched a 
nerve in the country, and its re-release is an attempt to see if just as many 
people will respond with dollars the second time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Easy Rider" has come to be the quintessential 1960s movie, it is 
important to remember that it came out in 1969, when the era it celebrated was 
just about over. Rather than an influence on a moment in American cultural 
history, it was a mythologizing and a goodby that affected other movies more 
than it did society at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Loosely directed by co-star Dennis Hopper, "Easy Rider" follows cool dudes 
Billy and Wyatt (Hopper and Peter Fonda), flush with money from a rich West 
Coast drug deal, as they motor out to New Orleans for a Mardi Gras celebration 
of their fiscal success. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediately noticeable thing about "Easy Rider" is how much it has 
become dated, turning into a relic of an era that has disappeared. It's not 
just hearing about people getting their thing together so they can have a 
groovy experience that now seems archaic but also the stoned philosophizing 
about the meaning of freedom that went along with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Running through all of "Easy Rider" is a naive awe at those lucky folk who 
"live off the land, doing your own thing in your own time." Most embarrassing 
is a visit Billy and Wyatt pay to an archetypal commune, where the marks of 
hippiedom, from the I Ching and Tai Chi to tepees and faded VW buses, clamor 
for attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Still the freshest thing about "Easy Rider," it will surprise no one who 
remembers it, is Jack Nicholson's supple breakthrough performance as a Jim 
Beam-drinking lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. To experience 
Nicholson curiously examining a joint or declaiming on everything from UFOs to 
New Orleans hookers is thankfully as much a pleasure as it ever was. 
</P>
<P>
 And as dated as so much of "Easy Rider" is (who wouldn't like to forget the 
oafish rednecks and that embarrassing New Orleans drug trip?), some of the 
simplest things the movie did prove to be as effective now as then. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the soundtrack, featuring songs by the Byrds, the Band, Bob 
Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf and others, still sounds alive. When the music 
is joined to Laszlo Kovacs' invigorating cinematography, "Easy Rider" is able 
to call forth the sense of freedom and possibility that made it such a

POP MUSIC; GOOD 'VOODOO' OR LOUNGE-LIZARD TIME?; THE INTERVIEW; THE KEY TO 
'VOODOO'? MICK, KEITH HAVE THEIR (DIFFERING) OPINIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With most rock bands, there is a single party line when it comes to interviews 
-- as if every member sits down ahead of time and agrees on how to tell the 
story. With the Rolling Stones, however, there is usually the Mick Jagger line 
and the Keith Richards line. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid- and late '80s, when there were tensions between Jagger and 
Richards over the future of the band, you could understand how these two old 
chums saw things differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though things apparently are smooth again, they still have separate takes 
on why the new "Voodoo Lounge" is the Stones' most appealing album in years. 
</P>
<P>
 To Jagger, it is mostly due to extensive planning before going into the 
studio. To Richards, it is pride and the freedom to rely on musical instincts 
that the band had long suppressed -- ironically, to avoid sounding too much 
like the Stones. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the last outing ("Steel Wheels"), we had a deadline to go on the road and 
there wasn't as much time as I would have liked to work on the record," Jagger 
says during a phone interview from Toronto, where the band is rehearsing for a 
tour that begins Aug. 1 in Washington, D.C., and reaches the Rose Bowl on Oct. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time we spent longer writing . . . so we had more songs. We had four 
long songwriting sessions, each about four weeks. We've never (written most of 
the album prior to the sessions) before. I have only been suggesting it for 30 
years. . . . But in the end, I am as much to blame as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 The planning went further than songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also sat down . . . Keith and myself and then Charlie (Watts) and myself 
about how we wanted the record to sound . . . about it being a bit more direct, 
a bit more simple," Jagger continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good I think because at least the other person knows what the other 
person is trying to do, which sounds simple but doesn't always happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview, Richards doesn't mention songwriting or pre-session 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came in for this one, I think everybody knew that we had to hit the 
spot," the guitarist says. "After we managed to pull ourselves back after 
almost falling apart (before the "Steel Wheels" album), we needed to prove we 
could still make a good record. It was never spoken, but you could kind of feel 
it in the studio." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Richards says, the attitude in the band, which also includes 
guitarist Ron Wood, was so good going into the sessions in Dublin that his only 
concern was replacing bassist Bill Wyman, who quit the group last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God or our lucky stars or whatever, but the change was almost 
seamless," he says. "Darryl (Jones) hit it off with Charlie and it was a joy to 
behold." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Jagger and Richards agree on one thing: They were comfortable working in 
the studio for the first time with producer Don Was, whose growing list of 
credits ranges from Bonnie Raitt to Willie Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Don encouraged us to use some of the old (trademark) sounds," Jagger 
says. "I kept teasing him about, 'Well, now, we don't want too much nostalgia.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind the odd influence, but I don't like it to be too direct and I 
really don't think they are on the record. To me, a lot of the tracks are just 
slightly tinged, which is good, but they are not a total copy." 
</P>
<P>
 Richards is more at ease with invoking classic Stones touches. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times we have avoided certain sounds because we told ourselves we've 
already done that," Richards says. "So, I thought, 'Let's get over that 
barrier.' After all, it is those little sounds, like maracas and harpsichord, 
that add extra texture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I think we suffered a little in the '80s from the pressures we 
were under about where we fit into things musically. That may be why one 
(album) was a little plastic or another was a little off. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the worst things a band can do is to start looking at groups coming up 
as threats and feel like you have to look for something new to offer. To me, we 
sometimes got thinking about it too much . . . and I think we tripped up. This 
time we were just ourselves." ROBERT HILBURN

THE SHOCK JOCK OF TELEVANGELISM; WITH SAVVY PHILANTHROPY AND AN IN-YOUR-FACE 
STYLE, DR. GENE SCOTT HAS GENERATED A LAVISH LIFESTYLE, POWERFUL FRIENDS IN LOS 
ANGELES AND A FIERCELY LOYAL GLOBAL FOLLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Glenn F. Bunting, Glenn F. Bunting is a staff writer for The Times' 
Washington Bureau. His last article for the magazine was a profile of former 
L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT, MILLIONS OF weary souls plop down on the family-room 
couch, pick up the remote and scan the airwaves in search of infotainment. They 
skip past snapshots of Roseanne raiding the refrigerator and the Bundys 
swapping insults until a close-up of The Face flashes on the screen.  
</P>
<P>
 Partially obscured by cigar smoke, the face appears puffed with rage and ready 
to explode. Piercing blue eyes stare through half-framed reading specs and 
gold-rimmed shades, worn one on top of the other. A mouthful of perfectly 
aligned, pearl-white teeth sneers behind a wispy beard. Shocking white hair 
stands out each night from under assorted head wear -- a Stetson, a Stanford 
cap, a crown, even a sombrero. 
</P>
<P>
 This bizarre visage lures television viewers to Dr. Gene Scott, pastor and 
supreme leader of the Los Angeles University Cathedral. But it is his 
provocative, profanity-laced monologues that keep them tuning in. Scott's 
eclectic broadcast mixes high-voltage Scripture and obnoxious solicitations 
(for money, naturally) with taped footage of his church's world-champion 
American saddlebred show horses prancing to the tunes of Sinatra and 
Springsteen. Toss in heavy doses of call-in hero worship from South Africa to 
Santa Barbara along with amusing commentary on current events and the result is 
a sort of religious Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nuke 'em in the name of Jesus!" Scott ranted during the Gulf War, boasting 
that he was the only minister urging President Bush to bomb Iraq. Recently, 
after three years of extensive dental work, Scott joked to his congregation 
that "there'll be fewer weeks in 1994 that I come here wanting to kill. So, get 
on the telephone!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Get on the telephone!" is Scott's favorite bark. It's his way of ordering the 
faithful to send cash. And send they do, more than $1 million a month, 
according to some estimates. Through the years, the collections have helped 
support Scott's lavish lifestyle -- chauffeured limousines, Lear jet travel, a 
Pasadena mansion, 'round-the-clock bodyguard protection and scenic horse 
ranches in Kentucky and the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, w. euGene Scott, as he spells his name, seems miscast as God's 
renegade salesman. The 64-year-old preacher's son holds a Stanford Ph.D., 
fancies himself an intellectual, a philosopher, an avid bibliophile and 
philanthropist. But a closer look reveals a fascinatingly complex character: 
Scott has no formal education in theology, an enormous ego, eccentric 
personality and extraordinarily diverse interests. He is a world-renowned stamp 
collector, an equestrian, painter and hunter, and a saxophonist who pokes fun 
at "honkers" like President Clinton. He has been lampooned on "Saturday Night 
Live" by comic Robin Williams, profiled in the documentary "God's Angry Man" 
and feted by some of California's prominent personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott is hailed by some community leaders for reviving the Christian spirit in 
the City of Angels. While crime, homelessness, graffiti and the stench of the 
inner city have pushed other congregations to the outer suburbs, Scott 
relocated his Glendale church Downtown in 1986. Every Sunday he attracts 
hundreds of worshipers from all over Southern California to hear his message in 
the historic United Artists Theater at Broadway and Olympic. His church spent 
$2 million to renovate the classic Spanish Gothic theater, established in 1927 
by Hollywood luminaries Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, 
and today, the cathedral rooftop carries the same neon red "Jesus Saves" signs 
that for decades towered over the city's skyline a few blocks away on Hope 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his achievements, Scott remains misunderstood and the subject of much 
ridicule. His wealth and notoriety, coupled with his spirited defense of the 
Resurrection lead skeptics to dismiss him as just another greedy, 
Bible-thumping televangelist. But nothing infuriates Scott more than to be 
lumped with the likes of Jerry Falwell, Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every way possible within the boundaries of God's word, I have tried to 
separate from the television evangelists' image," Scott tells his congregation. 
Television evangelist "has become a word that can only become analogized to 
nigger, kike, beaner and other epithets designed to demean and create a 
perceptual set of a lesser-quality being."  
</P>
<P>
 Few quarrel with Scott's insistence that he occupies a planet all his own in 
the universe of electronic ministry. Within the mainstream of religious 
broadcasters, largely made up of conservative evangelicals like the Rev. Billy 
Graham, Scott is regarded as unique. Indeed, he is unusual even among the many 
zany characters who operate on the fringe of televangelism. Who else spreads 
God's word so fervently while smoking a fat cigar and cursing his rivals? Or 
advises his followers that they don't have to go to church on Sunday to be a 
Christian? Now that his church's broadcasting enterprise -- the University 
Network -- spans the globe, Scott claims the world as his parish. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as no surprise that Scott attracts more than his share of critics. 
They portray him as a paranoid, vindictive iconoclast who leads a flock of 
rebellious followers. Scott, they are quick to point out, is accountable only 
to himself, tolerates zero dissent and exerts a frightening level of control 
over his followers.  
</P>
<P>
 "He refuses to put himself in a position where he can be criticized," says 
David Gill, a professor of Christian ethics at North Park College in Chicago, 
who has observed Scott. "Instead, he surrounds himself with all these 
sycophants and weaklings who are just looking for somebody to submit to." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott provides a form of drive-by religion for the '90s to a transient 
population that needs only to watch television and send in cash to be counted 
among the faithful. But Scott preaches no easy gospel; the fiery pastor guides 
his congregation each Sunday through two hours of intense analysis that focuses 
on his own distinctive interpretation of Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to town 18 years ago and said I'm looking for the uncommon man or 
woman," Scott explains. "I'm not here to transplant saints. If you just want an 
ordinary church, pick up the Yellow Pages and find the closest one to you." 
</P>
<P>
 ON A GORGEOUS FEBRUARY AFTERNOON, NINE top officials from the Glendale 
Adventist Medical Center arrive at a lavish estate in Pasadena with no idea 
what awaits behind the heavy iron gates. Upon entering the meticulously 
landscaped grounds, they are screened by a guard who carefully checks each of 
their names against a formal guest list. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott is entertaining the Adventists to show his appreciation for the care his 
82-year-old mother received after falling and breaking both wrists and a leg. 
The hospital staff had accommodated Scott's daily midnight visits and his 
entourage of security men, personal physicians and other aides. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next three hours, Scott conducts a tour of his church's "Sistine 
Chapel" -- an underground, climate-controlled museum that includes an original 
Rembrandt and Monet displayed among the pastor's own paintings. The visitors 
are treated to an exquisite five-course luncheon catered and served by trendy 
Marino's of Melrose Avenue. They are left speechless when Scott offers to 
contribute $20,000 to a hospital fund-raising drive to obtain new surgical 
equipment. They are dazzled by Scott's riveting life story, witty charm and 
encyclopedic mind, later describing him as "sensitive," "urbane," "humorous," 
"thoughtful" and "humble." For some guests, it is difficult reconciling this 
version of Scott with the same personality who appears so wacky on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "People started walking away feeling they had been in the presence of a 
Renaissance man," extols David R. Igler, a hospital vice president. "It was 
kind of like being with a Leonardo da Vinci. I don't think I've ever had an 
encounter or experience like that in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Igler offered to recount his impressions of the visit at the request of L.A. 
City Councilman Richard Alatorre, a close friend of Scott and a loyal 
supporter. "Have you talked with him?" Igler inquired, the amazement in his 
voice suggesting that I, too, would be in awe after meeting the Renaissance 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, I had tried to interview Scott. I had called his church's 
toll-free hot line to make a mandatory reservation for his Sunday service. A 
volunteer, called a "Voice of Faith," answered, and she noted my name and asked 
for my "King's House" number, which identifies all dues-paying members. She 
also asked whether I had ever attended Scott's service. When I told her I had 
no ID number and that I had never been before, she apologized and said it was 
unlikely a visit could be arranged. (But others have easily made reservations.) 
</P>
<P>
 I drove to the University Cathedral anyway, parking in a vacant lot across the 
street from the rear of the church. I couldn't help but notice several 
middle-aged men in polyester suits with worried looks painted on their faces 
and two-way radios plugged into their ears. They were members of the church's 
vaunted security detail, which includes off-duty Los Angeles cops paid to 
protect Scott, his congregation and their Downtown property. The heavy security 
is necessary, Scott contends, because the church "has a lot of valuables, 
including my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, one guard retrieved a pair of binoculars and began looking my 
way. Another guard walked up to my car and jotted down the license plate 
number. A third, with long red hair tied in a ponytail, approached and stood 
within a few feet of the driver's side door, watching over me. 
</P>
<P>
 I left my car and walked around the block to the front entrance of the 
cathedral, where I encountered the same ponytailed guard, arms crossed and 
chest expanded. I kept walking. The church's lawyer had cautioned me against 
sneaking into the cathedral if I wanted to land an interview with Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 On a subsequent Sunday, the security crew threatened a photographer who showed 
up outside the church to take photographs for this article. Police were called 
to the scene when one of the guards repeatedly shouted obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
 I never did get to meet Scott, shake his hand or pose a question in person 
despite repeated attempts. "Gene Scott has no intention of responding to any 
questions regarding church finances and Dr. Scott personally," the pastor 
comments. All the quotations from Scott in this article come either from taped 
broadcasts of his programs or written responses passed through a church lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 At my request, Scott furnished five references for me to interview. All were 
certifiable big shots who used superlatives to describe Scott while glossing 
over his idiosyncrasies. A "brilliant fellow," raved Lodwrick Cook, the ARCO 
chairman. "Extraordinarily bright," glowed Mark Pisano, executive director of 
the Southern California Association of Governments. "He is a very, very bright, 
intelligent man," lauded Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs. "He is caring. 
He is committed to the city. He is honest," praised Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 None could top the gushing of California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown: "I 
think he is one of the most interesting public figures in California. He is an 
extraordinarily brilliant person. His skills at communicating are probably 
equal to anybody that we currently know and may ever know." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the five men had been exposed to Scott's charm and witnessed his 
extreme generosity. When Cook helped lead the "Save the Books" campaign after 
the Downtown Central Library fires, Scott organized a telethon that raised $2 
million in pledges. As a fellow director of the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in 
Pasadena, Pisano appreciated Scott for rescuing the nonprofit swim facility 
with cash donations exceeding $430,000. When Wachs wanted to rally support for 
his mayoral candidacy last year, Scott arranged for him to address his 
congregation on television. Whenever Alatorre needs a contribution to a worthy 
cause in his district, Scott is "always there" to chip in. And when Brown's VIP 
friends visit Los Angeles, Scott gladly furnishes a church limo. 
</P>
<P>
 A relentless self-promoter, Scott adroitly uses his church's charitable 
contributions and his association with personalities to boost his ministry. 
Compliments from Cook and former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley, among others, have 
appeared in full-page newspaper ads touting the minister and his church. When 
Scott wanted to establish his good character during a 1990 court battle, he did 
not hesitate to drop the names of Bradley and others in legal papers.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott maintains that his church contributes only to charities that city 
officials recommend for the community good. Asked whether he uses friends in 
high places to help legitimize his church, Scott responds: "The question is an 
insult to me, the (church) and my friends. We were never illegitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless the hard sell does not make a believer of everyone. The Rev. Dale 
O. Wolery became acquainted with Scott in 1985 before the Church of the Open 
Door, of which he was assistant pastor, sold its historic Downtown cathedral to 
Scott's congregation for $23 million. Wolery had spent a good deal of time in 
Scott's company. But after Scott reneged on the deal, involving the church in 
protracted lawsuits, Wolery came to view Scott as a manipulator and a showman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like what he stands for," concludes Wolery, currently senior pastor 
at North Community Church in Yorba Linda. "A side of him is engaging, warm. He 
knows how to make you feel good. He is dangerous primarily because he really 
comes off as a straight shooter. He is the ultimate hypocrite." 
</P>
<P>
 AT AN EARLY AGE, SCOTT BECAME WELL VERSED IN THE HIGHER POWER OF religion. The 
son of a traveling preacher and his teen-age wife, he was born on Aug. 14, 
1929, in Buhl, Ida. When Scott was 6, his mother gave birth to premature twins, 
and the girl died within hours. The following month, the baby boy was asleep 
and young Gene was suffering convulsions when their mother had a vision of 
angels coming.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a stairway begin to roll down from heaven and come right down to the 
side of my bed," Inez Leona Graves Scott recalled in a 1980 interview. "Two 
angels walked down and they stopped in front of Gene. I said, 'Oh no, Lord, you 
can't take Gene!' and they just went around him and picked the baby up." 
</P>
<P>
 The infant died but Gene was spared. From then on, his parents knew their 
surviving child was special. Shortly thereafter, the family moved to the 
Northern California town of Gridley when W.T. Scott agreed to head an 
Assemblies of God church. He succeeded a pastor who crucified himself on a tree 
trying to imitate the marks of Christ. "At that time, the people like my dad 
were the cults, the kooks and the nuts," Scott once told an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 In elementary school, Scott proved to be an exceptional student. Accompanying 
a straight-A, seventh-grade report card was a teacher's note to his parents: 
"Do you know you have a genius for a son?" He played on the high school 
basketball team, though his father's congregation did not approve of the boy 
exposing his legs in public. The caption under Scott's photo in the 1947 
Oroville Union High School yearbook read, "Always a good-natured fellow." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott married his high school sweetheart, Betty Ann Frazer, in the early 
1950s. They had no children and were divorced 23 years later. On his program, 
Scott has portrayed her as the "devil's sister. I hate her. If I go to heaven 
and she's there, I'm going to another planet." Scott's second wife, Christine 
E. Shaw, a stunning woman 20 years his junior, can be seen nightly on his 
program riding the church's champion show horses. Trained in ballet for 16 
years, Shaw shares Scott's passion for art, stamps, coins and other 
collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 A pivotal point in Scott's life came when he enrolled in a doctorate program 
in philosophy of education at Stanford University. One professor was a leading 
disciple of Reinhold Niebuhr, and Scott's dissertation on the American 
philosopher left an indelible mark on him. Quoting Niebuhr, Scott described his 
life's goal: to "descend from the anthill of scholastic hair-splitting to help 
the world of men regulate its common life and discipline, its ambitions and 
ideals." Like Niebuhr, Scott believed that this could not be accomplished 
without religion. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, Scott stood out as a loner who was almost single-minded in his 
quest to excel academically. After earning his doctorate in 1957, he taught 
briefly at a Midwestern Bible college, helped Oral Roberts establish a 
university in Tulsa, Okla., and joined the Assemblies of God movement, a 
fundamentalist Christian denomination, where he quickly established himself as 
a rising star. Scott traveled all over the world preaching salvation to rapt 
audiences and designed a Sunday school curriculum that significantly boosted 
church membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had one of the sharpest, keenest minds of anyone I have ever known," 
recalls the Rev. William Vickery, superintendent emeritus of the Assemblies of 
God Northern California and Nevada District. But it was only a matter of time 
before the restless Scott would "go free in order to be creative and relevant 
to today's world." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Scott resigned his Assemblies of God credential in good standing and 
returned to Oroville to launch his own ministry with his father. Today, 
Assemblies of God officials are stunned by what they see and hear on Scott's 
program. "I just can't imagine someone with his brilliance and abilities 
allowing his energies to be diverted the way they have been diverted," says a 
perplexed Vickery. "I don't understand it. I think it is such a waste." 
</P>
<P>
 It was while serving his Oroville ministry that Scott was approached about 
taking over the 45-year-old Faith Center Church in Glendale along with its four 
broadcast stations and $3.5-million debt. Scott, who also had established 
himself as a shrewd entrepreneur, agreed to serve as Faith Center pastor 
provided that church leaders resign and approve a reorganization plan that gave 
him control. To Scott's amazement, the church accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith Center since has expanded and prospered. A congregation that numbered 
500 when Scott took over in 1975 has mushroomed to more than 15,000 members in 
the Los Angeles area, according to church estimates that are difficult to 
confirm. The church acquired the ultimate power address: P.O. Box 1, Los 
Angeles. And in 1983, the University Network launched 24-hour-a-day broadcasts 
of Scott sermons via satellite to North America and much of Mexico and the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after, Scott endured two financial disasters that would have placed 
most pastors in peril of losing their jobs. In 1983, the Federal Communications 
Commission stripped the church of three broadcast stations, worth approximately 
$15 million, after Scott refused to turn over financial records as part of an 
investigation. (The church sold the fourth station.) In 1987, the church lost a 
$6.5-million deposit when Scott sought unsuccessfully to renege on a deal to 
buy the historic Church of the Open Door building in Downtown Los Angeles, 
which was later demolished after its owners sold it to developers. The church 
then pumped more than $2 million into renovating its current location, the 
United Artists Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The setbacks only made Scott more determined to succeed. After the church lost 
its broadcast licenses, Scott continued to air his program by buying time on 
local and cable TV stations locally and nationally. Scott's church not only 
offered programming to an already-established network of outlets, but continued 
to air its program on some of the same stations that were taken away by the 
FCC. The church also beamed its programming nationwide via satellite. By 1990, 
it reached 180 countries. Two years later, his ministry could be picked up 
anywhere in the world in four languages on medium- and short-wave radio. (His 
program is now seen nightly in greater Los Angeles on cable.)  
</P>
<P>
 Scott claims that he did not seek out an electronic ministry, but happened to 
rescue the first church in the nation to own a Christian TV station. In a 
three-piece suit, the clean-cut Scott looked the part of the stereotypical 
televangelist when he first hit the airwaves. But it did not take long for him 
to realize that he needed a shtick. Enter the long hair and beard, crazy hats 
and cigars. "The cigar lets you know I ain't no Jimmy Swaggart," he howls. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly earned a reputation as a colorful preacher whose blunt tactics both 
attract and offend his audience. He bragged over the air that he could 
"probably teach Hugh Hefner a thing or two" about sex and told those who 
refused to send money to "vomit on yourself with your head up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 This unconventional approach, while widely chastised in religious broadcasting 
circles, impressed people like the Rev. Jess Moody, a Baptist minister and 
pastor of Shepherd of the Hills church in Porter Ranch. Moody is an unabashed 
Scott admirer who wishes he had such nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man is not a fool, but he acts like one from time to time," Moody 
observes. "That, I think, is designed to get attention from people he wants to 
reach. Apostle Paul said, 'I am all things to all men that I might win some.' 
Gene is trying to win people to Christ, and he is not doing it in the standard 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 To attract new viewers, Scott later decided that his church needed a TV sports 
franchise, something comparable to Ted Turner's Atlanta Braves. Enter the 
equestrian team. "There are so many horses' asses on television that I wanted 
to show the world what a whole horse looked like," Scott is fond of saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Using proceeds from the sale of his art prints, Dr. Gene Scott Inc. acquired 
the Silver Oaks Ranch in Bradbury, valued at $11 million in 1989, and a stable 
of more than 100 show horses that are now believed to be worth millions.

 First-time viewers "stop to see the horses because they are a class act," 
Scott told viewers in January. "And before they know it, this cigar-smokin' 
preacher is talkin' about something a little different than a 
rantin'-and-ravin', hellfire-and-brimstone hypocrite preacher. And they stop to 
see the horses and end up hooked on the teachin'. That's it. All you get on 
this network is me and the horses and the music. Clear?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Clear!" his volunteers shouted obediently from behind studio phone banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just thought I'd say that. Get on the telephone!" 
</P>
<P>
 In response, callers from around the globe phone in to applaud their pastor. 
Scott delights in selectively reading the laudatory messages aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Manchester, Ohio: I love the teachin', the horses and the music. It's 
the best on TV. Apple Valley, Calif.: Pastor, God's word, you and the horses 
are all I need. Klamath Falls, Ore.: We got the No. 1 pastor smokin' the No. 1 
cigar on the No. 1 television program showin' the No. 1 horses." 
</P>
<P>
 IN JANUARY, 1991, MEMBERS OF THE LOS ANGELES University Cathedral received an 
urgent appeal in the mail. Their pastor needed them to dig deep for a special 
fund-raising drive so critical to the church's future that it could not be 
revealed how the money would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time. Scott has instructed his followers to give 
generously to anonymous fund-raisers on at least six other occasions. This one, 
called "Secret V," was the church's most ambitious fund-raising mission yet. By 
Easter, Scott wrote, his ministry had to receive $10,000 apiece from 700 
followers and a minimum $1,000 apiece from 3,000 supporters, for a total of $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates vary on the total amount of money Scott brings in. During a recent 
sermon, he claimed that his members set "the world record in per-capita giving" 
by donating $350 per person per month. He also has said that his weekly budget 
of $300,000 does not come close to meeting the rent, payroll, broadcasting and 
other operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott insists that he only accepts financial support from individuals who 
respond to his sermons. "People are taught to give based on what they think the 
teaching they receive is worth," he stresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of membership is steep. For starters, Scott expects the usual 10% of 
his followers' income in weekly tithings. Since 1988, at the start of each 
year, Scott has reminded his followers that he is collecting "firstfruits" 
above and beyond weekly donations. Firstfruits, according to Scott, is spelled 
out in Scripture as "the firstfruit of the new year belongs to the Lord." The 
firstfruits check includes the first returns on any form of income -- an 
investment, a pay raise, a second job, a tax refund, even Lotto winnings. What 
if you're out of work? "Well then, you give the first week's unemployment 
check," Scott advises. 
</P>
<P>
 For non-givers, Scott warns: "If you get too smart with God, He might let you 
live this next year without Him so you can see the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 While raking in uncounted millions, Scott refuses to open his church's books 
to the scrutiny of independent auditors or follow accounting safeguards 
required by the 700-member National Religious Broadcasters, a group Scott 
derides as "Not Real Bright" for inviting as a speaker televangelist Jimmy 
Swaggart, who was disgraced by a sex scandal in 1988. Such devastating scandals 
had cast a pall over televangelists nationwide, but the industry appears to be 
on the rebound. Former NRB chairman David Clark says he is encouraged by recent 
trends in religious programming that emphasize ministry and teaching in place 
of "glitz, glamour and hype." 
</P>
<P>
 "This year marks the end of the televangelist scandals and the impact from 
them is basically over," Clark says. A recent study of religious programming 
found that on-air fund-raising and promotional activities have fallen to the 
same levels as before the Swaggart scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, like a number of other televangelists around the country, is not 
rushing to join the NRB, which requires organizations to undergo independent 
financial audits annually, publish a yearly report of income and expenses and 
disclose total compensation packages of top church officials. He is, says 
Clark, one of a fading breed. "I see a move away from the entrepreneurial, Lone 
Ranger guy like him (Scott). I think the next generation will be pastors of 
mega-churches with thousands of members and budgets of $8 (million) to $10 
million a year, minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 Still Scott thrives, with a church he says is accountable to God, his 
congregation, a board of directors he declines to identify and the Full Gospel 
Fellowship of Churches and Ministries, of which he was president. Such lax 
financial accountability -- combined with Scott's lifestyle -- has, in the 
past, attracted the attention of state and federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Attorney General's Office in 1978 investigated allegations of 
fraud at Scott's church and 11 other religious organizations. The probe, 
launched after complaints by church members, was dropped in 1980 when the state 
Legislature passed a law preventing the attorney general from prosecuting cases 
of civil fraud against tax-exempt religious organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, the Federal Communications Commission opened an exhaustive 
investigation after former employees accused Scott of diverting donations of 
cash, furs, jewelry, stock and other valuables for his own use and concealing 
assets in Swiss bank accounts. The allegations were never proved, and Scott 
adamantly denies any improprieties.  
</P>
<P>
 He stymied repeated attempts by the federal government to scrutinize his 
church's financial operation by directing contributors to sign pledge slips 
that specifically stated Scott could spend the money however he pleased. This 
arrangement did not appear to affect the church's flow of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do anything he wants with the contributions I send him," allows Mike 
Parker, the former mayor of Tacoma, Wash., who has been watching Scott for a 
decade and donates weekly. It is virtually impossible to know how financial 
resources are divided among Scott, the church and their many corporations. The 
church's financial empire consists of a complex web of dozens of interlocking 
companies, among them Bishop Dr. Gene Scott Corp., Dr. Gene Scott Inc., Dr. 
Gene Scott Consultants Inc., Gene Scott Travel Inc., W. Eugene Scott, Ph.D., 
Inc., Gene Scott Evangelistic Assn. and Wescott Christian Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's second wife, for example, received a $190,000 finder's fee when Dr. 
Gene Scott Inc. purchased the Silver Oaks Ranch in Bradbury. At the time, 
Christine Shaw's personal fortune included several million dollars worth of 
horses, stamps, art and vintage cars -- the same items accumulated by Scott and 
his church. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Scott maintains that he has no property, investments, stocks or 
bonds and that everything he owns is in the name of the church. His contract 
calls for a $1 annual salary, plus unlimited expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "God knows how much money he has raised over the years soliciting funds," 
complains Chuck Dziedzic, the FCC administrator who spearheaded the 
investigation of Scott's church. "We never came close to finding out. I don't 
think anybody knows but him." 
</P>
<P>
 RON CAREY REGULARLY ATTENDS CATHOLIC MASS AT CHRIST THE KING Church in Hancock 
Park. But the 58-year-old actor, known best for his role as Levitt in the 
television sitcom "Barney Miller," often attends services on Saturday evenings. 
That's because Sundays belong to Gene Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have learned more from him than anybody," Carey says. "He is probably the 
authority on St. Paul. We just read the Bible and look at it. He will go right 
down to the word. This is interpretation. This is knowledge."  
</P>
<P>
 Like Carey, many of Scott's followers belong to other denominations. They 
assert that no one on the religious scene today approaches Scott's intellect 
and expertise when it comes to interpreting God's word. His analysis of 
Scripture relies heavily on Greek, Hebrew and German studies to clarify 
inaccuracies in the English translation. This is evident on Easter Sundays, 
when Scott presents a defense of the Resurrection that is rich in detail, well 
researched and supported by historical facts, followers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's quarrel with those who deny the Resurrection is that they don't spend 
enough time looking at it. "If this is true, this is the central fact of 
history!" he fumes. "You gotta be a fool among all fools of mankind to not 
think it's worth at least 30 hours of study in your whole life. That's why I'm 
doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 During his Sunday sermons, Scott often admonishes his congregation not to seek 
God's blessing from a priest, the Pope or a place of worship. "And you're sure 
not going to get it from a motel with Jimmy Swaggart," he cracks. Rather, these 
blessings flow through God's word as interpreted by Gene Scott. His is a 
"word-based church" offering intelligent Christianity, Scott emphasizes. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Times reporter Ralph Frammolino visited the University Cathedral 
for a glimpse into Scott's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 No expense has been spared in restoring the historic theater. The lobby, with 
gold-backed mirrors and a vaulted ceiling finished in fresco murals, is half a 
block long. The massive auditorium, almost medieval in appearance, features 
large murals depicting the motion picture industry. Onstage, a huge curtain 
bears the letters "UA" in a coat of arms with the words "The Picture's The 
Thing" -- a fitting slogan for Scott's television ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are required to enter the cathedral. "I ain't beggin' converts," 
Scott scolds. "You don't get in here without a pass. I don't want anybody in 
here that doesn't have an appreciation for that smallest hunger in your heart 
to pursue the revelation of God's word." 
</P>
<P>
 First-time visitors like Frammolino are escorted into the auditorium, assigned 
a seat and closely observed by the church's security force. A buddy system 
within Scott's congregation also keeps a watchful eye on strangers. "We want to 
make sure our pastor stays alive," whispers one follower from Orange County, 
who identifies himself only as Duane. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000-seat theater is filled with people from a variety of ethnic 
backgrounds. Dressed in casual attire, the churchgoers look as if they could 
just as easily be going to Dodger Stadium or a Sunday matinee. No one under age 
12 is in attendance; children of churchgoers ride air-conditioned buses every 
Sunday to one of 43 museums within a half-hour of the cathedral. "We don't lock 
our kids in a little cubbyhole and teach them to hate God until they get the 
first chance to leave the church," Scott says. 
</P>
<P>
 When the curtain begins to rise, congregation members leap to their feet and 
cheer wildly. Before them appears their master, clad in a priest's collar, a 
teal-and-black windbreaker and gray slacks, seemingly unmoved by the adulation. 
After several seconds of enthusiastic applause, a rock band belts out praise to 
Jesus as Scott sits impassively on a blue-cushioned stool until the singing 
ends. Among the tunes Scott occasionally orders up is "Kill a Pissant for 
Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott strives to conduct his service as if it was a postgraduate lecture in 
religious studies. He is fond of boasting that his congregation consists mostly 
of college graduates. Unlike most university courses, though, there is no room 
for discussion of any kind in Dr. Scott's classroom. With the exception of 
not-so-spontaneous laughter at Scott's one-liners, not a peep is heard from 
members during the teaching, not even an "Amen" or a "Hallelujah." Scott 
insists that his two-hour service goes uninterrupted and gets angry if people 
seated in the front get up, even to go to the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As he delivers his message, Scott pauses every few seconds to allow an 
interpreter to repeat his words for the benefit of dozens of Spanish-speaking 
members in the audience and others listening worldwide. He illustrates the 
day's lesson on a glass rectangle with the intensity of an agitated football 
coach marking Xs and Os at halftime.  
</P>
<P>
 While reading aloud scattered verses in Ephesians, Scott scribbles Greek words 
on the glass. Hagyois is for sainthood, Dike for righteousness and Logos for 
the word. He writes in red, blue, green and black felt pens, using the 
different colors to strike previous markings instead of using an eraser. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, the board is streaked with arrows, circles, lines and 
indecipherable words that become nearly impossible to follow. The lecture 
suddenly is reduced to a mind-numbing blur of Greek nuances that virtually 
force the class to accept a relentless tightening of the instructor's 
ecclesiastical monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the underlying message of "basic Christianity" is clear. While other 
pastors denounce homosexuality, abortion, adultery, profanity and drinking, 
Scott refuses to condemn such sinful behavior. He leaves worshipers free to 
make their own choice without coercion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ask you to change when you come here," he instructs the congregation. 
"I take you as you are, as God takes me as I am." Scott preaches that, if 
people listen to him and start practicing faith, "God is going to change you in 
spite of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 He finishes his sermon and vanishes offstage without shaking a single hand or 
meeting his congregation. Herein lies a startling contradiction: Scott promotes 
himself as a friend to sinners who have been shunned by other churches, yet his 
cathedral doors are sealed off to the general public. Even highly devoted 
followers are not permitted to approach him in the name of security. Scott's 
retort: "I am more accessible and contactable than the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
 Most worshipers seem not to care that they are prohibited from seeing their 
pastor in the flesh. They can tune him in 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
reveling in the rediscovery of their faith under the guidance of a shepherd who 
acts like a rebel and still is elected by God. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Anderson, a middle-aged aircraft mechanic who sports an unkempt gray 
beard, is a typical Scott devotee. He attended church as a child but eventually 
strayed from religion. That was before he became hooked on Scott's television 
program while working the night shift at Northrop. Now he and his wife, Tracy, 
drive in every Sunday from Torrance to hear Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Anderson found Scott "exasperating" because the minister jumps from 
subject to subject during his lectures. But the teachings began to fascinate 
him, especially the anti-religious-Establishment thread of Scott's message. "He 
teaches that we're free," Anderson notes. "We've been made free and people who 
are teaching that you are not supposed to do this (and) not supposed to do that 
are voiding that freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Parker, the former Dodger first baseman, recalls the day in 1980 that he 
first listened to Scott on television. Within 20 minutes, Parker was on his 
feet, pointing at the screen and screaming, "He's right! My God, this guy is 
right!" The next day, Parker plunked down $500 for Bible study materials and 
has been a regular supporter since. "This man has saved my life," Parker 
exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 He readily admits that some of his friends don't hold Scott in such esteem. 
"They don't like a two-hour service. They don't like that he occasionally uses 
a swear word. They don't like the fact that he gets angry. They don't like that 
he spends a lot of time railing against people on his staff that he doesn't 
think are doing a good job. Some of those things I don't like either, but it is 
worth it to me to sit through to get the message." 
</P>
<P>
 GENE SCOTT WAS LIVID. AFTER successfully courting the vote of flamboyant City 
Councilman Gilbert W. Lindsay to prevent the Church of the Open Door from being 
demolished in 1987, Scott sensed that he was about to be double-crossed.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay, a religious man whose district included the church site, had assured 
Scott's congregation one Sunday that "hell's gonna freeze over" before the 
building, which Scott's church had moved into, would be torn down. But when 
Lindsay began to waver about preserving the 72-year-old church, Scott did not 
hesitate to remind viewers that Lindsay, then 86, was in his "senior years" or 
"16 years past the biblically appointed allotment" -- three score and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now if you've had an illustrious career, and you're in your eighth decade, do 
you want to meet your Maker saying, 'I decided to do one in for you, God?' " 
Scott thundered. "Gilbert Lindsay ain't dumb enough to face his Maker reneging 
on a sacred commitment in a platform of a church before 5,000 people and an 
onlooking nation." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Lindsay got religion and supported the project. He died at age 90, 
presumably at peace with the Lord for keeping his word to Scott's church. But 
Scott could not keep the wrecking ball away. After he'd unsuccessfully tried to 
renegotiate his deal for the property, its original owner sold it to 
developers. Scott lost his $6.5-million down payment, but acquired the church's 
"Jesus Saves" signs. He then moved his church to the United Artists Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's willingness to invoke the wrath of God against Lindsay demonstrates 
the lengths he will go to intimidate an adversary. Friends say Scott is a 
fierce street fighter who strives to obliterate an opponent, be it Satan or a 
competitor. At horse shows, Scott is not content when his equestrian team 
captures a medal. He wants a sweep of all the top places. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere has Scott incurred more battle scars than in the courts. Since coming 
to Southern California, his church's far-flung enterprises have been tangled in 
more than 100 lawsuits. At times, Scott and his lawyers have drawn criticism 
for their litigation tactics. A federal judge in 1987 called a desperate bid by 
Scott to retain the Church of the Open Door a "reprehensible" abuse of the 
legal process. In 1990, in a lawsuit on behalf of the American Horse Show 
Assn., attorneys for the O'Melveny & Myers law firm accused Scott of hiding 
behind corporate fronts to overturn his suspension by the association. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Scott was banned from competition for calling a judge a 
"prejudicial, incompetent nincompoop" on his television program after one of 
his horses lost a competition. Scott argued in legal papers that his suspension 
should be overturned because the horses were owned by Gene Scott Inc., which he 
contended was not run by Gene Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 While the suits do not always succeed in court, apparently they are effective 
in helping to intimidate Scott's adversaries. Dozens of people refused to speak 
about Scott for this article because they expressed fear of being sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Scott's followers occasionally have resorted to verbal threats 
and physical violence to defend their minister. In 1985, a musician in Scott's 
band who criticized the preacher reported to officials that he was jumped, 
punched and tossed through a plate glass window by two church followers. The 
musician, Donald Vladimir Nicoloff, was treated for facial and leg cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months leading up to a trial on assault charges against his alleged 
attackers, Nicoloff claimed he received harassing, late-night phone calls from 
Scott's disciples, some threatening bodily harm. The trial against the two 
church followers ended in a hung jury when the key witness, the church's former 
head musician, fled to Tennessee because he feared reprisals from Scott's 
disciples, prosecutors maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale police were so concerned about a potential outbreak of violence by 
Scott's devotees that the prosecutor assigned to the case, Los Angeles County 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb Lapin, was issued a gun permit and assigned a police 
officer for protection during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to call his followers fanatics or lunatics," Lapin says. "But 
whenever you have a group that has strong followers, I find they are easily led 
by their leaders, whether they are good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
 ADMIRE HIM OR DESPISE him, Gene Scott has attained the kind of fame, lifestyle 
and influence that most people only dream about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in America," sighs Clark of the National Religious Broadcasters, "can 
people like this get on television, attract an audience and collect enough 
money to stay on television." 
</P>
<P>
 And only in Southern California, it seems, can a long-haired, loud-mouthed 
preacher pack a cavernous movie house each Sunday with followers eager to hear 
the word of God from him. In a city that attracts people seeking the good life, 
a pastor with a free spirit, a stable of horses, a chauffeured limo and an 
answer for everything can be an attractive role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene Scott offers you all the advantages of Christianity with none of the 
inconveniences except tithing," says Rabbi William Kramer, a religious studies 
professor emeritus at Cal State Northridge and an admirer of Scott. "You don't 
have to put that in cellophane to sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others feel strongly that Scott has no business preaching in a church. The 
Christian Research Institute, an international religious center based in Irvine 
that monitors controversial religious movements, goes so far as to advise 
Christians not to attend Scott's services. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last few years, Scott has become more and more outrageous and 
offensive," a CRI analysis concludes. "His language is crude, abusive and 
profane, clearly violating God's standards for Christians." 
</P>
<P>
 Such condemnation drives Scott up a wall. At a recent service, Scott groused 
that he is fed up with outsiders who have the nerve to question his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never stop!" Scott protested to loud applause. "These judgmental asses!"

AGAINST THE GRAIN; MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS PEDDLING PATENTED SEEDS AND

<P>
 The raid was planned well in advance, the target selected with precision, the 
goal immense. The farmers would wear green scarves and loose fitting khadi -- 
traditional homespun cotton -- that evoked the spinning wheel Gandhi had chosen 
as the symbol of India's self-reliance. Like Gandhi, the farmers would move 
against an unwelcome foreigner, echoing the Mahatma's campaign against British 
imperialism. And to focus the nation's attention on the threat of a new 
colonialism, they would seize on a speck of nature at the core of civilization 
and at the heart of their livelihoods: the seed. 
</P>
<P>
 The seed agitation began in a stairwell just before noon on Dec. 29, 1992. 
Seventy-five farmers mounted four flights of stairs that led to the southern 
India offices of a multinational food corporation. Inside, half a dozen 
employees from Cargill Seeds Private Ltd. of India -- a tiny subsidiary of the 
largest privately held company in the United States -- were going about their 
business when the farmers burst through the door. "We have not come to harm 
you," announced Sesha Reddy, a barrel-chested farmer with a shock of white 
hair, Coke-bottle glasses and a booming baritone. "We are here only as a 
protest." 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers smashed windows, tore phones from the walls, emptied desk drawers, 
broke open locked file cabinets and hurled armfuls of papers, financial records 
and the symbol of their protest -- Cargill hybrid seeds -- through the broken 
glass to the street below. "It was," recalls John Hamilton, manager for Cargill 
Seeds India, "a rather unpleasant experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Below, in the streets of downtown Bangalore, a city of 4.1 million in the 
state of Karnataka, 400 farmers scooped up the papers, files and seed packets 
as they fluttered down from the fifth-floor offices. Wearing his trademark 
green-felt hat, M.D. Nanjundaswamy waited in his car with a pack of matches. 
Farmer, state legislator and former law professor, Nanjundaswamy is perhaps 
India's most prominent figure in the farm protest movement. When the piles grew 
high, he handed the matches to a farmer. Within minutes, a huge fire brought 
traffic to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 " Bon fire," Nanjundaswamy said with a smile. "From the French origin. Good 
fire." The farmers formed a ring around the flames and shouted up to Cargill, 
in the south Indian language of Kannada, the historic slogan of Gandhi's 
freedom struggle: " Tolagi India !" Quit India. 
</P>
<P>
 "THIS IS INDEED A DEFINING MOMENT IN ECONOMIC HISTORY," declared Peter 
Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). Sutherland was addressing economic ministers from around the world who 
had gathered in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April to sign the largest trade pact in 
history and to establish a new international structure, the World Trade 
Organization. Sutherland, a former Irish attorney general, is generally 
credited with keeping the fractious First and Third World forces together and 
bringing the negotiations, which had begun more than seven years ago in 
Uruguay, to a successful conclusion. Many of the signatory governments still 
must ratify the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fall of communism, free trade has carried an air of destiny. 
Proponents, mostly from the First World, compare GATT's falling trade barriers 
to the collapse of the Berlin Wall; both are seen as essential steps in the 
world's march toward democratic capitalism. The trade pact, according to its 
advocates, will eventually add $235 billion a year to world economic income and 
expand the development of the First and Third Worlds within a decade of its 
ratification. "Every country gains," concluded Sutherland, amid palm trees and 
gleaming pink walls. "There are no losers." 
</P>
<P>
 But the farmers of India's seed agitation are convinced that the pact will 
produce many losers. And they are not the only ones who think this. In the year 
preceding the accords, millions of farmers, environmentalists and social 
activists in India, Europe and east Asia took part in mass demonstrations and, 
in the case of Mexico, open rebellion. Leaders of the Zapatista movement in 
Chiapas cited free-trade accords as a principal motive for their revolt. Cheap 
corn imports from America, they claimed, will drive down prices and wipe out 
Mexican peasants. In South Korea, thousands of people participated in "rice 
riots" to denounce low-priced imports. Japanese legislators went on hunger 
strikes, and rice farmers vehemently protested increased imports. More than 
10,000 farmers across France joined in anti-GATT demonstrations, blocking 
highways and rail lines and bringing their tractors into the heart of Paris. 
And in India, crowds reaching half a million rallied against GATT for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 These opponents of the trade agreement believe it will force millions of 
farmers off their land and place much of the world's basic food supply in 
ecological jeopardy. As multinational companies prepare to bring seeds, 
chemical pesticides and fertilizers into Third World markets, many scientists 
and ecologists warn that a few corporate-owned varieties will replace thousands 
of locally cultivated seeds, making crops vulnerable to disease and drought and 
increasing the chance of famine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drive toward the uniformization of world crops is leading to a 
dangerously precarious world food system," says Timothy C. Weiskel, associate 
director of the Pacific Basin Research Center at Harvard's Kennedy School of 
Government. "More and more people are coming to depend on fewer varieties and 
fewer species of crops. Champions of GATT, whether they realize it or not, are 
destabilizing rural populations in the name of unsustainable agriculture. This 
will drive the small farmer out of production altogether. This is being done in 
the name of a new international economic order in which the Western world feels 
it can now write the rules for a post-Cold War global economy. GATT is one 
great big can opener of Third World countries for multinational corporations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Indian officials say old policies of protectionism and bureaucratic 
socialism have failed to bring prosperity to the world's second most populous 
nation. GATT, the government insists, is crucial to economic liberalization. 
"We went through a phase in which the government used to intervene in the 
economy," says Indian Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia in his 
high-ceilinged office near India Gate, New Delhi's great stone arch. "But the 
present reforms are based on the understanding that we now have an industrial 
base, we have a competitive capability, we have the resources to be a more open 
economy integrated in the world. India will do well if it becomes a more open 
and more competitive economy." Indeed, many farmers support the government's 
plans to increase exports, reduce tariff barriers and promote multinational 
investment from companies like Cargill, believing that these reforms will bring 
them more income.  
</P>
<P>
 With the trade pact in place, multinationals will have broad access to India's 
vast farming market for the first time since independence in 1948. A quarter of 
the world's farmers -- more than 200 million -- live in India. Already, scores 
of seed and petrochemical companies from Europe and the United States, armed 
with large research budgets and advanced genetic-engineering techniques, have 
arrived here to develop and market seeds, chemical pesticides and fertilizers. 
The GATT accord makes it possible for these companies to search India's fields 
and then create, patent and market new, "improved" products -- which, in turn, 
can be sold back to farmers.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten days before the GATT signing and nearly 16 months after the original raid 
on Cargill, more than 100,000 people gathered at Delhi's historic Red Fort. As 
Indian trade ministers prepared to leave for Morocco, the crowd marched toward 
Parliament. Bricks flew at the national memorial to Gandhi. Police used water 
cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets to turn back the crowd. On the day the 
accord was signed, Nanjundaswamy and his farmers' group staged another raid, 
this time against Union Carbide Private Ltd., the American chemical corporation 
infamous in India for the Bhopal disaster. "The nationalist forces," declared 
the former law professor, "have decided to destroy the property of all 
multinational firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer-activist Sesha Reddy sounds equally ominous when he recalls the East 
India Company, the British trader that dominated the lives of Indians for more 
than two centuries. "We call Cargill the West India Company. We don't want a 
West India Company to once again dominate our economy, our freedom, our 
politics. We are prepared to die for this." 
</P>
<P>
 MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER FARMERS ransacked the offices, Cargill's Bangalore 
headquarters are quiet. John Hamilton, a stocky Australian with broad white 
sideburns and a horseshoe mustache, sits behind his desk. With Cargill for 15 
years, Hamilton set up its India operations in 1988. On Republic Day, the 
anniversary of the enactment of India's constitution, a frail guard sits watch 
in the hall behind a new wrought-iron gate. "Next time," says Hamilton, "we'll 
be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Cargill's managing director for India laces his fingers behind his neck and 
gazes at the streets below. The agitation, he says, is mostly the work of "a 
political radical with a political agenda" -- M.D. Nanjundaswamy. "He is a 
charismatic local personality. But we will not let one small-time politician 
campaigning against our seed company run us out of the business." This is 
unlikely. Minnesota-based Cargill markets grain, coffee, cotton, beef, oil, 
steel, plastics and other goods to 58 countries and employs more than 69,000 
people. Last year, company sales reached $47 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 Cargill's arrival in India is part of a global strategy to market seeds and 
fertilizer to farmers and consumers more efficiently and cheaply than local 
producers can. Cargill, says Hamilton, can help India's growing population meet 
a potential food shortfall by producing high-yielding crops from hybrid seeds, 
increasing farmers' income in the process. But in developing improved seeds for 
farmers, he says, the company needs assurances that its seed innovations will 
be safe from "fly-by-night traders (who) set up shop" and resell them. Without 
these protections, won during contentious GATT negotiations, many seed 
corporations would not come to India. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of intellectual property rights -- for farmers, corporations and 
national sovereignty -- is a source of great disagreement and confusion. Indian 
citizens, trying to understand the trade accords, patents and 
intellectual-property protection, have had to wade through technical jargon and 
a slew of acronyms -- GATT, WTO, TRIPs, PBR, UPOV, PVPA, NPBGR, WIPO. In India, 
citizens have simplified the whole morass to "Dunkel" -- for Arthur Dunkel, the 
former director general of GATT who presented the draft treaty signed in 
Morocco. "Reject Dunkel, Reject Imperialism" is familiar graffiti.  
</P>
<P>
 During most of the GATT controversy, say its critics, the Indian government 
did little to help its own cause, neglecting to make the treaty available in 
any of the 16 major Indian languages. Citizens have been left mainly with vague 
reassurances about long-term benefits or somber assessments of a new global 
reality in which national governments will cede much of the responsibility for 
economic well-being to outside forces. "We are no longer the controllers of the 
economy but promoters and facilitators," Minister of State for Industry Krishna 
Sahi told reporters the day after the GATT accord was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the anti-GATT forces, for their part, often added more heat than 
light. At mass rallies, they claimed that under the GATT pact, farmers will be 
prohibited from selling or exchanging seeds or even saving them for the next 
year's planting. Such restrictions could go into effect when the World Trade 
Organization reviews intellectual-property rights, among other things, in 1998, 
which has generated the specter of a Draconian world in which farmers would be 
virtually forced to buy seeds from multinationals. But that is not the case 
under the current agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Between corporate demands that their agricultural innovations be protected and 
farmers' demands that their genetic heritage be preserved lie several basic 
questions: Who owns a seed? Who owns a biological property? Who owns the life 
form creating a new seed from the genes of four or five others? The difficult 
relationship between ancient custom and Western science, between farmers' 
rights and corporations' entrepreneurship, between indigenous knowledge and 
First World intellect, is revealed in the debate over an ancient plant that has 
been part of Indian life since before the birth of Christ.  
</P>
<P>
 The neem tree is fundamental to rural India. Neem-leaf juice prevents scabies 
and other skin disorders. Rabindranath Tagore, the great Indian poet and Nobel 
laureate, is said to have drunk it every morning for his health. Villagers 
brush their teeth with neem twigs. Gandhi chewed neem leaves before his meals. 
And for centuries, farmers have scattered neem leaves on their fields, using it 
as a natural insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the American-based multinational W.R. Grace & Co., the world's largest 
producer of specialty chemicals, has developed neem-based bio-pesticides in 
India and sells them in the United States. American patents for Neemix were 
granted because the scientific process involved an "inventive step" -- 
stabilizing and purifying the natural pesticide inherent in neem. Nanjundaswamy 
claims that, because of GATT, farmers are now legally prohibited from using 
neem leaves on their fields. This is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace has not even obtained Indian patents, says corporate vice president 
Martin B. Sherwin. "We have no intellectual-property protection in India, nor 
are we interested in any," he says. But critics of Grace say that once Indian 
patent law is brought into conformity with GATT, the U.S. patents for neem will 
essentially take effect in India. "The moment GATT comes into force," says 
Devinder Sharma, Delhi journalist and author of "GATT and India: The Politics 
of Agriculture," "India will be obliged to honor the patent. The effect will be 
that farmers will not be allowed to use the seeds of neem." Sherwin denies 
this. Yet there may be something more fundamental than patents at issue here. 
</P>
<P>
 Neemix spray, which will likely earn substantial profits, is based in a 
property first identified by farmers in India and elsewhere in Asia. Grace has 
no plan, and no mechanism, for compensating anyone in India for a share in the 
neem patent. "It is of Indian origin," says Sesha Reddy. "It is our material. 
It belongs to the entire nation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the real innovation, Sherwin responds, only came in 1959, when a German 
scientist identified the property within neem, azadirachtin, that makes it a 
good insecticide. This scientific breakthrough, Sherwin says, is far more 
sophisticated than any indigenous knowledge of neem's properties. The fact that 
Indian farmers already knew neem was a good insecticide is more akin to "folk 
medicine -- like what root might be better to chew to cure a headache." And 
that, says Sherwin, "is well outside my ability to comment on."  
</P>
<P>
 P. REMENANDAN IS STANDING IN AN AIRTIGHT, LOW-HUMIDITY REFRIGERATED room. In 
this cooler, and in the deep-freeze across the hall, 30,000 varieties of 
sorghum seeds lie in small containers arranged 35 to a tray. Down the hall is a 
similarly vast collection of millet and another of chickpeas. Elsewhere in 
India and around the world, collections of corn, rice and wheat seeds -- 
virtually every known species of select agricultural crops -- have been stored 
before they vanish into biological history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traditional varieties are disappearing," Remenandan says, his soft voice 
carrying just above the drone of industrial coolers. A food geneticist, 
Remenandan works at the gene bank at the International Crops Research Institute 
for the Semi-Arid Tropics, 250 miles north of Bangalore. Bankrolled by national 
governments, the U.N. and various funding agencies, ICRISAT is part of a global 
research effort whose mission is to increase crop yields to feed a world 
population expected to expand by 3 billion over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those genes have been formed after millions of years of evolution," says 
Remenandan, picking up an airtight aluminum container. "They cannot be cre-ated 
overnight. If they are not conserved, they will disappear forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The diversity of the world's agricultural crops began to decline in 1944, near 
the end of World War II, when, ironically, Vice President Henry Wallace and 
officials of the Rockefeller Foundation launched a program to feed the hungry 
of the Third World. Plant breeder Norman Borlaug left his classified DuPont 
defense lab for Mexico, where he was asked to devise a highly productive 
variety of wheat. By 1954, Borlaug had crossbred Japanese wheat varieties with 
Mexican wheat, creating a "miracle seed" that would forever change global 
agriculture. The Green Revolution was born in the name of peace and abundance 
-- and to thwart the spread of communism in the rural Third World. Borlaug, for 
his part, has always emphasized the program's social agenda. "Children born 
into this world," he says, "have the right to the basic necessities for a 
decent life, starting with food."  
</P>
<P>
 Scientists he inspired soon brought similar leaps in rice production in the 
Philippines and Southeast Asia. In 1966, Indian officials imported 18,000 tons 
of Borlaug's miracle seeds from Mexico, resulting in extraordinary jumps in 
wheat production in Punjab and other regions. In receiving the 1970 Nobel Peace 
Prize, Norman Borlaug -- and the Green Revolution -- were credited with fending 
off starvation for millions in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 But the miracle seeds brought unexpected consequences. Green Revolution 
farmers were told that the miracle depended on the addition of chemical 
fertilizers. For many farmers in the Punjab and elsewhere, the excitement of 
the first few years subsided as they put more and more chemicals on their land 
just to match the output of the previous year. And as genetic uniformity 
replaced biological diversity, the new monoculture became increasingly 
vulnerable to disease and pests. Against the threat of plagues and massive crop 
losses, researchers began setting up their refrigerated gene banks to conserve 
genetic material in case new disease-free varieties were needed -- and to 
preserve indoors the very species they helped to displace in nature. In the 
fields, pests developed resistance, forcing farmers to increase their use of 
chemical pesticides. Costs shot up, small farmers left in droves for the 
cities, and some Indian nationalists charged that the Green Revolution was part 
of a Western conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Green Revolution strategy integrated Third World farmers into the global 
markets of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds and disintegrated their organic 
links with their soil and communities," writes Vandana Shiva, a leading 
intellectual in the Indian opposition to GATT, in her 1991 book "The Violence 
of the Green Revolution." "Having destroyed nature's mechanisms for controlling 
pests through the destruction of diversity, the 'miracle' seeds of the Green 
Revolution became mechanisms for breeding new pests and creating new diseases . 
. . and with them the ever-increasing demand for pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
 GATT, charges Nanjundaswamy, will open up Indian agriculture to another 
massive transformation, built on the seed-and-chemical model of the Green 
Revolution. "GATT is the beginning of the second chapter," says the professor, 
himself a disillusioned Green Revolution farmer. But there is a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Green Revolution was largely a public effort. Funds came from 
foundations, governments and U.N. agencies. Research was shared. Seeds were 
exchanged in the interest of increasing food production. And though its 
benefits are still debated -- a recent survey by the Indian National Institute 
of Nutrition indicates that about 90% of Indian children 5 and under still 
suffer some form of malnutrition -- few doubt the motives of people like Norman 
Borlaug in serving a social good. But now global agricultural research is 
moving inexorably into private hands. Green Revolution centers like ICRISAT, 
for example, have had their budgets slashed by an estimated 30% in the past 
three years. At the same time, more and more publicly funded research is being 
directed toward corporate use.  
</P>
<P>
 As the Green Revolution took its toll on the environment, it became clear that 
new seeds were needed, seeds that depended less on chemicals. S.K. Kapoor, 
managing director of Proagro Seeds Company Ltd., a New Delhi-based seed 
company, says that chemical corporations "became apprehensive. If seeds are 
being made resistant to pesticides and insecticides, what happens to the 
chemical companies? The demand for insecticides will go down. So they started 
buying seed companies." In the 1970s and '80s, there were more than 1,000 
corporate chemical buyouts of seed companies around the world, according to Pat 
Mooney, author of "Seeds of the Earth" and a leading expert on the loss of 
genetic diversity. "The ulterior motive," says Kapoor, "was that there should 
be a regular demand of pesticide and insecticide." Subsequent events bear him 
out, especially in the field of agricultural biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 Biotechnology allows scientists to genetically engineer seeds for specific 
properties -- resistance to disease or pests or drought, for example, which 
would help make the seeds more productive. But most testing for genetic 
engineering in the industrial world since 1986 has not attempted to make seeds 
hardier or more nutritious or to help them survive better in saline soil or 
high winds. Instead, biotechnicians have tried to make them resistant to 
herbicides, thus allowing farmers to kill most weeds and other plants but not 
the biologically protected crop. Monsanto, for example, has devised a way to 
make tomatoes resistant to Roundup, allowing for sales of both the seed and the 
powerful herbicide and assuring the continued use of chemicals on food crops. 
Initial marketing for "Roundup ready" seed will be in the United States. 
Monsanto, DuPont, Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc have done similar tests for other 
crops, including soybeans, corn, potatoes, wheat and cotton.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly not encouraging farmers to use more chemicals," says Karen 
Marshall, director of public relations for Monsanto's agricultural group. "But 
farmers need to control weeds. If you hoe those lands, you could end up with 
soil erosion. You could lose ground moisture." Because Roundup is a 
broad-spectrum herbicide, Marshall says, "our hope is that we'll be able to 
reduce overall herbicide use." 
</P>
<P>
 ACACIA TREES AND MUSTARD fields flank the road on the outskirts of Delhi. A 
turbaned farmer, near the end of a long trek from Rajasthan state, leads his 
cows to summer pasture. Bulging sacks of fodder perch on wooden carts, hauled 
slowly up the road by Rajasthani camels. India's ancient system will be 
modernized, says J.S. Sindhu, Proagro's director of research, but he has a 
bleak vision of the changes the multinationals will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose the farmer has got two acres of land," Sindhu says, pointing out the 
window of his white sedan. "You are a multinational. You come to him and say, 
'You're not making any headway.' And you have come with a formula to convince 
him that if he produces this certain crop exclusively, he'll be better off. You 
say, 'I have got a tomato seed. This tomato will give you 200,000 rupees (about 
$6,500) from these two acres. The total you earn now is 125,000 ($4,000). You 
can put this difference in the bank, educate your kids, have a nice house, buy 
a scooter. . . .' That is the dream." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the kind of direct corporation-to-farmer marketing that the Indian 
government is now encouraging. At first, Sindhu says, only a few farmers will 
experiment with the new seeds, and then only on a portion of their land. "But 
seeing is believing," he says. "It only takes six years, and everybody 
switches. In certain areas, you will find only one crop exclusively -- on 
200,000, 250,000 acres, even on 2 million acres. The chances of epidemics will 
be very high. Any time you put monocultures in vast areas, it is not 
scientifically safe. You are working against variability. You are working 
against nature. And when you work against nature, you have to be prepared to 
face the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences, says Arun Kumar, economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University, 
will be a repetition of the Green Revolution -- chemical dependency, soil 
sterilization, water-table contamination, genetic loss and urban flight for 
small farmers who can't afford the increasing costs of pesticides and 
fertilizers. But unlike the Green Revolution, Kumar argues, corporations like 
Cargill will not necessarily focus on producing food for India's poor. Oil from 
Cargill's sunflower seed, for example, or PepsiCo's potato chips and 
export-quality basmati rice will go to those who can afford it -- to India's 
middle and upper classes and to consumers in the First World. 
</P>
<P>
 "What will be produced is what can sell in the other countries," says Kumar, 
principal author of the annual alternative budget, a critique of the 
government's liberalization policies by a coalition of opposition parties. "The 
richer countries have 85% of the world's purchasing power, so the cropping 
pattern will shift to the requirements of the advanced nations. What the 
average Indian requires is unlikely to be produced. The Indian poor will 
suffer. The food security of the whole Indian economy will suffer a great 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "Food security is not in danger," replies Finance Secretary Montek Singh 
Ahluwalia. First, he argues, the amount of land dedicated to export crops will 
not threaten India's production of basic food grains. Second, "as you move to 
an agriculture open to export possibilities, you generate higher income for 
agricultural producers. This feeds back in to better investment in their 
fields. India easily could double its yields per acre." Higher yields, 
Ahluwalia argues, will give farmers better harvests, more income and therefore 
more buying power, which is the ultimate security against hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 And higher yields can only be assured, say executives like Cargill's John 
Hamilton, if multinationals are allowed to market more productive seeds. Indian 
farmers, he says, want to buy quality seed that will give them consistently 
good yields. Cargill's sales for sunflower and corn seed are already up 300% 
over last year. "If that seed is going to come from a foreign company operating 
in India, it is of no consequence to the farmer."  
</P>
<P>
 BENEATH A PEEPAL TREE IN THE southern India village of Gobbedi, on a stone 
worn smooth from countless generations of sitting, villagers join Sesha Reddy, 
the farmer who has spent much of the last two years opposing Cargill and the 
multinationals. Like many in the farmers' movement, Reddy once believed in the 
Green Revolution. But he speaks now with the fervor of a man who has lost one 
faith and, after some searching, found another. 
</P>
<P>
 "In its youth, just like people, the Green Revolution was beautiful," he says. 
"But after some aging, it is going away." Reddy is now a convert to indigenous, 
sustainable agriculture, part of a local network of farmers who are practicing 
traditional techniques and are working with Indian geneticists to set up their 
own gene bank. "We have to go back to the nature," he says. "We'll go green now 
-- instead of Green Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the face of multimillion-dollar foreign investments encouraged by the 
government, the Indian farmers' movement faces long odds. Although small 
seed-saving collectives and indigenous associations have sprung up throughout 
the country, the demonstrations against GATT have quieted since the April 
signing, provoking some analysts to predict that the movement will fade. Reddy, 
though, insists a significant number of Indian farmers will reject the "new 
colonization." They will withdraw, he says, from the global economy by building 
a Gandhian system of self-reliance. He likes to quote the great poet, 
Rabindranath Tagore: 
</P>
<P>
 " Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; " Where knowledge 
is free. . . . " Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake. 
"  
</P>
<P>
 "Where knowledge is free!" repeats Reddy. "Knowledge should not be for the 
enrichment of the individual. It should be for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the road, farmers prepare the paddies for the new rice plantings. Frogs 
and crickets call from the darkening fields. "Monopoly is not life," says 
Reddy. "Only in sharing there is life."

GOSSIP COLUMNIST TO THE NERDS; DIGGING UP THE DIGITAL DIRT IN SILICON VALLEY 
WITH ROBERT X. CRINGELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom McNichol, Tom McNichol is a San Francisco-based writer. His last article 
for the magazine was The Gospel Truth, about the search for the historical 
Jesus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cursor on the computer screen pulsates like a racing heartbeat as Robert 
X. Cringely, gossip columnist to Silicon Valley, searches expectantly for a hot 
tip. Cringely's office at InfoWorld, the PC trade publication where his weekly 
"Notes From the Field" column appears, is really a giant nerve center. Most 
days, he receives about 30 e-mail messages, a dozen faxes and letters and two 
dozen voice-mail messages from assorted techno-weenies imparting confidential 
details about a product, embarrassing behavior by management or a juicy tidbit 
about a competitor. Today, it's inside information about Microsoft's upcoming 
version of Windows, code-named "Chicago"; tomorrow it will be word that a 
poorly designed piece of Apple software can send your fax to the wrong person. 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely is Silicon Valley's Father Confessor, but he definitely hasn't taken 
a vow of confidentiality. Every week, he pans through the slurry of information 
that flows his way and prints the best nuggets. Cringely's work is widely 
praised (mostly by computer grunts), almost as widely vilified (mostly by 
executives), but it is seldom ignored by those in the industry. "His stuff is 
wonderfully cranky and irreverent, which I think Silicon Valley deserves," says 
management guru Tom Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that this industry could spawn a gossip columnist may seem strange 
at first. But inside information is the grease that lubricates the entire 
computer business. Like politics and the entertainment industry, high-tech 
companies are in the business of selling what is essentially vapor. In all 
three industries, big promises are made ("No new taxes!" " 'Last Action Hero' 
is Schwarzenegger's best!" "This is the last software upgrade you'll ever 
need!") that often don't live up to their advance billing. That's where Robert 
X. Cringely, the digital Liz Smith, comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely isn't his real name, but it might as well be. During the seven years 
he's written the column, the 41-year old former foreign correspondent and 
Stanford professor, who came to work at InfoWorld because he needed the cash, 
has become Bob Cringely. Many times, even he can't tell the difference. "I'm a 
method journalist," Cringely says. "I sit down at my desk and I become Bob. My 
life is like the movie 'Groundhog Day.' I go to sleep and wake up and I'm Bob 
again. Bob has his own phone line and whenever I answer it, I'm Bob. I have 
people I've talked to every day for seven years as Bob." 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely is more than merely a cyber-gossip, a repeater of tales told out of 
school. He's a keen observer of the computer world, bringing a sense of humor 
and perspective to an industry that's sorely lacking in both. By being 
technically savvy enough to understand the world of computer nerds while not 
quite being clever enough to threaten them, he has managed to access the inner 
workings of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With computer magazines now one of the hottest fields in publishing, Cringely 
is not without competition: John C. Dvorak writes for several magazines and a 
pseudonymous Spencer F. Katt pens a "Rumor Central" column for PC Week. But 
Cringely's incisiveness and subversive humor have made him the columnist 
computer people turn to first. 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely portrays himself as a kind of Information Age Philip Marlowe, rooting 
out the shadowy mysteries of Silicon Valley. Every column contains two or three 
exclusive news items about a product not living up to its billing, surrounded 
by a running serial of his life, loves and battles with the barons of the 
computer world. 
</P>
<P>
 His lack of reverence for the industry's giants is neatly summarized by the 
title of his 1992 book, "Accidental Empires -- How the Boys of Silicon Valley 
Make their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and Still Can't Get a Date." 
To Cringely's heretical way of thinking, the computer industry happened more or 
less by accident, the people who made it happen were amateurs and, for the most 
part, still are. Cringely has his pudgy finger on the throbbing pulse of 
Silicon Valley, where the winners download giga-bucks and the losers stare at a 
taunting message that forever flashes across their computer screens: Abort? 
Retry? Ignore? 
</P>
<P>
 WE'RE WITH BOB IN A GARAGE IN PALO ALTO NOW, ON ONE OF HIS many field trips to 
the future of Silicon Valley. There aren't any cars in the garage, just five 
computers sitting on an L-shaped table. Bob's here to take a test drive of a 
new software program developed by six Stanford University graduates, three of 
whom live in the adjoining house. To picture the space, think back to the group 
house you shared with your friends after high school -- the vacant 
refrigerator, the tumbleweed-sized dust balls, the cloth sofa that gave off a 
cloud of dust every time someone sat on it. But instead of using this space to 
throw keg parties, the six Stanford grads pooled $15,000 of their own venture 
capital and went into the garage to develop a new piece of software that 
searches databases more efficiently than anything now on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer, two of the young Stanford whizzes, sit Cringely 
down in front of a computer and begin to demonstrate the new software designed 
by their firm, Architext. Kraus is president of the fledgling operation, which 
is why he's the only one wearing a tie. Spencer is the main software designer, 
which is why he's wearing a scratchy wool shirt with a white undershirt peeking 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 The program they've come up with basically allows users to navigate very 
efficiently through large databases. Imagine you've been assigned by your 
company to find out about trade policy in Singapore. In a conventional database 
search, this can be a very time-consuming chore. If you type in the word 
"Singapore" in a database containing recent newspapers, magazines and trade 
journals, you're likely to get back a mammoth list of stories about Michael Fay 
being caned -- interesting, but unlikely to please your boss. You could narrow 
your search by typing in "Singapore/trade policy/United States," but you'd 
still get back too many stories and only those that contained those specific 
words. The Architext program allows you to simply type in "trade policy in 
Singapore" and get back a compact list of citations, even those that don't 
contain the same words as your query. Among human endeavors, this may not rank 
with the development of the polio vaccine, but thousands of companies are 
desperate for tools to make sense of the wealth of information they can get 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we have information overload," says Cringely. "We have instant 
access to everything, which means we have insight into nothing. The trick is, 
how do you extract knowledge from all that information? Those are the tools we 
need to take the next step in computing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely is impressed with Architext, and even more so with the practicality 
of the Stanford whizzes. He hears from garage entrepreneurs all the time, many 
of whom don't have a very strong real-world orientation. Cringely knows one 
tinkerer who claims to have developed a superior computer architecture that 
unfortunately involves throwing out everything that's been invented up until 
now. But the six Stanford grads, running on rice, beans and moxie, have come up 
with a practical product that's already attracted the interest of several 
companies. They are now trying to persuade four large firms to invest in their 
software, 
</P>
<P>
 It's this adolescent enthusiasm that Cringely believes is America's secret 
weapon in world trade, particularly against the Japanese. The first generation 
of computer hackers, of which Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Wozniak are the most 
famous examples, were socially inept nerds who didn't conform to the usual 
teen-age standards of masculinity and coolness. Their solution was to create a 
new world in which they set the standards. The 1990s version of the young 
computer wizard is somewhat more interested in making money than impressing his 
peers, but shares much of the same "I'll show them" adolescent defiance. This, 
Cringely says, puts the Japanese, who place a premium on conformity and 
teamwork, at a considerable disadvantage. The Japanese may have more efficient 
workers, but we've got better geeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Architext demonstration is over, we depart through the kitchen, 
passing a 50-pound bag of California white rice. "It's almost empty," one of 
the wizards says ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely gets in his car and heads north on 101, back to his office in San 
Mateo. As we pass through bedroom communities that owe their existence to tiny 
wafers of silicon, he reflects on prospects facing the valley's newest players. 
"The move out of the garage will be more wrenching than they expect," says 
Cringely. "And there will come a day when Joe, the guy with the tie, finds out 
he's not the head business guy any more. But that's two years down the line. 
These guys are going to do just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN CRINGELY RETURNS TO HIS OFFICE, AN EAGER INFORMANT is cooling his heels 
at reception. The publisher of a national telephone directory on CD-ROM has 
shown up with news about one of his competitors. Needless to say, the news is 
not good. According to the tipster, his competitor's product has been dropped 
by several software distributors because of faulty data. And not only that, the 
product claims to have 80 million phone listings when it really only has 69 
million. Cringely jots down the information without committing himself to 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, there's nothing earth-shattering there," he says after the tipster 
leaves. "False advertising is the norm in the computer business. You always see 
features advertised on the box that aren't in the product. They used to put 
black tape over the features they took out, but they don't do that anymore 
because they think it looks tacky. Honesty is tacky. I like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely assiduously cultivates his sources, which sometimes involves laying 
down a fine layer of manure. By feigning interest in even the most 
inconsequential tip, he lays the groundwork for the source to bear fruit later. 
Someone in the product support division of a large computer company recently 
e-mailed Cringely with news that former California Gov. Jerry Brown was using 
an NCR Safari notebook, and not only that -- he had just ordered new batteries! 
Cringely messaged back and said, uh, thanks, keep me in mind if you come across 
anything else interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the guy comes back a few days later with this e-mail message," smiles 
Cringely, calling up a large document on his computer. "It's a history of all 
of the products his company produces, what works and what doesn't. And it's 
signed "Deep Throat.' " They always sign it Deep Throat. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his informants generally fall into three categories. Some are proud of 
their product but are afraid that it won't be marketed correctly, or at all. 
Another group is genuinely ashamed of a shoddy product they've worked on and 
want to warn customers away from it. And a third spills the beans out of sheer 
defiance of authority. Cringely twice received a file containing all of Apple's 
products for the next two years from an employee who was peeved at senior 
management. He and other InfoWorld staffers used the information in a series of 
stories about the new line. 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely takes pains to keep his true identity a secret, but it's more to 
build up the character's mystique than to protect his flow of information. The 
man behind the Cringely mask looks a little like Clark Kent, a self-described 
"pasty white boy" with thick glasses and gray-flecked hair. He attended the 
College of Wooster in Ohio, worked for the town newspaper and, for lack of a 
better idea after graduation, became a free-lance foreign correspondent for 
more than a dozen daily papers, reporting from trouble spots in Northern 
Ireland, Lebanon, Beirut and Africa. He interviewed Libyan leader Moammar 
Kadafi and noticed the slavish cult of personality that surrounded him, which 
Cringely says helped him understand Bill Gates and his operation at Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Northern California in 1977 to attend Stanford, where he received 
a Ph.D in public affairs communication. He remained at Stanford until 1983 as 
an assistant professor of journalism and immersed himself in Silicon Valley's 
emerging computer culture. He went to meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club, 
an organization of techno-geeks, where Steve Wozniak unveiled what would become 
the first Apple computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely joined InfoWorld as a reporter/editor, but it wasn't until the gossip 
columnist position opened up in 1987 that his cyber-destiny was fulfilled. Two 
other InfoWorld journalists had written briefly under the Cringely name, but 
didn't exploit the character's potential the way the third Cringely would. 
Seven years into the enterprise, Cringely Version 3.0 has built an Accidental 
Empire of his own. His book about Silicon Valley has been published in England 
and Japan and made it into a paperback edition in America. Cringely makes 
periodic speaking engagements, recently addressing a roomful of appreciative 
engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center near Washington, D.C. In 
addition to his weekly InfoWorld column, Cringely's musings appear on eWorld, 
Apple Computer's new on-line service and he will host a handful of shows next 
year on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipping in and out of the Cringely persona has its advantages. "When 
something goes wrong, Bob Cringely takes the blame," says "Cringely," 
momentarily stepping out of character. "I just let it roll off. I'm actually 
kind of a sensitive guy. When I make mistakes -- and I sometimes do -- I feel 
horrible." Cringely says he's a softy at heart, and besides, all the mean 
things he says about the computer industry are true. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are those who believe Cringely himself could stand a lesson in the 
truth. Some in the Silicon Valley are convinced that Cringely's liveliest 
anecdotes are distortions, if not downright fabrications. One such story that 
appeared in Cringely's book involves Bill Gates, presented to underscore the 
Microsoft founder's arrogance. Gates had just demonstrated a new Microsoft 
product in Ann Arbor when, according to Cringely and his sources, he decided he 
still had a few things left to prove. Gates, a little drunk at the time, 
Cringely says, sat in the passenger seat while a companion drove him around the 
town. Suddenly, Gates commanded the car to stop alongside a group of young 
blacks standing at a corner. Cringely picks up the story in his book: 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening!" the pencil-necked billionaire cheerfully greeted the 
assembled boom boxers, who had clearly no idea who or what he was -- this 
bespectacled white boy with greasy blond hair and bratwurst skin, wearing a 
blue and white plaid polyester shirt and green pullover sweater.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bill, let's go someplace else," called Gates' companion from the driver's 
seat.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Bill, go someplace else," said one of the young blacks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nah, I want to rap. I can talk to these guys, you'll see!"  
</P>
<P>
 Gates has said he has no memory of the incident, and his companion in the car, 
Laurie Flynn, a free-lance computer columnist for the New York Times, says 
Cringely's account is greatly exaggerated. Gates may have exchanged a few words 
with someone as he got into the car, Flynn says, but there wasn't any prolonged 
confrontation or insistence on wanting "to rap." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought (Cringely's) book was brilliant, but I don't think he's afraid to 
twist anecdotes to make a point," Flynn says. (Flynn, incidentally, was the 
second of three journalists to have written InfoWorld's gossip column under the 
Cringely pseudonym.)  
</P>
<P>
 Cringely stands behind the story as well as his other caustic 
characterizations -- that Lotus founder Mitch Kapor is guilt-ridden because of 
his success, that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is an insecure, narcissistic 
totalitarian and that Microsoft is a frat house that feeds on its young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who are angry are unhappy about being characterized," says 
Cringely. "They can't stand the fact that I try to explain the motivation 
behind their actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's fair to say that Cringely sometimes sacrifices accuracy in 
pursuit of larger truths. He's not the computer industry's Boswell -- he's more 
its Aesop, spinning tales with a moral. "His isn't the official picture of the 
valley," offers Tom Peters. "But people there tend to take themselves a little 
too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 CRINGELY'S SKIN STARTS TO take on an iridescent glow after a day in front of a 
computer, so he welcomes an opportunity to get out of the office. We hop in the 
Cringemobile and head for Sunnyvale, the unofficial capital of Silicon Valley, 
on another field trip. 
</P>
<P>
 We stop at Pacific Data Images, a leading computer graphics company. PDI is 
responsible for many computer-generated special effects seen in movies and on 
television -- the animated "scrubbing bubbles" that whisk your bathtub clean, 
the "Monday Night Football" opening in which two helmets crash together and 
explode and the 1993 Bud Bowl. Who says America has lost its competitive edge? 
</P>
<P>
 PDI's facility consists of a large, softly lit room divided into dozens of 
computer work stations. Enthusiasm pervades the building, as it does at 
companies all over the Silicon Valley. Cringely peers over the shoulder of an 
animator who's working on a commercial that will feature cats talking about the 
smell of their litter box. 
</P>
<P>
 Using sophisticated computer software for a cat litter commercial may seem 
like a frivolous application of the technology and -- let's face it -- it is. 
It might be nice to think that the information superhighway may one day allow 
teams of doctors in different cities to confer about a medical crisis, but 
don't be surprised if its primary use is delivering "Mrs. Doubtfire" on demand 
to millions of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes about 20 years for an information technology to go from being an 
idea in the lab to product used by millions of people," says Cringely. "So, in 
a sense, everything we're going to use in 10 years already exists. It's just 
not clear how it's going to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 The next stop is Woodside, where Cringely checks up on the progress of his 
friend, software entrepreneur Joe Adler. Adler, a short, puckish Englishman, 
has been hard at work launching start-up companies in the Silicon Valley. He's 
on the verge of launching his third business, which will offer a software 
package called Magic Theatre. It lets children make their own movies with 
music, sound effects and narration by clicking a mouse, speaking into a 
microphone and choosing illustrations -- no keyboard is necessary. Adler 
refined Magic Theatre by testing it on his preschool daughter for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most software for children is based on the theory that there's knowledge out 
there that you capture on a CD-ROM and then children come along and unlock it," 
Adler tells Cringely. "I don't believe that at all. Knowledge is what happens 
in a child's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Cringely's last stop is to a computer surplus store in Sunnyvale called the 
Weird Stuff Warehouse. Weird Stuff is where computer technology goes to die. 
Its musty shelves are cluttered with old computers, printers, monitors and 
peripherals sold to hobbyists at a fraction of their original cost. This is the 
computer world's graveyard, and the names on the tombstones are some of the 
biggest in the business -- IBM, Digital, Atari, Hewlett-Packard. Bob loves this 
place; he's like a kid in a candy store. "Look!" he exclaims, holding a huge 
piece of plastic the size of an Amazon breast plate against his chest. "It's a 
13 1/2-inch floppy disk! Can you believe how big this is? And it doesn't hold 
as much data as floppies do now that are a quarter of its size." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer industry's growth so far has depended on built-in obsolescence, 
where today's breakthrough is tomorrow's scrap. The turnover of both products 
and people is accelerating, but no one here seems to be looking back. No wonder 
Silicon Valley is so giddy about the future -- it's becoming a land without a 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same things happen over and over again in the computer business," says 
Cringely. "People in this industry have a very short institutional memory." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Robert X. Cringely comes in, Silicon Valley's own memory 
expansion kit.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: CROSSOVER HOPES: CAN 
'FISH' AND 'PRISCILLA' FIND THE MAINSTREAM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Is the mainstream moviegoing audience ready to cross over and support films 
about lesbians and drag queens? We'll find out this summer with the release of 
"Go Fish" and "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," two offbeat 
independent films that got such high marks at this year's spate of film 
festivals that they landed major distribution deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go Fish," a romantic comedy set among a group of hip young lesbians in 
Chicago, opened July 1. The film marks the directorial debut of Rose Troche, 
who financed 65% of this extremely low-budget ($250,000) film, along with 
co-producer and actress Guinevere Turner, by working a full-time job at the 
University of Illinois library. (Turner came up with her part of the kitty at a 
job where "she typed documents all day," Troche says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Australian director Stephan Elliott's "Priscilla," a musical road picture 
about two drag queens and a transsexual (played by '60s heartthrob Terence 
Stamp), opens Aug. 10. It features a series of elaborately choreographed and 
costumed disco numbers performed in the dirt of the Australian outback. "The 
movie is essentially a battle between frocks and landscape," Elliott quips. 
</P>
<P>
 The received wisdom of the day has it that the success of Jonathan Demme's 
"Philadelphia" will make it easier for such adventurous gay and lesbian films 
to thrive in the marketplace, but Troche and Elliott say that remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The studios have realized these films can make money, but their attempts to 
cash in on this market have been pathetic," says Troche, speaking by phone from 
Australia, where she is presenting her film at festivals in Sydney and 
Melbourne. "Take the film 'Three of Hearts,' which is fairly typical -- it's 
always a threesome where heterosexual desire has the final word. These films 
have an implied disclaimer on homosexuality and they leave me feeling used. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say 'Philadelphia' opened doors for gay films, but 'Philadelphia' is 
not a gay film -- it's a very tidy representation of gays, but that doesn't 
make it a gay film," says the 30-year-old director. "It was a safe film 
straights could embrace because everyone knows Tom Hanks is straight. There's 
no way that film would've done what it did if they'd cast a gay man in the lead 
-- and why didn't they? There are hundreds of gay actors! 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm often asked what makes a lesbian film, and I don't think that question is 
answerable yet. Obviously a film written, directed and edited by a lesbian (as 
"Go Fish" is) will probably be a lesbian film, but that's not necessarily true. 
It's not a matter of content, either -- it has more to do with sensibility. I 
don't plan to only make films about lesbians -- my commitment is to make films 
with strong women leads and female characters women can identify with. Sexual 
preference isn't the primary thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to making films with strong female leads, Troche also hopes to 
subvert some of the cinematic cliches about lesbians that have dominated the 
medium. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest cliches about lesbians is that they're always really 
attractive women who are passable as straight," Troche says. "Then there's the 
cliche that lesbians hate men, which is absolutely not true, and the cliche 
that lesbians are always going after straight women who usually concede at some 
point in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Go Fish' offers an alternative to those things by staying within a lesbian 
community where people have healthy relationships and aren't obsessed with 
their place in the straight world. I have to say that I'm aware 'Go Fish' 
doesn't speak to every lesbian," Troche adds, "and is specific to a particular 
urban lesbian experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual orientation is almost beside the point in "Priscilla," which has a 
different agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make a film about drag because I was looking for a way to bring 
back the musical," says Elliott, also on the phone from Australia. "I'm a big 
lover of musicals, and all the late-'70s post-'Grease' failures, combined with 
the arrival of music videos, which sucked up all the music, led the studios to 
stop making musicals. I think this is a market that can go through the roof 
again, and I was looking for a way to revive it when I realized here was the 
answer -- drag queens wear glitzy costumes and burst into song. They're 
walking, talking musicals!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Priscilla" conforms to the structure for movie musicals hammered out by 
Hollywood studios in the '30s and '40s but is markedly foreign in that it 
showcases a style of drag unique to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight years ago, a drag queen named Strykermeyer (who did "Priscilla's" 
makeup) started a drag group called the Scary Fairies, who did really unusual 
stuff," Elliott says. "They stopped trying to impersonate women and developed 
an extreme form of cabaret involving incredibly bizarre costumes and 
headdresses, and this is the kind of drag in the film. You'll notice it's not 
too often these characters dress as women. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of drag began as a subculture, but it's gone mainstream in Sydney, 
which is an extremely free-thinking city," he adds. "If you got a guy in dress 
on a stage doing Streisand, nobody would pay any attention to him -- you've got 
to work hard to get people's attention here." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott says he made his film "knowing I was pushing the envelope and 
expecting to get crucified," but in fact "Priscilla" has a better-than-average 
chance of crossing over. "Torch Song Trilogy," which is set in the world of 
drag, did well at the box office, and the French film "La Cage aux Folles," 
also about drag, was one of the most successful movies of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the mainstream audience seems to prefer gay men in drag rather than 
out of it, Elliott replies: "Because it's an excuse to laugh at them, and this 
is something I tried to exploit in the way I structured the film. I knew if I 
tried to make a sympathetic film about drag queens from the first frame, I'd 
lose three-quarters of the crossover audience. So in the first third of the 
film the characters come off as pretty trashy, and the audience is invited to 
laugh at them. Very slowly this begins to turn in the middle act, and in the 
last third of the film you laugh with them rather than at them." 
</P>
<P>
 One criticism that has been leveled at "Priscilla" is that the film's attitude 
toward its two female characters is flagrantly sexist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's absolutely sexist," Elliott says cheerfully. "I didn't set out to 
make a sexist film, but truth be known, many drag queens are incredibly sexist. 
Lots of queers basically can't relate to women, and many of the guys I know who 
do drag are having a go at women. This is the bloody truth -- why shouldn't I 
put it in my film?" 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude won't get Elliott too far in Hollywood, but at this point the 
studios are beginning to circle around him with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently passed through L.A., where I saw everybody, and the studios 
offered me just about everything. It was flattering, but I've got to be careful 
because I don't know if they can handle me," he says. "There'd be no point in 
them employing me to make a film they'll hate, and everything I was offered was 
very safe. No matter what I do next, it will be risky."*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: POUND FOR POUND, BRITAIN'S 
THE PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Half the names on Hollywood's A-list, it seems, are spending this summer in 
the British Isles. But they're not vacationing -- they're working. 
</P>
<P>
 An unprecedented number of movies, many backed by U.S. money, are currently 
being shot in Britain and Ireland. Several are period pieces that demand 
British locations. But producers were lured by attractive currency exchange 
rates and the fact that many highly skilled British film technicians have 
modified their fees following a long lean spell for the film industry here. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result Julia Roberts, Mel Gibson, Sylvester Stallone, Richard Gere, 
Robert Downey Jr., Liam Neeson, Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, Jessica Lange, Sean 
Connery, Emma Thompson, Glenn Close, Sam Neill and John Malkovich are all 
currently making movies in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and Malkovich star in "Mary Reilly," a retelling of the Jekyll and 
Hyde story directed by Stephen Frears. It is being shot partly on location in 
Edinburgh, Scotland, and partly at Pinewood Studios, near London. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other movies have a strong Scottish theme. Gibson stars in "Braveheart," 
the story of the popular 13th-Century Scots hero William Wallace, who led a 
revolt against the English. Neeson and Lange are the leads in "Rob Roy," 
another heroic Scottish figure, who was immortalized by Sir Walter Scott in his 
1817 novel. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny Highland tourist town of Ft. William, with 20,000 population, is 
being used as a base camp for both movies -- though the "Braveheart" crew is 
about to move to Ireland for the second half of production. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey, Ryan, Grant and Neill star along with David Thewlis ("Naked") and 
Polly Walker ("Enchanted April") in "Restoration," an adaptation of Rose 
Tremain's acclaimed novel. 
</P>
<P>
 It is set in the 17th-Century court of Charles II; Downey plays an 
irrepressible medical student who becomes Royal Physician and cheerfully 
partakes in the high living and low moral tone of the court before redeeming 
himself. Shooting takes place in London, Wales and the English south coast 
county of Dorset. 
</P>
<P>
 While Grant has a small role in "Restoration," he is the star of "The 
Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain," which started shooting 
at Pinewood. It is about two English map-makers who, after arriving at a Welsh 
village in 1916, inform its inhabitants that a mountain nearby is not as high 
as was believed and must be removed from the map. Featured are Tara Fitzgerald 
("Hear My Song") and Ian Hart ("BackBeat"). 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone is the lead in "Judge Dredd," a Cinergi film based on the comic book 
hero, which is filming at Shepperton Studios, west of London, for most of this 
year. Directing is the 25-year-old Britisher Danny Cannon ("Young Americans"). 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar winner Thompson stars in "Carrington" as painter Dora Carrington, a 
member of London's aristocratic Bloomsbury group in the early part of this 
century. The film traces her unconventional relationship with writer Lytton 
Strachey (Jonathan Pryce). Screenwriter and playwright Christopher Hampton 
("Dangerous Liaisons") makes his directorial debut, working from his own 
script; Hampton also wrote "Mary Reilly." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from these films, another Scottish-themed movie is due to start rolling 
before summer's end. "Loch Ness" is set near the Scottish lake in which the 
legendary monster is said to dwell; Ted Danson and Joely Richardson are 
expected to be confirmed as leads. 
</P>
<P>
 The mini-boom in British filming may not last. Most of the above films were 
green-lit when the exchange rate was highly favorable -- just under $1.50 to 
the English pound. But after a run on the dollar two weeks ago, the exchange 
rate slipped, reaching $1.55 at one point. On a movie budgeted at $15 million, 
that could mean extra costs of $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market's volatile," said one British industry insider. "You can be sure 
it's causing a lot of accountants a lot of headaches."*

 Thanks to the information superhighway, scenes from Disney's "The Lion King" 
now roar right from my computer's screen. 
</P>
<P>
 I can see only very small parts of the film -- about one or two minutes each 
-- in a viewing window about 2 inches wide and the quality isn't perfect, but 
it's still pretty impressive to see and hear a full-motion video and audio clip 
from a brand-new release. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-line information service CompuServe made video clips from movies 
available on an on-line service for the first time, starting two weeks ago. 
Anyone with a modem and a Macintosh or PC-compatible computer with Windows can 
download and watch small parts of "The Lion King," "The Shadow" and "Wyatt 
Earp," although only higher-end systems are fast enough to really do the clips 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The future has arrived -- sort of. Though this may mark the beginning of an 
age when consumers will be able to get movies on demand by way of a fiber-optic 
infobahn, this also shows that the technology has a ways to go.  
</P>
<P>
 Finding this out took me just under an hour -- that's how long it was to 
download one of the shorter "Lion King" clips, and the programs needed to show 
it, with a fairly fast modem connection (9600 baud). 
</P>
<P>
 But though downloading the clips takes time (and hence, money), it's also 
fairly easy, especially with CompuServe's MacCIM interface software. The clips 
from "The Shadow" (three are offered) and "Wyatt Earp" (two) are in 
CompuServe's Entertainment Drive Forum, an on-line area that includes 
entertainment-oriented discussions and movie stills, while the "Lion King" 
clips were moved to their own forum because they were so popular. 
</P>
<P>
 After downloading the video file "Hyenas and Scar," I "unstuffed" it using a 
decompression program I got from CompuServe, then opened "Popcorn," the 
cleverly titled viewing program. 
</P>
<P>
 When I opened the video file in Popcorn, the window popped up on my screen, 
complete with VCR-style controls to pause, rewind and fast-forward the picture. 
I pressed play and watched two hysterical hyenas lament their place as 
scavengers at the bottom of the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound was choppy and a bit out of sync, possibly because of the computer I 
was using (a PowerBook 180), but the picture moved fairly smoothly, even though 
the video was compressed for quicker downloading. A "Shadow" trailer I 
downloaded was even clearer, and the sound was almost perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing the clips in a bigger window lessens their resolution and frame speed, 
but despite this, the real problem with the clips is figuring out what to do 
with what are essentially digitized movie trailers. And with CompuServe connect 
time costing $9.60 an hour for a high-speed modem connection practical for 
downloading, it's a question that would seem to demand an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think downloaded materials have become trading cards of the on-line world," 
said Don Buckley, vice president of advertising and publicity of Warner Bros. 
"I think people are collecting them." 
</P>
<P>
 The studios are providing the clips for free to CompuServe for a limited time: 
"The Lion King" will be available the longest, all summer. It's too soon to 
tell if digitized videos can actually persuade people to show up at a theater 
in person. 
</P>
<P>
 So though no one is completely sure what people are doing with the clips, 
quite a few people seem to be doing it. CompuServe's Entertainment Drive forum 
is promoting the video clips online, and each clip from "The Shadow" and "Wyatt 
Earp," has been downloaded about 150 times since the service began. And 
although CompuServe won't give an exact number, the service reports that the 
eight "Lion King" clips have been downloaded a total of about 2,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the best reason to download the clips is just to see the computer 
play them -- the "gee whiz-factor" responsible for countless advances in 
technology. Many people want to show the clips to prove they can, and 
Entertainment Drive's multimedia message board is full of messages from those 
trying to overcome technical glitches in order to see Simba roar in their 
living room. Once the videos are downloaded, they can also be stored and set to 
play at certain times -- a plus if you like to hear animated hyenas laugh 
before you work on your personal finances.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: F/X; MORE 'GUMP' EFFECTS: 
THE GARY SINISE ILLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most amazing illusions in "Forrest Gump," a movie chock-full of 
special effects that opened Wednesday, has nothing to do with old newsreel 
footage -- but with Gary Sinise playing a Vietnam veteran with both legs 
amputated. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinise, 39, who has both legs, surprised even himself with his performance as 
Lt. Dan, a cocky Army officer who is wounded in the Vietnam War, losing both 
legs. He is shown both before the injury, as an able-bodied officer, and after, 
in a wheelchair, with both legs gone from the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I saw (the finished film) I was shocked by it," Sinise said 
recently while on a break from researching "Apollo 13," which like "Gump" stars 
Tom Hanks. "I guess I was unprepared for just how great the effects would be, 
because I know what it looked like when we were doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob and Ken are geniuses," he said, referring to director Robert Zemeckis and 
special-effects supervisor Ken Ralston. "They were constantly working it out, 
making sure we were shooting it the right way so we could figure out the effect 
later on. When I saw it later I thought, 'Those were really stunning, flawless 
effects.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The filmic effect of virtually erasing Sinise's legs was accomplished in a 
variety of ways: in the editing room, with computer assistance and with props, 
including a specially designed wheelchair, during the shooting of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan is first seen striding purposefully in a Vietnamese jungle encampment. 
Shortly thereafter, he is shot by the Viet Cong and saved from bleeding to 
death by Gump, played by Hanks. Through the rest of the film Sinise's 
embittered character is shown in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my very first scene we wanted the audience to see my whole body," Sinise 
said. "So all I have on are boxer shorts and you see my full figure and I'm 
walking along. We wanted to have an active scene where you saw that he was a 
strong guy, so we could really take it physically to a new place." 
</P>
<P>
 One scene intended to shock the audience shows Sinise's character being lifted 
from his bed in an Army hospital, revealing his legs reduced to bloody stumps. 
That effect was done in post-production, Sinise said, with a computer that 
erased all trace of his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so effective that Sinise, during a screening he attended, said he 
overheard someone ask, "Who is that legless actor they got?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is a pivotal emotional moment for Lt. Dan when he falls from his 
wheelchair in a bout of drunkenness and Gump attempts to help him. He snarls 
and waves off Gump, bouncing and dragging his body back to the safety of his 
chair. At that moment it is hard to believe that Sinise is anything but an 
amputee in reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheelchair in which Sinise sits was designed by New York magician and 
special-effects wizard Ricky Jay. The chair was structured in such a way, with 
a thin, slanting seat, that Sinise's legs were folded under and not visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston, the special-effects supervisor, said the design of the wheelchair was 
the key to the effects surrounding Sinise's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "For scenes on the boat where he falls out of the wheelchair or leaps into the 
ocean, we took a hunk out of the side of the boat, so he could move his legs 
where no one else could (see), then used a computer to reinstate that part of 
the boat," Ralston says. "There was this open slot where he moved his legs and 
you saw the stumps, and the pant legs were folded under just right. Then we 
went back and created the shadows passing over the cutout area." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, those in the audience will be trying to figure it out. Anytime the 
audience can perceive the special effects, says director Zemeckis, it breaks 
the magic and can jar them from the story, so pains were taken to make the 
effects seamless. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see Gary Sinise with his legs off, even though it's flawless, you 
say, 'How do you do that?' " Zemeckis says. "Then hopefully you accept it as 
just another film illusion."*

POP MUSIC; DETACHABLE EXTREMIST; JOHN S. HALL BELIEVES IN KEEPING HIS IMAGE AS 
SPOKEN-WORD ARTIST SEPARATE FROM HIS ROLE AS LEADER OF OFFBEAT ROCKERS KING 
MISSILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, Lorraine Ali writes about pop music for Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John S. Hall looks around the patio of his West Hollywood hotel with nervous 
suspicion. The spoken-word artist and singer of the New York-based rock group 
King Missile studies his surroundings carefully, his dark eyes shifting from 
the passing waiter to the gleaming pool to his plate of wheat pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there's nothing particularly intriguing about this environment to the 
average eye, Hall is an artist who thrives on the everyday. You get the feeling 
that he's gathering images like a scavenger and reshaping them for another King 
Missile song -- something like last year's surprise hit "Detachable Penis," in 
which Hall sleepily details the loss of his vital organ and his hung-over 
search for it the morning after. 
</P>
<P>
 Or he could be stockpiling info for a more disjointed ramble like "Sorry," in 
which he apologizes for everything he hasn't done in his lifetime. That song 
snowballs into absurdity: "I never played poker with a toothless, one-eyed 
pirate who kept picking his teeth with a bowie knife to distract me, while his 
parrot looked over my shoulder and told him what cards I had by using an 
elaborate code involving vomiting, chirping and sea chanteys." 
</P>
<P>
 This lopsided wit has elevated Hall to a unique, two-pronged form of 
celebrity, as both an offbeat rock cult hero and a key player in the recent 
rise of spoken word -- poetry-reading performances that have gone from the 
coffeehouse underground to the pop mainstream. MTV now sponsors rock-club tours 
featuring the skewed poetry of such artists as Maggie Estep and Reg E. Gaines, 
and spoken-word performance is one of the attractions at "Lollapalooza's" 
cultural midway. Beck and Henry Rollins are two prominent alternative-rock 
figures who also operate in the spoken-word field. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started performing, poetry readings were for poets who wanted to 
be published in college journals," says Hall, sipping his fourth cup of coffee 
of the morning while the L.A. sun wilts his dark, curly hair and beat-up black 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd read stuff based on Greek myths and traditional poetry subject matter, 
then I'd have to get up and scream pieces like 'Take Stuff From Work' really 
loudly. To me, part of it was the incongruity of context. That's what I like to 
play with." 
</P>
<P>
 In King Missile's concerts, Hall reels off his bizarre stories while 
keyboardist and bassist Chris Xefos, guitarist David Rick and drummer Roger 
Murdock create a dissonant backdrop that ranges from funk-tinged minimalism to 
experimental metal to avant-garde pop.  
</P>
<P>
 Xefos, a Long Island native who moved to San Francisco two years ago, writes 
his portion of the songs at home, then meets Hall and the rest of the band to 
unite the parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it amazing how John works," says Xefos in a separate interview. "He 
just writes stuff in his book and never really edits anything, therefore it 
either works or it doesn't. That's just one more thing I find strange about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, his work is 100% personal. Like 'Detachable Penis' may be funny, but 
it's also about his paranoia. You can look into it and see John. I think he 
always expresses himself in the words completely -- it's just that sometimes 
it's more masked than others." 
</P>
<P>
 Estep, who recently released an album called "No More Mr. Nice Girl," is an 
old roommate of Hall's who's seen him develop over the past 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "John's stuff is simple and direct, yet uncensored," she says. "I think it 
hits people in the stomach and funny bone. All of us at one time or another 
might think something remotely like his stuff, but never really know we're 
thinking it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hall, who declines to give his age but appears to be in his 30s, grew up in 
New York's West Village, but his parents -- his dad was a chemist for the Army 
and his mom was a homemaker -- were hardly part of the area's bohemian scene. 
Hall was introduced to the area's alternative lifestyles through school 
friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "My friend had the 'Hair' soundtrack, so we were like 8 years old and 
listening to albums with cuss words on them. Other friends turned me on to 
Frank Zappa. I'd go over to their lofts where their mother was painting nudes 
-- it was mind-expanding because I came from a very 'Father Knows Best' 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 While attending Queens College in communications, he started a band called You 
Suck, which did tongue-in-cheek versions of Culture Club and Barry Manilow 
songs. He eventually left school and the band, got a job as a bank teller and 
hung out with a girlfriend who introduced him to the art and writing of the 
Dada movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'These people are crazy like me,' " says Hall. "There's something 
sort of anti-academic about it. I thought you had to be raised by artists to be 
an artist, but then thought if Dada is this art movement where you can just 
display a urinal in a museum, then maybe that's the way for me. At the same 
time there was punk rock, and all these bands that couldn't really play, they 
were do-it-yourself. Anti-virtuoso. That also spurred me on." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was soon fired from the bank, and spent most of his time listening to 
records by such poets as John Giorno, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and 
Patti Smith. After breaking in at open-mike readings around the underground 
poetry scene, he hooked up with the indie rock label Shimmy Disc in 1987 and 
made two King Missile records, backed by label founder Kramer and a guitarist 
named Dogbowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Shimmy Disc that he met Chris Xefos and Dave Rick, who teamed with 
Hall on the 1990 King Missile album "Mystical S---." They picked up drummer 
Murdock and made the big jump to a major label, Atlantic Records, which 
released "The Way to Salvation" in 1991. Last year's "Happy Hour" and the 
current "King Missile" followed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just Hall's wit that's made King Missile records No. 1 on the college 
charts and its videos a strong presence on MTV. The band's quirky, catchy tunes 
draw an audience in that wouldn't normally be attuned to a spoken-word 
performer.  
</P>
<P>
 "John S. Hall is his spoken-word pieces," says Xefos, "whereas King Missile is 
a combination of that and music -- two elements. Sometimes the music we do is 
pretty weird and wacky. I don't know if as many people would hear it if it 
wasn't attached to what John is doing, and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band's left-field musical approach makes Hall feel at home, more so than 
he ever did with the straight-ahead rock of his first band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had problems with the rhyming, metered and contrived nature of 
songwriting," Hall says quietly, delivering his words in careful, compact 
packages. He rarely cracks a joke or strays too far from the subject under 
discussion. "That's why I thought instead I'd write free-verse a la Kerouac or 
Ginsberg, and get some simple music behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At poetry readings I became the comic relief, then they asked me to 
'feature.' I thought, 'Can I do 40 minutes of reading my stuff? No, so I'll 
have my friend come up and play guitar.' Then that evolved into King Missile." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hall is more interested in expanding on the band's musical side and 
bringing the music to the fore. "Rather than try and do the definitive 
spoken-word album while spoken word is at its height, we decided to evolve as a 
band into a more rock 'n' roll-ish thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the whole beginnings of this band were based in music. If you're not 
gonna have music, then I might as well write a book," says Hall, who also 
collaborates with several other artists and musicians around New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not known for my singing, but for my monologues. At shows, occasionally 
there will be this antagonistic attitude now, like, 'I can't hear the words!' 
If you want to hear the words, I do spoken-word shows all the time. Forty-five 
minutes of me with no music. King Missile is not the end all and be all of me, 
it's just one aspect of what I want to do."*

'DR. STRANGELOVE' AND THE SINGLE WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When asked if she has fond memories of working on Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. 
Strangelove," Tracy Reed emphatically responds, "Oh yes, lots!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed, who played "Miss Foreign Affairs," Gen. Buck Turgidson's comely 
secretary, concedes, in a phone call from London, that there were times on the 
set that were "very alarming." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only woman in it and I was wearing a bikini the whole time," Reed 
remembers, and when Kubrick decided to open the set to the press, "there were 
all these reporters staring at me. It was dreadful." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed landed the part after she met Kubrick with some friends at dinner. "We 
chatted," she says, "and he asked me to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite overexposing her to the media, Reed says Kubrick was "wonderful." 
George C. Scott, who played Gen. Turgidson, was "a darling, absolutely sweet," 
and the film's star, Peter Sellers, was "a sad man who never quite knew who he 
really was." 
</P>
<P>
 Although just 22 when "Dr. Strangelove" was produced, Reed disputes original 
press material claiming the film is "introducing Tracy Reed as 'Miss Foreign 
Affairs.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "That's ridiculous," she says. "I've been in the movies all of my life!" 
</P>
<P>
 The stepdaughter of British director Sir Carol Reed and the daughter of 
actress Penelope Dudley Ward, Reed actually made her film debut at the age of 6 
months, co-starring with her mother and Laurence Olivier in "The 
Demi-Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 And after "Dr. Strangelove," Reed continued to appear in British comedies -- 
"there were so many I can't remember" -- working again with Sellers in "A Shot 
in the Dark," until she began turning down parts to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 52, Reed has three daughters, ages 34, 21 and 20. She works as a broker 
for a British gourmet foods company, for whom she "travels the whole of 
Ireland," trying to encourage grocery stores to carry the company's products.  
</P>
<P>
 Reed got the job, she explains, by "pure chance," after deciding she wanted to 
remain in West Cork, Ireland, where she had recently bought a house. "I just 
rang them and asked if they needed someone to help them export to Ireland," she 
says. "They agreed and I had a job."  
</P>
<P>
 She says she's sometimes recognized as "Miss Foreign Affairs" when "Dr. 
Strangelove" has "just been on television," and is delighted to hear that the 
film is being re-released in the United States, where she hopes a lot of people 
see it. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, she says with a laugh, "I hope we all get paid again."*

BENEFIT FOR WAR-TORN RWANDA DRAWS 300 ; RELIEF: WOMAN TELLS OF LOSING 17 FAMILY 
MEMBERS IN CARNAGE THAT HAS CLAIMED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. THE SANTA MONICA 
COLLEGE EVENT RAISES $2,500. 
</P>

<P>
 About 300 people packed an auditorium Saturday at Santa Monica College in a 
show of support for a war-torn country thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rwandan benefit concert, organized by a Rwandan student and members of 
Operation USA, a local relief organization, took in about $2,500 from the $10 
admission and additional donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised. This is a very good turnout," said Richard Walden, president 
of Operation USA. The Santa Monica fund-raiser for Rwanda was the first held in 
Los Angeles since the war began in April, Walden said. In the two months since 
reports that an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people have been killed in the 
country, Walden said, donations for Rwanda have been few. "We realized we had 
to do grass-roots organizing to raise money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of dancers from Rwanda, Uganda and Malawi performed, as did the choir 
from Brookins A.M.E. Church in Los Angeles. Actors Mike Farrell and Danny 
Glover spoke about the urgency of the situation in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all in pain, and feel powerless in a sense, when assessing what is 
going on in Rwanda," said Glover. He encouraged the audience to write letters 
to local congressional representatives, saying, "We must let our voices be 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was visibly moved when dancer Laetitia Rwiyegura, who lives in 
Long Beach, spoke about her 17 family members who were murdered back home. "I 
lost my younger brother, two sisters and their families," said Rwiyegura, 36. 
"The more I talk about it, the more I want to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Ostreicher of Hollywood said that while she isn't an activist, she 
wanted to come down and donate money. She said the program was educational, and 
she could relate to the suffering of the young woman who spoke about losing her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father is a concentration camp survivor," Ostreicher said. "I could relate 
to what it means to be threatened with death because of the race and religion 
you belong to." 
</P>
<P>
 Another descendant of Holocaust survivors, Esther Krisman of West Los Angeles, 
said she was bothered that more isn't being done to help the people in Rwanda. 
She added that she feels a sense of helplessness.  
</P>
<P>
 "I started crying when I heard that girl (Rwiyegura) speak," said Krisman. 
"But I don't know what else can be done about this. There are so many similar 
tragedies going on in Bosnia and Haiti. It's all so overwhelming."

KIM'S DEATH SPARKS FEAR, RELIEF IN L.A.; REACTION: THE MUCH-DESPISED DICTATOR 
KIM IL SUNG IS GONE. BUT MANY KOREAN AMERICANS EXPRESS WORRY THAT HIS DEATH 
WILL LEAD TO INSTABILITY AND VIOLENCE IN NORTH KOREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the heart of Los Angeles' Koreatown, shoppers and shopkeepers, elderly 
people passing time, and evangelists urging passersby to come to their churches 
were talking about the death of Kim Il Sung on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe that he is gone," said a Korean Air stewardess as she 
and a friend sat on a bench in front of Hannam Supermarket reading 
Korean-language newspapers and discussing the death of the 82-year-old North 
Korean dictator. "We've been fooled by him too many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Lee, a Westside homemaker who was visiting a mall near Olympic 
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, said she did not like the longtime North Korean 
leader but would pray for his soul. "I've been waiting for him to die for the 
last 20 years," she said. "When I think about the horrible things he has done 
to 75 million Koreans, I wonder how he could have lived to be an old man." 
</P>
<P>
 In Koreatown and elsewhere throughout Southern California, many people of 
Korean ancestry said Kim's death came at an inopportune time -- before a 
historic July 25 summit meeting between Kim and South Korean President Kim 
Young Sam could take place.

 "Even in death Kim Il Sung causes problems," said Bo Ok Ahn, a grandmother who 
was shopping at Hannam Supermarket. "He should have died sooner or later but 
not now -- just when everybody is talking about peace on the Korean peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
 Chae-Jin Lee, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said there 
had been "a cautiously optimistic outlook for some kind of settlement of the 
nuclear issue under the elder Kim's leadership. In that sense, his sudden death 
was unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, an expert on North Korea, said the dictator's death has put North Korea 
at a "very important crossroad" where it needs to make "a fundamental decision 
about the future course of action." 
</P>
<P>
 The future of North Korea and peace on the Korean peninsula, he said, will 
depend heavily on who will emerge as a "final leader" to succeed the elder Kim, 
and the domestic and foreign policy changes that that person will make. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own sense is that (Kim Il Sung's son) Kim Jong Il will be able to 
establish his succession relatively smoothly for the time being, and some of 
the top leaders in North Korea are likely to rally behind him in view of the 
critical situation there," Lee said. "However, once his leadership is 
established, his father will be no longer there to support him, which means 
that he has to stand on his own two feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Shin, owner of Bourbon Street Liquor in the mall around the corner from 
the Hannam Supermarket, said his biggest concern now is what Kim Jong Il might 
do to succeed his father. He fears that Kim Jong Il's supporters and those 
opposed to him could engage in power struggles that lead to bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope that Kim Jong Il does not cook up terrorist acts as a way to 
consolidate his power," Shin said.  
</P>
<P>
 With the elder Kim's passing, continued Shin, the biggest obstacle to the 
eventual reunification of the two Koreas may have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say Kim's death will mean uncertainty for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of questions but no answers," said John Cha, a Korean American 
businessman in the city of Orange. No outsider, Cha said, will know what is 
taking place in the world's most closed society. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Kim Il Sung was alive, we knew it was bad, but now, all we have is 
uncertainty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shin, a native of Pyongyang, says he dreams of visiting the hometown he left 
when he was 3. His family's property in Pyongyang was taken over by the North 
Korean government to make way for Kim Il Sung Square, Shin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But an uncle of his, who lives in Los Angeles, still has deeds to the property 
and looks at them often. "My uncle says he will get it back when our divided 
land becomes one," Shin said.

INFIGHTING THREATENS ABC SCHOOL DISTRICT; EDUCATION: DISAGREEMENTS AMONG BOARD 
MEMBERS MAY ERODE A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN PRAISED FOR ITS FINANCIAL STABILITY, 
TEST SCORES AND ACADEMICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a bitter school board election last November in a district that includes 
five small Southeast cities, one board member persuaded his colleagues to take 
the unusual step of hiring a professional mediator to help resolve 
long-standing bickering. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the ABC Unified School District board fought over issues big and 
small. They yelled, cursed and snickered at each other in public. And they 
could not agree on how to spend money. Their nonstop wrangling made for 
dramatic theater, but resulted in numbingly long and ineffective board 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things (had) been so ridiculously out of hand at public meetings," two-year 
board member David Montgomery said. "We don't even talk to each other at social 
events." 
</P>
<P>
 The half-day mediation session, attended by only five of the seven board 
members, worked at first. But the truce was short-lived and only a few days 
later the fighting broke out again. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that the feuding board was steering the district toward financial 
chaos, the Los Angeles County Education Office recently intervened. County 
officials appointed an adviser to help manage the district's spending 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The board members do agree on one thing: their all-too-public brawling 
threatens to erode a school district that takes pride in its financial 
stability, high test scores and innovative academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was February when Leonard Murdy, a former school superintendent who teaches 
management courses at USC, set up a workshop for the board that oversees a 
21,000-student district that operates schools in Cerritos, Artesia, Hawaiian 
Gardens and parts of Lakewood and Norwalk.  
</P>
<P>
 By then, the bickering had been going on for years. "We all checked our guns 
at the door," board member Robert Hughlett quipped about the mediation session. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdy urged board members to focus on education and put aside their personal 
differences. Reluctantly, Montgomery said, board members "agreed to disagree 
and respect each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, the unity disintegrated when three board members claimed 
that the district was going bankrupt and asked county education officials to 
intervene. Two weeks later, the four other members put the superintendent, who 
had supported the request, on paid leave indefinitely.  
</P>
<P>
 Murdy said he was not surprised that a planned second mediation session was 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "A board is similar to a marriage," Murdy said. "There's some deep feelings 
there. . . . Some people are so locked in their beliefs, and the feelings are 
so strong that it's an impossible situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I will no longer participate in this phony exercise in working together as 
board members," said board President Cecy Groom. "I don't think there's a way 
to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Other members agree that their problems run too deep for an outsider to fix.  
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the dispute are four board members who have enjoyed the most 
recent success at the ballot box and count on the support of employee unions 
and some parents.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are three members who have substantial backing from 
administrators and a different group of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents who regularly attended board meetings say they are growing 
increasingly frustrated because their concerns go unheeded by the four-member 
majority, parent Anthony Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a district out of control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a teacher and union leader put the blame on the three-member minority for 
not trying to get along. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make a mockery of this board every time they sit here," teacher Richard 
Hathaway told the board one night. "They're very arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
 State and county education officials say the board is one of the most 
polarized they have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that the school system is in financial trouble, county education 
officials appointed an adviser April 18 who has the authority to veto spending 
decisions that could affect the district. County officials said the district 
was spending more money than it was receiving and that the spending deficit, if 
it continued, would have left the school system on the brink of insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the financial problem gets too bad . . . the trustees may lose their 
powers as a board," said Assistant Supt. Patrick Keegan of the California 
Department of Education. Whenever conflicts surface, "both sides are adamant 
that they're right. And both sides question the other side's view of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest schism was fueled by a bitter strike by teachers in October that 
lasted 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry about a contract that called for a loss in pay and an increase in class 
sizes, teachers walked out. Before the strike was over, the balance of power on 
the school board had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of teachers, Howard Kwon, a political newcomer and retired ABC 
teacher, toppled a longtime board member in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 With that loss, three longtime board members -- Hughlett, a Cerritos Community 
College administrator, planning consultant Dixie Primosch and environmental 
consultant Jim Weisenberger -- no longer had control of the board. They had 
favored the teacher pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers campaigned for the election of candidates who favored their 
positions. They were able to help oust one incumbent who did not support them 
and keep in office two incumbents who backed them. Together, Kwon, Montgomery, 
a painting contractor, and Sally Morales Havice, a Cerritos Community College 
professor, joined board President Groom in supporting teachers' demands.  
</P>
<P>
 In February, they made good on a campaign promise to give teachers a new 
contract that called for bonus pay and restored smaller class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority placed Supt. Larry L. Lucas on paid administrative leave 
indefinitely. They said he had grown unpopular, and teachers and other 
employees accused him of being autocratic. His attorney is negotiating a 
settlement. The majority also disputed warnings that the district was in 
financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the county education office tried to resolve the financial impasse 
by providing financial advice. But the two factions refused to meet with the 
county at the same time and, despite stern warnings from the county education 
office, repeatedly refused to cut spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Many disagreements, however, break out more over style than substance. 
</P>
<P>
 At one budget meeting in March, board members exchanged sharp words over who 
would get to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughlett had flipped on a light switch near his seat, indicating that he 
wanted to talk. But Groom was poring over a three-inch-thick budget report and 
did not yield the floor. An accountant, Groom said she was busy looking for 
accounting errors. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes, Hughlett waved his arm, then gave up and started talking 
and laughing with board ally Primosch, seated next to him. Suddenly annoyed, 
Groom turned their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is funny, you idiots?" Groom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you talking about?" Hughlett shot back. "You can't even read it," he 
said, motioning toward the budget documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the board decided to delay some of the proposed budget reductions. 
Such delays have become a regular feature of budget talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the feuding prompted a change in the board's seating chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughlett was moved away from a seat next to Morales Havice after she 
complained that he had tossed a clipboard in her direction and hit her in the 
elbow. Hughlett denied the allegation, but traded seats with Weisenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 The board majority has continually complained that staff was providing 
incomplete and inaccurate financial information and accused the minority of 
trying to subvert their leadership by asking the county to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 At a March meeting, Morales Havice called the request for intervention a 
"dastardly act" done in secret. Groom said the three deserved to be 
reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Primosch said the minority bloc only wanted to save the district from 
possible bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're out of order," Groom told her. She and her three board allies walked 
out of the room while Primosch was still talking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and employees fear that the bickering will have fallout beyond 
possible financial problems. They worry that district officials are unfocused 
and could unwittingly damage a school district that has been the envy of its 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Unified students have consistently logged impressive marks in standardized 
tests. On last year's new statewide student test, ABC had the best or nearly 
the best scores in every category among Los Angeles County school systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents from both sides threaten to use elections next year to keep their side 
in power. Four school board seats now held by Groom, Hughlett, Primosch and 
Weisenberger will be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 After the county's financial adviser managed to get both sides to agree that 
the district's financial crisis is real, the board finally adopted a budget 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 After a marathon special session June 18, the board came up with nearly $1.8 
million in cuts to keep the $69-million budget balanced for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The final vote was 4 to 3.

 Where's Charlton Heston when you really need him? 
</P>
<P>
 The actor could have been a big help Saturday afternoon when a Universal 
Studios Hollywood employee drove her car the wrong way -- into the theme park's 
Red Sea attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who works in the studio's wardrobe department, was rescued unharmed 
from the middle of the lake after about an hour by county firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Moses in one of his most famous movie roles, Heston parted the waters 
of the mechanized "sea" on the studio's lot. Pharaoh's soldiers followed him 
and were drowned when the waters rejoined. Now the Red Sea is a popular 
attraction on the studio's tour tram ride. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unlucky employee was not familiar with how it works, said county Fire 
Capt. Rod Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got there after the lake had parted so a tram could go through," 
Washington said. "So all she saw was the path that's about as wide as a road, 
and she thought she could go through there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 As a tram exits the lake, it triggers a device that causes the parting waters 
to meet, Washington said, and "she was trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 An Urban Search and Rescue team from West Hollywood rescued the 32-year-old 
woman with ropes and harnesses. Her name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said he was stunned when firefighters first got the rescue call 
about 2:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it, but now I can understand how it happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who usually works weekdays, customarily leaves by the studio's back 
gate at the east end of the lot. But that gate, which exits onto Barham 
Boulevard, was locked Saturday, forcing her to find another way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was going to attempt to exit on Lankershim at the west end of the 
studio," Washington said. "But apparently, she wasn't familiar with the tram 
ride."  
</P>
<P>
 Or, it seems, the movie.

ANTI-GANG OFFICER SHOT IN JAW IN BOYLE HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer was shot in the jaw Saturday while investigating 
possible gang activity in Boyle Heights. Police say they are holding possible 
suspects for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Gabriel Rivas, 31, assigned to the Hollenbeck station's anti-gang 
squad, had finished a field interview at 12:30 a.m. and was driving with his 
partner, Anna Carlisle, on 5th Street near Gless Street when bottles and rocks 
were thrown at his car, according to a police statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers "drove from the scene intending to request additional units and 
return in force to investigate the incident," a police statement says, but 
Rivas suffered a single gunshot wound to the jaw, and was taken to County-USC 
Medical Center for surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 Rivas was later transferred to USC University Hospital. He was listed in fair 
condition.

HOT PROPERTY: ROCKER SELLS MALIBU DIGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 SAMMY HAGAR, lead vocalist of the rock band Van Halen, has sold his Malibu 
home of eight years for close to its last asking price of about $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer and guitarist, who has been with Van Halen since 1985, listed the 
six-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot house at $2.25 million in May, 1993, after he 
and the band left on a world tour to celebrate its 15th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Hagar said that he had put the house on the market because he had 
only been there twice in nine months, partly because he also has homes in Mill 
Valley, Carmel and Mexico. The Malibu home was also being sold as part of his 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagar, 46, now lives mainly in Mill Valley but is leasing another home in 
Malibu while spending the summer with the band, recording a new album at Eddie 
Van Halen's Hollywood Hills studio, Hagar's publicist said. A collection of 
Hagar's greatest solo hits combined with two new songs was released earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The home that Hagar sold is a contemporary Cape Cod on a bluff behind gates 
overlooking Broad Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was sold to Yuri Spiro, owner of Westwood-based West World Productions, a 
computer publishing company. Spiro purchased the home as a weekend retreat. His 
main residence is in Beverly Hills, and he also has a home at Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Principe of Westcord/Westoaks Commercial Group in Westlake Village 
represented Spiro, and Lynette Bishop of Douglas Properties in Malibu 
represented Hagar. 
</P>
<P>
 Late actor/poet MACDONALD CAREY'S Benedict Canyon home of 23 years has been 
sold for $370,000, $1,000 more than its asking price, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy-winning Carey, who had a distinguished career on Broadway and 
appeared in 60 films as well as on early radio and TV, was best known in recent 
years as Dr. Tom Horton on the daytime soap opera "Days of Our Lives," a role 
he played for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, who also wrote several books of poetry and an autobiography (in 1991), 
died at 81 in March at the home that was just sold. Built in 1950, the 
three-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot house has what have been termed "gorgeous 
gardens, with a beautiful collection of roses." 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which is said to have been purchased by a lawyer from Ireland and 
his wife, had been listed by Kyle Grasso and Joe Babajian, both of Fred Sands 
Estates, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 WYLAND, the painter who prefers using only his surname and is known for his 
"Whaling Walls" (murals of life-size whales and other marine animals), has 
purchased a waterfront mixed-use complex in Laguna Beach, where he plans to 
maintain a studio and residential loft for himself. His main home is in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old artist purchased the property for about the asking price of $1 
million. The building there is where he painted his first Whaling Wall in 1981, 
when he was a struggling artist living full time in Laguna Beach. Since that 
first 140-x-26-foot mural of a gray whale and calf, Wyland has painted 53 
Whaling Walls in a number of cities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave his Laguna house to his mother three years ago but has kept a factory, 
gift shop and gallery in the area, and now he is planning to spend $500,000 
more on the complex he just purchased, to create his loft and a museum, a 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bel-Air mansion that gangster LUCKY LUCIANO is said to have leased during 
the late 1930s and that actors Eddie Murphy and Richard Harris rented in more 
recent years has been sold in foreclosure for close to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of the highest foreclosure sales in Southern California and is 
believed to be the biggest to date in Bel-Air. Built in 1936, the nine-bedroom, 
10,000-square-foot estate, on two acres with a tennis court, was for sale in 
1991 at $8.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer is Joseph Arsenault, described as a 28-year-old investor who just 
moved to Los Angeles from New York. Arsenault already put the home back on the 
market at $4.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He also leased out the home for two months, at $65,000 a month, to an Iraqi 
businessman who rents a house on the Westside for himself and his entourage 
every summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Rappaport of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills, represented Arsenault 
in the purchase and lease and has the $4.9-million listing. Kathy Villa of 
Asher Dann & Associates, Beverly Hills, represented the seller, First Los 
Angeles Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor STAN HERMAN has listed 99 acres off of Coldwater Canyon that he has 
owned for 14 years at $16.75 million. "I want to move to Montecito and have a 
little office to complement my larger office in Beverly Hills," he said, 
referring to his realty company, Stan Herman/Stephen Shapiro & Associates. The 
site, along a mountain ridge, is approved for 13 lots.

YOUR MORTGAGE; MAJOR LENDERS WOO CREDIT-RISKY BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the largest financial organizations in the country quietly have begun 
making home mortgages to consumers they formerly avoided: refinancers and home 
buyers with dents, nicks and even major gashes in their credit histories. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest entrant into the burgeoning "B" and "C" market: Prudential Home 
Mortgage, the second highest-volume private originator of residential loans in 
the United States. Rather than automatically turning down applicants who've had 
spotty payment histories, Prudential is now giving them a second shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even applicants who've been 30 days late on their mortgages as many as three 
times in the past 12 months -- or 60 days late no more than once -- may qualify 
under the giant lender's new "B" mortgage program. As of the first week of 
July, the loans will be available in all 50 states through mortgage brokers or 
the firm's retail branches. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing industry classifies most applicants into one of four broad 
categories from A to D. Consumers with perfect or near-perfect credit and 
payment records fit into the top grade. B and C borrowers are those who've run 
into significant economic troubles somewhere along the way -- forcing them to 
fall behind on payments of their debts -- but aren't deadbeats. They have the 
capacity to pay their debts, but their prior report cards simply scare away 
banks and most other traditional lenders. Applicants with recent or ongoing 
bankruptcy filings or mortgage foreclosure proceedings fit into the D category, 
or even a no-man's land recognized by some intrepid lenders as E -- the pits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the 1990-1992 recession, hundreds of thousands of homeowners 
have slipped from solid A's to B and C credit ratings. Typically they've been 
victims of corporate down-sizings, plant closings or regional economic slumps 
that left them with lower income than they'd enjoyed in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than sending borrowers like these out the door, major mortgage lenders 
are rushing to come up with programs to attract them as customers. National, 
publicly traded firms such as American Residential Mortgage Corp. and Plaza 
Mortgage recently have created separate subsidiaries to do nothing but 
originate B and C home loans. Other well-known banks and mortgage bankers 
reportedly have competing programs on the drawing boards or heading for 
launches. 
</P>
<P>
 The motivation for the sudden burst of B and C activity is straightforward: As 
Prudential Home Mortgage vice chairman Larry R. Swedrowe put it in an 
interview, "These (borrowers) are often people who've had credit problems that 
were beyond their own control." With the proper underwriting safeguards -- and 
a higher interest rate than A borrowers get -- "they represent a very sound 
business opportunity" for lenders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of interest rates and terms can credit-impaired borrowers look for 
from the new wave of high-volume mortgage lenders plunging into B and C waters? 
Here's a quick overview of what you might find. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, you should know that the entire B and C market emphasizes 
relatively high equity levels in borrower's homes. For most B grade applicants, 
lenders will not go higher than a 75% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. That is, if 
your house is worth $200,000 and you're B-rated, don't expect to get more than 
a $150,000 mortgage -- at least not if you want the lowest available rate. 
Borrowers with C-grade credit shouldn't expect LTVs in excess of 65%, and 
D-grade considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
 A second shopping factor to keep in mind: B and C lenders are willing to 
stretch the limits on your overall debt ratios -- often far beyond what you'd 
find as an A-category applicant. For example, Plaza Mortgage's subsidiary 
Option One Mortgage Corp. starts its permissible debt-to-income ratios at 45% 
and goes to 60%. That means that your total household monthly debt -- mortgage, 
charge accounts, auto loan, college loan, etc. -- can be between 45% and 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast that with the standard ratios in the A market, which typically stop 
at 36% to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 A final hint about shopping: B and C mortgage lenders' programs have wide 
variations in underwriting criteria. What one firm considers an acceptable 
credit risk at a given LTV and debt-to-income level may be shockingly different 
from a competitor's. As a result, the best way to find the right loan package 
in the B and C market may not be to rate shop as you would in the A market. 
Instead, contact one or more local mortgage brokers in your area, lay out your 
credit profile and ask them to shop for the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage brokers are especially important in this field because firms like 
Prudential, ADVANTA, American Residential, Option One, Delta and other large B 
and C lenders depend upon them as their local originators or correspondents. 
One broker usually does business with multiple lenders, and should know their 
intricate program variations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates? Depending upon your specific credit history and home equity, look for 
adjustable rate loans starting in the 7 3/4% to 8% range, and fixed-rate 
30-year loans in the 10 1/4% to 10 1/2% range for B borrowers. For C credit 
loans, add on a percentage point or more.

CONDO Q & A: CAN ASSOCIATION LIMIT NUMBER OF RENTALS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hickenbottom is a past president of 
the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI), 
a national nonprofit research and educational organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in a large association in Orange County. Some association 
members would like to limit the number of units that can be rented to either 
30% or 50% of the total number of units. Owners who wish to rent their units 
would be unable to do so once the approved percentage has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) states that 
"nothing in this document shall prevent an owner from renting his/her 
condominium out" to a tenant. Can the association prevent an owner from renting 
out a unit? Can the association charge a higher monthly assessment to the 
owners of units that are rented? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The declaration is your association's "constitution." It is the 
highest authority among your association's governing documents and it is very 
difficult to change since it requires a high percentage of owners', and often 
the lenders', approval. 
</P>
<P>
 If your declaration prohibits the restriction of rentals, then any conflicting 
rule passed by the board of directors would be invalid. The only alternative 
would be to change the declaration by a vote of the owners, following the 
amendment procedure that is stated in the document. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging an absentee owner a higher assessment would probably be illegal since 
the monthly assessment is based upon the percentage of ownership or the square 
footage of the owner's unit. Again, the declaration will typically state the 
procedure for establishing each person's obligation for the maintenance of the 
complex. For example, if the association has 10 units and the declaration 
states that each of the 10 unit owners pays an equal amount of the 
association's expenses, then each owner is responsible for one-tenth of the 
total expenses. Any other method of sharing the expenses is invalid, and 
therefore, unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 The association could charge an extra fee, separate from or in addition to the 
monthly assessment, only for specific services that are above and beyond the 
services provided to the other owners. The extra fee must be fair and 
justifiable. It cannot be an exorbitant fee that is simply used as a penalty to 
discourage rentals. Use Caution Trying to Enforce Age Restriction 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In our condominium association, one of the owners now has a daughter and a 
grandchild living in her condominium unit. Our association's documents specify 
that it is a "senior citizen" condominium. What can be done to evict the 
residents who do not comply with our occupancy restrictions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Be very careful about trying to enforce the age restriction until you seek 
the advice of an attorney who can analyze your particular association's rights. 
Even though your association's documents prohibit children, there are state and 
federal laws that may make your association's age restrictions illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act was adopted. The law 
specifies that a residential complex must have specific services or amenities 
for senior residents in order to qualify for senior housing status. This 
federal law supersedes your association's legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty for age discrimination can be as high as $50,000 so I urge you to 
spend the necessary funds to obtain expert legal advice before you or your 
board of directors tries to evict the young woman and her child. Board Members 
Mum About Suing Developer 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My association is in the midst of suing the developer for construction 
defects. The board of directors will no longer allow our board meetings to be 
taped. When the owners ask questions about the building or equipment 
replacement or financial reports, the board members say, "We can't discuss 
that. The lawyers are handling it." What are the owners entitled to know about 
these matters? Please give us your comments. 
</P>
<P>
 A: In my opinion, a tape recording of a meeting is an invitation to trouble. 
Sometimes, taping a meeting is necessary but the tapes should not be saved as a 
permanent record. Tapes should be erased after the minutes, the official record 
of the association, are written, approved and filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, owners are entitled to have access to the 
association's records and they are entitled to be informed about board meetings 
so that they can attend. However, when legal action is pending, it is necessary 
that the association's interests be protected. Therefore, the board is allowed 
to hold "secret meetings," called executive board meetings or executive 
sessions and the minutes may be sealed until the legal issues are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has an obligation to disclose, in general terms, the types of 
problems that are the basis for the legal action, but the specifics of the case 
are privileged information. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has the power and authority to act on behalf of all of the owners. 
The owners, who elected the board members for that purpose, sometimes get 
concerned about all that power when legal issues arise. However, the owners 
should be very cautious about interfering unless they have irrefutable evidence 
that the board is not acting in their best interests.

MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW BUYING HOMES, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With lower housing costs and renewed income growth, American households are 
once again moving up the housing ladder to homeownership, according to a study 
by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeownership rates are already on the rise for most age groups, halting the 
downward spiral of the 1980s, according to the annual study, "The State of the 
Nation's Housing 1994."Demographic trends -- including the aging of the 
baby-boom generation and the movement of immigrant households into the economic 
mainstream -- should support strong home-buying potential throughout the rest 
of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not since the 1950s has single-family demand so dominated the housing 
market," said the center's director, H. James Brown. "The ingredients are in 
place to lift the national homeownership rate to an all-time high by the year 
2000." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the recent rise in interest rates, the report notes that income is also 
rising, and concludes that stronger income growth could well offset the effect 
of higher mortgage costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mortgage interest rates are only one factor in the home-buying equation," 
said the center's executive director, William Apgar. "The strength of 
single-family production and sales throughout the country suggest that the 
current recovery is widespread enough to withstand an uptick in rates." 
</P>
<P>
 The study cautions that the growth of homeownership also has a down side. Most 
new construction today is of better-quality, single-family homes, located at 
increasing distances from the central cities of large metropolitan areas. "Left 
unchecked, the decentralization of development will reinforce the spatial 
isolation of the poor in economically depressed areas," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For low- and moderate-income renters, lack of savings to cover the down 
payment and closing costs blocks progress up the housing ladder," Apgar said. 
"And for minority households, discriminatory barriers present further 
obstacles."

ANTIQUE DOORKNOB UPDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laura Henning, Editor's note: On May 29, the Real Estate section ran an 
article and photographs on Bud Wolski and his huge collection of antique 
doorknobs. Here is an update on that story: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First the bad news: On June 20 there was a major fire at the Manchester Sash & 
Door Co. The South-Central Los Angeles business, which had been in Wolski's 
family since 1922, was a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the good news: Wolski's doorknob collection, one of the finest in the 
United States, was unscathed. It was housed in a nearby bungalow and in several 
walk-in metal shipping containers that were unaffected by the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski was philosophical about the recent turn of events. He said the 
60-foot-by-160-foot corrugated metal structure was one of the "greatest fire 
hazards" in South-Central. Filled with lumber, tools, machinery and completed 
doors and window sashes, the structure was uninsurable, Wolski said. Fire 
officials placed the loss at $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the blaze started when some youths tried to steal a car that was 
parked near the rear of the building. When they could not "hot wire" the 
vehicle, they abandoned it, leaving behind a smoldering fire. The car 
eventually exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolski plans to re-establish his door and sash company on a limited basis. And 
his prized doorknobs are still on view and for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get discouraged sometimes," said Wolski, 73. "It's a helluva way to 
retire." Laura Henning

GROUP HOME ANSWER STEREOTYPES MENTALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the June 26 "Real Estate Q&A," Robert J. Bruss discussed the lack of 
disclosure of a residential group home for the mentally ill ("Must Residential 
Group Home Be Disclosed?") and more or less agreed with the writer that they 
had reason for concern for the safety of their daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious that Bruss is uninformed about the mentally ill and, in his 
ignorance, has underscored one of the most damaging stigmas the mentally ill 
have endured -- that they are dangerous and/or violent. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the mentally ill are more likely to be the victims of violence, not 
the perpetrators. The episodes of violence in the mentally ill population is 
less than 1%, much less than the "normal" population. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of people who suffer from mental illness strive very hard to 
control their symptoms so they may lead more "normal" lives. When they are 
successful, they can hold down jobs, go to school and try to achieve 
independence. One of the benefits of achieving this success is to live in a 
regular neighborhood and be treated like the decent human beings they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental illness is a disease, like cancer or diabetes. The disease exaggerates 
and distorts the personality but does not change peaceful people into violent 
ones. These people are not monsters that society needs to be protected from. 
They are sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and sometimes parents. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a realtor, the mother of three daughters, the eldest being mentally ill 
and who, for the first time, is living in a decent neighborhood with several 
other adults experiencing the long road back from severe mental illness. It is 
a personal success story for her and I would like to see more people have the 
chance to achieve it, also. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bruss' statement that "I don't blame you for being concerned with the safety 
of your daughters" is the perfect example of stereotyping the mentally ill into 
a category of dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 At no point did the letter-writer say that the residents of the group home 
were a safety hazard. All the writer mentioned was that the residents talk to 
the writer's daughters and their friends, if they are outside, and that they 
would not have bought the house if they had known "mentally ill" residents 
lived nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because an individual is handicapped, that does not mean he or she is 
dangerous. Bruss encouraged the public to believe that the mentally ill are 
dangerous individuals and that neighborhoods where residential homes exist 
could be problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 The only statement he should have made would be to contact the local 
authorities if the residents of the group home were creating problems.

THE DOWNSIDE TO BOTH SIDES IN LEASE-OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a private investor in residential real estate for the past 15 
years and have been a reader of Robert J. Bruss' column ("Real Estate Q&A") in 
The Times for several years. I feel compelled to voice my strong disagreement 
with his view on lease-option agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 I know Bruss is very much in favor of lease options. But what he doesn't tell 
the readers is that before a tenant enters into a lease-option agreement, they 
must be able to identify the source of the money for the down payment once the 
lease/option agreement expires. 
</P>
<P>
 I have had two lease options. Both times the tenant was not able to exercise 
the option and lost a lot of money. Sure, I made a few dollars, but was very 
disappointed when the tenant could not buy the property and I lost out on an 
easy sale. Instead, I received the property back and was faced with the 
unpleasant task of going through the repair, advertising, showing and screening 
of deadbeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Now whenever a prospective tenant inquires about a lease-option, I inform them 
that if they are planning on winning the lottery to finance the purchase, that 
they had better forget about a lease-option. I explain to them that a 
lease-option can result in their losing a lot of money and wishful dreams. I 
suggest that Bruss do likewise.

THE VALUE OF HIRING A PROFESSIONAL APPRAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the June 26 "Real Estate Q&A" column ("How to Determine Asking Price for 
House"), Robert J. Bruss writes that a professional appraiser could be hired at 
a cost of several hundred dollars but the result would only be one appraiser's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he recommends interviewing three successful real estate agents 
working in the area and consulting friends, neighbors and business associates. 
The agents, he says, will provide written comparative market analyses showing 
sales and listing prices in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 What, one wonders, does he think the appraiser does? 
</P>
<P>
 The typical comparative market analysis that Bruss talks about is in fact a 
kind of off-the-cuff appraisal done by the broker, usually free, to obtain a 
listing. But it is almost never as rigorous as a professional appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 A properly done appraisal is not just any opinion of value. It is based on 
recent closed sales in the neighborhood of homes that are as similar to the 
appraised property as the market offers, with research-based adjustments for 
unavoidable dissimilarities, and includes other research to identify market 
trends and other factors affecting value. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no quarrel with Bruss' advice about getting opinions from successful 
brokers. An agent who has concentrated on a particular neighborhood for some 
time should have a very good feel for values there. But one should never forget 
that everything an agent does is directed toward obtaining a commission. Once 
the seller is signed up for three to six months, an overpriced listing can be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraiser's job is to make an unbiased estimate of value based on the best 
information available. The fees he or she charges are highly competitive and 
cheap by comparison with almost any other professional service. Most 
residential appraisers make less than $15 an hour.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Keep bougainvillea vines on the dry side during their blooming season to 
insure the brightest colored bracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hydrangeas in tubs on a shaded patio or under a lath will add a large splash 
of color with their enormous blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feed citrus and avocados monthly during the growing season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treat Walnut husk fly with applications of Malathion and spreader sticker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fill containers with colorful blooming annuals and set them throughout the 
outdoor living areas -- on decks, by front doors, on porches and balconies.

GARDENING Q & A: GROWING THE MOST COLORFUL ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I've heard that color intensity on roses can be improved by the 
addition of minerals or other substances. Is this true? How can I improve or 
intensify the color of my roses? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Although too much nitrogen fertilizer applied in the springtime may 
reduce the intensity of color in early flowers, our Southern California soils 
usually contain enough minerals to sport optimal colors in roses under normal 
conditions. Sometimes, however, adding Epsom salts (one-quarter cup per mature 
plant) may help; and if leaves become chorotic, applying iron chelate greens up 
the foliage and increases flower color. 
</P>
<P>
 The best flower color can usually be obtained in our area by 1) planting roses 
where they receive at least six hours of full sunlight per day (the ideal is 
morning and mid-day sun with filtered late afternoon shade), 2) watering 
regularly and 3) feeding with a balanced plant food about every six weeks from 
early February through September. Do Citrus Trees Really Attract Termites? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A real estate agent advised me not to buy a house with citrus trees planted 
near it, claiming that citrus trees attract termites. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Nothing in my own experience or in the literature substantiates this 
unusual claim; so I asked pest control agents, and they said that citrus trees 
are no more susceptible to termites than most other wood sources. The fact is 
that these dreaded pests -- particularly the subterranean and dry wood termites 
in inland areas, and the much larger dampwood or Formosa termites near the 
coast -- are well-established in Southern California, regardless of citrus or 
any other kinds of trees. So no matter where you choose to buy a house here, be 
sure to have it checked, and if necessary, treated for termites. Bugs Eat 
Strawberries Before They Can Ripen 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We planted strawberries this year and have nurtured them well so we could 
have a good crop. However, it seems like the bugs get to them just before they 
ripen, and most of them are spoiled. Is there anything we can do to beat the 
bugs without using poisons? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although surprisingly little is written about this common problem, there 
are some satisfactory solutions to your dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 You seem to be getting a good fruit set; so the basic problem is to find a way 
to keep the fruit off the soil and away from the reach of the bugs -- usually 
pill bugs, sow bugs, earwigs and slugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial growers plant strawberries in raised rows covered by black plastic 
and water by flooding the furrows. Thus the developing fruit rests on the side 
of the slippery plastic, and the pests are unable to reach it. 
</P>
<P>
 At home you may also want to use this technique. Or you could place sturdy 
cardboard rolls (or bricks or rocks, etc.) under the sides of the plants to 
prop the berries up off the soil. Or mulch with coarse bark or rough gravel. It 
works best if the berries can simply hang in the air. However, just keeping the 
berries up off the soil will significantly increase your viable harvest. (This 
rule-of-thumb applies to other crops, such as tomatoes, squashes, melons and 
anything which might develop at ground level.) Flying, Black-Spotted Bug Eats 
Plant Greens 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a major problem with bugs eating the greens on my vegetable plants 
and pumpkins, primarily a flying green bug with black spots on its back 
(cucumber beetle?). Nothing I've tried has worked. Do you have a remedy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You are correct in identifying this black-spotted green bug as a cucumber 
beetle. The recommended remedy is an application of Ortho Sevin Garden Dust to 
the foliage. This will eliminate beetle and caterpillar problems quite 
effectively, and it is relatively safe for humans. As always, please be sure to 
follow label instructions.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: QUIET, COOL ALTERNATIVE BEATS HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 QUESTION: I want to add air-conditioning, but I cannot afford a central air 
system. I don't want noisy room air conditioners either. How efficient are the 
new quiet ductless mini-split models? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: New ductless air conditioners are efficient and extremely quiet. These 
air conditioners are ideal for any home, especially ones without air ducts (hot 
water or electric baseboard heat) or for a room addition. Not having to install 
ducts lowers the total cost. Heat pump models are available too. 
</P>
<P>
 A mini-split ductless system is somewhat like a central air ducted system 
because the compressor is outdoors. Small quiet cooling blower units (only 8 
inches deep) are mounted on the walls or ceilings in one to three rooms. Often, 
three indoor blower units are adequate to cool an entire house. 
</P>
<P>
 The chilled refrigerant from the single outdoor compressor flows through small 
tubing to the indoor units. Some models allow you to locate the indoor units up 
to 100 feet from the outdoor compressor. 
</P>
<P>
 To install the indoor unit, you only have to cut a 3-inch diameter hole in an 
outside wall. Refrigerant tubing and electric power come from the outdoor 
compressor unit, so you do not have to run wiring indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if your house has a ducted hot-air furnace, a ductless cooling system has 
advantages over central air -- zone cooling, hand-held remote control, cool air 
outlet high on wall and cleaner air for people with allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 Zone cooling can lower your electric bills. With a ductless system, you can 
easily keep your higher-activity areas (workroom, play room, etc.) cooler than 
other rooms. Built-in computerized clock thermostats let you automatically 
raise and lower the temperature in each area. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ductless systems have hand-held remote controls (like a TV remote) to 
adjust the temperature, blower speeds, humidity control, louver directions, 
etc. from your easy chair or bed. There is also a control keypad on the wall 
right beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the small indoor blowers are mounted high on a wall or a ceiling, the 
cool air naturally circulates evenly throughout your rooms. This reduces 
isolated cold spots. Some models also have a special low-humidity mode. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have allergies and want to keep your bedroom air allergen free, a 
ductless systems allows you to isolate that room while keeping it cool. There 
is also a built-in blower filter to further clean the air. 
</P>
<P>

air conditioner manufacturers listing cooling outputs, efficiency ratings, 
types of remote controls and special features. Please include $2 and a 
self-addressed envelope.

Should Fireplace Damper Be Closed? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I know that I should close the damper in my fireplace chimney in the 
winter, but is it necessary to close it in the summer too? Since hot air rises, 
the hot outdoor air should not come down. 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you air-condition your home, you should close the fireplace chimney 
damper. Even though it is cooler indoors, the sun shining on the chimney makes 
it warm. This creates an upward draft and draws out cooled air. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do not air-condition and you rely on ventilation, leave the chimney 
damper open in the summer.

MONTEREY HILLS CONDO ASSOCIATION GIVEN HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilson Summit Homeowners Assn., a 120-unit condo association in the 
Monterey Hills area of Los Angeles, has been honored as small association of 
the year by Community Assns. Institute (CAI). 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Summit association was honored by CAI for creating of an effective 
committee system, re-landscaping the complex and rallying 95% of the homeowners 
to install low-flow toilets, which cut the association's water and sewer bills 
by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson Summit is 7 years old, its homeowner association was formed in 
November, 1992. The units were rented for the first five years before being 
sold as condos, according to Lynette Findley, who works for Aberdeen Management 
Co. of Burbank as the liaison with the homeowners association. Most homeowners 
in the moderate-income complex are first-time buyers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 CAI's nationwide awards program, now in its fifth year, honors one association 
in each of four size categories: small (1 to 149 units), median (150 to 499), 
large (500 to 999) and very large (1,000 or more). 
</P>
<P>
 CAI is a nonprofit association created in 1973 to educate and represent the 
nation's residential community association industry.

THEY'RE DRIVEN BY A CLASSIC CASE OF CAR MANIA; AUCTION: EVENT FEATURES 
DROP-DEAD-RED CONVERTIBLES, SWANK BENTLEYS AND OTHER FOUR-WHEEL WONDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Whether they came to drop big bucks on a black 1939 Bentley or were content 
merely to gaze at a red-hot 1966 Ford Thunderbird convertible, the thousands 
who attended Saturday's Collector Car Auction had one thing in common: They 
were fanatical about cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have pictures of their wives, kids and dogs," said Tony Guenther, 
47, of Newport Beach as he pulled out his wallet. "I have my car. It's a 1940 
Lincoln Zephyr convertible and it's really swanky." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a shopper in a grocery store, Guenther slowly trolled the aisles of 
classic cars at the Hyatt Newporter, inspecting the merchandise and searching 
for good deals. But in the end, his money remained next to the picture in his 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing today," Guenther said. "But it's fun to look." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Lindsey, however, didn't travel all the way from Salt Lake City just to 
window-shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some money to spend and spent it," Lindsey said after he bought a 1988 
Shelby CSX Dodge Shadow for $1,500. "I'm thrilled beyond excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, like many of the more than 5,000 people who came to the auction, was 
drawn to the event because it featured cars and memorabilia from the personal 
collection of auto designer Carroll Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, 31, said he knew he "had a great deal" after the auction when Shelby 
offered to buy the engine back for $1,500 and allow Lindsey to keep the rest of 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had a video of that," he said. "I called my wife and she was really 
excited too and that's a relief." 
</P>
<P>
 The auction, organized by the World Classic Auction & Exposition Co., began 
Friday and concludes today. The auctioning of some 300 cars will generate more 
than $5 million in transactions between buyers and sellers before the event is 
over, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the premiere event in Southern California," said Rick Cole, who 
inaugurated the annual auction in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 That was good news to Chuck Smith of Yorba Linda, who was preparing to auction 
his 1966 Thunderbird convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best one in the world," he boasted, having put 3 1/2 years into 
restoring the fire-engine red classic. "You feel a little sad after you sell 
it, but you get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when you're looking to get at least $55,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors said the classic-car market was hit hard by the nation's 
recession and only now is it slowly recovering. "It's still a fairly soft 
market," said Don Auerbach, a dealer from Dallas, who stood outside the large 
auction tent, taking a break from the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good time to buy. I think the hobby is getting back to the people with 
a sincere interest in cars," he said. "In fact, I'd better get back in there."

MUSIC, PUPPETS BRING GOSPEL TO THE YOUNG; RELIGION: HARVEST KIDS' CRUSADE DRAWS 
14,500 TO EVANGELICAL GATHERING THAT ENDS TODAY AT ANAHEIM STADIUM. 
</P>

<P>
 With his black Nikes propped up on the row of seats in front of him, 
9-year-old Mario Escodo quietly mouthed the words of a biblical hymn led by 
"Psalty, the Singing Songbook." 
</P>
<P>
 The El Monte youngster said that even Barney, PBS's popular purple dinosaur, 
doesn't hold a candle to Psalty, who headlined a 90-minute extravaganza of 
music, choreography and puppets Saturday afternoon during the Harvest Kids' 
Crusade at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barney doesn't sing as many songs as Psalty and he doesn't sing about the 
Lord," explained Mario, who said he has an extensive collection of Psalty's 
tapes at home and was excited to be seeing the character in person for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's program drew about 14,500 youngsters and adults and was part of 
the fifth annual Harvest Crusade, which is one of the largest evangelical 
crusade efforts in the country. The event ends its three-day run at the stadium 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the children's program -- held for the first time last year -- 
uses Gospel messages and Christian music to entertain and convert, just like 
the regular evening sessions of the crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The object is to take essentially the same message for adults and put it into 
a kids' format," event organizer John Collins said. "We want to talk about the 
Gospel's requirements and about what it means to be a Christian." 
</P>
<P>
 Children and their parents were invited to, as Psalty said, "make Jesus your 
forever friend," and were urged to make a public pronouncement of their 
commitment to Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that kids know Jesus and have Jesus in their heart," said 
65-year-old Anaheim resident Doris Grooms, who brought her grandchildren to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The lively program also included several songs led by Charity Churchmouse, a 
cartoonish character who pranced around the stage in a bright red dress and 
curly pink hair that resembled cotton candy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living in difficult times," the mouse told the crowd in a squeaky 
voice. "Some would think that it would be difficult to be a Christian during 
these times. But they are wrong!" 
</P>
<P>
 The program had its share of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, during a chorus of the song "Joy, Joy, Joy," dozens of giant 
beach balls descended from the sky, prompting the crowd to play some impromptu 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm 6 years old again!" exclaimed 29-year-old Tricia Meigide, who 
got a few swings at a beach ball when one bounced down to the field-level seats 
where she and her three young children were located. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just awesome," said Meigide, of Riverside. "We're having a great 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Meigide and other parents said they were grateful for the opportunity to 
expose their children to their faith in such an entertaining way. Some said 
they were also glad to mix with such a large crowd of fellow believers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, in school or in the neighborhood, kids feel alone in their 
beliefs," said Paula Escodo, Mario's mother. "It's important for them to see 
that they are not alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Lucio, a 38-year-old Ontario resident, brought his two daughters and some 
of their friends to the event and said he hoped that the Christian messages 
would stay with them for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bible says you have to lay a foundation for your children," Lucio said. 
"We don't force it down their throats, but we want them to know who God is. We 
want our kids to be believers and expose them to things that will help them 
grow. But, in the end, they will have to make their own choice."

AUTHORITIES AGAIN SEEK LEGENDARY HACKER; COMPUTERS: KEVIN MITNICK, A LONGTIME 
VALLEY RESIDENT, IS ACCUSED OF USING HIS TECHNICAL WIZARDRY TO VIOLATE 
PROBATION. HE HAS GONE INTO HIDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 He's one of America's most wanted digital desperadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mitnick, a legendary "dark side" hacker whose computer was, in the words 
of one investigator, an "umbilical cord . . . to his soul," is being sought by 
federal and state authorities for once again allegedly using his technical 
wizardry as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 A warrant has been issued accusing him of violating the terms of his federal 
probation that he not enter a computer illegally. At the same time, the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles is accusing him of posing as a law enforcement 
officer to gain classified information and to possibly create false identities 
for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they narrowly missed him at a Studio City copy shop where he was 
picking up some allegedly illegally obtained DMV information, authorities so 
far haven't been able to catch up with him since they visited the Calabasas 
company he worked for in late 1992. Mitnick's life now seems to have come 
tantalizingly close to replicating the Robert Redford movie role in "Three Days 
of the Condor," about a man who goes into hiding and uses his technical 
knowledge to outwit the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick once used the nickname "Condor." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mitnick, 30, a former computer nerd who dropped 100 pounds before going 
into hiding, these are just the latest accusations spanning a career of hacking 
that began at Monroe High School in North Hills, when he learned how to access 
the school district's main computers. Eventually, he was able to break into a 
North American Air Defense Command computer in Colorado Springs, Colo., several 
years before the movie "WarGames," about a hacker who nearly starts a war after 
entering a defense computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick also became a skilled "phone phreak" who was able to manipulate the 
telephone system to pull pranks on friends and enemies, according to 
authorities. He disconnected service to Hollywood stars he admired, and a 
former probation officer said her phone service was terminated just as she was 
about to revoke his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an electronic terrorist," said a onetime friend who turned him in to 
authorities in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing the panic he can instill in others, after his arrest in 1988, he was 
denied bail by three different federal judges, who feared what he could do once 
back on the streets. Much of the fear about Mitnick in law enforcement quarters 
appears to stem not from what he has done in any one case, but from what mayhem 
he could cause in our computer-dependent society if he put his mind to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick eventually pleaded guilty to one computer crime and served a year in 
prison. Afterward, he spent almost a year in a Los Angeles residential 
treatment program, Gateways Beit T'Shuvah, during which time he was not allowed 
to touch a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriett Rossetto, the program director, said Mitnick suffered from an 
addictive-obsessive disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw his hacking as an addiction," she said. Mitnick was a loner who was 
very vulnerable and did not open up easily. In appearance, he resembled the 
classic computer jockey, overweight, with clunky glasses and shirttail hanging 
out. At the keyboard of a computer, he felt strong and capable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossetto liked him, but was not particularly impressed by his intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a recurring theme over the years. Some people see him as a 
genius with a terminal, while others say his technical abilities are not 
extraordinary. What is extraordinary, say friends, is his willingness to be 
consumed for as long as it takes by his appointed task, such as finding a way 
past a computer's security system. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniable, however, are his skills at what some have called "social 
engineering" and others "gagging," which is the ability to manipulate others to 
turn over information he desires, such as access codes and passwords. 
</P>
<P>
 Beit T'Shuvah uses the 12-step recovery model. While at the center, Mitnick 
made good progress and lost weight. After leaving the program, he moved to Las 
Vegas, then returned for a relative's funeral. Rossetto saw him briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 He told her he wasn't doing well. "I said, 'Admit yourself back here,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, Mitnick went to work for Teltec Investigations Inc., in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executive Michael Grant said Mitnick was training to be an 
investigator for the firm, which does assets investigations, surveillance and 
research. Grant said he knew about some of Mitnick's past problems. "He told me 
he had gone straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant said that while Mitnick was at the firm, he did a good job. He lived 
with another company official, Mark Kasden, a friend of Mitnick's father, Alan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in late September of that year, FBI agents showed up and asked to search 
Mitnick's office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit for another search at the same time, the FBI was 
conducting a computer and wire fraud investigation into computer hacking and 
unauthorized entry into Pacific Bell Telephone Co. computers. Mitnick was named 
as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI believed that Mitnick the "phone phreak" was back. According to the 
affidavit, Mitnick or others residing and working at three apartments and a 
Compton company had tapped into telephone and electronic communications to 
obtain passwords belonging to security investigators, tampered with the 
computers, and intercepted company voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also alleged that special calling features not then available to 
the public had been placed on Kasden's phone and were not being paid for. They 
included speed dialing and priority ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI declined to comment on their investigation, but Grant said he and 
Kasden believe Mitnick rigged the phones for himself while he was staying with 
Kasden. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant believes Mitnick is "probably one of the brightest individuals with a 
computer that ever set foot on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 After the search, Mitnick disappeared. Kasden said he later saw him once 
briefly at a gas station. "He said, 'Adios, I have problems I have to take care 
of.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Grant nor Kasden see him as destructive. "He's a gentle guy and 
nonviolent. He's never going to hurt anybody. But some of the stuff he does is 
irritating," said Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Concurring in that assessment are some people who have known him longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rubin, an attorney who once represented him, said Mitnick has never used 
his skills to enrich himself. When he was arrested in 1988, he was living in a 
modest Panorama City apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lewis De Payne, 35, who befriended Mitnick when both men were teen-agers, 
said his friend is often judged to be something he's not. "He's brash, but 
effective, and that causes some people some discomfort as far as rubbing them 
the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 De Payne also says people over-estimate Mitnick's computer wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
 But others insist his activities go beyond curiosity and pranksterism to 
serious crime, such as posing as a law enforcement officer to gain private 
information. The New York Times has reported that Mitnick is suspected of 
stealing software and data from half a dozen cellular phone manufacturers, 
compromising the security of the phone networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV has also requested a warrant for his arrest, claiming that in the fall 
of 1992 he began posing as a law enforcement officer to obtain sensitive DMV 
information, including driver's licenses and vehicle information and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would give a requesting officer's name and would basically use his 
identity and birth date," said Bill Madison, a DMV spokesman in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison believes Mitnick could have gotten the secret law enforcement PIN 
numbers he needed by tapping into DMV phone lines in Los Angeles and 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities got wind of the scam after a DMV technician became suspicious when 
a man, who identified himself as an investigator for the fraud division of the 
Los Angeles County Welfare Department, requested DMV information and supplied a 
fax number that the technician did not recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 The number was traced to a Studio City copy shop. Other fax numbers were then 
traced to copy shops in Sacramento and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators staked out the copy shop and watched Mitnick pick up the 
materials, Madison said. A chase ensued, but Mitnick got away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost had him," Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said he believes Mitnick may be using the information to change 
identities, to wreak havoc on other's lives or possibly for some type of 
monetary gain. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Mitnick allegedly gained access to a Bay Area man's records and 
used information in the file to try and change his health care provider so that 
he could benefit from the man's medical coverage. He also used the information 
to take on the identity of the man's dead son in order to obtain a phony 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very scary," Madison said. "You don't want him in your records."

MAN HELD IN ATTACK ON WOMAN, 81 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 81-year-old San Fernando woman allegedly stabbed by a transient she had 
befriended was in stable condition Saturday at a local hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Jim Shepherd, 32, on suspicion of stabbing the woman with a 
kitchen knife in the face, hands and stomach Friday after she let him in her 
home and attempted to prepare him a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's 82-year-old brother found her at the home they shared on Hagar 
Street just before 3 p.m. Friday. He told police Shepherd came to his law 
office with blood splattered on his shirt and said he had just killed "an enemy 
of God," police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's brother grew worried after she did not answer his telephone calls, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother and sister, whose names were not released, had been friends with 
the transient for the past few years, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd, who was arrested when he returned a second time to the law office, 
was booked for attempted murder and is being held on $500,000 bail. Police said 
he had a history of mental illness. An arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday.

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS

 Three candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 39th 
Congressional District. They are Democrat R.O. Davis of Buena Park, Libertarian 
Jack Dean of Fullerton and Republican Ed Royce, the incumbent, of Fullerton. 
Here's where they stand on four issues. Health Care: 
</P>
<P>
 Davis: "We must demand the security of health care insurance for every 
citizen; health care insurance that cannot be lost when we need it most. The 
president has put forth reasonable principles as guidelines. . . . Every 
citizen will benefit. Those that will pay slightly more will no longer need to 
fear being canceled or priced out of their insurance policy. A small increase 
in premiums is a prudent investment, providing true security." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean: Opposes Clinton health reform plan. "The only health care reforms that 
are likely to have a significant impact are those that draw on the strengths of 
the free market. The Libertarian Party has developed a comprehensive proposal 
for health care reform that would reduce health care costs while extending 
access to health care for all." The five-point plan includes establishing 
tax-exempt medical savings accounts similar to individual retirement accounts; 
making all health-care expenditures 100% tax deductible; deregulating the 
health care industry; replacing the Food and Drug Administration with 
"voluntary certification" by a private organization, and privatizing Medicare 
and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Royce: Opposes Clinton health reform plan but favors tort reform to reduce 
medical malpractice insurance premiums and hold down diagnostic costs. He also 
favors tax deductible medical savings accounts. "I support measures to 
guarantee that individuals with a pre-existing condition who have to change 
carriers would be charged no more for their new plan than the normal premium 
rate charged to all new customers, and to ensure everyone that their coverage 
cannot be denied in the future, even if they change jobs or move. Regulatory 
barriers should be eliminated so that small businesses can purchase health 
insurance through pools or tax-exempt trusts--increasing their bargaining power 
and dramatically reducing the cost of premiums." Education and Health Care 
Benefits for Illegal Immigrants: 
</P>
<P>
 Davis: "People illegally in this country should be deported. When a state or 
other jurisdiction refuses to participate with the federal government in 
located illegal aliens, the . . . jurisdiction assumes the financial 
responsibility for them. Every person residing in our country must receive 
humane treatment, which includes medical care and education." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean: "The Libertarian Party platform calls for ending tax subsidies for all 
citizens, legal or 'illegal'." 
</P>
<P>
 Royce: "Taxpayers can no longer be asked to bear the financial burden of 
supporting illegal immigrants. With the exception of emergency room care, I 
support a prohibition on tax dollars going to benefit those who are in this 
country illegally." Crime: 
</P>
<P>
 Davis: "Child molesters, rapists, and psychopaths must never be allowed to 
re-enter society after their first conviction. The court needs the power to 
order wealthy felons to pay the cost incurred for their prosecution and 
confinement as part of their restitution in order to lower taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean: "The government is failing to protect us from violent criminals, while 
squandering its resources on drug prohibition and other victimless offenses. 
The government pushes victims aside in the criminal justice system, and 
threatens to create new victims by disarming law-abiding Americans. Meanwhile, 
government welfare, education, tax and regulatory policies create a breeding 
ground for new criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Royce: Supported anti-crime bill approved by the House earlier this year that 
is now pending before a House-Senate conference committee. "I am working for 
tougher laws across the board, more police protection and more prison 
construction. Protecting people from crime is government's most important 
responsibility. It has to do a better job." El Toro Marine Corps Air Station: 
</P>
<P>
 Davis: "Converting the El Toro air base into an international airport will 
create a hub for Orange and San Diego counties. Building rapid light rail will 
tie the area together. This will create good jobs, while enhancing our quality 
of life and cleaning the air we breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean: "I believe the land should be put to its highest and best use, i.e., if 
a large corporation or a consortium of investors wishes to purchase the 
property for (a commercial airport) I have no objection. However, considering 
the size of the federal deficit, I do not believe the federal government can 
afford to give this property away." 
</P>
<P>
 Royce: "Converting El Toro to commercial use is a vital step in bringing new 
businesses and job opportunities to Orange County, especially as our local job 
base becomes more and more dependent on trade. It also makes sense from a 
long-range planning viewpoint, since our existing airport already operates at 
near capacity."

DRIVER MAKES SPLASH AT THEME PARK; ACCIDENTS: EMPLOYEE IS RESCUED AFTER HER CAR 
GOES INTO RED SEA ATTRACTION AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Where's Charlton Heston when you really need him? 
</P>
<P>
 The actor could have been a big help Saturday afternoon when a wrong-way 
Universal Studios Hollywood employee drove her car into the theme park's Red 
Sea attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman, who works in the studio's wardrobe department, was rescued 
unharmed from the middle of the lake about an hour later by Los Angeles County 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 As Moses in "The Ten Commandments," one of his most famous movie roles, Heston 
parted the waters of the mechanized "sea" on the studio's lot. Now, it's a 
popular attraction on the studio tour tram ride. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hapless wardrobe employee wasn't familiar with how it works, said Fire 
Capt. Rod Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got there after the lake had parted so a tram could go through," he said. 
"So all she saw was the path that's about as wide as a road, and she thought 
she could go through there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Pharaoh's soldiers believed the same things 3,000 years ago. They were wrong, 
and so was she. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tram exits the lake, it triggers a device that causes the parting waters 
to meet, Washington said. "She was trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Studio workers used underwater pumps to lower the water level to keep the 
woman's car from completely submerging, Firefighter John Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then an Urban Search and Rescue team from West Hollywood arrived, using ropes 
and harnesses to rescue the 32-year-old woman, whose name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her ankles got a little wet, but she was unhurt," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also wet was a tour guide who jumped from his tram and rushed to help save the 
woman. To the amusement of tour-takers, he slipped on moss at the water's edge 
and fell in. He was not injured and got out of the lake on his own, Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said he was stunned when firefighters got the rescue call about 
2:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it, but now I can understand how it happened," Washington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the young woman, who normally works during the week, is used to 
leaving by the studio's back gate at the east end of the lot. That gate exits 
onto Barham Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Barham gate was locked Saturday, forcing her to find another way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was going to attempt to exit on Lankershim at the west end of the 
studio," Washington said. "But apparently, she wasn't familiar with the tram 
ride."  
</P>
<P>
 Or the movie.

MAN SURRENDERS TO POLICE AFTER BARRICADING HIMSELF IN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old man who barricaded himself in his father's house early Saturday 
surrendered to police after officers lobbed a round of tear gas into the house, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the 15000 block of Harvest Street shortly before 1 a.m. 
when a man complained of trouble at the residence, said Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Jim Cansler.Once there, Cansler said, officers heard a single gunshot and the 
voice of a man shouting obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lee Parker, 60, then came out of the house and told police his son, 
Terry Parker, was on cocaine and threatening to kill himself, Cansler said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5:15 a.m., after police heard several more shots inside the residence and 
negotiations with Strategic Weapons and Tactics team officers failed to bring 
Parker out of the residence, authorities fired tear gas into the home, Cansler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker exited the house, "taunting the officers to come and get him, 
brandishing the handgun and threatening suicide," Cansler said.  
</P>
<P>
 At 5:35 a.m., Terry Parker surrendered to officers without incident. He is 
awaiting arraignment at the Van Nuys Jail on charges he brandished a handgun, 
Cansler said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries, Cansler said.

SMALL GIRL KILLED BY HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER IN WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were asking the public for help Saturday night in finding a hit-and-run 
driver who killed a small girl on 15th Street in front of an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, police identified the girl as 2-year-old Karen Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the accident occurred at 7:52 p.m. on 15th Street, between Monroe 
Lane and Newland Street, in an area that includes numerous apartments. Police 
had few leads Saturday night and appealed to the public for information that 
might assist investigators in apprehending the driver and locating the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described the car that hit the girl as a four-door older model, 
maroon in color, dirty and in poor condition. Lewis said police were not 
certain if the driver was male or female.

POLICE UNVEIL PLAQUE, BUST HONORING 3 FALLEN COLLEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The city's police union honored three fallen comrades Saturday, unveiling a 
memorial plaque and bust to one of them at its headquarters on North Sycamore 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Before more than 75 people, officials of the Santa Ana Police Officers Assn. 
unveiled the two-foot-tall bust of Cpl.Daniel Allan Hale, who died in a 1977 
shootout with two paroled convicts, said Sgt. Ken Ice. Hale was 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale was survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. Daniel Hale Jr., 20, 
who attended the ceremony, "looked so much like his dad, it was eerie," Ice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also dedicated a wall plaque containing the names of Hale and two 
other police officers who died in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Nelson A. Sasscer was shot to death in 1969 by a pedestrian whom he 
had stopped for questioning. Also honored was Edwin Jensen, a motorcycle 
officer who was killed in the early 1920s when he crashed while chasing a 
suspect, Ice said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both memorials were 16 years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hale was killed, a committee was formed to raise funds for the bust and 
plaque, but the project was sidetracked until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee last year commissioned sculptor Victor Riesau to create the bust 
and plaque. Riesau has also created a memorial to slain Sacramento law 
enforcement officers.

VOTE PAVES THE WAY FOR MEMORIAL; TRIBUTE: PANEL OKS CULTURAL HALL. CRASH 
VICTIM'S PARENTS SAY THE CENTER WILL FULFILL THE DREAM OF DAUGHTER TO 'HELP THE 
CHILDREN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Out of the black ashes of the fiery plane crash that killed their 17-year-old 
daughter, a Lancaster physician and his wife wanted to pull something positive. 
They decided to use money from her death settlement to build a cultural hall in 
her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 They thought their dream was dashed last month when the Lancaster Planning 
Commission denied permission for the project after neighbors complained about 
potential noise and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, the Lancaster City Council unanimously overturned that 
decision. For Thillaiampalam Srijaerajah and his wife, Sita, the vote means 
they can put the money from a tragic accident into a center for music and dance 
lessons, community gatherings and religious meditation -- all in the name of 
their daughter Krishani. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were thinking right from the start that we wanted to do something for the 
community," said Sita. "This is for the children, mainly. It's good for them to 
spend their time with dancing and music." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, by building this center, the couple believe they will fulfill their 
daughter's dream of doing something to make the world a better place. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 16, in an essay written 10 months before the February, 1991, plane 
crash, Krishani said: "I don't want to live the rest of my life knowing that I 
did not do anything to help the children. I want to leave a mark, a legacy, 
after I die, which is that I helped the next generation in some way become the 
best generation so far created." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family members say that, despite her youth, Krishani was deeply 
concerned about social issues and world conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 She served as a volunteer in the emergency room at Antelope Valley Hospital 
and was determined to become a pediatrician. She was angry when the Persian 
Gulf War erupted because she feared that many innocent children would be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter was an extraordinary human being," said her father, who is known 
to his patients and friends as Dr. Sri. "She was a selfless, dedicated person. 
She always respected others. She never said a bad word about anybody. If she 
got mad, she'd go in her room and cry for a little bit and come out smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Her grades placed her among the top students at Paraclete High School in 
Lancaster, and she was a talented pianist who performed at several conferences 
for music teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Krishani was a voracious reader, which led to one of the few bad habits her 
parents can recall: She sometimes brought a book to the table and continued 
reading during a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 In an October, 1990, school essay, she wrote: "From childhood I was termed as 
'quietly aggressive' and 'silently intelligent.' I was brought up to do nothing 
short of success." 
</P>
<P>
 Her academic counselor at Paraclete, Judy Sterr Steinberg, recalls that 
Krishani was "very bright, very persistent. She was very goal-oriented. She was 
applying to the best schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the college campuses on Krishani's list was Mount St. Mary's College in 
Los Angeles, a small Catholic women's school with a strong premedical program. 
She arranged to fly from Palmdale to Los Angeles on Feb. 1, 1991, aboard a 
small commuter plane for interviews with the Mount St. Mary's faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents did not join her because they had to fly to a relative's wedding 
in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Krishani's younger sister, Dilani, questioned the wisdom of three family 
members taking airline trips at the same time, her mother recalls. At first, 
Krishani scoffed at the notion. But later she removed a religious medal she had 
worn around her neck for the previous two years and put it in her mother's bag, 
apparently to protect her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need this anymore," Sita Srijaerajah remembers Krishani saying. "God 
will protect me." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, after visiting the college, Krishani boarded the 19-seat SkyWest 
Flight 5569 to return to Palmdale. That evening, in an accident that raised 
grave questions about safety conditions at Los Angeles International Airport, a 
USAir Boeing 737 arriving from Columbus, Ohio, slammed into the SkyWest plane 
on the runway, killing all 12 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Krishani's parents quickly returned home. Hundreds of friends and relatives 
attended her funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, her parents continue to grieve. "For us, it never dies," 
Krishani's father said. "It's like yesterday for us. We've relived the 
experience a hundred times." 
</P>
<P>
 Krishani's parents received just over $500,000 to settle a claim they filed 
against a federal agency in connection with her death. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tribute to their daughter, the Srijaerajahs, who are natives of Sri 
Lanka, decided to use the money to build a meeting and meditation place for the 
Antelope Valley's small Sri Lankan community. Members of this group now must 
gather in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The family purchased a 2.3-acre parcel on 25th Street West between avenues K-4 
and K-8. The proposed construction called for a 13,500-square-foot cultural 
hall for classes and social gatherings and a 1,500-square-foot meditation hall 
for the spiritual chanting practiced in the Hindu religion. 
</P>
<P>
 But on June 13, in a 3-2 vote, the Lancaster Planning Commission rejected the 
project, saying it would disrupt a residential area and increase traffic -- 
objections raised by several people living near the site. City zoning laws 
allow houses of worship in residential areas, but only with a permit that the 
commission refused to grant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thillaiampalam Srijaerajah said he was shocked and considered abandoning the 
project. "I'm here throwing half a million dollars into the community," he 
said, "and they didn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
 But several friends urged him to appeal. "I said that it was a fitting tribute 
to Krishani," recalled Sri Ramanathan, a family friend. "I felt that, deep in 
my heart, if the Planning Commission understood what the project was really all 
about, they would have approved it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the City Council meeting Tuesday, Krishani's father explained that the 
cultural hall would not be restricted to any ethnic or religious group and 
could be rented by a range of community organizations. He also agreed to 
surround the project with thick landscaping to decrease the noise impact on 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief discussion, the council overturned the Planning Commission's 
decision, allowing construction to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is a compatible use in a residential area," Councilman George 
Runner said at the meeting. "I don't think the traffic is an issue at all. . . 
. I think this is an important contribution to the community, and it needs to 
be encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal is wonderful," added Councilman Michael Singer. "That's an 
appropriate memorial to his daughter."

LONG BEACH JAZZ BIRDLAND WEST CLUB UP FOR SALE; ENTERTAINMENT: THE OWNER, A 
MUSICIAN HIMSELF, CITES ECONOMIC WOES, THE INCREASING COST OF BOOKING QUALITY 
PERFORMERS AND THE HEAVY DEMANDS OF THE JOB.

<P>
 After nearly eight years of hosting jazz greats such as Les McCann and Art 
Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Birdland West owner Al Williams is putting his 
Long Beach nightclub up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Williams filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal 
Bankruptcy Act to reorganize his debt. Then last month, Williams said, he 
decided to sell the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said his club, like many local businesses, is a victim of the poor 
economy. Recently, ticket sales have dropped and the cost of booking well-known 
bands has risen. Despite the drop in sales, Williams said he has declined to 
lower ticket prices, which average about $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see enough people to hire the acts I wanted to hire," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a 51-year-old drummer, said he is also finding the task of running 
the club too demanding. He said he wants to focus on playing with his own band, 
the Jazz Society, once the sale is complete. He declined to discuss possible 
buyers but said he hopes to find one who will maintain the club's jazz 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdland West is one of the few clubs in the Los Angeles area to offer jazz 
exclusively. Others include the Catalina Bar & Grill in Hollywood and The 
Strand in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When he opened Birdland West in 1986, Williams said he was banking on Long 
Beach's central location to draw jazz lovers from Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. The club has drawn a crowd from outside the city as well as a 
faithful following of local customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That place was like 'Cheers' before the economy got bad," Long Beach 
Councilman Ray Grabinski said, referring to the popular television-show bar 
with a loyal local clientele. "Before Al opened up Birdland, downtown didn't 
have many events at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Jones, director of Downtown Long Beach Associates, a group of downtown 
merchants, said his group and city officials are helping Williams find a buyer 
who will keep the club open.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams ran the Jazz Safari club near the Queen Mary for 10 years before 
losing his lease in 1986. The same year, he remodeled the second story of the 
historic Bradley building at Pine Avenue and Broadway to open Birdland West.

THE INDOOR GARDENER; TIPS ON KEEPING HOUSEPLANTS HEALTHY, HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rapp is a Los Angeles free-lance writer 
who, as Mr. Mother Earth, has written several best-selling books on indoor 
gardening. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Houseplants make a beautiful, and inexpensive, decorative accent, adding color 
and warmth to virtually any room in your home or apartment. Not only that, 
houseplants help purify the air round you, adding a health benefit as well. And 
the best news is: Anybody can grow houseplants. You are just as capable of 
having a lush, verdant indoor "plant-ation" as a certified botanist, as long as 
you're willing to devote the barest amount of time to seeing that your plants 
get the proper amount of light, water, humidity, food and love. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 26 tips that I guarantee will help keep your houseplants happy and 
healthy for years to come: BUYING A PLANT 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Be sure you buy an indoor plant. Over the past couple of hundred years, 
professional horticulturists and just plain plant fanciers have discovered and 
isolated, mostly through trial and error, the plants that will thrive in a pot 
in your house or apartment. The best way to ensure the plant you buy is a 
certified "indoor plant" is to shop at a reputable nursery, garden center or 
flower shop where you can put your trust in the staff. Plants sold at 
supermarkets and discount stores are most likely indoor plants, especially if 
they're potted in clay or terra-cotta containers. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- If you travel a lot or if you're just too busy to devote a lot of time to 
plant care, stick to a hassle-free plant. Among the best are philodendron, 
pothos, Chinese evergreen, dracaena, cactus, spathiphyllum, palms, ficus, 
dieffenbachia or sanseveiria. These plants need only northern or eastern 
sunlight, water when their soil is dry, a weekly misting and a monthly feeding. 
Flowering plants, delicate, fern-like plants and plants with gaudy foliage 
usually will not survive indoors without ideal growing conditions and lots of 
TLC. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Know the name of the plant you're buying and what kind of growing 
conditions it requires. For instance, there are only a few plants that will do 
well in dark corners, such as those listed above. If you haven't got a bright 
sunny spot, stay away from flowering plants and plants with colorful leaves. 
Tell your plant purveyor about the light conditions where you want to put your 
plant. He or she will advise you which plants will be best suited to those 
conditions. PROPER WATERING 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Be a cautious waterer -- don't overdo it. More plants die from 
overwatering than any other cause. A good general rule is water your plants 
only when their soil is dry to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Water your plants with water at room temperature. Water that's too hot or 
too cold can shock the plant's delicate root system. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Cover the top of the soil with a thin layer of purified charcoal. This 
will filter out any impurities in the water and will help freshen the air. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Make sure there is a drainage hole in the bottom of your plant's 
container. If you want to repot a plant to a container with no drainage hole, 
be sure to put a layer of pebbles on the bottom of the container to collect 
excess water before adding potting mix. Wet roots rot and the plant will die. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Transplant your plants from plastic to terra-cotta pots. The terra-cotta, 
or clay, pots are porous and they "breathe," ensuring more oxygen for the roots 
and allowing excess water to escape, thus helping to avoid overwatering. KEEP 
UP THE HUMIDITY 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- If possible, keep an inexpensive humidifier in every room where you have 
lots of plants. Dry heat in winter and air conditioning in summer rob much of 
the humidity from our houses and apartments, and tropical plants need humidity 
to ensure maximum health. Come to think of it, so do we. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Spray your plants with a fine mist of water every day. A daily misting 
helps keep them clean and will go a long way toward preventing brown tips. 
</P>
<P>
 11 -- For extra humidity, group your plants together if it's aesthetically 
pleasing. Plants "transpire," giving off humidity for each other to absorb. 
</P>
<P>
 12 -- Keep your plants on a "dry well." This can be a saucer or tray filled 
first with pebbles and then with water. The water will evaporate upward and 
keep the humidity level higher around the plant. You'll have to add water to 
the well a couple of times a week. KEEP YOUR PLANTS WELL FED 
</P>
<P>
 13 -- Feed your plants regularly. Use a good liquid houseplant food once a 
week during the spring and summer and once a month during the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
 14 -- Don't feed your plants "table scraps." Some plants might benefit from 
coffee grounds, egg shells, etc., but others will suffer, so it's best to stick 
to the commercial houseplant foods. 
</P>
<P>
 15 -- Never feed a sick plant. No matter what the plant may be suffering from 
-- overwatering, underwatering, not enough light, not enough humidity, whatever 
-- while nursing it back to health don't add any chemical matter to the soil. 
This can weaken the already struggling root system. GENERAL TIPS 
</P>
<P>
 16 -- Rotate your plants so that each side gets equal exposure to the sun. 
This keeps the plants from leaning in one direction or another. 
</P>
<P>
 17 -- Keep your plants clean. Don't polish the leaves with oil or mayonnaise 
-- this clogs the breathing cells and may kill the plant. Simply sponge the 
leaves with a solution of one part dish-soap to 20 parts water and then spray 
off with clear water. 
</P>
<P>
 18 -- Water your African violets from below. Watering them directly into the 
soil can rot the crown. Instead, as soon as the soil begins to dry out, place 
your violet in about an inch of water in a saucer or bowl. The violet will 
"drink" the water through the holes in the bottom of the pot. It's a good idea 
to add a couple of drops of liquid plant food to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 19 -- To get poinsettias to "re-bloom": Prune them back when the red bracts 
(flowers) fall off in late winter or early spring, nurture them in a bright 
spot through spring and summer, then starting in mid-October give them 12 hours 
of darkness (as in a closet) every night for about 8 weeks until the red bracts 
reappear. 
</P>
<P>
 20 -- During the summer, take your more temperamental plants outside and put 
them in a sheltered, shady spot. There they'll experience ideal growing 
conditions for a couple of months. They may have a little trouble readjusting 
when you bring them back indoors, but they'll benefit from the vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 21 -- Check your plants regularly for pests -- mealybug, scale, aphids, 
whitefly, etc. Keep a bottle of organic insecticidal soap on hand. Early 
detection is your best hope to control the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 22 -- Use only store-bought, sterilized potting mix for your houseplants. 
Garden soil is too thick. Houseplants need a nice, airy soil, and who knows 
what pests lurk in ordinary loam? 
</P>
<P>
 23 -- Prune or cut back your hanging and vining plants frequently. This 
process encourages new and bushier growth. Creeping Charley and wandering Jew 
are among the more common plants that should be cut back as soon as they begin 
to turn brown and straggly. 
</P>
<P>
 24 -- If your plant just sits there doing nothing, and you want it to grow, 
repot it. Transplanting is a much-feared operation, but there's no need to be 
afraid. Just get a new pot two inches larger in diameter than the old one; fill 
it halfway with fresh potting mix; remove the plant from its old pot and set it 
in the new one; add soil until the plant is snug in the new pot; water 
thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 25 -- Rake the top of your plants' soil every couple of months with a fork or 
the little indoor gardening tool made for that purpose. Aerating the soil in 
this manner keeps the soil loose and prevents it from caking. Plants need air 
to get to the root system to do their best. 
</P>
<P>
 26 -- Play music for your plants and talk to them. Don't scoff. I knew a 
botanist who did an experiment: He put three sets of identical plants into 
three separate rooms with identical growing conditions. In the first room he 
played only rock music and the plants thrived; in the second room he played 
only classical music and the plants thrived. In the third room he played only 
the news and the plants died.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; LIFE ON THE TRAIL: PARALYSIS TO 
PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There comes a point in many a journey when the traveler has to decide whether 
it is better to go on or simply curl up and die by the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dallas, that monument to bad taste that lies shimmering in the heat and 
haze of the Texas wasteland, it occurred to me that the curling-up option 
seemed the best bet. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock on the bedside table said 4:20 a.m. The congealed remains of last 
night's room service pizza, most of it uneaten, lay nearby, testimony to yet 
another unfortunate choice in meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep was something desperately needed but not likely to be achieved. At 4:30 
a.m., the telephone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good morning. This is your wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 Wake-up, hell. I hadn't been to sleep for fear that the call would not arrive, 
as had happened several weeks -- or was it lifetimes? -- ago in Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5:15 a.m., with the sky still an inky black and the temperature already 
approaching 80 degrees, I stumbled out of the hotel, into a cab and took off 
for Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But as bleak as the day was starting out, all was not lost. The cabdriver 
turned out to be Nigerian and had very definite opinions on the Super Eagles' 
chances against Italy in the next day's game 1,552 miles away in Foxboro, 
Mass., which is where I was going. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had some interesting thoughts about the previous day's game between 
Sweden and Saudi Arabia at the Cotton Bowl, which is where I had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to life on the World Cup '94 trail. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not about teams or players. Nor is it about coaches or referees, or 
even games. Rather, it is a gathering of personal impressions on the impact 
World Cup '94 has had on America in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a collection of postcards hurriedly scribbled and sent home from various 
stops during a 13,480-mile odyssey on the road to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 In another week, that journey will be over and so will the tournament. The 
national teams of 24 countries will have played 52 matches in nine U.S. cities 
over the course of 31 days. Those are the bare statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the postcards tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 LOS ANGELES: The flags and banners that adorn downtown streets and the roads 
around LAX will soon become a familiar sight. The same decorations, hundreds of 
them, have been draped on poles from Palo Alto to Orlando. What is going to 
happen to them once the World Cup is over? Will they be discarded, given to the 
volunteers, sold for charity, sold for profit? Who knows? And by the way, how 
long are those World Cup murals alongside the freeways going to last? 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO: This is a real city, probably the finest in America after San 
Francisco. And it has caught World Cup fever. Almost every store and restaurant 
along classy Michigan Avenue sports some sort of tournament-related 
paraphernalia, even if it's only a soccer ball or two in the window. The 
Chicago Tribune plays the World Cup big every day. Newsstands and bookstores 
are bulging with international newspapers and magazines filled with soccer 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA's brass has installed itself in a waterfront hotel, but the interest is 
not so much in the political wrangling among soccer's leaders as it is in the 
fight going on for the World Cup 2002 bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and South Korea have set up adjoining hospitality suites and are going 
toe to toe in an effort to win support for their respective bids. Both 
countries are seeking to stage the tournament and the intense rivalry will 
continue until a decision is announced in 1996. Japan has the edge, but not by 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlight of the opening ceremony at Soldier Field: Singer Diana Ross trying 
to hit an open net from 10 yards and missing completely. She could play for 
Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 PONTIAC, Mich.: It's difficult to know what's more impressive, the incredibly 
enormous Swiss flag hanging from two construction cranes outside the Silverdome 
or the Silverdome itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, amid sauna-like conditions, Teofilo Cubillas is hurrying through the 
crowd. Only in the United States can a legitimate World Cup star -- he played 
striker for Peru in Mexico in 1970 and in Argentina in 1978 -- pass unnoticed 
and unheralded. You want to shout, "Do you know who this is?" But Cubillas is 
not concerned. He came to see the United States play Switzerland, not to sign 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Moose Preserve Bar and Grill in nearby Bloomfield has promised to 
show the day's second game, between Colombia and Romania, on its big-screen TV. 
Its menu bids us welcome: 
</P>
<P>
 "The featured wines this month are inspired by the World Cup Soccer Games 
(sic). They will draw people from all over the world to our city. We hope that 
this will be just one of many events that we will host in the years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 That's unlikely unless the Moose Preserve folk move their tables farther away 
from the big screen. That astonishing free kick goal by Romania's Gheorghe Hagi 
had to elude not only the Colombian defense and goalkeeper but three or four 
diners, several beer bottles and a salt and pepper set before hitting the back 
of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 And the picture was fuzzy too. 
</P>
<P>
 WASHINGTON: The media shuttle has not appeared. The volunteer is more 
interested in her novel than the bus schedule. The Metro is the only option. 
It's a good one. Overflowing with fans from Mexico and Norway, it's an E-ticket 
ride, complete with sound effects. "Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole!"  
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO: You can't see it as you drive into the city from O'Hare, but it's in 
plain sight when you drive back to the airport: An unknown business has painted 
an enormous Brazilian flag on one of its exterior walls. It is at least three 
stories tall. And Brazil's not even playing here. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, another sight catches the eye. An insurance company has kept the 
lights on in 118 strategically selected windows over 20 floors of its 
skyscraper to beam a corporate World Cup welcome message to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.: New Jersey has been the butt of jokes since time 
immemorial. Newark Airport proves to be a good indication why. Construction 
chaos. Delayed flights. Nonexistent manners. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind, it is soon left behind as I head for my hotel at 1:30 a.m. 
Unfortunately, the hotel, too, is soon left behind. Turns out I went to the 
wrong one. The World Cup road is beginning to wear exceeding thin. Another cab, 
another hotel, another night with very little sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Giants Stadium cheers me up. The Meadowlands has done the tournament proud, as 
have each of the other eight stadiums being used. All have been boldly and 
colorfully decorated with World Cup designs and logos. A job well done. 
</P>
<P>
 ORLANDO, Fla.: A two-hour delay on the runway at Newark (where else?) makes 
Florida seem like paradise when I finally arrive sometime after midnight. It 
isn't, but it seems like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The police presence here is more evident than anywhere else and the cops are 
not smiling. It's a bit disconcerting to enter the media work area and be 
greeted by a snarling police dog and its handler, both of them ugly. Or to be 
searched not only on the way in but also on the way out of the Florida Citrus 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this doesn't quite jibe with the Mickey Mouse postcards on sale at the 
hotel, featuring the round-eared rodent kicking a soccer ball. Then again, 
perhaps it does. 
</P>
<P>
 DALLAS: The taxi ride from DFW into the city takes you past an unattractive 
dome on the right side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the Cowboys play," the American cabbie beams proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the constant travel has left me in a sour mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go see them when they start playing soccer," I reply. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't say another word the rest of the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, if the World Cup had to use Dallas as a venue, wouldn't it have 
been better to play in a stadium where pillars don't block the view? 
</P>
<P>
 EAST RUTHERFORD: Newark is even worse the second time around. Even the 
postcards are boring. 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO: If Major League Soccer really wants to build a mailing list of 
potential fans, it could do worse than to contact every cabbie in the country 
(except the guy in Dallas). 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the one taking me to Soldier Field is from Ethiopia, and he tells me 
that although he can't afford the time or money to actually attend any of the 
games, he is taping them all on his VCR at home and enjoying them at night. 
</P>
<P>
 DALLAS: Before the kickoff of the Sweden-Saudi Arabia game, I bump into 
another former star making his way anonymously through the crowd. Carlos 
Alberto was captain of Brazil's 1970 World Cup-winning team and later played 
for the New York Cosmos and the California Surf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cotton Bowl pillars are in his way too. 
</P>
<P>
 Something nice about Dallas: One bright teacher has had his or her 
grade-school pupils paint World Cup pictures. The watercolors adorn one section 
of the International Broadcast Center. They are far more appealing than any of 
the souvenirs on sale nearby, including the boxed set of 24 World Cup team 
metal badges at $125. 
</P>
<P>
 BOSTON: The sports bar and restaurant in the lobby of my hotel has the 
Netherlands-Ireland game showing on its two big screens and on every other TV 
set in the place. The bar is not full, but everyone is watching intently, 
including the maitre d'. 
</P>
<P>
 He turns out to be from Ireland and has a vested interest in the result. But 
he takes the loss in good stride and makes an interesting observation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Welsh, the Scottish and even the English have been backing our lads," he 
says, surprised and pleased at the thought that stereotypes are being broken. 
Soccer can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the same bar is packed for the USA-Brazil game. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxboro Stadium is about a 45-minute drive from civilization as we know it, 
and once near the stadium the freeway signs begin displaying the soccer ball 
logo that is a feature in all nine World Cup cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the press tent, a familiar figure looms. Diego Lucero is a living legend. 
Now 93, the Argentine-born Lucero is the only person on earth to have been to 
every World Cup tournament, starting in Uruguay in 1930. A former journalist, 
he now is one of FIFA's honored guests. 
</P>
<P>
 We exchange a few words and I move on. Later, at Logan International Airport, 
I buy a unique cap. Manufactured before the qualifying rounds were completed, 
it celebrates France's participation in World Cup '94. France didn't make it 
and I have a collector's item. 
</P>
<P>
 But France will be the World Cup host in 1998. I wonder if Lucero will be 
there. I hope he is. 
</P>
<P>
 His World Cup odyssey has been a great deal longer than mine and surely the 
Rose Bowl will not be its final destination.

</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the Dallas venue will remember our failures: the blight around the 
aging Cotton Bowl, the empty seats inside, the construction-hampered traffic 
flow that turned game days into nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a month, in nine locations, the world has applauded our wonders, 
cringed at our bruises, and, in some places, even felt our embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did we do? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, we shined. Other times, we stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we yelled too much, pushed too much. When the rest of the world was 
rushing joyfully out of a subway or dancing through an alley, often we put up 
our dukes and played the frightened bullies. 
</P>
<P>
 But we also smiled a lot, and listened a lot, and sometimes accepted that 
which we did not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those hourlong postgame fan celebrations that forced stadium police to 
work overtime. We eventually realized something could not be so bad if it made 
so many people so happy. 
</P>
<P>
 We hollered and hugged, we were impatient and helpful. In other words, we were 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we thrilled. But other times, we disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the New York venue will remember what Dublin sales representative 
Gerry Taylor remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor learned on the first weekend that despite slick World Cup 
advertisements, New York was not New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Boston was not Boston, but Foxboro. And Detroit was not Detroit, but 
Pontiac. And Los Angeles was Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 And New York was actually a smelly, industrial area in northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor left his Manhattan room early one Saturday morning, four hours before 
the opener between Italy and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrapped himself in an Irish flag and planned on a making a pregame stop in 
a pub next door to Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do this all the time in Dublin," he said. "Pop a few Guinness at the pub, 
talk to other fans, get ready for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 But upon arriving in East Rutherford, N.J., he realized the only thing he 
could drink next door to the stadium was toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't a pub in sight. Or a store. Or a house. Or even a street that 
wasn't an expressway. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the next three hours sitting with two friends on a curb, cursing his 
introduction to sports in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are all stadiums like this, away from cities, in the middle of nothing?" he 
asked. "Seems to me it must be hard to have good sports in places like this, 
isn't it? We are let down." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing we can assure him, and others as disillusioned as Taylor, is it 
wasn't because we didn't try. 
</P>
<P>
 Rating the 1994 World Cup venues, best and worst of show: CHICAGO 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: We knew this would be a great spot from the moment we first bit into 
something called "the Belly Buster," sold at a hot dog stand near Soldier 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingredients: Polish beef dog, relish, ketchup, mustard, onions and jalapeno 
peppers. It lived up to its billing. Trust us. 
</P>
<P>
 And so did everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldier Field is the perfect location for an international event, being just a 
short cab ride from one of America's great downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan Avenue has been buzzing for a month, what with German tourists in 
Bermuda shorts buying black patent leather shoes to accompany their white 
socks. At night, horse-drawn carriages fought with taxis for street space in 
some of the best action since Ben Hur. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: The only people who didn't enjoy themselves here were the Greeks, 
both the national soccer players and the large Chicago-area community that 
gathered to watch them one Sunday morning against Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece lost that game, 4-0. In the process, the teams drove Greek fans so 
crazy they started seeing things. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the game, a Greek tossed a smoke bomb on the field, later 
claiming it was tradition to do so after his team scored. 
</P>
<P>
 His team is back in Athens, and it still hasn't scored. 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: The World Cup's kind of town, Chicago is. Not only were the 
streets brimming with international flavor, the shuttle system to Soldier Field 
was so efficient that cabbies complained about not getting enough chances to 
rip people off. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's a venue. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: During a bachelor party held on the 36th floor of a 
prominent local hotel, somebody poured beer down the elevator shaft. By 
morning, the ale had dripped to ground floor and short-circuited the electrical 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotel guests -- some checking out with reams of World Cup-related luggage 
-- were forced to carry everything down 20 flights of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the bottom, they had to tip valet-parking drivers for walking 10 steps 
to pick up their cars. BOSTON 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: We marveled not at a city's effect upon a World Cup, but vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened to a town divided along ethnic lines has been remarkable," 
said E.J. Kahn of the Boston Host Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 By order of Mayor Tom Menino, the historic City Hall area was turned over to 
foreigners of every imaginable color and tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-timers who never thought they would see an African soccer team playing at 
the home of the New England Patriots also never thought they would see people 
dancing on their cobblestone streets in tribal costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were particularly worried the night after Argentina had defeated Greece 
in a first-round game. While the Greeks partied in front of City Hall, the 
Argentines celebrated eight blocks away in Copley Square. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiestas drew closer and closer until five Argentine fans wearing 
blue-and-white uniform shorts stood directly behind a dozen Greeks dancing in a 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as security guards prepared to move in, the circle slowly opened, and the 
Greeks motioned for the Argentines to join them. The Argentines did. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardened city sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: Many fans apparently didn't realize that the game would be played 
about 45 minutes south of Boston in the desolate suburb of Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody knew that once they arrived at the stadium, in a forested area 
where parking availability seemed unlimited, parking spaces would cost $20 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors got even with the World Cup Organizing Committee, though, by leaving 
their hotels in Boston and staying closer to the stadium in places such as 
Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Our smallest state as a World Cup host? Not quite what organizers had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: The Northeast may have tried harder than any other area, and it 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The normally reserved Bostonians, ranked 28th out of 36 U.S. city residents in 
a recent survey rating kindness to strangers, discovered warmth and tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 When dozens of Irish tourists were swindled out of tickets, Bostonians found 
them more. When foreigners didn't understand those distinct accents, Bostonians 
spoke more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: For an hour after Argentina's victory over Greece, more 
than a hundred Argentine fans remained at Foxboro Stadium, dancing and singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Police politely asked them to leave their seats, but the group only moved as 
far as the lower concourse. Thirty minutes later, police finally escorted them 
down the concourse and out the front gates, where they continued to party. 
</P>
<P>
 Was the game that exciting? Well, yes and no. With this stadium being 20 miles 
from the nearest decent-sized city, they had nowhere else to go. DALLAS 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: From the World Cup volunteers to city cab drivers, we appreciated the 
people. Amid bleak surroundings and uncomfortable temperatures, they provided 
the venue with some badly needed touches of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 One hero was Laura Addington, a schoolteacher from Louisiana. She served as an 
interpreter for everyone. Well, at least everyone who spoke English, French, 
Spanish, Italian, German or Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 Other stars were the African taxi drivers. They knew the roads, and they knew 
soccer, which is the only reason we were able to find Maradona during rush 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: Some nights were almost cool enough to hold a sporting event. Yet 
most of the games were held in the blazing afternoon or early evening sun to 
accommodate European television. 
</P>
<P>
 Those brave enough to attend games suffered through stifling heat. Don't buy 
those happy expressions you saw on ESPN. It was torture. 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: Dallas is a Cowboy town. And not the Germans, Argentines or any 
of the soccer fanatics who came through here changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 With poor attendance and a distinct lack of any electricity other than that 
generated by the Cowboys' new set of uniforms, this proves there are about a 
thousand better places in this country to hold an international event. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Dallas is a bad place -- it's merely the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 We have learned that events such as the World Cup require diversity of thought 
and appreciation of differences. Dallas is just too danged American for any of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 What Dallas' failure here portends for the 1996 Olympics in another southern 
town called Atlanta, well, that's for another story. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: By some estimates, the World Cup games here were 
outdrawn even by the demolition of the Cotton Exchange building downtown one 
Saturday morning. But at least at the soccer games, nobody was treated for 
smoke inhalation. NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: With the melting pot of New York City nearby, this was the only truly 
international venue. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium rocked with the sounds, colors and even smells of those countries 
competing. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for its location in New Jersey, Giants Stadium was also the perfect 
World Cup facility, with a beautiful field and gleaming facilities that had 
foreigners gawking. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: The only Cup fever to hit New York City involved the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was because of the Rangers. Or Knicks. Or Gay Games. It certainly 
wasn't the Yankees, whose attendance was routinely tripled by the World Cup 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was because every day in New York City feels like an international 
festival. Or maybe it was because New York City simply didn't have the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, the city that doesn't sleep also didn't care. It was interesting to 
drive to the stadium listening to New York City sports-talk radio hosts rip 
soccer, then arrive to discover mile-long lines at the front gates. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey license plates, all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: Organizers could save tourists and taxi fare by dropping all 
pretenses that the game is being played in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of this venue proves it is time to start celebrating the ethnic 
charms and splendid facilities of northern New Jersey . . . and leave New York 
to worry about the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: The location for the World Cup host committee in this 
country's largest city? New Brunswick, N.J., 90 minutes from Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 The location of these New Jersey-played games as listed on commemorative 
postal stamps? New York. DETROIT 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: Do not underestimate the accomplishment of organizers who ran the 
Detroit venue by avoiding all traces of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Games were staged an hour's drive north in the suburb of Pontiac, a bedroom 
community dominated by large front lawns and strip malls. If Detroit street 
gangs possess missiles that can fly that far, we didn't see them. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue MVP (Most Valuable Professor) was Trey Rogers, the god of sod. The 
assistant prof of turf-grass science at Michigan State actually made grass grow 
inside the Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of experiments, at a cost of $2.4 million, the indoor stuff 
held up admirably and was hailed by all but the most serious allergy sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: Much like East Rutherford and Foxboro, there was no there there. The 
venue lacked big-city energy and a pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets emptied at 10 p.m. After night games, if you hadn't paid someone 
to hold a spot in line at Herschel's Deli, the happening spot was a Taco Bell 
drive-through. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, after a game in the non-air-conditioned Silverdome, all anybody 
wanted to do was lie down in a nice comfortable meat locker. 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: Smiling faces, helpful people, but mostly sweat. Three-alarm, 
two-shirt sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: After the June 24 game between Brazil and Sweden, a 
thunderstorm passed directly over the media tent as hundreds of journalists 
were filing their stories. The thunder was deafening and the tent shook as if 
it were going to break. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning threatened to knock out the power. The lights flickered, World Cup 
officials implored reporters to save their files or risk losing them. 
</P>
<P>
 This scene was repeated at media and hospitality tents in most of the venues. 
But aside from the Mexican team, nothing in the tournament has collapsed. 
WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: We never thought we'd say this, but we liked the subways. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue line, which stopped three blocks from RFK stadium, was a 
shoulder-to-shoulder mass of international passion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch fans made their mark by pounding on the ceilings. The Swiss, by 
chanting through the underground terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans demonstrated their presence with songs, singing loud even though 
they could barely breathe while crushed in overloaded cars during the final 10 
minutes of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all underground, but it was true democracy, rare even for our nation's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: Everything was wonderful until you actually walked inside RFK. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium is falling apart. The Mexican fans literally caused it to rock 
with their constant bouncing during Mexico's emotional tie with Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium security officials were surly and overbearing. Maybe it was those 
horrible purple berets that made them so mad. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium media-tent volunteers, mostly of college age, were the worst. This 
would be of no interest to the public, except many worldwide impressions of 
this country are created by foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 And those foreign journalists were treated horribly. Little attempt was made 
to understand or deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets were refused with no explanation given. Attempts to talk with media 
coordinators were denied. Questions about the facility were greeted with 
shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Translators working player interviews refused to even offer translated quotes 
until they had been typed and apparently approved by supervisors, which often 
took two or three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 When one Middle Eastern journalist complained about discrimination, one 
college girl working as a volunteer laughed in his face and replied, "I don't 
think so." 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: Sports organizers beware. Any further events staged here should 
not involve any local volunteers or officials from this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a wonderful city, and as our capital, it should be the one of the 
first places promoters go for big events. But now we wonder if haughty 
attitudes and low-rent facilities haven't kept the big games away. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: A local activist hung a "Save Bosnia" sign in the stands 
during the opening game here between Mexico and Norway. It was taken down by 
local officials. He sued for the right to display it. He won. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the guy wanted to rub it in, but visible the next game were two "Save 
Bosnia" signs. SAN FRANCISCO-PALO ALTO 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: We love Los Gatos. This mountain town of 28,000 near San Jose has 
adopted -- and been adopted by -- the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brazil's games at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, Los Gatos became Little 
Rio, complete with samba music, incessant drumbeats and conga lines through 
Town Plaza Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very exciting," local resident Judy VanKampen said. "It is totally 
different than what you normally see in Los Gatos, which is people walking down 
the street with dogs and strollers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though crowds were lively, they were orderly. Some of the women might 
have strained the city's public decency codes with their skimpy bikinis, but 
city officials, to their credit, looked the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure they did. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: The whining of Palo Alto politicians because World Cup organizers 
identified the venue as San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless we are missing something, nobody has written a song called, "I Left 
My Heart in Palo Alto." 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: Of all the venues, Stanford University was the worst in 
creating obstacles for World Cup organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials were in position to drive a hard bargain because FIFA, 
soccer's organizing body, wanted a presence in San Francisco but did not want 
to use Candlestick Park because of its smaller size. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Stanford Stadium is by far the least modern of the venues. Even though 
some improvements were made, World Cup organizers did not get all of their 
demands met. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those academics learned that the World Cup is just the type of event that 
educational institutions should be encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 The excellent soccer is the least of its legacies. Teams from four continents 
played here, and the visitors who followed those teams to Palo Alto left 
something of themselves behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the merchants, it was not money. They were disappointed in 
their take. 
</P>
<P>
 But the visitors contributed something more valuable, their cultures. Los 
Gatos, one feels, will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: A Brazilian woman walked into an ice cream store in Los 
Gatos one hot day and ordered a beer. LOS ANGELES-PASADENA 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: My, but the old lady still can sing. Our Rose Bowl looked wonderful 
with its face lift and colorful frills. 
</P>
<P>
 When the air is clear and the heat isn't oppressive, there is no better view 
in this World Cup than that of the San Gabriel mountains looming behind the 
Rose Bowl scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, the view of that scoreboard after the United States played Columbia 
was pretty nice too. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: That World Cup chief Alan Rothenberg would allow his hometown 
facility to rip off hungry and thirsty soccer fans -- many of them his 
neighbors -- with inflated prices is inexcusable. Two dollars and fifty cents 
for a Sno-cone? Fish and chips for $7.50? 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: The scene reminds us of the 1984 Olympics, causing emotions we 
never thought we would feel again. Traffic flowing smoothly, the city clean and 
pressed, citizens talking about something fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys say that many people here couldn't care less about the event, but the 
ones who do have made it memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: With so many men ignoring the "Women" signs on the 
portable toilets outside the Rose Bowl, officials placed "Out of Order" signs 
on several working potties and secretly passed around the word that women 
should use those. ORLANDO 
</P>
<P>
 * BEST: Quick, somebody get this town an NFL team. There was no better 
stadium-area atmosphere than here, where fans congregated less than a mile from 
the Florida Citrus Bowl at a trendy shopping and dining area called Church 
Street Station. 
</P>
<P>
 One night the Dutch fans were having so much fun, they started stealing 
baseball caps from policemen. Another night, the Mexicans were having so much 
fun they lay down on the railroad tracks upon hearing an oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe we don't all have the same kinds of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Expensive restaurants became rollicking pubs. Thousands of foreigners became 
wailing, wandering messes. 
</P>
<P>
 Did we mention that the Irish were also in town? 
</P>
<P>
 * WORST: This was soccer in a sauna. Every team that played under the 
unforgiving midday sun recorded a triumph of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 For fans, merely getting to the games was a similar triumph. Ten dollars to 
ride a parking lot shuttle? Fifteen dollars to park at a local school, with the 
money being handed to a member of the PTA? 
</P>
<P>
 This was central Florida hucksterism at its worst. But then, they learned from 
the experts down the street, those guys wearing the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 * IMPRESSIONS: With the Dutch and Belgians in town, this was supposed to be 
the site of hooliganism. Police from around the state were summoned for 12-hour 
shifts. But nothing happened. The most serious crime involved people refusing 
to leave bars at closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Already our vacation capital, Orlando proved that it deserves to become a 
sports capital as well. It knows how to turn a game into an event without 
anybody getting hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 After existing for so long in the shadow of fantasyland, it acts as if it 
loves this real stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU HAD TO BE HERE: In the downtown area on July 4, fans from everywhere 
joined to sing "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 To whom? To the United States, of course. Considering how we came of age in 
yet another international sporting scene this summer, it was a happy birthday 
indeed. 
</P>

 From zealots to the casual fan to the simply curious, they have come in droves 
to World Cup '94, making this the best-attended tournament in the event's 
64-year history. Through 44 of 52 games, the crowd count stood at 2,995,242, 
surpassing the record of 2.5-million for Italia '90. Indeed, this global 
spectacular has been so popular that ticket sales at some venues, such as 
Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando, and Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, have 
exceeded listed capacity.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; THEY CAUGHT THE FEVER; WORLD CUP '94 WILL SHATTER 
ATTENDANCE RECORDS -- EVEN WITH DALLAS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those Europeans and South Americans were right after all -- Americans still 
don't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 How else to explain that 54,456 turned up at Foxboro Stadium in Massachusetts 
one June evening to witness South Korea play Bolivia to a 0-0 tie in the first 
round of the World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have never happened in Brazil," observed a Sao Paulo reporter. 
"Everyone would have known better than to come out for that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, come they have, pushing attendance figures beyond soccer's stratosphere. 
After 44 games through the second round, World Cup organizers sold 2,955,108 
tickets, an average of 67,162 per match. And the final eight matches were sold 
out by early last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, World Cup '94 has seen record-breaking crowds in the one country that 
has been most resistant to soccer. Organizers have sold 97.7% of listed 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people doubted we could fill the stadiums," said Alan Rothenberg, 
chairman of World Cup USA. "There was fear that this would be the sterile, 
passionless World Cup except for a few aficionados. Instead it has been an 
international coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by the U.S. national team's success, almost a half million watched 
five matches at the Rose Bowl, which will play host to a semifinal, the 
third-place game and the July 17 final. By then, about three-quarters of a 
million will have attended games in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities have done equally well. Chicago virtually sold out its first 
games, then fell a few thousand short in the Germany-Belgium second-round game. 
East Rutherford, N.J.; Pontiac, Mich.; Orlando, Fla.; Foxboro, Palo Alto and 
Washington had similar experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, Brazil became the first World Cup host country to surpass a million 
in attendance. Brazilians averaged 47,432 per match. The final was held in 
Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro before the largest single-game crowd, 
199,854. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take four more World Cups -- in England in 1966 -- to reach the 
million milestone again. The two-million mark was not passed until 1982 in 
Spain. And before this tournament, Italia '90 held the attendance record of 
2,515,168, an average of 48,369 per match. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 44 years after Brazil's success comes an unfathomable leap: The 
three-million barrier has fallen in America. 
</P>
<P>
 When the United States played Romania on June 26, 93,869 came to the Rose 
Bowl, the '94 Cup's largest single-game crowd thus far. Five days earlier, the 
smallest crowd was recorded when 44,132 watched Nigeria rout Bulgaria, 3-0, at 
the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtrodden Dallas has had the toughest sell of the nine World Cup sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four of the eight quarterfinalists played in Dallas, but not in major 
matches," lamented William Stroube, chief of operations, who said the event has 
had a tremendous economic impact on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial gains have yet to be determined, but much was made of Dallas' 
inability to sell out before the tournament began June 17. And during the first 
week of the tournament, Dallas hoteliers complained about no one showing up for 
the blocks of rooms they reserved for prospective fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas was snake bit for several reasons. In Texas, American football is an 
institution, and the two-time Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys are at the 
height of popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Texans might be a bit stubborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truthfully, a lot of people don't know the rules (of soccer)," said Carol 
Padgett, the Cowboys ticket manager. "I have watched it on TV and have 
absolutely no idea what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In Arlington, baseball's Texas Rangers opened a new ballpark that has been the 
summer highlight. Furthermore, the Rangers have been in first place in the weak 
American League West during much of the World Cup. That combination is too 
powerful and the Rangers are averaging 12,689 more fans per game than last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, Bulgaria and South Korea were based in the Dallas area. Teams 
without a large ethnic following in Texas, neither country brought the number 
of fans that Brazil, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands did. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dallas could have sold out the Cotton Bowl for all six of its games, 
said Jorge Herrera, a vice president with the city's Visitors and Convention 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, a marketing specialist, said city officials were not allowed to 
promote Dallas because of restrictions by FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA controlled the distribution of tickets through package deals with certain 
hotels, as well as how the World Cup could be marketed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sold tickets a certain way so we couldn't help," said Herrera, a soccer 
fan. "FIFA told us last year that tickets were not available, and later they 
were. They did not level with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, dismissed the charges. He 
said with the exception of 15% of the tickets, distribution was handled by 
local organizing committees. FIFA also returned any unsold seats so the local 
venues could sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to do with the ticket sales in the U.S.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least he didn't try to grab any of the credit. Through the Years

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * RESTAURANT RELOCATION: Approved a request by the Community Redevelopment 
Agency for $529,000 to relocate Rusty's Hacienda Restaurant from 1331 S. Boyd 
Street in Boyle Heights to 1716 N. Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood to make room 
for Rio Vista Village, a 75-unit housing development. Under California law, the 
CRA is required to provide relocation assistance to businesses displaced by its 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOUSING DEVELOPMENT: Authorized the CRA to provide a $4.9-million loan to 
Villa Del Pueblo Limited Partnership for the construction of an 81-unit low 
income housing development at 1441 S. Hope Street. The six-story building is 
scheduled to be completed by September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFER: Approved offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of the two people who forced their way into a 
residence at 800 S. Norton Avenue in the Wilshire area on May 29 and raped and 
robbed the five women living there. Friends of the victims have said they plan 
to match the council's reward. 
</P>
<P>
 * BLOCK PARTY: Approved the closure of Cherrywood Avenue between Rodeo Road 
and Coliseum Street on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. for the Cherrywood Avenue 
block party. 
</P>
<P>
 * POLICE DONATION: Accepted the donation to the Los Angeles Police Department 
of 15 IBM personal computers, 22 mobile video systems, 20,000 videotapes and 
2,000 nine-volt batteries from DARE America. 
</P>
<P>
 * WALK OF FAME: Approved adding the following names to Hollywood Boulevard's 
Walk of Fame: the singing group The Supremes, actor James Coburn, actor Ben 
Johnson and Sesame Street's Big Bird. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * GOLFING FEES: Approved raising of the green fees at city golf courses 
to $16 from $15 during the week and from to $19.50 from $18.50 on weekends. The 
$1 increase overrides the Board of Recreation and Parks action to raise the 
fees $1.50 for most golfers while lowering the fees for seniors and youths 
under 17 years of age by 50 cents. A decision by the council regarding the fees 
for seniors and youths was delayed until this week. In comparison, the current 
fees at county golf courses are $17 during the week and $21 on weekends. Passed 
12-2. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita 
Walters, Jackie Goldberg, Rudy Svorinich Jr. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

VOICES: A GLOBAL VILLAGE; CREATING AN AFRICA-THEMED DISTRICT ALONG CRENSHAW 
BOULEVARD WOULD CREATE CHARACTER IN THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE IT A PLACE WHERE 
PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE AND OTHERS WILL COME TO VISIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVA JOYCE PARHAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Melva Joyce Parhams need only look around her office to see her dream of the 
future. Taped to the wall above her desk is a map of Africa, land of her 
ancestors, while just outside her second-story window is bustling Crenshaw 
Boulevard, the main thoroughfare of her longtime home. Parhams, a Cal State Los 
Angeles student and longtime community activist, wants to fuse the spirit of 
the two disparate locales by creating the African International Village, a 
themed district that would run the length of the Crenshaw corridor from Adams 
Boulevard to Florence Avenue. She was interviewed by Geoff Boucher.  
</P>
<P>
 During the riots I was at home watching TV like a lot of people, watching the 
looters out there burning my district down, and what I saw was an apathy about 
the place we live. How can you do that to a place you care about? I think 
creating the African International Village would uplift our community 
psychologically and spiritually, and give the people a sense of ownership. Most 
of all it would help the children, educating them and making their community a 
better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is here and the time is now. It is only six years until the end of 
the century. This project would create a character for this area and make it a 
place where people want to live and others will come to visit. The community 
supports this; they tell me all the time. The grass-roots support is there; 
people think it's a beautiful idea. But it's the leaders who are not 
responding. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the politicians and leaders have this attitude that, "If we didn't 
think of it, we don't want anything to do with it." But we're all on the same 
side. I know there have been a lot of programs, and there is a lot of money 
being spent on them, but there are still unemployed people everywhere, the 
gangs and crime are still there. There are children still sleeping in the 
streets. And I'll tell you this, it's not the white man's fault. We have to 
make these changes for ourselves if we want a better place. 
</P>
<P>
 Our professionals, once they get established, a lot of them never come back 
and contribute. Maybe that is because of slavery in our history, when family 
kinships were torn up. I think that left us with an "everybody for themselves" 
attitude. We need to know ourselves, and feel good about ourselves. We need to 
jump back past the slavery to celebrate who we were in our own country, when we 
were kings and queens. We have the shackles off our hands, but not our brains. 
We need to find dignity and hold our heads up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Village would help by giving us reminders of that past, by educating our 
young people and creating business. I've paid out of my pocket for three years 
now, but now we need others to help. A lot of people tell me I have dedication, 
they say that people usually only do things for themselves, and I tell them 
it's because I have a dream. I have a long-term goal: to see the children of 
the 21st Century have a better chance than the generation we have now.  
</P>
<P>
 There are 10 architects, artists and engineers who have stepped forward and 
made all these wonderful designs and I have these maps that show where 
everything would go. They're planning out the buildings and the transportation. 
The business owners in the area support it. There would be African theme shops, 
and arts and crafts for sale. I dream about seeing the hotel shaped like one of 
the Pyramids there at Adams, also. And there would be a memorial there with the 
names of all the people that have died because of gangs and violence, so young 
people can see the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 People think of Africa and think of spears and little huts, but there is far 
more to it than that. They need to know about Egypt, for example, and how it 
was a black land. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be something everyone could be proud of.

GRAFFITI PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surely, you must be aware of the severe graffiti problem in our 
city.Therefore, why does The Times persist in aggravating the problem by posing 
people for news pictures in front of graffitied walls and buildings? Another 
glaring example of this practice is the large photo of mariachi Jose Jesus 
Vargas ("El Mariachi," June 26) posed with graffiti in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Please be sensitive to the needs in our community by not publicizing, 
popularizing and glorifying graffiti in the pages of The Times.

VOICES: SPEAKING OUT; AN ACLU ATTORNEY WARNS THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION MAY 
SEND A MISTAKEN MESSAGE TO EMPLOYERS THAT THEY HAVE CARTE BLANCHE TO IMPOSE 
LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN TOMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Toma, 32, has been a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties 
Union for six years. He specializes in cases involving language-rights issues 
and has filed court challenges against employers who establish workplace rules 
that prohibit employees from speaking languages other than English. In 1989, he 
filed a lawsuit against Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, challenging that 
facility's English-only rule. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of assistant head 
nurse Aida Dimaranan, who worked in the maternity ward and spoke English and 
Tagalog, was settled out of court in 1992. Toma lives in Silver Lake. He was 
interviewed by Karen E. Klein.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court recently refused to hear an appeal of a ruling that 
said English-only rules do not discriminate against bilingual em ployees. That 
means that in the future it will be a lot easier for employers to impose 
English-only rules on employees who are fully bilingual and it will be harder, 
much harder, to challenge them. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm afraid the court's decision may send a mistaken message to employers that 
they have carte blanche to impose language restrictions. I believe employers 
should be very careful in recognizing the limits of this ruling. Where there 
are employees with limited English skills, the employer has to show that there 
is a business necessity for imposing an English-only rule. 
</P>
<P>
 When there is a business necessity, when communication in English is an 
essential element of work performance, there is no reason to challenge that. 
For instance, no emergency room employee is going to demand the right to speak 
Spanish while working on a patient in critical condition. No employee is going 
to ask to speak Tagalog to English-speaking customers in a store. That just 
would not make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're challenging is blanket English-only rules -- rules that prohibit 
employees from speaking their native languages at break times, lunchtimes, etc. 
We all know that when we're at work we don't do four hours of work straight 
without speaking even a word of a personal nature. 
</P>
<P>
 If you pass someone in the hall and he says, "Hola, que tal," you want to say, 
"Bien." People are getting written up for that. Some folks might lose their 
jobs over something like that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case that I brought on behalf of a Filipino nurse, my client was 
speaking Tagalog on the phone to her mother about giving medicine to her child 
at home. Her mother didn't speak English very well so she really needed to 
communicate in Tagalog. Another employee heard her and said, "I'm going to 
report you!" It makes for a very oppressive work atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 I have found that in workplaces where English-only rules are imposed there is 
always a core problem of animosity and mistrust among the employees or between 
manager and employee, and the use of native languages only exacerbates it. 
Usually, language becomes the external weapon in these conflicts but the 
conflict and the disunity among employees existed before language was singled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The ones who complain typically are English-speaking employees who hear other 
employees speaking in a native language and feel excluded or feel like other 
employees are being favored if the manager also speaks another language. 
Sometimes, employees believe their co-workers are making fun of them in another 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy for management to outlaw the speaking of native languages and think 
the problem will go away. But the complete elimination of native languages 
creates more animosity and anger and in the long run it does not improve the 
work environment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to deny that bigotry and anti-immigrant sentiment is behind many of 
these rules. Many people have mistaken ideas about immigrants and they believe 
that immigrants don't want to learn English. That is absolutely incorrect. 
Studies show that today's immigrants learn English as quickly as or even faster 
than other immigrant groups have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 I would counsel employees who are non-native English speakers to stand up for 
their rights at their workplaces. If employees are limited-English speakers, 
this ruling does not mean they can be forced to speak English all the time. It 
applies only to fully bilingual workers. Contact a civil rights organization if 
attempts at resolving the problem internally are ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants should not merely accept that the speaking of their native language 
has no importance under our laws because that is not true.

BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; TO DORSEY HIGH'S BOYS, 2 DONS DON'T MAKE IT RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dorsey High boys' basketball team must be getting tired of looking up at a 
scoreboard and seeing another team nicknamed the Dons winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Compton Dominguez Dons beat the Dorsey Dons, 92-58, behind 
the scoring of Tommy Prince in the finals of the Watts Summer Games at Compton 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the score was closer as Dominguez escaped with a 76-71 win over 
Dorsey in the second round of the Artesia Tournament. Prince led all scorers 
with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had another good run down at the end of the game again," Dorsey Coach 
Kevin Gibson said. "The difference was that our big men didn't get into foul 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey has added two new players to its roster: 6-8 junior forward Marcus 
Mason and 6-4 senior forward Tim Johnson. Mason was academically ineligible 
last season and Johnson is a transfer from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will give us depth at the forward position, which we need," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez is the hottest high school basketball team this summer. The Dons are 
16-0, winning both the Watts Summer Games and the Artesia Tournament. 
Dominguez, however, pulled out of the Pump Discovery Shootout after winning its 
second game by forfeit Tuesday at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Showdown -- Crenshaw's Ronnie Arch vs. Santa Ana Valley's Olujimi Mann. 
</P>
<P>
 A matchup worth watching was created when Crenshaw scheduled a home-and-away 
series with Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time the Cougars play a non-tournament game in Orange 
County, according to Coach Willie West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars will host Santa Ana Valley next season and will play in Orange 
County during the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, who will be a junior, is one of the top players in Orange County while 
Arch is the top returning scorer from the two-time State Division I champion 
Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schedules -- The West Coast All-Star Camp, which began Saturday at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, will give Southern California basketball fans their first 
glimpse of the nation's top players returning from the Nike Sports Festival and 
Adidas ABCD Camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today is the Superstar Camp, which returns to the campus of UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, Long Beach Poly and Westchester will be the top-seeded teams in the 
8th annual Fairfax Summer Classic, which begins Thursday. Among the top players 
competing are Prince, Danny Walker and Ben Sanders of Westchester, Darwin 
Carter of Manual Arts, Damian Dawson of Poly and Duane Davis of Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion St. John Bosco also returns, but without Jelani Gardner, 
who will play for Cal in the fall. Other past winners include Pasadena Muir and 
Artesia. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Correction -- The Slam 'N Jam Invitational begins Saturday and continues 
through July 21 at South Torrance and West Torrance high schools. The 
tournament features some of the top players in the country and runs from 9 a.m. 
to 9 p.m.

NOTEBOOK; GARFIELD, BELMONT STARS JOIN FORCES TO LEAD WEST TO FIESTA BOWL 
VICTORY

<P>
 Quarterback David Guerra helped Garfield to the Southeastern Conference title 
while Belmont running back Ramon Archie led the Sentinels to the Northern 
Conference championship last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The players in combination proved just as potent as they were on opposing 
schools in the Fiesta Bowl All-Star Classic as the West team scored a 19-17 
victory over the East on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra completed three of seven passes for 147 yards and a touchdown, and 
Archie rushed for 95 yards in six carries in the game matching graduating 
seniors from East L.A. (West) against players from the West San Gabriel Valley 
(East) at Wilson High. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra was named the outstanding player for the West, and Gavin Peries of 
South Pasadena, who gained 85 yards in seven carries, was selected the East 
squad's outstanding player. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustin Lopez of Roosevelt opened the scoring with a 24-yard field goal in 
the first quarter. Bell's Danny Morales and Garfield's Leon Houston then 
combined on a 39-yard touchdown on a flea-flicker in the first quarter, and 
Guerra connected with Carlos Ortiz of Marshall on an 85-yard scoring pass for a 
16-0 second-quarter lead of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's 33-yard field goal in the third quarter gave the West a 19-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The East, coached by Jerry Scott of Salesian and Jack Aguilar of Pius X, 
scored 14 consecutive points in an 11-minute span on two touchdowns and a 
safety by Salesian's Augie Moran to make the score 19-17 with 5:23 left. The 
East twice missed two-point conversions.  
</P>
<P>
 The rally came up short when the East lost a fumble on the West 31 with 10 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The West, which leads the series 2-1-1, was coached by Pablo Cano, an 
assistant at Marshall. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Armando Figueroa of Garfield, who gained 38 yards in seven carries for the 
West in the Fiesta Bowl, has decided to attend a junior college in the fall 
rather than play for San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa has been accepted to San Jose State and surpassed the NCAA-mandated 
score of 700 points on the Scholastic Aptitude Test for freshman eligibility, 
but he was not offered a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-7, 170-pound running back, though, said he will attend East Los 
Angeles College this fall despite its lack of a football program and hope for a 
scholarship the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 An All-City Section 4-A selection, Figueroa rushed for a City-leading 1,669 
yards and 16 touchdowns last fall and gained a City-record 4,548 yards and 38 
touchdowns in three seasons.

 A team of students from Evans Adult School will play in the SoccerFest at the 
Convention Center. The downtown school, whose purpose is to develop English 
skills for students of all ages, will play two exhibition matches against 
community groups Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 SoccerFest, which will run through July 17, is an international soccer 
festival and interactive theme park produced by World Cup USA 1994.

ELDERLY STRUGGLE TO RECOVER FROM EARTHQUAKE; VALLEY: FOR SENIORS WHOSE LIVES 
WERE UPROOTED, THE PROCESS IS TEDIOUS AND BAFFLING. SERVICE AGENCIES ARE ALSO 
TAXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Disaster was no less painful when they were younger. But when the hurricane 
passed, the war ended, and the Great Depression finally gave way to prosperity, 
they picked up the pieces and built their lives again. 
</P>
<P>
 Those survivors are different now -- older, sometimes fragile, often alone -- 
and putting their lives together after a disaster takes more help and more time 
than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 For older people who lived through the Northridge quake, recovery has been a 
tedious struggle, one that baffles many and has taxed the public and private 
agencies that provide them services. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, they still must be hand-held through the confusing labyrinth of 
disaster aid -- coaxed into applying for assistance they are eligible to 
receive, convinced that there is no shame in accepting help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time I'm giving up and allowing people to help me," said Anne Wadler, 
76, looking down at a stack of papers piled on her kitchen table in Canoga 
Park. "I can't cope with any more problems. I wasn't like this before. I 
wonder, what is happening to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are no comprehensive statistics on how many quake victims are 60 and 
over. But between Jan. 17 and June 17, the city's Department of Aging provided 
services to 12,021 older people who lost homes or property in the quake, or who 
need emotional or financial support. Through 16 senior citizen multipurpose 
centers and nine other agencies serving the elderly, the city provided services 
such as disaster advocacy, information and assistance, transportation, home 
meals, relocation and handyman services, according to statistics provided by 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's Area Agency on Aging, has served at least 35,000 older 
people with similar services, county officials said. In Ventura County, the 
Area Agency on Aging served 10,320 older people between Jan. 17 and May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Public and private agencies that assist older people have had to hire extra 
staff, as thousands of older people in post-quake Southern California have 
sought help with everything from finding new homes to finding counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, in acknowledgment of the special long-term needs of older people 
during times of disaster, the federal Department of Health and Human Services 
granted local agencies nearly $7 million to pay for recovery assistance to 
older quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 These agencies have discovered what relief and social workers in Florida 
learned after Hurricane Andrew: Disaster strikes at any age, but recovery comes 
quickest to the young. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you, if you're in your 80s, start from scratch?" said Lynn W. Bayer, 
director of the Los Angeles County Area Agency on Aging. "People are 
experiencing a tremendous sense of loss and an identity crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar communities and homes that once formed the core of their lives have 
been suddenly snatched away and with them a comfort and certainty about the 
world around them. Some do not sleep at night. Some experience a decline in 
health. Some call for spouses and family members buried years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Fariola did not want to leave the house on Rimpau Street that she 
shared with her husband before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake threw the wood-frame house off its foundation and tilted it 
precariously. The chimney fell down, leaving a huge hole, and the porch was 
torn away from the rest of the house. City inspectors red-tagged the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fariola kept living there, feeding her cats and her dog, Bingo, taking 
walks through the West Adams neighborhood she has lived in for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Social worker John G. Merrill of Adult Protective Services learned about 
Fariola two weeks after the Northridge quake through an anonymous call. Merrill 
visited Fariola, took one look at the leaning house and informed her that she 
could not stay there -- not even for one more night. He began making 
arrangements to find her temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
 When concerned neighbors learned of her dilemma, they volunteered to put 
Fariola up for the night. She accepted the offer. The next day they took her to 
the disaster center where a Red Cross worker found a senior apartment complex 
in Monrovia that would accept Fariola and her dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of her departure, Merrill and the neighbors gathered at the house -- 
the stranger who came to help and longtime neighbors she had learned to trust. 
</P>
<P>
 They packed some of her clothes, her dolls and some photographs, while a 
tearful Fariola wavered between the certainty of her past and an unknown 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 As the group waited outside for the van that would take her to Monrovia, 
Fariola quietly slipped back into the house and locked the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not coming out," she told them through the locked door. "I'm staying 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Frances, you have to go," Merrill told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Merrill stood in front of the house trying to coax Fariola out, he 
understood her resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of her attachment to the past was lost with just that shake of the 
earth," Merrill said. "There's a real attachment to a house, a real bond." 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, Fariola still lives in Monrovia, miles away from her home, her 
neighbors and her yesterdays. Sometimes Fariola's conversation is a confusing 
mix of the past and the present. She speaks of long-ago people and places as if 
they still exist, as if they are still part of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the lounge of the Monrovia complex, she is calm but somber when she 
talks about the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew they weren't going to let me stay there," she said, looking away. "I 
don't blame them. I sure miss my house." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill not only helped remove Fariola from her damaged home, but helped 
oversee the building of her new life -- one that is insulated with support from 
outside public and private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she has a caseworker, a financial counselor, a psychological counselor and 
a doctor that she sees regularly -- none of which she had before the quake. But 
Fariola had not sought any of the help herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In all her 70 years she has never "been on the dole," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she is proud of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe people owe me anything," she said, her voice full of 
conviction. "You can't depend on other people. You have to depend on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Like she and her family did when she was young and strong quakes hit Santa 
Barbara. Like they always did during tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is different because my husband's dead," she said, softly. "It helps 
when you have family. It helps even if they can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Fariola's case is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest cases, I think, are people we had to relocate," Bayer said. "Now 
they want to be back in their old neighborhoods, where their church is and 
their stores are, everything they're used to." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no going back for some. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordable housing, in short supply before the quake, is even harder to find 
now. For some older quake victims, especially those who lived in 
rent-controlled apartment buildings, relocation has also meant a decline in 
their standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where older people were able to live a reasonably good life before, they're 
finding they don't have the money to live the way they did because it has to go 
to rent," Bayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, Anne Wadler began to reconsider the idea of home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking I'm not getting younger and my health is not good," said Wadler, 
who is partially blind. "There'd be all kinds of problems in a place that I 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 Just months before the Northridge quake, she'd purchased her own mobile home 
for $20,000 and moved into Canoga Mobile Estates in Canoga Park. She was proud 
of her purchase and happy to be close to her daughter and her family. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake seriously damaged her coach and many of her belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first weeks after the quake, the Red Cross paid for Wadler's stay in a 
motel and provided her with money for food. Eventually, she found a small 
one-room unit in a Canoga Park apartment building where she now lives. She has 
decorated the table in the breakfast nook with a bouquet of pink, purple and 
white cloth tulips that she found at a thrift store. White lacy curtains hang 
from the kitchen window. But it still does not feel like home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been independent where I did everything myself," Wadler said 
looking out at the courtyard through her kitchen window. "Now, I'm just 
devastated. I try to fight that off, but it doesn't go away. The worst thing 
is, I couldn't cope for myself. I couldn't think straight." 
</P>
<P>
 The uncontrollable cough started after the quake, so did the insomnia, the 
nervous stomach and the piercing headaches -- brought on by high blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 She worried about finding a new place to live. She worried about repairing her 
old home. Months later she is still worrying about both. 
</P>
<P>
 With the $1,200 she receives from Social Security, she is paying rent in two 
places -- $343 for a HUD-subsidized apartment and $390 for the space occupied 
by her crippled mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course there are other living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money doesn't go very far," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $9,910 grant she received from FEMA, Wadler has been making 
arrangements to have the coach repaired through a project run by the state's 
Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mobile Home Minimal Repair Project was created to help mobile home owners, 
many of whom are older people, find licensed contractors to repair their 
quake-damaged coaches, said Dree DeClamecy, spokeswoman for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Wadler waits for assistance from the state, independent contractors 
looking for work have called her and her daughter repeatedly offering to do the 
repairs. And she still does not know if she will return to the mobile home park 
or keep her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole ordeal -- the commotion and long lines at the FEMA center, the phone 
calls, the waiting -- has consumed her life and left her frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of frustration Wadler experienced prompted Los Angeles officials to 
create the Disaster Outreach Recovery Unit so that older people could bypass 
the long lines and receive whatever additional assistance and referrals they 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially scheduled to end in June, the unit, which is part of the city's 
Department of Aging, has been funded until the end of the year, said Thelma 
McClinton, who coordinates the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still just coming out of it," McClinton said. "A lot of people 
went into shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Moore, 68, had seen it all before, so when the quake hit she was calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in China, through the Sino-Japanese occupation," Moore said. "I was 
in air raids when I was 5 and 6 years old. . . . Then I lived in Japan and I 
experienced earthquakes there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had learned to cope with all this you know," she said sitting on 
the couch of her home in North Hollywood. "I thought, 'Well, it's not going to 
bother me. I'm going to be just fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But she isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 With each passing aftershock, her composure dissolved into forgetfulness, 
disorientation, fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I have cracks in my ceiling," she said pointing up to a jagged line 
above the mantle. "I have cracks in my bedroom, but that's how I feel. That's 
what happened inside of me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through an awful lot. I've seen a lot of pain, a lot of illness, 
buried a lot of people. The quake brings it all back." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, Moore volunteered at the East Valley Multipurpose Senior 
Center, organizing field trips for seniors. Now she also receives counseling 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting of her counseling group, an older woman who survived the 
collapse of Northridge Meadows Apartments spoke about her experience. As she 
listened, Moore discovered her feelings were shared by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with us older people it's not the death that we're afraid of, it's 
the dying -- how you're going to go, lying under a rock or something, being 
alone," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 For some older people, like Catherine E. McArthur, 68, who worked at the 
Salvation Army seven days a week in the days following the quake, helping 
others is a way to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senior-to-Senior Peer Counseling group at the Pacoima Senior Citizens 
Multipurpose Center, volunteers have spent their time dealing with their own 
feelings and helping others. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon they gathered with the group's leader, Bill Hulling, to talk 
candidly about the way the quake and the continuing aftershocks have changed 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm experiencing anxiety and I'm not one that would normally be considered 
anxiety-ridden," said Ted Minor, 73. "I'm secure in myself and in my God, and 
I'm thinking, 'Is this the big one?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In counseling others, they do not pretend to have all the answers or that the 
problems will go away overnight. They listen. They talk about preparation -- 
having supplies like radios and water. They talk about the reality of their 
lives as older people. 
</P>
<P>
 When an aftershock hit while she was at a restaurant, Carmen Amper, 69, 
watched diners rush outside and scramble under tables. She didn't do either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I can't get under the table, my knees won't bend,' " she recalled. 
"Now, I just pray, 'Lord protect us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Faith," Hulling responded. "I think that's a tool our generation uses."

MEMORIES OF TRAGEDY AT TOURNAMENT TIME; ACCIDENT: SURVIVORS REBUILDING LIVES 
AFTER POST-GAME CRASH THAT KILLED AN O.C. COUPLE LAST YEAR.

<P>
 As his Bobby Sox team prepares for another summer tournament this weekend, 
Russ Little can't help thinking back to July 11, 1993, a day that began as "one 
of the best days of my life. But it went from the best to the worst in a couple 
or three hours." 
</P>
<P>
 On that warm Sunday evening, the coach had returned triumphant from a playoff 
game in Anaheim Hills and had just stretched out in bed when his wife answered 
the telephone and gasped. A Laguna Beach doctor's car had careened out of 
control and struck a carload of Little's friends and players returning from the 
game in a crushing head-on collision on Santiago Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash killed two of the Littles' best friends, Mark and Noreen Minzey, and 
critically injured the Minzeys' 11-year-old daughter Karie, who was an all-star 
outfielder. Another all-star, 11-year-old Danielle Rodriguez, and her sister 
Jackie, then 24, were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Littles, the others involved in the tragedy have spent the past year 
piecing their lives together. But the shock of that summer night will never 
leave them, said Rebecca Rodriguez, Danielle's and Jackie's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the last thing we ever thought would happen," Rebecca Rodriguez 
said. "We were happy that afternoon. We stopped on the way home to buy some red 
shorts to celebrate. Now, not a day goes by when I don't think of Mark and 
Noreen. We had been hanging together all summer, like one big family." 
</P>
<P>
 Karie Minzey, now 12, is still recovering from severe head injuries and 
several reconstructive surgeries and is living in Georgia with her aunt and 
uncle and older sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Rodriguez has regained the use of her left arm, which was fractured 
in several places in the crash, and is again an all-star and again a member of 
the cast of the Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach. Her sister Jackie has 
also healed, although her left leg is permanently scarred by burns from hot 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dr. Ronald Joseph Allen, who prosecutors say was drunk and under the 
influence of drugs when his rented Chevrolet collided with the Minzeys' Dodge, 
he sits in Orange County Jail, stripped of his medical license and facing trial 
this fall on charges of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no winners in this incident; this is truly a tragic situation," 
said Kevin E. Monson, a Newport Beach attorney representing Allen. "Here is a 
brilliant young internist, whose entire life had been predicated on giving to 
others, who now finds himself accused of murder, the very antithesis of 
everything he wanted in life." 
</P>
<P>
 The year has brought a host of civil lawsuits by the survivors against Allen 
and others. The Minzey and Rodriguez families have sued Allen, and on Friday 
the Minzeys sued the state Department of Motor Vehicles and the Medical Board 
of California, claiming the agencies should have acted sooner to revoke his 
licenses to drive and to practice medicine. The Minzeys also sued South Coast 
Medical Center, where Allen had received psychological treatment shortly before 
the crash, and Chrysler Corp., which manufactured the Dodge the family was 
driving. The Rodriguezes are expected to file similar suits against the DMV and 
Medical Board on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, 33, declined to be interviewed. But his attorneys say he still suffers 
from the severe depression that had begun even before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen had a history of alcohol and drug problems and had attempted suicide 
several times, according to police reports. And on the day of the crash, just 
before beginning to drive for a still undisclosed reason, toward rural Santiago 
Canyon, Allen had learned of his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Allen is still in extreme remorse," said Deputy Public Defender Alan 
Crivaro. "What he does is mull over this a lot. . . . He seems to be physically 
healthy, but he has his bad days." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's mental state draws little sympathy among the Mission Viejo families 
affected by the crash, or even from his Laguna Beach patients. Allen had been 
working with a group of severely ill AIDS patients who were left in the lurch 
when he began his down slide, said Richard Ammon, a Laguna Beach psychologist 
who knew Allen and treated many of the same people. 
</P>
<P>
 "My patients feel a lot of betrayal," Ammon said. "When you have a terminal 
illness, the relationship with your doctor is one of the primary ones you have. 
These guys are dealing with their diseases, and to have your doctor abandon 
you. . . . There's not a lot of pity." 
</P>
<P>
 There is absolutely no sympathy for Allen in the tightknit Rodriguez household 
in Mission Viejo. The Rodriguez, Little and Minzey families had grown close 
because of softball. Ed Rodriguez, Noreen Minzey, Russ Little and Jackie 
Rodriguez were the coaches of the all-star team that played at Canyon Hills 
Park that Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was elated that afternoon after the Mission de Oro team beat an 
Anaheim Hills squad, 8-0. Little's daughter, Jennifer, had pitched a no-hitter, 
Karie Minzey had contributed a triple, and Noreen Minzey had recorded the game 
on a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were on cloud nine," said Little, 40, the owner of a metal refinishing 
shop. "We were all talking about playing Cerritos the next night and the chance 
to continue on to the nationals. . . . When we drove home, we took the freeway 
and they took Santiago Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving, they had a brief discussion about who would ride with whom, 
said Rebecca Rodriguez. Danielle wanted to ride with the Minzeys, which she and 
Jackie finally did. 
</P>
<P>
 After a stop for Mexican food, the five of them began the drive home, choosing 
to take picturesque Santiago Canyon Road because there was still light. Noreen 
Minzey, 33, drove. Jackie sat in the front seat with Danielle directly behind 
her. Karie was in the middle of the back seat, and Mark Minzey, 37, sat behind 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Rodriguez didn't see the Chevy until it was just about to hit the 
front left side of the Minzeys' Dodge about 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that Noreen Minzey died instantly. Paramedics had to cut 
through the car to free her body. 
</P>
<P>
 A dying Mark Minzey, bleeding profusely from a severed artery, is credited 
with a heroic effort, directing paramedics to his critically injured daughter 
and the Rodriguez girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark's last words were 'I'm fine, take the girls first,' " said Jackie 
Rodriguez, now 25. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after 9 p.m. when the phone rang at the Rodriguez home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son answered, grabbed his shoes and said, 'Mom, you've got to take this 
phone call,' " Rebecca Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrenaline pumping, the Rodriguez family rushed to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where they found Danielle and Jackie in the emergency room. Jackie's 
feet had been burned by hot engine oil and "were like charcoal," and Danielle 
was drugged and nearly unconscious, bits of glass and some red clay from the 
baseball diamond still in her curly, blond-streaked hair. 
</P>
<P>
 A comatose Karie Minzey, suffering from extreme head, leg and knee injuries, 
was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. The early prognosis was not 
good; it was not known if she would survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since the accident she has been in and out of hospitals and now 
rests in one again, recovering from reconstructive surgery to her face and 
forehead, her aunt, Jeanine Posey, said from their Marietta, Ga., home. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeries have been tough and scary for the seventh-grader. The subsequent 
recoveries are just as difficult, with accompanying pain, nausea and swelling. 
Sometimes she is unable to see for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does pretty good. But it's not really easy," Posey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although softball is still only a dream, Karie swims and rides her bike in her 
small Georgia town and has managed to attend church summer camps between 
surgeries, Posey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie and her 16-year-old sister, Shelbie, are doing well with their 
close-knit religious family, but miss their parents, Posey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just play it by ear," Posey said. "We just see how they're doing and let 
them tell us how they're feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 In most ways, Karie is "just like any other 12-year-old," her aunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really done great. But she's a lot wiser than most people. A lot more 
grateful. She has a different perspective on life than most." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a perspective shared by Danielle Rodriguez, Danielle's mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danielle told me, 'Mom, I'm like a living angel because I was spared. I know 
I'm going to do good things with my life because that's what God wants me to do 
now,"' Rebecca Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 With tournament season here again, the crash and its aftermath became the talk 
of some circles of softball-crazy Mission Viejo. The talk peaked two weeks ago 
when Karie Minzey and her family returned to California for the first time and 
attended her sixth-grade graduation from Stoneybrooke Christian School in San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie also met up again with her favorite ballplayer, California Angels 
pitcher Chuck Finley, during a game. She hadn't remembered Finley's first visit 
at the hospital in the days after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 A touching moment came when she attended closing ceremonies for the Mission de 
Oro Bobby Sox league recently and had a chance to see the Rodriguez and Little 
families. Russ Little said he found her to be slightly taller than before, her 
hair darker. He said that "basically she is doing remarkably well, considering 
the extent of her injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a lot of problems with an eye that was severely damaged, and arm and 
leg injuries," Little said. "But mentally she is the same smiling kid she was 
before. It's a miracle story, really."

N. KOREAN HEIR APPARENT IS A BIZARRE ENIGMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il, North Korea's presumed new leader, is said to watch public 
executions with "frenzied joy" and amuse himself by ordering subordinates to 
shave their heads or strip naked. He is suspected of masterminding 
international bombings and kidnapings blamed for killing more than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest son of Kim Il Sung, the Communist dictator of Pyongyang's grim 
regime who died Friday, reportedly stages frequent orgies in his palatial 
villas. He is paranoid about germs, a film fanatic with 20,000 videos and an 
ardent fan of Daffy Duck cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Such bizarre tales have long filtered out of Pyongyang from diplomats and 
defectors about Kim, 52, the pudgy, bespectacled scion of the Marxist world's 
only family dynasty. But whether they are true or false is impossible to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing certain about the mysterious prince of Pyongyang is that almost 
nothing is known for certain about his character, his hold on power or his 
ability to govern his cloistered country. Nor is it clear how he intends to 
rescue an economy said to be near collapse, placate a people reduced to eating 
roots, manage North Korea's military of 1.1 million soldiers, the 
fourth-largest in the world, or deal with the country's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one Westerner is known to have ever met him, an Italian entrepreneur 
named Carlo Baeli who was treated to a lobster dinner cruise on one of Kim's 
pleasure boats in 1992. Kim has made only one known public utterance in his 
life -- "Glory to the heroic Korean People's Army!" -- which he shouted at the 
end of a two-hour military display in 1992. His speeches are read by narrators 
on television and the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a very mysterious person," said Ahn Byung Joon, a political science 
professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. "We don't know much about his 
character, experience and ability. We know only his appearance and face on TV. 
For the time being, there is no doubt he will take over, but how long he will 
be able to rule is very difficult to say." 
</P>
<P>
 One Western diplomat in Tokyo, as baffled as everyone else by Kim, said only 
that officials are concerned about reports of his "unusual character." 
</P>
<P>
 Clues as to how solid Kim's support base actually is may come over the next 
several days from the kinds of speeches he makes and policies he announces, 
said one North Korean expert in Seoul. One critical clue will be whether he 
assumes the three titles of general secretary, president and chairman of the 
military commission of the Korean Workers' Party -- as well as whether he 
ascends from "Dear Leader," as he is called, to "Great Leader," as his father 
was known -- this expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Kim has been groomed by his father to take over the helm for the 
last 20 years. He has aimed to solidify his support base since 1972, when he 
established the "three main revolutionary squads" to mobilize 40,000 new 
college graduates a year to build loyalty to Kim in the party, factories and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1991, the senior Kim named his son supreme commander of the 
military, awarding him the highest title of "marshal" four months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he is known to have faced opposition from a "veterans group" within the 
army. Diplomats say the conflict is generational and that many of the senior 
officials opposing him have been forced to retire or were reportedly executed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, analysts say, he is bitterly opposed by his stepmother, Kim Song 
Ae, and her allies in a long-running drama of palace intrigue. The hatred is 
said to be mutual: Kim reportedly cuts the face of his stepmother out of every 
photo in which she appears. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike his charismatic father, who genuinely commanded public adoration, 
Kim is a recluse who mistrusts everyone and finds it difficult to meet people's 
eyes, much less make friends, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows what kind of person he really is, but what is certain is that 
among those who have met him, not one has a good impression of him," said one 
source close to Chongryun, the pro-Pyongyang residents group in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 To help consolidate Kim's power, the party propaganda machine began cranking 
up its output of official hagiography in the mid-1980s. He is now even said to 
possess magical powers, such as the ability to condense time and space. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of his birth have been rewritten from a mundane event in 
frozen Siberia to a glorious miracle atop the Korean peninsula's highest and 
holiest mountain amid bright lights and a double rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Naewoe Press, which monitors North Korean developments from 
Seoul, Kim was born Feb. 16, 1941, but his birth year was moved to 1942 to 
create an even, 30-year difference with his father. His birthplace was also 
moved -- to the sacred Mt. Paekdu, in a secret camp of "freedom fighters" 
opposed to the Japanese colonialists. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother died when he was 7, and he was evacuated to China for the duration 
of the Korean War -- events said to have devastated him and even affected his 
emotional development. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang spin-meisters credit Kim with an "insatiable" desire for learning, 
with consuming thousands of books during junior high school, writing six 
classic operas in just two years and other wondrous feats. 
</P>
<P>
 More objective analysts who monitor North Korea say Kim shows two faces: a 
ruthless terrorist and an economic reformist. 
</P>
<P>
 The trigger-happy image stems largely from suspicions that he masterminded the 
1983 bombing in Burma, now Myanmar, that killed 17 South Korean officials and 
the 1987 midair bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he initiated two of North Korea's most recent belligerent acts: 
the decision to put North Korea on a "semi-war" footing on March 8, 1993, and 
the stunning announcement four days later that it was pulling out of the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts at the time, however, said Kim's move was mainly to show his 
"boldness" in an attempt to consolidate his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he is known to have promoted economic reform within the 
Stalinist state. He was behind the establishment of the North's rare free-trade 
zone in the Tumen River estuary on the Chinese border, as well as other moves 
beginning in the 1980s to woo more foreign investment and liberalize the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint-venture law he supported in the early 1980s produced more than 100 
enterprises -- many of them financed by North Korean residents in Japan. But 
only 20 to 30 are still functioning, said one economics expert. Kim's "three 
main revolutionary squads" too often disrupted factory production with 
ideological meetings. Or the North Koreans kicked out their foreign partners to 
seize the profits but foundered when they left, the expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have the ability or talent to think up these programs himself," 
the expert said. "He is surrounded by staff who do it for him." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kim's main interests are said to be films, women and wine. He holds 
regular parties with strippers and orders high-ranking officers to play with 
them, according to two 1989 defectors, actress Choi Eun Hee and her director 
husband, Shin Sang Ok. The pair say they spent eight years in Pyongyang after 
Kim ordered them kidnaped from Hong Kong to teach him about movie-making. 
</P>
<P>
 According to defectors and diplomats, Kim is sensitive about his height (5 
feet, 6 inches) and weight (189 pounds) and wears heels and a permed bouffant 
to elongate his profile. He orders his home disinfected every day.

CLINTON TRADE PLAN FALLS FLAT AT G-7 SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG and TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton came to the high-profile Group of Seven summit to 
demonstrate new strength in foreign policy but instead watched his premier 
initiative sink Saturday under a wave of sharp criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's proposal, on future trade cooperation, was met by such firm 
objections, according to senior aides to several summit participants, that he 
was forced to abandon it almost as soon as he presented it. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was offered as a limited next step toward expanding international 
commerce in the wake of a tariff-reducing global agreement completed in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 In its most elementary form, it would have set up a one-year examination of 
impediments to world trade, but it would have also set an agenda for 
liberalizing trade rules in entirely new areas, such as financial services, 
telecommunications and investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton presented the plan as his partners in the Group of Seven -- British 
Prime Minister John Major, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, French 
President Francois Mitterrand, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Italian Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- sat down in an ornate, red-walled room of the 
Palazzo Reale overlooking the Bay of Naples. Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi 
Murayama, hospitalized Friday night after suffering an intestinal illness at an 
informal dinner with the other summit leaders, was represented by Foreign 
Minister Yohei Kono. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama was released from the hospital Saturday evening and planned to rejoin 
the summit today. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through their two-day annual conference, the seven, whose nations 
account for 70% of the world's economy, approved a communique that omitted any 
mention of the volatility in currency exchange rates. Since Clinton took 
office, the value of the dollar compared with the Japanese yen has fallen 
roughly 20%, to a post-World War II low. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Administration officials sought to steer clear of the dollar's woes, 
those problems continued to dog Clinton in Naples: His statement Friday 
suggesting that the United States would not intervene to prop it up on currency 
markets sent the dollar into another sudden tailspin; on Saturday, Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen took pains to diplomatically counter the impression 
left by the President, saying, "We're prepared to act when it's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The G-7 communique saluted the strength of the current economic recovery and 
called for reductions in unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is well on the way to a significant economic recovery," Clinton 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the second and final day of the summit, the group will be joined by 
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, whose role in the meetings is being 
expanded for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders will focus on such sensitive issues as the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the crisis in Haiti and the progress of Russia's economic 
reforms, each holding the potential for further disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The negative reaction to the President's trade proposal came as a jolt after 
Administration officials had built it up under the forward-looking name of 
"Markets 2000" and had portrayed it as evidence of his interest in leading the 
other nations to more open trade practices. When the President arose in Naples 
on Friday morning, he was greeted by a headline in the European edition of the 
Wall Street Journal reading, "Clinton's Trade Plan Puts His Leadership to the 
Test at Summit." 
</P>
<P>
 The President said Saturday evening that all but one participant in the summit 
"said they affirmatively agreed with my trade proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 But as portrayed by representatives of the others at the meeting, it was at 
first politely turned aside and then systematically ripped apart. 
</P>
<P>
 French presidential spokesman Jean Musitelli called the plan "arrogant and 
silly" and said Mitterrand had likened its sudden, last-minute appearance to 
the appearance of "a UFO." The summit participants themselves -- apparently at 
pains not to embarrass the U.S. President -- used more measured language. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems Clinton encountered demonstrate in a foreign setting some of the 
difficulties he has encountered at home: Despite signs of solid economic 
growth, including the creation of 3.8 million jobs since he took office, and 
low inflation, Clinton's standing in opinion polls continues to sag. Similarly, 
the strength of the U.S. economy has not translated into boosting his standing 
among the other leading industrialized democracies at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, when President George Bush attended his final economic summit 
conference, in 1992, the United States had led the world into recession -- it 
was about to turn the corner into a then-unseen recovery -- but Bush's 
leadership was unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
 As portrayed by senior aides, Clinton did not try to press what had been a 
central element in his program here because he thought it was not worth a 
serious argument with Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mitterrand was being Mitterrand," a senior White House official said, 
referring to the French president's reputation for upholding France's 
independent course. The official added, "The President decided, 'Who cares?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But others, in Washington, were sharply critical of Clinton's retreat after he 
advanced the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was being touted as another indication of Clinton taking charge, and the 
G-7 responded. This is his breakthrough? What happened?" said a Republican who 
has been involved in past summits. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials thought they had done the groundwork for the 
proposal, sending out a letter 10 days before the summit spelling out the 
President's plan to each of the other six participants. But in informal talks 
among their aides Friday night, there were private hints of trouble, and 
Saturday the proposal was quickly dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's chief government spokesman, Dieter Vogel, painted a scene in which 
Clinton's proposal was gradually picked apart, at first cautiously and politely 
by Kohl and then in more direct, blunt language by Mitterrand and European 
Union Executive Commission President Jacques Delors. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, the three are by far the most experienced summit participants 
and certainly among the most politically savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, the summit host, also came down hard on the Clinton idea at his 
closing news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 All argued that the plan's ambitious goal, to tackle a whole new set of highly 
emotive trade issues before the dust had settled from last year's bruising 
conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, was at best premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Of far greater importance to Clinton's summit partners, however, was their 
view of his plan as a danger to the delicate and crucial process of ratifying 
the Uruguay Round accord. Delors and Mitterrand reportedly argued that this 
danger is especially strong in some southern European and key developing 
nations, such as India, where approval of the agreement came only after fierce 
political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most nations have yet to go through this process, which they hope to complete 
by January. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the negative reception was swift and final: Less than an hour 
after presenting what White House aides had been billing as the major U.S. 
initiative at the summit, the President was forced to put it back in his 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The final communique contained no mention of either the Clinton plan or the 
ideas central to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Clinton was apparently influenced by the discussions and did not insist," 
Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to various accounts of the incident, which occurred during the 
nearly four-hour morning session, only Major gave Clinton enthusiastic support, 
and Kohl praised some of its ideas before "suggesting" that it was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 During their meeting Saturday, the seven nations did agree on two concrete 
proposals to help Russia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing "deep concern" about the economy of Ukraine, they agreed to provide 
$4 billion in loans over the next two years -- on condition that Ukraine 
"renews its commitment to comprehensive market reform." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ukraine has yet to begin to reform its economy, and its Soviet-style 
system, based on control by the central government, is on the verge of 
collapse. Desperate Ukrainian job-seekers have begun to pour over the Russian 
border, alarming Moscow and the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the summit's aid plan, Clinton has proposed a separate $5-billion 
package for Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the summit approved $200 million to help Ukraine close the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant. European Union leaders have already promised 
$600 million to prevent further radiation leakage from the damaged reactor and 
to bring three other nuclear reactors up to Western standards. The 12-member 
European group wants Washington and Tokyo to kick in $700 million more, 
bringing the total to $1.5 billion -- enough to start the cleanup job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the aid package is likely to satisfy neither Kiev nor Moscow. Ukrainian 
officials have put the cost of a Chernobyl retrofit at up to $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven nations also approved an expansion of the International Monetary 
Fund's lending program, a move that could allow Russia to borrow more than $1 
billion more from the IMF.

S. KOREA PLACES TROOPS ON ALERT; ASIA: A DAY AFTER THE DEATH OF COMMUNIST 
LEADER KIM IL SUNG, SEOUL SAYS IT IS RESPONDING TO SIMILAR ACTION BY NORTH. BUT 
PYONGYANG REMAINS SILENT ON ITS MOVEMENTS, AND CAPITALS APPEAR CALM. 
</P>

<P>
 Suspicion and fear of war returned to South Korea on Saturday as President Kim 
Young Sam put his nation's armed forces on alert immediately after hearing of 
the death of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily life in both Seoul and the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, remained 
normal, however, and officials of the United States, which maintains 37,000 
troops in South Korea, said no signs of military movements had emerged and that 
American forces were not on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat in Seoul also said that fears of an imminent military 
confrontation, or even a significant rise in tensions, were overdrawn. Visual 
inspections showed that the Demilitarized Zone that separates the North and the 
South was "quiet, calm and subdued," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "North Korean soldiers haven't even taken modest precautions to increase 
readiness," the diplomat said. "Across the board, we are not aware of anything 
being done to prepare for military hostilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean alert for its 625,000 soldiers was ordered in response to one 
that Seoul officials said the North ordered earlier in the day. North Korea 
itself made no such announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging the people "to attend to your daily life without concern," Kim Young 
Sam said the South Korean government can "safeguard peace . . . under any 
circumstances. We are well prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 The alert underscored fears of what might happen in secrecy-shrouded North 
Korea now that the Stalinist country has lost the only leader it has had since 
separate governments were set up in the North and the South in 1948. Soviet and 
U.S. occupation forces divided the onetime Japanese colony after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The influence of the 1.1-million-strong North Korean military is expected to 
increase with the demise of the 82-year-old charismatic leader who claimed, in 
propaganda, to have liberated Korea from Japan and who in fact launched the 
bloody 1950-53 Korean War and a series of terrorist attacks against the South 
over the years. Kim's lifelong goal had been to reunify the country under 
Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Communist neighbor China will be one of the countries most affected by Kim Il 
Sung's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the same generation and background as the leaders who have ruled China 
since 1949, Kim was personally close to the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung 
and to current senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who will turn 90 in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the passing away of Comrade Kim Il Sung," Deng said in a statement 
released Saturday night in Beijing by the official New China News Agency, "the 
Korean people lost a great leader and I a close comrade-in-arms and comrade." 
</P>
<P>
 Historians recall that the last generation of Chinese leaders, Mao and Zhou 
En-lai on the mainland and Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, all died during an 
18-month period in 1975-76. Cycles of natural disasters and deaths of elder 
leaders are viewed as ominous signs in Chinese politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his close personal and generational ties, Kim Il Sung's death of a 
reported heart attack Friday is sure to increase speculation about Deng's own 
failing health and the ambitions of those who would replace him. The rapidity 
with which the government released Deng's statement Saturday was intended, in 
part, to quell this speculation by showing that the Chinese leader was up and 
alert to events, including the death of his North Korean friend. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Chinese, another troubling aspect of Kim Il Sung's death is that they 
feel much less comfortable with his eldest son and designated successor, Kim 
Jong Il, than they did with the father. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a public calm about the North Korean nuclear issue, Chinese officials 
are known to be very worried about the prospect of a rogue nuclear power on the 
Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Kim, 52, took what was regarded as the first step Saturday toward 
the dynastic succession that his father had promoted for two decades, as North 
Korea announced that he will head a committee to organize a funeral next 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 No foreigners will be allowed to attend the funeral, the announcement said. 
During a mourning period until the rites, Kim's body will lie in state in the 
Parliament building and all forms of amusement will be banned throughout the 
country. Memorial rites are to be held in all offices and factories, it added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Young Sam said he was disappointed that he would not be able to meet Kim 
Il Sung in what was to have been the first-ever meeting between leaders of the 
North and the South. He had been scheduled to travel to Pyongyang on July 
25-27. 
</P>
<P>
 "(We) were prepared to sit down and discuss peace on the peninsula and the 
future of the two Koreas. It is sad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the North nor the South canceled plans for the summit, but staging it 
appears highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the summit was announced, "we were worried about all that talk of war. 
Then, we were relieved by news of the summit. Now, we are back to worry again," 
a businessman visiting Seoul from Pusan said. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly pedestrian, who said he fled the North during the Korean War, said 
he was worried about "an abrupt incident" occurring. "But who knows? This may 
shorten the time for unification." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pyongyang, a correspondent for Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported that 
citizens were gathering in front of a massive statue of Kim. "Some were 
crying," he said. No military movements or police reinforcements were seen, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden death of Kim, who welcomed former President Jimmy Carter in 
Pyongyang last month, also interrupted talks that had just begun between the 
United States and North Korea in Geneva aimed at resolving doubts about North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. Carter's visit opened the 
door to both the planned Korean summit and the renewal of U.S.-North Korean 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Television footage of the meeting with Carter had shown Kim in high spirits 
and apparent good health. Carter himself described Kim as alert and well 
informed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now visiting Japan, Carter issued a statement urging Kim Jong Il and other 
North Korean leaders to "honor the memory of their country's 'great leader' . . 
. by maintaining the commitment toward peace that (he) made 2 1/2 weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Kim now heads both the armed forces and the Korean Workers' Party 
but had not taken over the third key post in the North -- that of head of 
government, or president. Kim Il Sung, while retaining the presidency, had 
turned over daily operation of the government to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States regularly conducts air surveillance of North Korea, 
intelligence information about politics remains little more than guesswork. 
Knowledge of Kim Jong Il is even more sparse than insights into how the 
government as a whole works. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities of what may happen range from Kim Jong Il launching a war 
against the South to consolidate support within the armed forces to a sudden 
turn toward reform of a stagnating economy that has declined for three 
consecutive years. In between is the possibility of a power struggle among 
figures unknown to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Pessimists, who outnumber the optimists, believe that the son may be even more 
unpredictable than the father. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts in both Washington and Seoul presume Kim Jong Il will succeed his 
father. But the big question is for how long. Forecasts for a short reign -- 
"anywhere from five minutes to five years" -- prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald P. Gregg, former U.S. ambassador in Seoul, has said that South Korea's 
history could suggest a potential scenario for the North. Much as in 1960-61 in 
the South, when an unstable government came into power only to be ousted a year 
later by a coup, Kim Jong Il is likely to lead the country briefly and then be 
ejected by a general, he has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim assumed leadership of the massive military only in December, 1991. How 
much influence he has won with the only force capable of holding the country 
together is unknown. Kim had never served in the army until his father named 
him to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, some analysts have noted that Kim's status as his father's 
anointed heir makes him the only possible leader who can bring legitimacy to a 
new government. To protect its own prerogatives and status, the ruling group 
needs at least his name, if not his actual decision-making power, these 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 A minority of experts have pointed out that the shroud of secrecy over North 
Korea has produced "a tendency to demonize the son and short-circuit careful 
analysis." Actually, Kim Jong Il has been associated with attempts to bring 
about economic reform since the early 1980s, they say.

DEATH PENALTY UNLIKELY FOR SIMPSON, EXPERTS SAY; TRIAL: COMBINATION OF FACTORS 
ARE CITED, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT SPOUSAL MURDER CASES RARELY DRAW CAPITAL 
PUNISHMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The odds are high that the Los Angeles district attorney's office will not 
seek the death penalty against O.J. Simpson, according to prosecutors, criminal 
defense lawyers and other death penalty specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal experts offer a variety of reasons for their prediction, even though 
Simpson is among the group most likely to be charged with capital murder and 
sentenced to death -- African Americans accused of killing whites. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons why he likely will be an exception: He does not have a 
lengthy criminal history. He has been a national hero. It has become 
increasingly difficult for prosecutors to obtain the death penalty in Los 
Angeles County. Seeking the death penalty might make it more difficult to 
garner a conviction. His execution would leave two young children of one of the 
victims without a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, the death penalty is rarely imposed in spousal murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, of the 2,812 men on Death Row nationwide, only 34, or 1.2%, killed 
their wives or ex-wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to speak directly on the Simpson case, veteran prosecutor 
Frank E. Sundstedt, who chairs the special death penalty committee in the 
district attorney's office, said the office is mindful of that statistical 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult to obtain a first-degree murder conviction in any 
domestic violence case," Sundstedt said. "To the extent that you need some 
basis for a 'special circumstance' in order to have the defendant eligible for 
the death penalty, that has to be taken into consideration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law is explicit about which murders are so horrifying that a jury can 
consider the death penalty. There are 19 such "special circumstances," 
including the murders of a police officer or firefighter, murder for financial 
gain, murder by bomb -- and multiple murders, as charged in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to receive the death sentence, Simpson must be convicted of at least 
one count of first-degree murder, meaning that it was premeditated. The jury 
also would have to confirm the special circumstance allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he were convicted of the slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson 
and her friend Ronald L. Goldman -- many attorneys stressed that it would be 
rare for the death penalty to be imposed on Simpson, a nationally known figure 
who for years has been held in high public esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of anyone so beloved who has faced the death penalty," said 
Santa Monica defense lawyer Gigi Gordon, who specializes in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel most comfortable sentencing someone to death when we can reduce their 
whole life to a single act of brutal violence," and that simply would not 
happen with the former Heisman Trophy-winning USC tailback, said Bryan 
Stevenson, director of the Alabama Capital Representation Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're forced to see the defendant as something more than the criminal 
act, it becomes much harder to say, 'We're going to kill you.' O.J. Simpson has 
the advantage of being known for something other than allegedly killing his 
wife and another person. The other things he is known for are very human 
things, very endearing things, the kind of things that would you make feel loss 
or sorrow if he were dead," Stevenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way that a jury is going to return a death judgment against O.J. 
Simpson," said defense lawyer Barry Levin, a former Los Angeles police officer 
who has handled nine capital cases. "Having had a substantial amount of 
experience in this area, what it boils down to is the only way a jury will kill 
your client is if he is a complete animal, they hate him." 
</P>
<P>
 On several occasions, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has asserted that Simpson's 
popularity will make it more difficult to obtain a conviction. Moreover, 
Simpson's life history would be a very real factor in any assessment of whether 
the death penalty should be imposed against him, if he were convicted of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, after Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell 
bound Simpson over for trial, Garcetti said one of the first decisions his 
office has to make is whether to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most cases, Garcetti will be involved in the decision-making process in 
the Simpson case. That process promises to be a veritable minefield for him, 
said Loyola law school professor Laurie Levenson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't ask for the death penalty, there will be a clamor that this is 
special treatment for a celebrity. But if he does, there will be the 
traditional claims that it is arbitrary . . . used against people of a 
particular race. Either way, there's going to be criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 He faces a formidable critic in Los Angeles defense lawyer Leslie Abramson, a 
vocal opponent of the death penalty who represents Erik Menendez, 23, one of 
the two brothers who have admitted shotgunning their parents to death in their 
Beverly Hills home in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate Van Nuys juries deadlocked in January between murder and lesser 
manslaughter charges against Erik Menendez and his brother Lyle, 26. The 
district attorney's office has said it will retry both brothers and is still 
seeking the death penalty against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the district attorney's office to ask for the death penalty 
against O.J. Simpson -- I am personally very sympathetic to him -- but if they 
don't, I will make them come into court and explain why they are trying to kill 
the abused Menendez boys," Abramson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson situation is particularly tricky because of the current stance of 
the prosecutors and his lawyers, said Los Angeles defense lawyer Bradley W. 
Brunon. "The defense is maintaining Simpson didn't do it. The prosecution is 
maintaining that he did it in a very calculated manner." 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, Brunon said, he thought it was possible that the district 
attorney's office might initially ask for the death penalty but ultimately 
reverse field, after further evidence about the case unfolds. "They could 
change their mind gracefully and go for life without possibility of parole or a 
straight life sentence," Brunon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most death penalty specialists said they believed that Garcetti simply 
will not opt for the death penalty at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 For strategic reasons, it might be easier to secure a conviction if jurors do 
not have to consider the "specter" of the death penalty, UCLA criminal law 
professor Peter Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands now, the Simpson case "is a domestic homicide case and sadly not 
an uncommon one," said Stanford University criminal law professor Robert 
Weisberg. And in the overwhelming number of such cases, it is difficult to 
obtain the first-degree murder conviction that is a prerequisite for the death 
penalty, Weisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, he said, the only exceptions are when one spouse kills another to 
try to profit from an insurance policy or when one spouse hires a hit man to 
murder a mate. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills defense lawyer Jeffrey R. Brodey said his own experience in 
recent years shows how unusual it would be for the district attorney's office 
to seek death in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Brodey said he has represented six people accused of double murders; in five 
of the six cases, the prosecutor sought death. The only time the district 
attorney's office didn't go for the ultimate penalty was a case of a man 
murdering his wife and her lover, Brodey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went into his wife's place of business and shot her. Then he walked down 
the street a short way and went into the (lover's) business and shot him." 
Without any persuasion from him, the district attorney's office decided against 
seeking the death penalty, and Brodey said the fact that it was a spousal 
homicide was the critical factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said from the beginning this is not a death case." Rather, the 
prosecutor sought life without possibility of parole. Brodey argued that his 
client acted in the heat of passion when he shot his wife and that he "was 
still in the grips of rage," when he shot the lover. The jury returned two 
verdicts of second-degree murder and Brodey's client received a sentence of 20 
years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, several defense lawyers said they had represented defendants in 
multiple homicides in Los Angeles where the district attorney's office did not 
seek death. They said Garcetti could present numerous such examples if he is 
accused of giving Simpson special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would be favoritism" for a celebrity if Garcetti asked for 
life in this case, Gordon said. "The death penalty is reserved for the worst of 
the worst. What the general public doesn't understand is there is a hierarchy 
of murderers -- people who kill police officers, serial murderers, child 
killers. The death penalty has to be reserved for those people." 
</P>
<P>
 The way to San Quentin starts with Section 190.2 of the California Penal Code. 
Though the law sets forth the 19 explicit special circumstances that can 
justify the death penalty, it actually is not explicit enough. It does not say, 
for instance, that conviction for multiple murder must lead to execution -- 
only that it may. 
</P>
<P>
 Because capital cases are far more expensive than ordinary murder trials, the 
law thus presents prosecutors in each of the state's 58 counties with a 
dilemma. They must do what the law does not -- decide which cases deserve the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 As could be expected, guidelines and practices vary from county to county. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego County, for example, Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr. decides when 
to pursue the death penalty. So does Arlo Smith, the district attorney of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, it used to be that one man also made the decision -- 
Curt Livesay, who was a senior prosecutor under former Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner 
and others. Near the end of Reiner's term, Greg Thompson, another veteran 
deputy, took over the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, however, who took office in December, 1992, has opted for a 
different system. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Thursday morning, in a conference room on the 18th floor of the Downtown 
Criminal Courts Building, eight veteran prosecutors -- an all-white, all-male 
group since its lone woman member became a federal judge -- review those murder 
cases headed for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue is whether special circumstances are still appropriate. If so, 
the next decision is whether to pursue a penalty of death or life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the eight weigh in with comments. Then, as before, one person makes 
the decision -- Sundstedt, the head of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The input is "exceedingly helpful," Sundstedt said. But he added, "It is not a 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 A case comes to the committee after several steps up the organizational 
ladder. The trial deputies -- in the Simpson case, Marcia Clark and William 
Hodgman -- will write an internal memorandum that sets forth the facts, 
analyzes the law and urges the committee to choose either life or death. 
</P>
<P>
 Various supervisors will review that memo. Two weeks before the committee 
meets, the defense is invited to supply in writing any information it wishes to 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Garcetti said that Simpson's attorneys will be afforded the chance 
to submit mitigating material. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Sundstedt said, committee members are unanimous in their opinions. 
But debate is often spirited, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the decision is made to opt for death, Sundstedt said, that is it -- 
although presumably, in this case, Garcetti will have the last word. 
</P>
<P>
 Only once have defense lawyers been granted an appeal of that decision, and 
that was just a few days before jury selection began last year in the Menendez 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 That appeal was unsuccessful. Sundstedt said he felt obligated to meet with 
the Menendez defense lawyers because they had not otherwise had the opportunity 
to submit material to the committee. "They were not given special treatment 
because of the Menendez case," he said. "It was just a timing deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Because far more homicides occur in Los Angeles County than anywhere else in 
California, Sundstedt said, the committee is kept busy, usually reviewing two, 
sometimes three or four cases each week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, he said, the committee looked at 200 cases. It opted to pursue the 
death penalty in 35, about 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 Since not all of those 35 cases have been completed, it remains to be seen how 
many death verdicts will be returned. Charles A. Gessler, a veteran Los Angeles 
County deputy public defender, estimated that juries come back with a death 
verdict in only about 10% of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming majority of such cases involve those in which the victim is a 
stranger, or at least someone who does not have a long, emotional involvement 
with the killer, because jurors find such cases frightening, Stanford's 
Weisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where prosecutors also use a committee system, the panel 
reviewed 20 cases last year. It opted to pursue the death penalty in two, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King, who heads the homicide unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alameda County, where Dist. Atty. John J. Meehan heads the committee, the 
panel looked last year at 10 cases. It opted to ask for death in three, said 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Jim Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the figures in Los Angeles County far exceed anywhere in the state 
-- and, according to the state Department of Corrections, there are more 
murderers among the 383 inmates on Death Row from Los Angeles County than 
anywhere else, 112. The runner-up is Alameda County: 29. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Sundstedt said: "I don't believe that the office willy-nilly seeks the 
death penalty on defendants in Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, he said, actually is opting to pursue death far less often than 
during the Reiner years. In the three years before Garcetti took over, 
Sundstedt said, Los Angeles prosecutors asked for death an average of 53 times 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Through July 1 of this year, Sundstedt said, the committee has reviewed 86 
cases and opted to ask for death 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 cases, according to Sundstedt, include allegations of murder by arson, 
the kidnap murder of a child, the killing of a mother and daughter, the murder 
of two police officers -- and several cases involving allegations of multiple 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far and away" the largest category of death penalty cases, Sundstedt said, 
are robbery-murders. Next, he said, are multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think multiple homicides is one of the considerations that most often 
justifies seeking the death penalty and it is one of the ones most persuasive 
to juries," said Dane Gillette, head of the state attorney general's death 
penalty unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have more than one body, that makes a difference in how the case is 
charged, how it is tried and how it is viewed if they go to a penalty phase." 
</P>
<P>
 While compelling, that factor alone, however, is not enough. The reality, 
several prosecutors said, is that there is no magic formula for deciding that 
it's right to give a jury the option of choosing death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously you have to have some way of differentiating, and it is difficult, 
because every murder involves the death of a human being," Sundstedt said. "But 
the fact remains: every robbery-murder is not a death case." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid it's a bit like pornography," said Michael Tranbarger, an 
assistant Los Angeles district attorney and one of the eight on the committee. 
"It's hard to describe, but I know it when I see it." 
</P>
<P>
 If a crime seems particularly vicious, prosecutors consider that a significant 
aggravating factor. The age and what several prosecutors called the "quality" 
of the victim also play a critical role. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim is a most important thing," said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Peter Bozanich, who also is a member of the committee. "If you've got children, 
watch out -- the jury really wants a piece of that guy. . . . If it's a drug 
dealer, the jury thinks, 'Ah, he's got it coming,' which is really logical." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson was the mother of two small children and her friend, Goldman, 
was a waiter at a trendy Brentwood restaurant. In the normal sense of how these 
cases are evaluated, attorneys made plain, they would be considered 
"high-quality victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Also critical, prosecutors said, is the defendant's background. A particularly 
violent past tends to tip the scale toward seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say you've got a 35-year-old defendant with a long and sordid past," 
said another assistant Los Angeles district attorney on the committee, R. Dan 
Murphy. "This guy has had 20 years to learn and he still hasn't gotten it 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson, of course, has only the single blemish on his record, the 1989 
no contest plea in Municipal Court to charges he beat his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 It just seems improbable that Simpson could face the death penalty, said a 
member of the committee who asked to remain unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than this incident," the committee member said, referring to the 
slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman, "there's a perception 
that he's had an exemplary life. Never underestimate the power of perceptions." 
Death Penalty Panel 
</P>
<P>
 These are the eight members of the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
Special Circumstances Committee. All are veteran prosecutors who decide whether 
the office will pursue the death penalty in murder cases. Review of the O.J. 
Simpson case is still weeks away. When the committee takes up the matter, one 
member, William Hodgman, will not take part because he is a prosecutor on the 
case. However, in an unusual move, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti will take part in 
the decision.

COLUMN ONE; FOCUS ON SIMPSON TROUBLING FOR BLACKS; CONSTANT SCRUTINY HAS MADE 
HIM A LIGHTNING ROD FOR THORNY ISSUES OF RACE, CLASS AND PRIVILEGE. AFRICAN 
AMERICANS FIND THEIR LOYALTIES ARE DIVIDED, AND OLD WOUNDS ARE REOPENED.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an unlikely setting for a salon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the electronics section of the Broadway department store in the 
Crenshaw-Baldwin Hills Plaza, a small group of African American men and women 
stand transfixed by a wall of murmuring televisions. More than two dozen images 
moving in unison display a larger-than-life O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Some comment on the white band of his stiff collar, the crisp lines of his 
dark suit, the sleek matinee-idol profile. The commentary is punctuated with 
"too bads" and "how sads" -- each statement delivered in a tone that suggests 
they are viewing not a defendant but a corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond Simpson's innocence or guilt, beyond expressions of sympathy or sadness 
for the bereaved, beyond the public obsession with the melodrama, for many 
African Americans the Simpson saga brings up a host of thorny, unresolved 
issues -- about race, about class and about privilege. It opens old psychic 
wounds. The ubiquitous image of Simpson sitting silently in a courtroom is both 
a blow and a rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a recent Times poll and a USA Today survey show that African 
Americans are nearly twice as likely as whites to sympathize with Simpson, a 
subterranean dialogue is gaining steady momentum. At informal meeting places 
around the city and the country -- from barber and beauty shops, to bus stops 
and cafes, to racquetball courts and sunny breakfast tables -- another hearing 
of sorts is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell's decision Friday that Simpson 
should be tried for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her 
friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, race had begun to emerge from the shadows. It was 
beginning to find shape and form near the center of discussion about the case, 
especially among African Americans. It moved from private conversations and 
radio talk shows into a more public sphere. And once the subject of race 
arrives, many believe, the specter of racism is sure to follow, finding its 
voice not in shouts but in whispers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people call it the "hidden issue." Some pointedly argue that it is not an 
issue at all. Still others believe it was from the beginning -- and will always 
be -- at the center of any high-profile event or small incident that involves a 
person of color. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Simpson it is more complicated than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people regardless of their color who hit such a celebrity 
status they transcend the issue of race," said Dr. Kwaku Person-Lynn, who 
teaches African American Studies at Cal State Dominguez Hills. "When you go 
above and beyond, that tends to diffuse the issue of race. . . . And the fact 
that he is so associated with the white world, he is not a threat. He is not 
one of them, but yet he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as with so much of American culture, race is a lens that focuses or 
distorts the world in a particular way. And for many African Americans, the 
Simpson debate is seen through that very prism. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want him to be innocent," said Michael Hughes, a West Los 
Angeles-based psychotherapist. "I think the way that wish manifests itself is 
different in white people than in black people. I think . . . it's easy for 
white people to put race out of their minds. I don't mean that nastily, but I 
don't think any of us want to be burdened. But I don't think that a black 
person doesn't wake up any day and not reckon with being black. I don't think 
white people share that same concern at the same degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Even black people who were not especially fond of Simpson have empathized with 
his plight. Kathy, 39, who asked that her last name not be used, says that, 
from the beginning, she believed it was going to be "a race thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since watching the case I really feel sorry for him," she said, spoon-feeding 
her niece a chocolate sundae at the Crenshaw mall. "I blame the media. It's a 
conspiracy to keep black people down. First it was Clarence Thomas. Then Mike 
Tyson. Michael Jackson. Rodney King." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's "hero" status, his place as an icon, especially among African 
Americans, adds another dimension to the debate. But as the weeks pass, Simpson 
becomes less a hero and more a symbol. A catalyst. A scapegoat, a lightning 
rod. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a writer and a member of the media. I take this in stride," said Ellis 
Cose, a contributing editor at Newsweek and author of "The Rage of a Privileged 
Class." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's different on the street: 'Jesus, why are they going after this black 
man? . . . That's what happens when a black man tries to be white,' " Cose 
said. "I'm also hearing a lot of people saying that it sort of serves him right 
for turning his back on the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Cose sees it as an intriguingly complex case of schizophrenia. "There are a 
lot of (black) people who don't identify with him, they think he abandoned the 
community. But they are invested in his well-being somehow. If O.J. is guilty, 
then somehow they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is," Cose said, "part of the cross that minorities bear. And it goes back 
to that sense of being on probation in America. It either expiates you or 
deepens your misery." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Cose feels that the Simpson case, on its face, has very little to 
do with race. But it plays a large part in the way many African Americans are 
reacting to the media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, many reactions -- from unconditional support to condemnation -- 
weren't based so much on a particular transgression -- but on what many thought 
might lie around the corner. Vivid memories and cautionary tales -- like that 
of Emmett Till, who was lynched in 1955 in Mississippi for whistling at a white 
woman -- are slow to recede; they fuel suspicion, spur dialogue. When Time 
magazine darkened the image of Simpson on its June 27 cover, the proverbial 
smoking gun surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Media have attempted to tip-toe around the race issue, Cose said, for a couple 
of reasons. "We've spent 40 years dealing with race, and people want to get it 
off the table. . . . (People) tend to be very polite and very nervous about 
race. And very correct. The first inclination of the responsible media is to 
play it as straight as they can, bend over backward to make race not a factor. 
The irony is," Cose said, "that it is coming through the back door." 
</P>
<P>
 Many African Americans tend to see the Simpson panorama -- from media and law 
enforcement to something as quietly powerful as the loaded language of the 
public discourse -- a shade differently. Diligently scanning for the subliminal 
messages, early on they saw the harbingers of worse things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "My buttons were pushed when O.J. was handcuffed initially, not as (a) suspect 
but a person who may be able to provide information," said Westwood-based 
attorney George L. Mallory Jr. "I don't want to suggest that this is all 
racial, but having served as a prosecutor, I realized that at that stage, O.J. 
was not a suspect. It wasn't appropriate to put on the handcuffs . . . he was 
going to speak to police, he was not combative. The handcuffs illustrated at an 
early stage that the LAPD were inappropriately exercising their discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Wiley, a former sports journalist and author of the book "What Black 
People Should Do Now," says it's what didn't happen in those early days that 
gave him pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I first noticed was that I saw an African American man be treated as a 
man in the American justice system. I thought I was living in an alternate 
universe," Wiley said. "I've never seen the police take the handcuffs off a 
black murder suspect. To see that. In some ways O.J. is a paradigm. I wish the 
American justice system would treat everyone the way that they treated O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions became more vocal as media coverage picked up steam: the omnipresent 
mug shot, the nonstop footage of O.J. Simpson at the pinnacle (Nicole Brown 
Simpson smiling in the background), now juxtaposed against the duly subdued and 
somber man in cuffs. For some, the haunting parade of unsettling images revived 
dormant ghosts and opened old wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we have a black man with power the system along with the media has 
to take them down," said Ronald Mathis, modeling one of his wares -- a black 
T-shirt emblazoned with a visage of Simpson in his glory days -- and the 
message: "Save O.J. We Believe in You." Mathis is staked out at the corner of 
Temple and Spring Downtown selling T-shirts ($10) and caps ($5) at a brisk 
clip. "They're just blowing it all out of proportion. Just want to take a black 
man down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others feel it is a bit more complex than that. "The Time and Newsweek covers 
did it for me," said Muhammad Nassardeen, founder of the Inglewood-based 
Recycling Black Dollars community improvement organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand marketing and I understand imagery, so when those hit the 
newsstand, I thought: 'Wow, they are really playing games.' And 'A Trail of 
Blood,' it was a horrible caption," said Nassardeen of Newsweek's June 27 
cover. "I thought it was just as bad as the Time cover, but (that one) had a 
sensitive caption: 'An American Tragedy.' Just think if you were a white person 
and the only black person that you saw was with a broom or was a caddy, and now 
this. That was about fear. They think: 'Wow, we should be afraid of them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nassardeen, however, says he wants to be careful about choosing the cause, 
lest the import of the message be lessened. "We need balance in the portrait of 
the African American. I don't want to be running around screaming, carrying the 
racism flag, anytime that an African American does anything that hurts us," he 
said. "We can not allow ourselves to be tied with Darryl Strawberry's drugs, or 
O.J.'s problems. We can't become victims of a myopic view. We have to step back 
and look at the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 He echoes Cose's observation about African Americans feeling as if they are on 
probation, viewed as a group rather than as individuals. For many, the stakes 
feel, and are, high. And sometimes the most intense pressure comes from within 
the ranks. "I'm really saddened by it as a person who's basically committed to 
African and African American images," said Nassardeen. "This, this is a major 
blow." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia A. Turner, a professor of African American Studies at UC Davis, tells 
a story that many African Americans would find familiar. "When I was a little 
girl a series of murders were committed in our town. . . . I remember my 
parents hoping and praying the killer wasn't black," Turner recalled. "This was 
in the early days of the civil rights movement. . . . We didn't want anything 
to happen that would set Martin Luther King back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that I don't think many white people understand," Turner 
said. "Like the murder of Polly Klaas wasn't looked at as a blow against the 
white race. But the faults of one of us are viewed as blows against all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 As with many minority groups, shrugging off those reflexive responses requires 
peeling off layers of expectations and warnings passed down through 
generations. And as Florida-based clinical psychologist Na'im Akbar notes, the 
more public the figure, the more prevalent the tendency to reach out and 
protect the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very protective of our celebrities," Akbar said. "We are protective of 
anyone who gains visibility . . . and the reason being that there are so few of 
us who do. When they do gain prominence, it is usually for some negative 
reason," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a high-profile individual takes a tumble, the reverberations are 
particularly intense within black circles: "When they become tainted in some 
way, then their shortcomings become equated with the whole black community," 
Akbar said. "And as long as the person is a black hero when they are tainted, 
their taint is a direct consequence of them being African American." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Simpson's complicated public persona that make unconditional 
allegiances complex: His second wife and a string of white girlfriends, golf 
games at the country club, the symbols of landed (read: white) gentry. 
</P>
<P>
 That has made fully embracing Simpson difficult for some African Americans. 
Even the terms "transcendence" and "colorlessness" have been used by supporters 
and detractors alike. A transcendence that raised his profile and rallied 
support from all hues; yet a colorlessness that made some African Americans 
wonder of late, aloud, if he "forgot where he came from." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think O.J. was universally accepted," said attorney Mallory. "O.J. had 
really, at least in his mind -- and probably in the mind of others -- in some 
sense transcended race, and I think that in some part because O.J. was never 
really viewed as an individual intricately involved in the black community. 
Therefore, blacks and whites somehow became more tolerant of O.J.'s lifestyle 
-- which was non-threatening to either ethnic group," Mallory said. "I think 
the commercials more than anything else brought him into mainstream America. 
And his image somewhat endeared him to the hearts of Middle America because of 
his non-threatening style." 
</P>
<P>
 Treading a line between two worlds upped the psychological ante, said 
Person-Lynn of Cal State Dominguez Hills. "O.J. Simpson has been, and has not 
been part of the African American psyche, so to speak. And so we've embraced 
him as our own. As an African American man, we don't want to see him abused; we 
will close ranks." But he added, careful not to shroud the crucial particulars 
of the case, "we want to see him . . . treated fairly, if he is innocent. If he 
is guilty . . . we want to see him punished." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ralph Wiley views it through a slightly different prism -- beyond race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hero worshipers feel betrayed," Wiley said. " 'Juice' became what people 
expected him to be. That's what causes these things, this abuse of power, 
corruption of power." 
</P>
<P>
 Power and class , said Joe Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some degree Simpson's celebrity status placed him above. He ran across our 
TV screen for years playing football, then ran across our TV screens in the car 
rental commercials. His celebrity status allowed him to be viewed as a 
celebrity -- who happened to be black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that race has anything to do with this," Hicks said, "except 
among some peripheral people around some communities. I think it's a discussion 
trying to seep its way out of this talk show circuit, suck out some bigger 
issues. The longer (the case) goes, it gives people time for their minds to 
sink back into different modes and issues, to develop some sort of racial 
posture, so that the races both black and white can snipe at each other." 
</P>
<P>
 To Hicks, class speaks louder than race in this instance. "It points up the 
degree to which money can buy you some justice in America. He has the ability 
and the money to hire himself a battery of defense attorneys that a normal 
person couldn't even dream of. Justice is clearly a class issue -- this is not 
about a black man married to a white woman. I certainly don't see this." 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion of race also obscures another issue central to the debate -- 
domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Simpson pleaded no contest to charges of spousal battery. "In 
'89 was when we should have helped the brother out," said Gary Phillips, a 
local writer and activist. "Here was a man who by his own admission beat his 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot divorce the issue of race, Phillips said, "but there is another 
reality there too. It really raises this debate around men. Do we start to deal 
with this whole question of wife beating? Do we as men confront that? Call your 
friends on something that they might be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But even a youngster who raised the question of domestic abuse saw at the core 
an issue of disparity and unequal treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it just isn't fair," said Brandy, 11, taking a break from shopping 
with her mother at the Crenshaw mall. "It isn't fair because it's happening 
here all the time -- women getting beaten, killed. But when it happens over in 
that area," she said, gesturing toward a vague expanse, "then they do something 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 And that issue most ruffles Kimberle Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry I don't think that that many people were that invested in O.J., and 
therein lies the rub for me," said Crenshaw, a UCLA law professor. "My own set 
of concerns goes along the gender lines -- to circle the wagons around gender. 
But you don't see a similar kind of concern when it comes to black women." 
</P>
<P>
 The black community was lukewarm when it came to Lani Guinier and Anita Hill, 
she says. "And we're about to have the most Draconian welfare reforms which 
(will affect) black women, and I don't see a lot of people rallying around to 
support those women. Though a lot of us were raised by single black women." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw wants to push people to examine other hidden issues tangential to 
race, but intraracial in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 But airing issues that suggest disharmony in the black community, especially 
those of gender equity, often gets viewed as diluting the cause, breaking ranks 
or airing dirty laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't mind if we had a washing machine inside" and cleaned up the 
problems, Crenshaw said. "It's just that I don't like sleeping on dirty 
sheets."

NEWS ANALYSIS; DEATH LEAVES U.S. ACROSS TABLE FROM UNKNOWN FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung could not have come at a worse 
time for the United States in its efforts to stop Pyongyang from acquiring 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 It means that the leadership in Pyongyang will be struggling to sort out its 
internal politics over the next few crucial months -- just when North Korea is 
facing major decisions about the future of its nuclear program, about the 
disposal of highly radioactive nuclear fuel and, more generally, about its 
relations with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong Il, emerges in control in Pyongyang, he will 
usher in the world's first Communist dynasty. No other Communist leader has 
ever passed on power to a child. At the very least, that transition will mean 
months of uncertainty for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if Kim Jong Il takes the reins of power, we won't know for a while how 
solid his leadership is or whether he will last," Leonard Spector, a nuclear 
specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Saturday. 
"Clearly, there's a faction in Pyongyang that wants to push this (nuclear 
weapons program) forward." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it may be one of history's unending ironies that Kim's death is being 
greeted by the United States with more than a little regret. 
</P>
<P>
 When President Clinton, at an economic summit in Naples, Italy, expressed 
"sincere condolences" to the people of North Korea about Kim's death, he was 
being more than just polite. The North Korean leader who has been viewed since 
the beginning of the Cold War as one of America's leading adversaries became, 
in his final days, the man with whom U.S. policy-makers hoped to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Kim had fought one bloody war against the United States and its South 
Korean allies and staunchly opposed U.S. policy in Asia for more than four 
decades. But he was considered the only one in Pyongyang with the 
unchallengeable authority needed to cut off North Korea's developing nuclear 
weapons program before it destabilizes the entire region of East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the plight the United States and its principal allies in the region, 
Japan and South Korea, now find themselves in: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Saturday, talks in Geneva between the United States and North Korea about 
the nuclear program were temporarily halted, only a day after they had started. 
In a startling symbol of their disarray, North Korean negotiators apparently 
found out about Kim's death when a U.S. official woke up one of his 
counterparts in the early morning hours and told him to turn on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even if the talks start up again, they may not go anywhere for a while. 
Kim's death means that North Korea could well have either erratic leadership 
under Kim Jong Il or an unstable or paralyzed leadership over the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't know what impact this will have on our discussions," Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci said Saturday. He said U.S. officials 
will stay in Geneva and "try to resume the talks, if that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * Meanwhile, thousands of highly radioactive nuclear fuel rods, enough to make 
about five bombs, are cooling off in pools alongside North Korea's 25-megawatt 
nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. Something has to be done with them within the next 
few months before they begin to corrode. 
</P>
<P>
 If arrangements the United States is seeking for the disposal of this spent 
fuel are not made at the Geneva talks, then the rods could well be turned into 
weapons-grade plutonium at North Korea's reprocessing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 * And even if the immediate crisis involving the fuel rods is resolved, the 
new North Korean leadership will have to be persuaded to give up its other 
nuclear installations, including a reprocessing plant and a huge, 200-megawatt 
reactor now under construction at Yongbyon, which could produce enough 
plutonium for eight to 10 nuclear weapons a year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to David Albright of the Institute for Science and International 
Security, the earliest possible start-up date for this larger reactor is late 
1995, although Defense Secretary William J. Perry said recently that the new 
reactor will take a few more years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate worry for U.S. policy-makers is that North Korea will succeed in 
turning its plutonium into usable nuclear weapons. As far as U.S. officials 
know, that hasn't happened yet; there is no sign North Korea has tested any 
nuclear device. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it does, Asian neighbors such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan could 
try to develop nuclear weapons too. And other nations with active nuclear 
programs, such as Iran, could follow North Korea's example by successfully 
defying the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the international regime that 
seeks to prohibit any new nations from joining the nuclear club. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range problem is even worse -- that North Korea will not only make 
its own nuclear weapons but use its facilities to produce nuclear fuel for 
export to such potential customers as Iran, Iraq and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of these gloomy prospects, what hope does the Clinton 
Administration have for peacefully defusing the North Korean crisis? 
</P>
<P>
 First, it is possible that Kim Jong Il may turn out to be something less than 
the demon that Western intelligence agencies have depicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western analysts have suggested that Kim Jong Il favors a greater degree 
of economic reform than his father permitted. Maybe he had the world's worst 
case of the monarchical syndrome in which children of dynastic leaders are 
forced to wait until well into middle age to take over a parent's throne. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, the available evidence suggests that Kim Jong Il is not just 
some North Korean version of England's Prince Charles. Intelligence specialists 
believe that the younger Kim has been directly responsible for acts of 
terrorism, including the 1983 bombing in Burma, now Myanmar, that killed 17 
South Korean officials and the bombing of a South Korean airliner in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A second possibility for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear crisis is that 
someone else in Pyongyang may take over the reins of power instead of Kim Jong 
Il. This scenario, however, carries its own dangers. Korean history is replete 
with examples of bloody power struggles and coups. No one wants civil war or 
chaos in a country with North Korea's nuclear potential. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, U.S. intelligence agencies have been bitterly 
divided over the question of whether there are competing factions within North 
Korea's seemingly monolithic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials, and some outside experts on North Korea, have long 
argued that there are reformers and hard-liners in Pyongyang. According to this 
line of argument, the reformers are eager to bargain away the nuclear program 
for diplomatic recognition and economic help. 
</P>
<P>
 But other U.S. intelligence specialists at the CIA and the Pentagon contend 
that the differences within the North Korean leadership are minimal and that it 
is misleading to talk of any serious "reform" faction in Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 These analysts believe that Kim Jong Il and other North Korean leaders have no 
intention of bargaining away their nuclear program, because they see nuclear 
weapons as a guarantee of their own survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration now faces a number of tricky foreign-policy 
questions concerning North Korea that extend well beyond the nuclear dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, suppose Kim Jong Il makes a bid for international recognition of 
his leadership, perhaps by offering to meet with U.S. officials or by going 
forward with the summit meeting with South Korea later this month that his 
father had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the United States try to deal with him and encourage its allies to do 
so, at the risk of giving him the sort of legitimacy that could help him 
consolidate his power? Or should the Administration hold back and avoid Kim 
Jong Il, at the risk of alienating him permanently? 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, the Clinton Administration seems to be trying to avoid 
confronting that decision. The written statement issued by the President on 
Saturday sent condolences "to the people of North Korea" and did not mention 
Kim Jong Il. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, our (the United States') job is to keep things just as cool as 
possible," Spector of the Carnegie Endowment said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before long, the United States is going to have to make some choices. Just 
when the Clinton Administration hoped it might have a chance through the Geneva 
talks of easing the crisis over North Korea, the problem seems to be growing 
bigger rather than smaller.

SUPERFUND'S BIGGEST MESS MAY BE IN THE COURTHOUSE; LITIGATION: TOXIC CLEANUP 
HAS BEEN SLOWED BY A MORASS OF COSTLY LAWSUITS. LEGAL REFORM PLAN DRAWS WIDE 
SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the lucrative world of corporate law, the word inspires dreams of shiny new 
BMWs, of vacations to Cancun and of billable hours mounting year after 
prosperous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The word is Superfund. It is the nickname given the 1980 law designed to clean 
up thousands of polluted sites across the nation -- from abandoned landfills to 
manufacturing sites, mines and even federal facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For many lawyers, who have been called "wizards of ooze" because of their 
roles in litigating Superfund cases, the law has been mother's milk. 
</P>
<P>
 By the best available estimate -- that of the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. 
think tank -- fully 40 cents of every dollar spent on such projects has gone 
not to clean up toxic waste but to pay lawyers' fees and other costs of 
litigation. And those dollars are staggering: The federal government alone 
spends nearly $1.6 billion annually on Superfund. And private industry is 
believed to spend several times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more demonstrative of the problem: The House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee estimated in 1990 that the insurance industry and its clients 
spend about $500 million in legal costs annually wrangling over liability for 
Superfund cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the system -- including the Clinton Administration -- contend that 
the slow pace of the work is directly attributable to the tangled web of 
litigation that can stall progress on a project for years while it ensnares the 
federal government, corporate polluters, insurance companies and -- 
occasionally -- hapless bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only 237 of the 1,344 toxic waste sites deemed in need of emergency 
cleanup have been declared clean and safe. In coming weeks, Congress, prodded 
by the Administration, is moving to complete a sweeping reform of Superfund 
law. And while the effort is designed to tackle an array of perceived problems, 
the primary focus is on stemming unintended legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The purveyors of reform argue that the stakes are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 One out of four Americans lives within four miles of a toxic waste site slated 
for cleanup under the program. California, with 96 sites on the Superfund list, 
has one of the largest shares of polluted sites in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the health of citizens, jobs also hang in the balance -- not just for 
high-priced lawyers but for entire communities, the Administration contends. 
Almost 20% of Superfund projects are located in urban areas. But even after 
such sites have been declared clean, they remain legally poisonous to many 
potential buyers because, under current Superfund law, purchasers of such sites 
assume liability for past pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, most of these sites remain fenced off, while surrounding 
neighborhoods -- many in minority communities -- go without the jobs they need 
desperately. Meanwhile, businesses looking for operating sites are moving out 
to suburban "greenways," where woods and open farmland are cleared -- and then 
lost -- to establish new industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Horror stories about the legal entanglements of Superfund cases abound. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Kalamazoo, Mich., the Upjohn Co., a major pharmaceuticals firm, was named 
by the Environmental Protection Agency as the party responsible for the 
$20-million cost of cleaning up a toxic landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to spread the cost among other polluters, Upjohn wrote letters 
threatening to sue 741 parties that had dumped trash in the landfill. They 
ranged from Flipse's Flower Shop to the Milwood Little League. Even the mother 
of William Parfet, Upjohn's president at the time, couldn't escape the 
company's dragnet. Martha Parfet, chairwoman of Gilmore Bros. department store 
in downtown Kalamazoo, received a letter from Upjohn notifying her that the 
trash the store had put out on the curb could make it liable for a share of the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the case of the Hardage Landfill in Criner, Okla., attorneys for a group 
of 350 firms held responsible for the cleanup stretched across the nation and 
read like a "Who's Who" of Superfund law, according to one participant. The 
cleanup itself was expected to cost $70 million. But over nearly a decade, 
lawyers earned more than $45 million in legal fees in the case and several 
suits are still unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a tiny office of the Oklahoma State District Court became a 
defendant in the case. Its alleged misdeed? The office had disposed of a box of 
poisoned cookies -- crumbs of evidence in an old criminal case -- in the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 * At one of the earliest and most notorious Superfund sites -- a 63-acre 
landfill in New Jersey -- more than 400 parties have sued and countersued, 
hoping to spread the $52-million cleanup cost. Attorneys involved in the case 
spent more than $80,000 a year on Federal Express deliveries alone, according 
to congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Superfund site in Long Island, N.Y. -- a four-acre chemical storage 
area that leaked dangerous chemicals into ground water and seawater -- the EPA 
identified 257 polluters which it determined should pay for the $7.7-million 
cleanup. At least 136 law firms were hired to handle the original legal work. 
Four of the 257 polluters sued 442 insurance companies, which in turn engaged 
the work of 72 more law firms. The owner of the site sued another 101 parties 
that he believed contributed to the pollution, prompting the hiring of many 
other lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 For a flower shop or a Little League team, the prospect of such suits can be 
frightening -- and expensive. And for the communities whose health may be 
endangered by toxic sites, getting a voice in the process -- which usually 
means hiring a lawyer who can penetrate this legal morass -- is downright 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases like these, the EPA now determines the largest and most visible 
polluters of a Superfund site and splits the cleanup bill among them. Those 
enterprises typically turn around and sue many others in hopes of spreading the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, said Rep. Al Swift (D-Wash.), a key proponent of Superfund reform, 
is a feeding frenzy of litigation that cascades down the corporate food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the parts of this law that has been most broke is how liability 
worked," said Swift, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that 
drafted a version of Superfund reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government ate the big fish, the big fish ate the middle-sized fish and 
the middle-sized fish ate everything else. That has got to go. This program is 
enormously litigious. You're spending an enormous amount of wealth without 
getting much cleanup," Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of the original designers of Superfund is exasperated by the problem: 
"Everybody is terrified they're going to get sued. It's gotten out of hand and 
it's made these programs unpopular," said Peter H. Kostmayer, a former member 
of Congress who helped write the Superfund law and who now, as EPA regional 
administrator for the mid-Atlantic states, oversees the cleanup of some 200 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, not everyone believes that the program needs fixing. Besides 
averting scores of public health disasters, the act's unprecedented liability 
features have had a dramatic effect on business, proponents say. By putting 
firms on notice that they may be forced to pay for the cleanup of 
contamination, Superfund has discouraged many from creating hazardous waste in 
the first place. The result has been a shift toward pollution prevention that 
could prove to be Superfund's most enduring legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many attorneys swear that the lawsuits are slowing. They acknowledge 
that the law's first decade was marked by confusion and a spate of litigation 
as companies tested the limits of the new law. But as companies have begun to 
learn that the courts are not likely to bail them out of their responsibilities 
under Superfund, many firms fingered for polluting have stopped struggling and 
started cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, President Clinton has called the Superfund program "a disaster." 
And the Administration has responded with a package of reforms that are 
mind-numbing in their legal complexity but simple in their aim: to retain a 
system in which polluters are held accountable for cleaning up their messes but 
adding powerful new incentives for them to accept those responsibilities and 
proceed with the process of decontamination with a minimum of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite simply, said EPA Administrator Carol Browner, the reforms aim to make 
Superfund cleanups faster, fairer and more efficient. "America needs Superfund, 
but it needs a Superfund that works," Browner said last February in unveiling 
the Administration's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Those aims are largely reflected in draft House and Senate bills making their 
way through the congressional committee system. While the draft bills have 
drawn scattered opposition, they are notable mainly for the political consensus 
that has emerged around them. Manufacturers, insurance companies, community 
groups and an apparent majority of lawmakers -- all of whom have bickered 
fiercely over the program in the past -- have lined up behind the House and 
Senate bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the proposed bills is a system of arbitration for the 
parties that played a major role in causing the contamination of a Superfund 
site. An EPA-approved mediator would carve up the cleanup costs and assign each 
party a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, a polluter has two stark options: It can accept its 
proposed share of costs and settle up -- forgoing the right to sue other 
parties but receiving immunity from further liability for the site's 
contamination -- or it can reject its allocation and face months or even years 
of suing and being sued. 
</P>
<P>
 As further inducement to settle and clean up, lawmakers like Swift have sought 
to increase the fairness of how costs are divided. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA would take responsibility for finding the smaller businesses -- like 
Flipse's Flower Shop -- that may have contributed minutely to the contamination 
of a Superfund site. The agency then would have a brief period in which to 
settle with such parties. Organizations like the Milwood Little League would 
know quickly what their obligation was and, after making small payments to 
settle with the EPA, would be immune from further lawsuits. Purchasers of 
cleaned-up sites would also get explicit immunity from liability. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA would also take responsibility for drawing on funds from its war chest 
of $1.6 billion annually to pay for pollution caused by companies that have 
disappeared or gone out of business. Under current law, the responsibility to 
pay those "orphan shares," which are often substantial, is divided and assigned 
to the remaining major polluters. Many firms are so aggrieved by the perceived 
unfairness of this that they will pay attorneys countless billable hours to 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the House and Senate reform bills would aim to reduce suits between 
firms responsible for cleanup costs and their insurance companies by 
establishing a new settlement program called the Environmental Insurance 
Resolution Fund. It would use taxes raised on insurance companies to make 
partial settlements with firms faced with Superfund cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While reducing the role that attorneys play in the program, Browner hopes the 
reforms would boost the role played by surrounding communities. The 
Administration's proposal, as well as the House and Senate reform bills, 
include language that would give Superfund communities a strong voice in 
determining how the site should be used in the future and as a consequence, how 
far cleanup efforts should go. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our chance. . . . We have to seize this opportunity and fix 
Superfund," Browner recently told an audience in Cleveland. "Let's put fair 
procedures in place so we can focus on getting the job done, not haggling about 
who owes what. Less money for the lawyers means more money for cleanup and 
economic development."

POLICE TRY TO PUT COLLAR ON BRAZEN CANINE KIDNAPERS; CRIME: PRICEY PEDIGREES 
ARE BEING STOLEN FOR RANSOM OR RESEARCH. LAPD IS TAKING THE PROBLEM MORE 
SERIOUSLY.

 The dognaper was surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Five uniformed Los Angeles Police Department officers and six detectives were 
deployed in a perimeter around the Woodland Hills parking lot. For backup, a 
police helicopter hovered in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim counted out the $450 ransom as the dognaper sat in his car, the 
stolen Boston terrier in his lap. Suddenly, six police cars pulled up. Officers 
confronted the dognaper, guns drawn. They arrested him, returned the dog to the 
shaken owner and headed back to the West Valley division station, where they 
resumed chasing burglars, rapists and murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many other serious crimes today, this dognaping five months ago may 
not have seemed worthy of such a show of force. But there are so many dogs 
stolen and so many distraught owners demanding action that law enforcement 
officials are taking the problem more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Extortion is extortion," said Detective Larry Kagele, who coordinated the 
dognaping bust. "Stealing a dog and demanding money is no different than any 
other type of extortion." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 million dogs are stolen each year in the United States, said Mitch 
Rapoport, director of the National Dog Registry, which operates a national hot 
line for stolen pets. Southern California law enforcement agencies, 
particularly in affluent areas, and other animal control agencies also are 
receiving an increasing number of dog theft reports. At least once a month, 
someone reports a dog theft to the Los Angeles chapter of the Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key reasons that thefts are increasing, Rapoport said, are that the price of 
pedigreed dogs continues to rise and more people are purchasing expensive guard 
dogs because of the fear of crime. With so many people buying valuable animals, 
he said, thieves are finding easy money in suburban back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the Boston terrier was lucky because police usually cannot spare 
that many officers for a dognaping bust. But most police stations, like the 
West Valley Division officers, will try to send a squad car to the site where 
owners have arranged an exchange with dognapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners are so attached to their pets that they will pay exorbitant ransom 
demands. A widow from Corona del Mar last year left $2,500 in a Huntington 
Beach phone booth to ensure the return of Ginger, her toy poodle. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to dognaping for ransom, thieves sell the pets on the street or at 
swap meets. Some unscrupulous animal dealers, Rapoport said, sell stolen 
pedigreed dogs to puppy mills for breeding purposes. Others sell them for 
medical research at prices of up to $500. Although dogs are the primary 
victims, cats, too, are occasionally stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals usually target homes, but they sometimes park large vans in 
neighborhoods and steal loose dogs they find on the street, said Judith 
Reitman, author of "Stolen For Profit: How the Medical Establishment Is Funding 
a National Pet-Theft Conspiracy." Some, Reitman said, lure dogs with 
high-pitched whistles, use females in heat as bait or immobilize larger dogs 
with stun guns and then toss them into vans. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people can't comprehend pet theft," said Lt. Dave Havard, head of 
investigations for the Los Angeles SPCA chapter. "They think their dog just got 
loose somehow and wandered off. People should be aware that pets are being 
stolen and that it's a serious crime. If the dog is worth more than $400, 
that's grand theft." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the theft problem became clear to many animal experts last 
year when a sheriff in a rural West Virginia county discovered 110 stolen dogs 
crowded into a small pen. A man had stolen the pets and was planning to sell 
them to medical researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 A local newspaper published the National Dog Registry's hot line 
(1-800-NDR-DOGS) to help reunite owners with their stolen pets. Operators were 
surprised when the hot line was deluged with calls from more than 1,000 people 
in the area who had recently lost dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that many people from a rural county in West Virginia have missing dogs," 
Rapoport said, "you can imagine how big the problem is across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Southern California detectives, overwhelmed with violent crimes, do not 
have time for such investigations. The most that they usually can do is take a 
theft report. Even most local animal control agencies cannot spare officers to 
track down pet thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recommend that victims report the crime, then set up a meeting with the 
thieves to arrange an exchange. If there are no officers free to set up a bust, 
victims can sometimes jot down a license plate number for a later arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pet owners will simply pay ransoms without contacting authorities. Others 
pay the rewards that they had offered without realizing their pets had been 
been stolen. Some thieves snatch dogs out of back yards, wait until reward 
notices are posted and then return the pets to pick up the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no local statistics on dog thefts, during the last year 
LAPD officers have made a number of busts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Last month, police arrested a man who stole Shannon Ray's boxer, Willy, from 
her Woodland Hills home and left a $100 ransom demand on her answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 * In February, police arrested a man who stole a Yorkshire terrier from a 
Hollywood pet store, then ordered the owner to take a bus to a Sunset Boulevard 
street corner, where he promised to swap the dog for $240. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, police arrested a woman who stole Virginia Davis' mixed-breed 
dog, Gizmo, from her car, which was parked in a Van Nuys shopping center, and 
demanded a $200 ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic dognaping bust in the annals of the LAPD involved Maude, the 
Boston terrier. 
</P>
<P>
 She was abducted in January from the Woodland Hills back yard of Henri and 
Sandy Kemp. The dognaper called late that night and told the Kemps he was 
prepared to kill Maude if he did not get at least $450. They agreed to meet at 
9 the next morning in the parking lot of a Woodland Hills supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were mortified," Sandi Kemp said. She lifted Maude on her lap, and said: 
"We were some worried about you, Maudie." 
</P>
<P>
 They called police early the next day and talked to Detective Kagele, who 
quickly rounded up officers from the roll call meeting. Later that morning, as 
Kemp met with the dognaper and began counting out $20s, Kagele barked into his 
police radio: "OK! Move in!" Officers whipped out their 9-millimeter pistols 
and liberated Maude, who ran up to Kemp, jumped into his arms and began licking 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagele is a hero to the Kemps, but the other detectives in the station tease 
him unmercifully. When he walks into the squad room, some of them begin 
barking. Others call out: "Here comes the doggie bandit detective." A few of 
the detectives bought him a fuzzy, yellow stuffed dog with pink and green paws. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some detectives were amused by the bust, the district attorney was 
not. Damani Grey, 19, pleaded guilty to attempted extortion and was sentenced 
to 120 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, Maude was treated no differently from any other Southern 
California resident who is the victim of a crime. An acquaintance of the Kemps 
called to inquire if there had been any movie or television executives 
interested in Maude's story. If any called, she wanted the Kemps to be sure to 
contact her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband is an agent. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some dogs that end up at medical research facilities, animal activists say, 
are stolen. Others are obtained by deception. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the country's most notorious cases, three San Fernando Valley kennel 
operators were convicted of theft, fraud and conspiracy in 1991 and sentenced 
to three to five years in prison. They answered ads from owners who were 
seeking new homes for their pets, promising that the animals would be cared for 
on a horse ranch. Instead, about 80 of the pets died after being sold for 
medical research. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Dr. John Young, chief veterinarian at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, animals that are obtained under false pretenses and sold to researchers 
"are very isolated, unusual cases." Most dogs, he said, are obtained legally 
and have enabled researchers to develop important medical advances -- including 
angioplasty, in which a balloon catheter is inserted to widen narrowing 
arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal advocates have made it so difficult for research facilities to 
obtain animals that more than 10 million dogs a year are put to death in 
shelters when they could have been useful to scientists, Young said. But the 
shortage of dogs for research, he said, has created a climate in which a 
handful of unscrupulous animal dealers can operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal dealers, licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, can sell to 
medical facilities if they breed the animals themselves or if the owners sign 
statements indicating they are aware their pets will be used for research. But 
there should be more frequent inspections of dealers' kennels to ensure dogs 
are properly cared for, and there should be greater penalties for those who 
break the law, said Barbara Peterson, program coordinator of the Stolen Pet 
Program, which operates a nonprofit hot line to reunite owners with pets 
(1-800-STOLEN-PET). 
</P>
<P>
 In response, USDA officials say they have increased such inspections by about 
35% during the last two years. And, officials say, the department has added 35 
inspectors since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton) and Sen. Russell D. Feingold 
(D-Wis.) recently wrote letters, which were signed by dozens of other 
congressmen, to the USDA demanding greater oversight, including better 
investigations before dealers are licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day across America, family pets are stolen to be sold for use in 
medical research . . . " Brown wrote. "The law must be enforced so that pets 
and pet-owners are protected from the actions of those people who profit from 
this unconscionable trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Animal experts recommend that owners have identification numbers tattooed on 
their dogs or tiny microchips implanted beneath the skin -- both painless 
procedures that are becoming increasingly common. Back yards should be secured 
with locked gates and dogs should always be kept on a leash outside the house, 
they warn. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think that just because they have a Doberman or a Rottweiler or a 
boxer they're safe because people will be afraid to steal them," Rapoport said. 
"But a lot of these people who are stealing dogs are pros. They can handle the 
animal better than you can."

 SETTLING DOWN: Older folks in the Valley don't show much preference for one

 GOT THEIR GOAT: While most of the Valley slept Saturday morning, four officers 
from the LAPD's West Valley Division kept the streets safe from a bearded billy 
goat that tangled up traffic in Canoga Park. . . . The officers tossed the 
horned, black and white animal an Egg McMuffin and slipped a cord around its 
neck while it ate. "I guess he escaped from his pen and was running through the 
streets, kind of like the bulls of Pamplona," said Lt. Anthony Alba.

Beach phone booth to ensure the return of Ginger, her toy poodle. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County police said dognapings for ransom here are rare or perhaps 
underreported. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not to say it doesn't happen occasionally, but I wouldn't say it's a 
regular occurrence," said Sgt. Bill Van Cleve of the Huntington Beach Police 
Department's investigative unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very few reports of dog theft," Van Cleve said. "As far as evidence 
goes, it's doggone if the people don't have any idea who stole them." 
</P>
<P>
 Demands for ransom are rare in most cases, said Robert O'Brien, animal control 
officer for the Costa Mesa Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of reports from people who feel it was theft of a dog, but in 
fact what happens a lot of times is that people find strays and decide to keep 
them," O'Brien said. "It also happens that people find dogs and call the owners 
and ask how much the reward is." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to dognaping for ransom, thieves sell the pets on the street or at 
swap meets. Some unscrupulous animal dealers, Rapoport said, sell stolen 
pedigreed dogs to puppy mills for breeding purposes. Others sell them for

<P>
 "If that many people from a rural county in West Virginia have missing dogs," 
Rapoport said, "you can imagine how big the problem is across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Southern California detectives, overwhelmed with violent crimes, do not 
have time for such investigations. The most that they usually can do is take a 
theft report. Even most local animal control agencies cannot spare officers to 
track down pet thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recommend that victims report the crime, then set up a meeting with the 
thieves to arrange an exchange. If there are no officers free to set up a bust, 
victims can sometimes jot down a license plate number for a later arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pet owners will simply pay ransoms without contacting authorities. Others 
pay the rewards that they had offered without realizing their pets had been 
been stolen. Some thieves snatch dogs out of back yards, wait until reward 
notices are posted and then return the pets to pick up the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no local statistics on dog thefts, during the last year 
LAPD officers have made a number of busts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Last month, police arrested a man who stole Shannon Ray's boxer, Willy, from 
her Woodland Hills home and left a $100 ransom demand on her answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 * In February, police arrested a man who stole a Yorkshire terrier from a 
Hollywood pet store, then ordered the owner to take a bus to a Sunset Boulevard 
street corner, where he promised to swap the dog for $240. 
</P>
<P>
 * In October, police arrested a woman who stole Virginia Davis' mixed-breed 
dog, Gizmo, from her car, which was parked in a Van Nuys shopping center, and 
demanded a $200 ransom. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic dognaping bust in the annals of the LAPD involved Maude, the 
Boston terrier. 
</P>
<P>
 She was abducted in January from the Woodland Hills back yard of Henri and 
Sandy Kemp. The dognaper called late that night and told the Kemps he was 
prepared to kill Maude if he did not get at least $450. They agreed to meet at 
9 the next morning in the parking lot of a Woodland Hills supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were mortified," Sandi Kemp said. She lifted Maude on her lap, and said: 
"We were some worried about you, Maudie." 
</P>
<P>
 They called police early the next day and talked to Detective Kagele, who 
quickly rounded up officers from the roll call meeting. Later that morning, as 
Kemp met with the dognaper and began counting out $20s, Kagele barked into his 
police radio: "OK! Move in!" Officers whipped out their 9-millimeter pistols 
and liberated Maude, who ran up to Kemp, jumped into his arms and began licking 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagele is a hero to the Kemps, but the other detectives in the station tease 
him unmercifully. When he walks into the squad room, some of them begin 
barking. Others call out: "Here comes the doggie bandit detective." A few of 
the detectives bought him a fuzzy, yellow stuffed dog with pink and green paws. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some detectives were amused by the bust, the district attorney was 
not. Damani Grey, 19, pleaded guilty to attempted extortion and was sentenced 
to 120 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, Maude was treated no differently from any other Southern 
California resident who is the victim of a crime. An acquaintance of the Kemps 
called to inquire if there had been any movie or television executives 
interested in Maude's story. If any called, she wanted the Kemps to be sure to 
contact her. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband is an agent. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some dogs that end up at medical research facilities, animal activists say, 
are stolen. Others are obtained by deception. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the country's most notorious cases, three San Fernando Valley kennel 
operators were convicted of theft, fraud and conspiracy in 1991 and sentenced 
to three to five years in prison. They answered ads from owners who were 
seeking new homes for their pets, promising that the animals would be cared for 
on a horse ranch. Instead, about 80 of the pets died after being sold for 
medical research. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Dr. John Young, chief veterinarian at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, animals that are obtained under false pretenses and sold to researchers 
"are very isolated, unusual cases." Most dogs, he said, are obtained legally 
and have enabled researchers to develop important medical advances -- including 
angioplasty, in which a balloon catheter is inserted to widen narrowing 
arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal advocates have made it so difficult for research facilities to 
obtain animals that more than 10 million dogs a year are put to death in 
shelters when they could have been useful to scientists, Young said. But the 
shortage of dogs for research, he said, has created a climate in which a 
handful of unscrupulous animal dealers can operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal dealers, licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, can sell to 
medical facilities if they breed the animals themselves or if the owners sign 
statements indicating they are aware their pets will be used for research. But 
there should be more frequent inspections of dealers' kennels to ensure dogs 
are properly cared for, and there should be greater penalties for those who 
break the law, said Barbara Peterson, program coordinator of the Stolen Pet 
Program, which operates a nonprofit hot line to reunite owners with pets 
(1-800-STOLEN-PET). 
</P>
<P>
 In response, USDA officials say they have increased such inspections by about 
35% during the last two years. And, officials say, the department has added 35 
inspectors since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton) and Sen. Russell D. Feingold 
(D-Wis.) recently wrote letters, which were signed by dozens of other 
congressmen, to the USDA demanding greater oversight, including better 
investigations before dealers are licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day across America, family pets are stolen to be sold for use in 
medical research . . . " Brown wrote. "The law must be enforced so that pets 
and pet-owners are protected from the actions of those people who profit from 
this unconscionable trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Animal experts recommend that owners have identification numbers tattooed on 
their dogs or tiny microchips implanted beneath the skin -- both painless 
procedures that are becoming increasingly common. Back yards should be secured 
with locked gates and dogs should always be kept on a leash outside the house, 
they warn. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think that just because they have a Doberman or a Rottweiler or a 
boxer they're safe because people will be afraid to steal them," Rapoport said. 
"But a lot of these people who are stealing dogs are pros. They can handle the 
animal better than you can."

SUPERFUND'S BIGGEST MESS MAY BE IN THE COURTHOUSE; LITIGATION: TOXIC CLEANUP 
HAS BEEN SLOWED BY A MORASS OF COSTLY LAWSUITS. LEGAL REFORM PLAN DRAWS WIDE 
SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the lucrative world of corporate law, the word inspires dreams of shiny new 
BMWs, of vacations to Cancun and of billable hours mounting year after 
prosperous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The word is Superfund. It is the nickname given the 1980 law designed to clean 
up thousands of polluted sites across the nation -- from abandoned landfills to 
manufacturing sites, mines and even federal facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For many lawyers, who have been called "wizards of ooze" because of their 
roles in litigating Superfund cases, the law has been mother's milk. 
</P>
<P>
 By the best available estimate -- that of the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. 
think tank -- fully 40 cents of every dollar spent on such projects has gone 
not to clean up toxic waste but to pay lawyers' fees and other costs of 
litigation. And those dollars are staggering: The federal government alone 
spends nearly $1.6 billion annually on Superfund. And private industry is 
believed to spend several times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more demonstrative of the problem: The House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee estimated in 1990 that the insurance industry and its clients 
spend about $500 million in legal costs annually wrangling over liability for 
Superfund cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the system -- including the Clinton Administration -- contend that 
the slow pace of the work is directly attributable to the tangled web of 
litigation that can stall progress on a project for years while it ensnares the 
federal government, corporate polluters, insurance companies and -- 
occasionally -- hapless bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only 237 of the 1,344 toxic waste sites deemed in need of emergency 
cleanup have been declared clean and safe. In coming weeks, Congress, prodded 
by the Administration, is moving to complete a sweeping reform of Superfund 
law. And while the effort is designed to tackle an array of perceived problems, 
the primary focus is on stemming unintended legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The purveyors of reform argue that the stakes are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 One out of four Americans lives within four miles of a toxic waste site slated 
for cleanup under the program. California, with 96 sites on the Superfund list, 
has one of the largest shares of polluted sites in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those sites is in Westminster, where several dozen families live atop 
an old toxic dump near Sowell Avenue and Golden West Street. Federal officials 
said that a Long Beach trucking company that went out of business years ago 
dumped petroleum wastes in four pits at that location in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this summer, the EPA will begin a two-year project to clean the toxic 
site, which is located beneath a neighborhood in which residents have long 
complained about a black ooze that rises to the surface during the hot summer 
months. As many as 50 families will be relocated for up to four months by EPA 
officials while the cleanup is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the health of citizens, jobs also hang in the balance -- not just for 
high-priced lawyers but for entire communities, the Administration contends. 
Almost 20% of Superfund projects are located in urban areas. But even after 
such sites have been declared clean, they remain legally poisonous to many 
potential buyers because, under current Superfund law, purchasers of such sites 
assume liability for past pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, most of these sites remain fenced off, while surrounding 
neighborhoods -- many in minority communities -- go without the jobs they need 
desperately. Meanwhile, businesses looking for operating sites are moving out 
to suburban "greenways," where woods and open farmland are cleared -- and then 
lost -- to establish new industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Horror stories about the legal entanglements of Superfund cases abound. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Kalamazoo, Mich., the Upjohn Co., a major pharmaceuticals firm, was named 
by the Environmental Protection Agency as the party responsible for the 
$20-million cost of cleaning up a toxic landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to spread the cost among other polluters, Upjohn wrote letters 
threatening to sue 741 parties that had dumped trash in the landfill. They 
ranged from Flipse's Flower Shop to the Milwood Little League. Even the mother 
of William Parfet, Upjohn's president at the time, couldn't escape the 
company's dragnet. Martha Parfet, chairwoman of Gilmore Bros. department store 
in downtown Kalamazoo, received a letter from Upjohn notifying her that the 
trash the store had put out on the curb could make it liable for a share of the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the case of the Hardage Landfill in Criner, Okla., attorneys for a group 
of 350 firms held responsible for the cleanup stretched across the nation and 
read like a "Who's Who" of Superfund law, according to one participant. The 
cleanup itself was expected to cost $70 million. But over nearly a decade, 
lawyers earned more than $45 million in legal fees in the case and several 
suits are still unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a tiny office of the Oklahoma State District Court became a 
defendant in the case. Its alleged misdeed? The office had disposed of a box of 
poisoned cookies -- crumbs of evidence in an old criminal case -- in the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 * At one of the earliest and most notorious Superfund sites -- a 63-acre 
landfill in New Jersey -- more than 400 parties have sued and countersued, 
hoping to spread the $52-million cleanup cost. Attorneys involved in the case 
spent more than $80,000 a year on Federal Express deliveries alone, according 
to congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Superfund site in Long Island, N.Y. -- a four-acre chemical storage 
area that leaked dangerous chemicals into ground water and seawater -- the EPA 
identified 257 polluters which it determined should pay for the $7.7-million 
cleanup. At least 136 law firms were hired to handle the original legal work. 
Four of the 257 polluters sued 442 insurance companies, which in turn engaged 
the work of 72 more law firms. The owner of the site sued another 101 parties 
that he believed contributed to the pollution, prompting the hiring of many 
other lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 For a flower shop or a Little League team, the prospect of such suits can be 
frightening -- and expensive. And for the communities whose health may be 
endangered by toxic sites, getting a voice in the process -- which usually 
means hiring a lawyer who can penetrate this legal morass -- is downright 
daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases like these, the EPA now determines the largest and most visible 
polluters of a Superfund site and splits the cleanup bill among them. Those 
enterprises typically turn around and sue many others in hopes of spreading the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, said Rep. Al Swift (D-Wash.), a key proponent of Superfund reform, 
is a feeding frenzy of litigation that cascades down the corporate food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the parts of this law that has been most broke is how liability 
worked," said Swift, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that 
drafted a version of Superfund reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government ate the big fish, the big fish ate the middle-sized fish and 
the middle-sized fish ate everything else. That has got to go. This program is 
enormously litigious. You're spending an enormous amount of wealth without 
getting much cleanup," Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of the original designers of Superfund is exasperated by the problem: 
"Everybody is terrified they're going to get sued. It's gotten out of hand and 
it's made these programs unpopular," said Peter H. Kostmayer, a former member 
of Congress who helped write the Superfund law and who now, as EPA regional 
administrator for the mid-Atlantic states, oversees the cleanup of some 200 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, not everyone believes that the program needs fixing. Besides 
averting scores of public health disasters, the act's unprecedented liability 
features have had a dramatic effect on business, proponents say. By putting 
firms on notice that they may be forced to pay for the cleanup of 
contamination, Superfund has discouraged many from creating hazardous waste in 
the first place. The result has been a shift toward pollution prevention that 
could prove to be Superfund's most enduring legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many attorneys swear that the lawsuits are slowing. They acknowledge 
that the law's first decade was marked by confusion and a spate of litigation 
as companies tested the limits of the new law. But as companies have begun to 
learn that the courts are not likely to bail them out of their responsibilities 
under Superfund, many firms fingered for polluting have stopped struggling and 
started cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, President Clinton has called the Superfund program "a disaster." 
And the Administration has responded with a package of reforms that are 
mind-numbing in their legal complexity but simple in their aim: to retain a 
system in which polluters are held accountable for cleaning up their messes but 
adding powerful new incentives for them to accept those responsibilities and 
proceed with the process of decontamination with a minimum of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite simply, said EPA Administrator Carol Browner, the reforms aim to make 
Superfund cleanups faster, fairer and more efficient. "America needs Superfund, 
but it needs a Superfund that works," Browner said last February in unveiling 
the Administration's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Those aims are largely reflected in draft House and Senate bills making their 
way through the congressional committee system. While the draft bills have 
drawn scattered opposition, they are notable mainly for the political consensus 
that has emerged around them. Manufacturers, insurance companies, community 
groups and an apparent majority of lawmakers -- all of whom have bickered 
fiercely over the program in the past -- have lined up behind the House and 
Senate bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the proposed bills is a system of arbitration for the 
parties that played a major role in causing the contamination of a Superfund 
site. An EPA-approved mediator would carve up the cleanup costs and assign each 
party a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, a polluter has two stark options: It can accept its 
proposed share of costs and settle up -- forgoing the right to sue other 
parties but receiving immunity from further liability for the site's 
contamination -- or it can reject its allocation and face months or even years 
of suing and being sued. 
</P>
<P>
 As further inducement to settle and clean up, lawmakers like Swift have sought 
to increase the fairness of how costs are divided. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA would take responsibility for finding the smaller businesses -- like 
Flipse's Flower Shop -- that may have contributed minutely to the contamination 
of a Superfund site. The agency then would have a brief period in which to 
settle with such parties. Organizations like the Milwood Little League would 
know quickly what their obligation was and, after making small payments to 
settle with the EPA, would be immune from further lawsuits. Purchasers of 
cleaned-up sites would also get explicit immunity from liability. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA would also take responsibility for drawing on funds from its war chest 
of $1.6 billion annually to pay for pollution caused by companies that have 
disappeared or gone out of business. Under current law, the responsibility to 
pay those "orphan shares," which are often substantial, is divided and assigned 
to the remaining major polluters. Many firms are so aggrieved by the perceived 
unfairness of this that they will pay attorneys countless billable hours to 
sue. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the House and Senate reform bills would aim to reduce suits between 
firms responsible for cleanup costs and their insurance companies by 
establishing a new settlement program called the Environmental Insurance 
Resolution Fund. It would use taxes raised on insurance companies to make 
partial settlements with firms faced with Superfund cleanup costs.

PRIEST FINDS PEACE AND JOY THROUGH SURFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Mongrain swings his surfboard around in the water, points himself 
toward shore and starts paddling. As the wave lifts his board, he jumps to his 
feet and begins to skirt across its smooth, arching surface. His face brightens 
with a broad smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a moment of joy and peace, something akin to a religious experience for 
Mongrain, who should know about such things because he is a Roman Catholic 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really look forward to getting out there," Mongrain said at the rectory of 
St. Peter Claver's Church in Simi Valley, where he is the pastor. On the wall 
of his office is a poster of a breaking wave with the words: "God must have 
been a surfer." 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it peaceful and actually very contemplative out there watching the 
sets come in," he said. "And of course there's nothing like making a steep 
drop." 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year-old Mongrain admits that it is a bit unusual to find a 
bleach-blond priest with a penchant for throwing surfing analogies into his 
homilies on Sunday, but this is California, after all, and it's not unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another surfing priest in San Diego, Mongrain said. But unlike 
Mongrain, who rides a 9-foot, 6-inch long board, the word is that Father Bruce 
Osborn rides a high-performance short board and "rips" -- surfer jargon for an 
especially talented surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongrain is much more modest in describing his own abilities. Taking a 
priestly vow of humility to heart, he said he is just happy for the one morning 
a week he can go surfing. He is not really into radical maneuvers, he just 
likes the sensation of streaking across the face of a wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a stress reliever for Mongrain, who heads a parish of about 2,500 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 A priest for 17 years, Mongrain was sent to the parish two years ago after the 
assistant pastor, Father David Piroli, was arrested for allegedly stealing 
money from church coffers and possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Parish officials testified at the trial that they had found thousands of 
dollars from the church's collection plate in Piroli's room in the rectory. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug charge was never filed, however, and the embezzlement charge was 
dropped after a Ventura County jury deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal, 
ending a two-year criminal prosecution that scandalized the parish. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Mongrain went from assisting at the church to becoming 
pastor after Father James McKeon, who founded the parish in 1972, was 
transferred to a church in Westlake Village. Mongrain does not like to speak 
about the case. He only says that it is over, and the church is healing. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 families left the parish during the scandal, said Eileen 
Slavin, who has worked for St. Peter Claver's Church since it opened. Since 
Mongrain took over, she said, attendance has begun to increase again. 
</P>
<P>
 The months-long trial left the parish community shattered, she said. Mongrain 
spent much of his time trying to rebuild the trust of parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a list of all the money collected and how it was spent in the church's 
weekly bulletin passed out at every service. Slavin said Mongrain has also done 
little things that have brought people back, such as repainting the church and 
installing a lawn where he can often be seen playing catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is the only priest serving the close to 10,000 people who attend 
services at the church, Slavin said she is now worried that Mongrain will get 
burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 He holds two Masses a day during the week, and several more on Saturday and 
Sunday. Along with that, he watches over the ebb and flow of his flock -- 
deaths, births and marriages -- while still finding time to hold pool parties 
for parish youngsters and their parents, or play on the church's softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people come to me it's usually about relationships," he said. "I make 
myself available and ready to handle what are real tragedies in people's lives. 
I try to listen to their struggles and offer my friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 His manner is quiet, controlled and friendly, but he admits that the stresses 
of the job can throw him. He looks for advice from a friend at St. John's 
Seminary in Camarillo where he studied, and solace in part from surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 The women who work in the church office say he works too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worry about how hard he works," Slavin said with concern. "He never lets a 
call go unreturned. He's never late for an appointment, and he's always busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I wish he'd go surfing more often. It's his escape, I 
think. It's invigorating for him and I think it prepares him for what he faces 
every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Mongrain wakes up each day at 3:45 a.m., takes in the quiet of the morning, 
drinks a big cup of coffee, prays, and then watches news, and, if he gets the 
chance, highlights from the previous night's baseball games. He grew up wanting 
to be a shortstop with the Dodgers and still loves to see them play. At 6:30 
a.m., he says Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday, after giving Communion to a handful of early risers at 
Mass, Mongrain walked into the sacristy -- the room where the sacred religious 
objects and vestments worn by the priest are kept -- and slipped out of his 
priestly robes. Underneath, he wore a colorful T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 A little later -- in shorts, sandals, and the T-shirt -- he loaded his 
surfboard into his white pickup truck and headed toward Surfer's Point in 
Ventura. It's a weekly routine, his chance to spend a few hours in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there he met up with his regular surf buddies -- a fireman, a jeweler and 
an oral surgeon. The fact that he is a priest does not come up much when they 
are surfing. Looking at a tanned, smiling Mongrain, you would never know it, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he looks more like a surfer than a priest," said Dennis Longwill, 46, 
the oral surgeon, who has been surfing with Mongrain for five years. Longwill 
met him when Mongrain worked at Sacred Heart parish in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he looks just like anybody else out at Surfer's Point. I think it 
surprises people that he's a priest. Maybe he should get a wet suit with a 
white collar." 
</P>
<P>
 The small waves, poor conditions and overcast skies at the point Friday 
morning kept a lot of surfers out of the water. But Mongrain suited up and 
waxed his board anyway, like he always does. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with him was Larry Montag, 42, a Los Angeles firefighter who met 
Mongrain 15 years ago at Our Lady of Assumption in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair caught a few of the small waves rolling into the point, and then 
headed up to Santa Barbara to look for a new surfboard for Mongrain. He was out 
for something smaller, more maneuverable, looking for a design he calls an "Old 
Blue," also know as a "Spoon." 
</P>
<P>
 It is stable and easy to paddle like a long board, Mongrain said, but faster 
and quicker to turn -- more like a short board. 
</P>
<P>
 He was "stoked" about getting a new board, he said. And looking forward to 
getting in the water again next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Priests should be men of joy," he said. "I try to share that with others. . . 
. Surfing is something that's exciting for me. It's where I find my peace and 
joy."

SINGLE-PAYER PLAN FOR HEALTH CARE SPARKS FUROR; COVERAGE: ESTIMATES ON THE 
COSTS DIFFER WIDELY. THE BIG QUESTION IS: ARE PEOPLE READY TO SURRENDER PRIVATE 
INSURANCE CARDS FOR A STATE-RUN SYSTEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California's extraordinarily far-reaching universal health care initiative, in 
its early stages of debate, has already sparked a spirited fight over dollars 
-- tens of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In opening salvos, sponsors and opponents of the so-called single-payer 
initiative released wildly conflicting financial studies, with critics showing 
deficits in the mega-billion range and sponsors projecting monster savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers creating such widely differing estimates are mind-boggling: The 
scope of the proposed plan to insure all of California's 31 million residents 
starts out at $100 billion a year and grows from there. From the start, the 
program would dwarf the proposed state budget of $57.3 billion, an amount that 
represents what the state will spend over the next 12 months on public schools, 
prisons, existing health and welfare programs, community colleges and 
universities, various regulatory programs and debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 But many observers believe that for most voters the issue ultimately will boil 
down to a simpler, but possibly excruciating, choice: As costly as health 
insurance may be now, are they ready to surrender their private insurance cards 
for the uncertainties of a state-run system? 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every Californian will have to give up his existing health plan," Kirk 
West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, told reporters last 
week. "When all is said and done, the great bulk of the voters will lose the 
health insurance they have now and it will all be (replaced by) the political 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Will voters go for that? 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsors of the initiative are hoping yes, believing that the health care 
safety net under most Californians is so fragile that even those with health 
insurance want more protection. There are also 6 million Californians with no 
health insurance, many of whom once were insured but lost their coverage when 
they were laid off, fired or lost a spouse through death or divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "That person with Blue Cross today may only be a job away from losing it," 
said Dr. Kevin Grumbach, a professor and family practitioner at UC San 
Francisco and widely published economic analyst of public health systems. 
"Employment these days is so tenuous that even people who think they are 
well-insured are close to the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Grumbach, one of the founders of the 1,000-member California Physicians 
Alliance, contributed to the drafting of the initiative. The alliance, along 
with the Congress of California Seniors and the grass-roots consumer group, 
Neighbor to Neighbor, formed the original coalition that drafted the 
initiative, although a variety of labor unions and consumer groups had been 
pressing for a single-payer system for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative was drafted shortly after California voters in 1992 rejected 
Proposition 166, a health insurance measure sponsored by the California Medical 
Assn. That proposition would have mandated that all employers provide 
insurance, but it would have left the private health insurance system in place. 
Many health activists, including Grumbach, believe that was a major flaw of 
Proposition 166, just as they say it is a flaw of President Clinton's national 
health insurance plan. They argue that health insurers drain large amounts of 
money from the system in profits, administrative costs and duplication of 
services among what they say are the 1,500 health insurers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 What they came up with as an alternative is a proposal that would create a 
new, government-run health plan to replace the current system based on private 
insurance. It would go well beyond what any other state has ever tried to do 
and would create one of the largest health systems in the world. Patterned 
after the health system used in Canada, it would provide even more generous 
benefits, to more people, than that nation, authors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone would be the old players such as Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Aetna, along 
with the all-important membership cards that unlocked the doors to hospitals 
and physicians offices for tens of thousands of Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the initiative agree that deciding whether to jump from the old 
system in favor of a new, untried system will be a huge step for Californians 
to take. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are counting on people such as Susanne Griffin, an Encino attorney. 
She has private insurance with one of California's largest health insurers. She 
recently attended a small fund-raiser sponsored by the single-payer initiative 
campaign at a private home in the San Fernando Valley and left saying she is 
willing to try the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin's policy with a private insurer covers herself and one of her two 
daughters. It costs $244 a month and carries a $1,000 deductible, meaning the 
insurance doesn't kick in until she has paid the first $1,000 of her medical 
bills. Because her policy doesn't cover her chiropractor, whom she goes to 
regularly because of an injury from an automobile accident, Griffin said she 
has about $5,000 a year in out-of-pocket expenses. The single-payer initiative 
would free her of those expenses, while covering her chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 She estimates that under the new system she would pay $1,275 a year in higher 
state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be half of what I am paying now" in insurance premiums, said 
Griffin, who contributed $100 to the initiative campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Milne, director of Oakland-based Californians for Health Security, 
sponsors of the initiative, said, "This is basically writing a new constitution 
for health care. Once we step through the door, there will be no turning back, 
but beforehand it seems an almost impossible step for people to take." 
</P>
<P>
 What he is banking on, however, is that consumers will look at the initiative 
and compare it to what they have now. "The benefits of this program equal or 
exceed nearly all the packages out there now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even critics of the measure concede this is true. In fact, one of the 
opponents' arguments is that the sponsors are promising such a rich program, 
there is no way the state will be able to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the measure propose substantial increases in the personal and 
payroll taxes, boosts that they say would raise $46 billion a year, to help 
finance the system. The taxes would be offset by savings to individuals and 
corporations on premium and out-of-pocket expenses, which they no longer would 
have to pay. But critics say there still will not be enough money to pay for 
the rich benefit package and that by 1998 there will be a $48-billion state 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard A. Wiebe of Taxpayers Against the Government Takeover, the 
Sacramento-based opponents of the initiative, said keying in on the public's 
fears of a government-run insurance program will be "one of the key messages of 
the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 "The public can't afford to ignore the numbers," he said. "The economy can't 
afford the tax increases that this measure would impose on the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the initiative cite public opinion surveys that have shown the 
public has more confidence in the private sector's ability to provide 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times national poll of adults in April found that many expressed 
a strong preference for a health care reform plan in which private insurance 
companies continued to play a role, with 71% saying they would like to retain 
private insurers and 21% in favor of a government-run program. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll of state voters in May asked those surveyed if they would vote 
for the single-payer initiative. That poll, conducted before the initiative 
signatures were filed, found sentiment running 54% to 34% against the measure, 
with 12% saying they didn't know. The May poll, however, found the measure 
winning 45% to 41% among Democrats, and 44% to 42% among independents. The 
final results were influenced by a lopsided 72% of Republicans who said they 
would vote against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a grave concern among members of the public that they will lose the 
coverage they now have," said Wiebe, whose campaign has hired the same media 
firm that created the Harry and Louise ads being used by insurance companies to 
fight President Clinton's health plan. "When people hear about a 'state-run 
system' I think they will say, 'That doesn't apply to me.' We need to tell them 
that it does, that they are in danger of losing their health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 But another who attended the recent fund-raiser for the initiative, Brooke 
Ricketts, a waitress at a Brentwood restaurant, said she isn't worried. She 
said she really hasn't used the private policy she maintains for $80 a month. 
The policy has a $500 deductible, and because she enjoys good health and only 
goes to the doctor for annual checkups, she said she has never exceeded the 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the initiative, her monthly payments would be cut in half, she figured. 
"I like the freedom of choice of it, and regardless of your job, you are always 
paying the same fixed percentage of your income," she said.

ROUGHING IT; YOUNG CAMPERS GET A TASTE OF LIFE IN THE MARINE CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 They will have the rest of the summer to relax and enjoy their vacations. But 
for one grueling week in July, 450 youngsters from as far away as Washington, 
D.C., have abandoned summer's traditional pursuits to find out how they might 
like life as U.S. Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment they awake at 5:15 a.m. until lights out at 10 p.m., these 
few, proud youngsters, ages 8-18, will spend their time on training runs, 
crawling under barbed wire and learning how to capture a city without injuring 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in camouflage hats, jeans and a variety of colored T-shirts denoting 
their units, they even act the part of Marines -- standing at attention when 
spoken to, saluting officers and following orders throughout the weeklong Young 
Marines National Encampment, which began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always wanted to be a Marine," Garden Grove resident Heather Heuer 
said as she listened to shots being fired from a hill above her, where real 
Marines were taking infantry training. "Ever since I was little, I have always 
had that dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Heuer, 17, who has been a member of the Tustin branch of Young Marines since 
the seventh grade, was promoted to 1st sergeant at the start of the encampment, 
becoming the first female in California to hold that rank. She plans to enlist 
in the Corps after she graduates from Marina High School in Huntington Beach 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is my plan," she said. "Like I said, every kid has their dream and this 
is mine. I guess I like it fast-paced. It just gets in your blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the children participating in the program see their futures in the 
Marine Corps. Some view the camp as an opportunity to have fun and meet other 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Osei Kirby, of Los Angeles, said he became involved in the program after two 
cousins joined, although he doesn't see himself as a future Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because it teaches me a lot of different things and most of all it 
challenges me," the 13-year-old said. "The oral exams and promotion tests are 
the hardest parts." 
</P>
<P>
 During their week at the 125,000-acre Marine base, the youngsters take turns 
learning to rappel off a 60-foot tower, running the standard obstacle and 
assault courses and watching combat demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is the closest that 16-year-old Luel Bucago -- the highest ranking 
Young Marines officer in the United States -- will come to living the life of a 
Marine. Although his dream was to follow his father into the Corps, Luel has 
severe asthma and was recently told he could not join up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luel said that hasn't stopped him from remaining in the Young Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a Marine was something brought on by my father and I did want to follow 
in his footsteps," he said. "But so far I'm just doing my hardest to show kids 
that their dreams can come true even though mine didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters from California, Virginia, Michigan, New Mexico and Washington 
D.C., all members of their local Young Marines chapters, participated in the 
camp. The organization was founded in 1958 to teach young people 
self-discipline and teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Luel's father, Leon Bucago, the commanding officer for the Young Marines' 
Tustin branch, said the Orange County group, which has about 120 members, goes 
through weekly physical training, attends lectures about life in the armed 
forces and learns about Marine discipline. Members also attend boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the youth of today are screaming for parameters," Bucago said. "With 
our program they study leadership, drug and alcohol prevention. I would rather 
have them (in the Young Marines program) than out there doing drugs and getting 
involved in gangs. We offer them a positive atmosphere where we show them how 
to succeed."

FEINSTEIN'S TV ATTACK ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been airing a new television 
commercial about immigration and her support for tougher enforcement on the 
international border. The ad, which is being broadcast statewide, also 
contrasts Feinstein's position with her Republican challenger for the Senate 
seat, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). THE AD 
</P>
<P>
 It opens with a statement: "While Congressman Huffington voted against new 
border guards, Dianne Feinstein led the fight to stop illegal immigration." A 
picture of presumably illegal immigrants streaming over the border appears on 
the screen while Feinstein's voice is heard explaining that 3,000 illegal 
immigrants try to cross the border many nights. Feinstein adds that she has 
only been in the Senate a short time, but has worked hard to secure the border 
with more agents, fencing, lighting and other equipment. It closes with the 
senator saying to the camera: "I'm Dianne Feinstein and I've just begun to 
fight for California." THE ANALYSIS 
</P>
<P>
 The statement that Huffington voted against new border guards is based on the 
congressman's opposition last month to a sweeping appropriations bill that 
included funding for 700 new Border Patrol guards. Huffington's campaign has 
called the Feinstein attack a "shameless distortion" because he has voted four 
times to increase the border guard even though he opposed the recent 
appropriations bill, saying it also contained wasteful spending. Feinstein's 
campaign contends, however, that if Huffington's side had won the vote, the 
guards would not be added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Latino officials have criticized the video of illegal immigrants running 
across the border, warning that it scapegoats immigrants and harms relations 
among ethnic groups. The complaints have been nowhere near the level of 
criticism aimed at Gov. Pete Wilson for a similar commercial about immigration. 
Feinstein's campaign said its commercial was more sensitive because it was shot 
in color, not black-and-white, and the commentary was not as inflammatory. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimate that 3,000 illegal immigrants cross the border on many nights was 
provided to Feinstein by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, said 
Marco Ramirez, a spokesman for the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad's claim that Feinstein has worked hard on the issue refers to her 
outspoken role on the Judiciary Committee, which plays a major role on 
immigration legislation. Last summer, Feinstein unveiled a six-point plan that 
included a $1 border-crossing fee. Last month, she introduced a comprehensive 
bill that calls for another 2,100 border guards in the next three years. 
Huffington supported a plan in April that would have added 6,000 guards over 
five years.

LESBIAN COLONEL RETURNS TO WORK ON COURT ORDERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years after Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer was kicked out of the National 
Guard for being a lesbian, the highly decorated Vietnam War veteran was back at 
her old job on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court ordered her reinstatement last month, ruling that her 
discharge based on her sexual orientation was unconstitutional.The U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Thursday refused to delay that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 A smiling Cammermeyer, dressed in a camouflage uniform, arrived in an white 
Mercedes-Benz and entered the main gate at Washington National Guard 
headquarters, south of Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to her job as chief of nursing services for the 164th Mobile Army 
Surgical Hospital. As a regular reservist, her work obligation is two days per 
month and a 15-day annual training mission. The job pays about $12,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard commander Maj. Gen. Greg Barlow asked Cammermeyer to report to work 
Saturday after the appeals court rejected the Justice Department's latest 
effort to block her reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew the military to move so fast," the 52-year-old Cammermeyer said 
Friday night. "I'm more disappointed that it's taken two years to get here."

BLESSED EVENTS ON COLUMBIA: 2 BABY NEWTS, 3 INFANT FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shuttle Columbia, already jammed with jellyfish, goldfish, guppies and 
salamanders, gained more passengers Saturday -- two new newts and three fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's first female astronaut, Dr. Chiaki Mukai, spotted the five freshly 
laid eggs less than a day into the scheduled two-week laboratory research 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Four female Japanese red-bellied newts and four Japanese Medaka fish -- two 
male and two female -- are among thousands of aquatic animals flying on 
Columbia as part of space fertilization and developmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medaka, a guppy-like fish, were not swimming in circles endlessly as many 
other fish do in space, and that left them open for more important matters, 
like mating. They didn't waste any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy," Japanese project scientist Shunji Nagaoka said after 
learning of the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists interested in fish reproduction chose Medaka that seemed to be 
resistant to the common looping behavior. Nagaoka said experimenters hope to 
have more than 100 Medaka eggs laid in orbit; it takes about a week for the 
eggs to hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers stowed 340 Medaka eggs aboard Columbia before liftoff Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the newts, biologists injected hormones into two of the animals before 
the flight to induce egg-laying. One of the seven astronauts will inject the 
other two newts early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagaoka said he suspects that the vibration of the shuttle launch may have 
prompted the early newt egg-laying. He is hoping for 200 to 300 more new newt 
eggs before Columbia is scheduled to return to Earth on July 22. The shuttle 
was launched with 144 newt eggs handpicked by researchers.

RESIDENTS PREPARE FOR WORST AS WATERS RISE IN SOUTHEAST; DISASTER: RIVERFRONT 
HOMEOWNERS IN PARTS OF GEORGIA, ALABAMA AND FLORIDA FLEE TO HIGHER GROUND. 
FLOODING HAS ALREADY CLAIMED 24 LIVES.

<P>
 For the riverside residents of this small town, the worst of the disaster was 
still 40 miles upstream and four days away. But it was not too early to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to get my parents out of here because there is going to be water 
to the rooftop of this house," Ellen Sellers, 33, said Saturday from the back 
porch of her childhood home in Flint River Heights. The Flint River, where she 
had fished and water-skied as a girl, was three feet from her parents' door and 
rising by the minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't believe it," said Sellers of her parents. "They have lived here 
for 25 years and they think everyone is panicking. But I feel certain they are 
going to lose their house." 
</P>
<P>
 Houses, and lives, have been lost every day for almost a week now in what is 
being called the worst flooding to hit Georgia -- and parts of Alabama and 
north Florida -- this century. At least 24 people are dead and five are missing 
after heavy rain from a stalled tropical storm pushed dozens of usually 
tranquil rivers and creeks to rage far from their banks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Albany, Ga., National Guard troops and hundreds of volunteers continued 
piling sandbags around the civic center in hopes of holding back the Flint, 
expected to crest late Saturday at 45 feet, 25 feet above flood stage. More 
than a quarter of the town's 20,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate 
their homes. At least 5,000 people are being housed in shelters set up in 
schools and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a portion of the earthen dam at 8,500-acre Lake Blackshear gave way 
Saturday morning, but a state official said there was no immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Just south of the Alabama line in the Florida Panhandle, Caryville, a town of 
600 residents, was all but washed away by the flood. From the air, only 
rooftops could be seen poking through the waters of the Choctawhatchee River. 
As had happened in Albany, Ga., earlier in the week, several coffins in a 
cemetery popped out of the soaked ground, and police detained several people as 
they tried to break through barricades and secure their relatives' remains. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,200 people have been moved from their homes in the Florida 
Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 In Macon, Ga., the Ocmulgee River has crested, but approximately 150,000 
residents were left a messy cleanup job and no drinking water for at least a 
week. The river swamped the water treatment plant Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Interstate 75, sections of which had been closed for three days, was 
reopened early Saturday near Macon, traffic was still snarled throughout much 
of southwest Georgia. Some of the problems stemmed from the crush of residents 
rushing to prepare for high water, others by those who just wanted to look at 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Albany, one man was arrested for obstructing police. "If you gawk or balk, 
we're going to arrest you and jail you," said Assistant Police Chief Bob Boren. 
</P>
<P>
 Even boat traffic was causing problems. Police in Bainbridge urged people to 
stay off the Flint after homeowners reported that the wakes from motorboats 
were breaking windows in partially submerged houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had floods in the past, but this is unreal," said Sellers, who left her 
three children with friends in Dothan, Ala., before returning to Bainbridge to 
help her parents evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictions were that at least three-quarters of this picturesque rural 
community of 12,000 would be inundated by Wednesday as the Flint rises to 20 
feet above flood stage. An overnight curfew is to go into effect tonight. 
Electricity and gas were cut off to some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Saturday, pickups, rental trucks and even peanut wagons 
pulled by tractors ferried furniture, appliances and other belongings from 
homes by the river to higher ground. The Amoco Oil Co. opened a warehouse near 
town for residents to use as a storage space. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Brown, 35, safety director for Flint River Mills Inc., one of the largest 
grain elevators in the Southeast, said tons of animal feed and equipment had 
been moved to other facilities. "We're completely evacuated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in the Dixie Dandy Food Store, three-quarters of a mile from the 
swirling brown waters of the Flint, store owner Walter Goodman and his family 
were hurrying to clear the shelves even while making occasional sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had planned a two-day flood sale to reduce the inventory," Goodman said. 
"But we don't have time for that now." He expected six feet of water in the 
store by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance agents reported a run on flood insurance this week. David Porter of 
the Independent Life Insurance Co. said he sold several policies. He was in the 
shrinking back lawn of a friend's house Saturday, driving golf balls into the 
Flint as it rushed southward with shattered trees, plastic debris, even 
children's swing sets, all suspended in the muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a five-day waiting period," Porter said. "So those who bought from us 
on Thursday have to hope and pray this doesn't affect their homes before 
Wednesday at 12:01 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto were long gone, heavy 
thunderstorms formed over Alabama and Georgia early Saturday, adding to the 
rain that has pelted the region and occasionally casting an ominous gloom to 
the anxious preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a spirit of helpfulness was evident -- volunteers from as far away as 
Florida showed up to help move people from their homes -- trucks were scarce 
and not everyone who needed assistance got it right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Cooper, a 25-year-old mother of three, sat forlornly in her riverfront 
house in Bainbridge, watching her neighbors flee. "I'm going to have to stay 
here. I don't have no choice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley reported from Bainbridge, Ga., and Clary from Miami.

PALESTINIAN POLICE HELD IN MAN'S DEATH; GAZA STRIP: THE PLO GOVERNMENT FACES 
ITS FIRST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE IN THE KILLING OF A PRISONER ACCUSED OF 
COLLABORATING WITH THE ISRAELIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with its first major human rights test, the new Palestinian Authority is 
moving quickly to bring to justice three members of its police force accused of 
beating to death a taxi driver suspected of collaborating with the Israeli 
secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 Khaled Kidra, the Palestinian prosecutor general, said Saturday that the three 
Palestinian officers were arrested after an autopsy showed that Farid Jarbou 
had been severely beaten "close to sensitive areas of his body" during 
interrogation last week and had died "as the result of the use of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Jarbou, 28, from the southern Gaza town of Shabura, was arrested June 25 on 
suspicion of working for Shin Bet, Israel's secret service, according to 
Palestinian officials. He was found dead in his cell in the interrogation wing 
of the Al Saraya prison complex in the Gaza Strip before dawn Tuesday, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freih abu Medein, the justice minister, in a statement Saturday condemned the 
killing as a "very grave offense" and promised that "all those found 
responsible" would be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the issue of Palestinians who have worked for Israeli 
intelligence and security services, as hundreds have, is one of the most 
sensitive the Palestinian Authority faces because of the intense popular hatred 
toward them. 
</P>
<P>
 As Israeli forces prepared to withdraw from Gaza, it reportedly recruited even 
more agents in what Palestinian security officials contend was an effort not 
only to ensure continued intelligence from the region but to manipulate 
politics there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recruitment of these informants and agents is a dirty, dirty game," a 
senior security aide to Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser 
Arafat said, "and we will be a long time in cleaning up the results. . . . A 
lot of that dirt inevitably will soil us." 
</P>
<P>
 Two captains in the counterintelligence branch of the Palestinian security 
service and an "interrogator" have been arrested, Justice Ministry officials 
said, and are expected to be tried by court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarbou's death was the first of a prisoner since Israel handed over the Gaza 
Strip to the Palestinian Authority two months ago, and it renewed fears among 
Palestinian and international human rights groups about adherence to the rule 
of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned that Mr. Jarbou's death appears to have been caused by 
severe abuse by the Palestinian security services," said Kenneth Roth, 
executive director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. "At the same time, 
we are encouraged that the authorities have acknowledged the abuse and are 
saying that three members of the security forces have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this early stage of Palestinian self-rule, the authorities need to send 
clear signals that violations of human rights will not be tolerated, and we 
hope that their handling of this death in detention will exemplify this 
approach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Abu Medein, Human Rights Watch also urged the Palestinian 
Authority to establish an office where complaints about police abuse, as well 
as other human rights violations, can be made by prisoners, their lawyers and 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington-based human rights group Solidarity International also said it 
was investigating after receiving a complaint from Jarbou's family. Arafat has 
promised Amnesty International that the Palestinians will apply internationally 
recognized human rights standards in the autonomous Gaza Strip and the Jericho 
District in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its annual report, Amnesty said last week that Palestinian groups 
"continued grave human rights abuses, including torture and deliberate and 
arbitrary killings."

DEATH OF NORTH KOREA'S KIM RATTLES G-7; DIPLOMACY: NUCLEAR STANDOFF WITH 
PYONGYANG WILL DOMINATE TALKS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung sent a tremor of anxiety through 
the Naples meeting of the world's leading industrial nations Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the advanced nations sought to put the best face on developments 
since the death, but they privately acknowledged their deep concern about what 
many view as the world's most dangerous trouble spot. And as they scrambled for 
scarce information, they said the death of the 82-year-old dictator would push 
the North Korean nuclear standoff to the top of political talks scheduled for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kim's death temporarily shut down talks between North Korea and the 
United States over Pyongyang's nuclear program, President Clinton said he saw 
"good news" in the request of North Korean negotiators in Geneva that U.S. 
officials remain in Switzerland for talks that may resume after Kim's funeral, 
in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks, which entered their third round Friday, are aimed at resolving a 
dispute over what U.S. officials fear may be North Korean use of radioactive 
power plant fuel for bomb-building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that they will stay with their policy and stay with their course 
-- that this reflects the feelings of the leadership in North Korea, and not 
simply the feelings of Kim Il Sung," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that U.S. military officials had decided against calling an alert for 
the 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea after an inspection showed "there was no 
evident, alarming change." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Clinton stopped short of praising Kim's heir apparent, Kim Jong Il, whom 
U.S. officials have in the past described as erratic, dissipated and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know something about him, obviously, but I haven't met him," Clinton said 
tersely when asked his view on the likely North Korean ruler. The younger Kim 
has rarely been seen and has never met U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Other world leaders at the meeting interrupted their economic discussion to 
interrogate Clinton on how he plans to react to the developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they wanted to know from me was what happens now," Clinton said. But he 
acknowledged that "we don't have any more information." 
</P>
<P>
 The summit brought together the leaders of the United States, Japan, Germany, 
France, Canada, Italy and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, clearly searching for hopeful signs in a murky situation, said 
they saw some evidence that a cadre of officials, perhaps led by Kim Jong Il, 
was taking charge. They said the fact that Kim's death was not formally 
announced until 32 hours after it occurred suggested that a leadership group 
was deliberating over affairs of state. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials went out of their way to try to quash speculation that the 
death might be the result of a coup, saying they had no evidence that the cause 
was anything other than a heart attack, as officially reported. They said there 
were no signs of ominous troop movements in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who said he had been in talks on 
developments on the Korean peninsula since early Saturday, said U.S. officials 
will be "watching this with great care." 
</P>
<P>
 And another U.S. official acknowledged that no matter what the United States 
might want to do about the succession, "we have exactly zero influence over 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign ministers of Japan, South Korea and Britain were quick to assert their 
view that the death will not disturb the unstable chemistry of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said he believes the situation will not 
"negatively disturb the situation on the peninsula."

HILLARY CLINTON PLAYS HOOKY; ITALIANS SCRAMBLE FOR JOG TOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Neapolitans call it "dolce far niente" -- sweet indolence. It is the 
Mediterranean talent for leaving stress behind, and sitting back to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is taking in the sights and the culture while 
President Clinton attends summit meetings, has already adopted the local 
custom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so happy and relaxed here," she said during an impromptu interview at 
the Villa Pignatelli art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, turning her back on an official spouse dinner and night at the ballet, 
Mrs. Clinton took a tour on the famed Amalfi coast, culminating in a concert in 
Ravello. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian press didn't appreciate Mrs. Clinton playing hooky. The newspaper 
Il Mattino criticized her for not going to the ballet and dinner hosted by 
Veronica Lario Berlusconi, wife of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 If she felt slighted, Mrs. Berlusconi didn't show it as she posed with Mrs. 
Clinton Saturday. The two shared a laugh as they in unison took off their 
sunglasses for photographers at the Sant'Elmo fortress and then immediately put 
them back on. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton also discomfited his hosts a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian police apparently didn't realize until the last minute that they 
would have to accompany Clinton on his morning run along the Naples seafront 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to haul a sportswear store owner out of bed at 4 a.m. to get their 
outfits, three sets of shorts, T-shirts, jogging shoes and sweatbands. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost came to $570. "They told me to send the bill to the (Italian) prime 
minister's office," store owner Giovanna Maurelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of Clinton's trade plan wasn't the only setback for the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House put out a T-shirt with caricatures of the summit leaders, 
which is a popular souvenir. Just one problem: It has the wrong Japanese prime 
minister on it.

HOW THE LEGAL WEB CAN SPIN OUT OF CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How does the cleanup of Superfund sites get so entangled in legal maneuvering? 
The following is a worst-case scenario, but it reflects the way that legal 
dramas at several Superfund sites have played out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Superfund program, 
frequently uses a pool of federal funds to conduct preliminary cleanup of sites 
that are found to pose an immediate danger to the health of surrounding 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, while the EPA begins to investigate the scope and cost of a more 
permanent cleanup, it attempts to find the "potentially responsible parties" -- 
usually those that have contributed most significantly to the contamination -- 
even if their actions were legal at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 It sues them for the cost of cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The potentially responsible parties -- or PRPs, as they are called in 
Superfund argot -- then try to find others who may have contributed to the 
site's pollution but who were not named by the EPA as liable for cleanup costs. 
The PRPs sue them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, each of the PRPs sues its property and casualty insurers in 
hopes that they will cover a share of the cleanup cost. The insurance firms 
normally argue that the liability preceded their coverage or was not included 
in it and refuses to pay. The insurers countersue in an effort to establish 
that they are not liable for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the parties socked with cleanup responsibilities by the EPA try 
a risky and usually costly legal maneuver, suing the federal agency in an 
effort to make it accept a cheaper method of cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, small polluters sued for recovery of cleanup costs by big polluters 
hire attorneys to fight the lawsuits. MELISSA HEALY

TORRANCE TRUCK DRIVER ARRESTED IN SEIZURE OF 7,200 POUNDS OF COCAINE

<P>
 A California truck driver was in custody Saturday after authorities seized 
nearly 7,200 pounds of cocaine valued at $500 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drug Enforcement Administration, the Pecos Police Department's 
drug-sniffing dog and the Texas Department of Public Safety found the drugs 
Thursday after a tractor-trailer was stopped on Interstate 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck driver, Khaled Alsawas, 43, of Torrance was charged with possession 
with intent to distribute cocaine. He remained in Midland County Jail. U.S. 
District Judge John G. Hyde ordered Alsawas held without bail until Tuesday, 
when a federal detention hearing is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Beery estimated the drugs' street value at $500 
million.

 The following message, on 1992 Pulitzer Prize-winner Jane Smiley's answering 
machine at Iowa State University in Ames, illustrates one writer's attempts to 
deal with the fallout that can accompany the prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Hi.This is Jane Smiley. I'm on leave this semester, so I'm not coming into the 
office, so please do not leave a message on this machine because I probably 
won't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to write to me, please send a stamped, self-addressed envelope 
with your letter. Otherwise, I won't be able to reply. If you listen to the 
rest of this announcement, though, your questions may be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 1. I can't sign books because I'm not coming into the office and it's too 
onerous a task for the secretaries to have to carry them around. 
</P>
<P>
 2. I'm not taking any more speaking engagements in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 3. I don't have time to send biographical information or interpretive words 
about my novels to book clubs or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 4. I don't have time to read manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
 5. I'm not taking any more journalistic assignments for the rest of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 I do read my mail, but since I don't get here very often and because I have a 
new baby and two big projects I'm working on, I don't answer it very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 If you still have something you want to write me about, please feel free to do 
so in care of the English Department here, and don't forget your stamped, 
self-addressed envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, thank you for calling, and I appreciate your interest, and, um, 
'bye.

BILL BOYARSKY: SIMPSON MURDER CASE; SOME JUDGES MIGHT WANT TO LEARN WHAT THIS 
REPORTER DID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting this week, I'll be back at the same old newsstand after several days 
on America's hottest story, O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the experience was an education. Except for a school desegregation 
trial several years ago, I hadn't covered the courts since early in my career. 
I had no preconceived notions -- or, unfortunately, much knowledge of 
procedure. Colleagues helped me with procedure, as did my brother Jeff, a 
criminal defense attorney in San Mateo County. For the most part, I approached 
the assignment without the background, or baggage, that I bring to political 
campaigns, government meetings, community protests and our occasional riot and 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 That was viewed as a plus when my editors assigned me to write a daily 
commentary on the preliminary hearing. Educate our readers, they said, while 
you educate yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we knew the proceedings might exceed the known limits of sensational 
journalism, we also thought they could provide a lesson in the criminal justice 
system which, despite all the coverage it receives, is still misunderstood and 
disrespected. 
</P>
<P>
 The extreme public interest in the Simpson case magnified every detail of the 
system. Procedures that would be ignored by the press in the usual hearing 
would be headlines. Although this distorted the system, it also exposed it to a 
public that does not normally get excited about a motion to suppress evidence 
or the 4th Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We called the column The Spin because we wanted to explain how the prosecution 
and defense shape their actions to influence the public, especially potential 
jurors. Spinning, a term born of political campaigns, means presenting a 
candidate, or client, to the press in the best light. It's become as important 
in high-profile legal cases as in political campaigns. "The lawyer's role 
suddenly broadens to include the task of commentator and manager," Simpson's 
attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, once wrote in a legal journal. "In fact, the 
lawyer's function as a spokesperson is maybe as important to the outcome of a 
case as his advocacy skills in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 I'd seen television change political campaigns. But until I walked up Spring 
Street from The Times to the Criminal Courts Building in the mornings, past the 
satellite trucks massed in the parking lot and the commentators outside the 
11th-floor pressroom, I didn't understand what a profound influence it could 
have on the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Television has made us more aware of crime, more fearful even in neighborhoods 
where crime rates are low. Television's unforgiving magnifying glass has 
exposed judges and juries to praise and ridicule for their decisions. In the 
Simpson case, with commentators dissecting every move, the focus has distorted 
the process but it has also opened it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about what we saw. The cops were forced to convince the judge that they 
didn't burst into Simpson's estate on a whim. The prosecution's witnesses had 
to defend their scientific evidence. We watched the defense question the 
experts. The judge had to explain her reasoning at length, and in detail. 
Millions watched this. 
</P>
<P>
 This is important because of widespread skepticism about the courts, 
particularly in minority communities. Even after the intense coverage of the 
Simpson hearing, many blacks remain unconvinced that Simpson is getting a fair 
shake. 
</P>
<P>
 The only remedy for that is to make sure the process stays open. That's our 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the job of the people who run the courts, especially the judges. I 
had good conversations with a couple of them, and the court public information 
personnel hustled to get me appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 But I got the feeling that some judges are nervous around the press. I 
detected a wariness. That won't work in today's high-pressure, media-dominated 
justice system. If lawyers are becoming media spinners, judges must accept the 
role of educating the public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the preliminary hearing ended Friday, I turned in my column. The 
assignment was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 But not really. My editors had done me a favor by sending me over to the 
Criminal Courts Building. I've learned a lot, and I'll stop by the courthouse 
more often. Monday, I'll be back, talking to the presiding judge for a column 
on the rigors of being the judge in a high-profile case.

 Tens of millions of Americans watched at least part of the televised

 But the version of criminal practice that viewers have seen resembles the real 
thing only to the same extent that a pristine architect's model of a cityscape 
-- perfectly tidy, immaculately clean and expensively detailed -- resembles the 
messy squalor of an actual city street. 
</P>
<P>
 The average preliminary hearing takes less than a day, often less than an 
hour, and the defense preparations are often similarly perfunctory. By 
contrast, from the debate over how many hairs could be plucked from Simpson's 
head -- a procedure that most defendants undergo summarily, and roughly, 
without benefit of judicial supervision -- to the detailed, although ultimately 
unsuccessful, presentation of a motion to suppress evidence, People vs. Simpson 
has shown the public a defendant with the money to fully exercise every right 
provided to him under the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is the most famous defendant ever arrested for murder in the United 
States, and for most middle-class Americans, his ordeal is as close as they 
ever will come to having a loved one on trial. For many Americans, the 
televised hearing may have served as a form of catharsis for the traumatic 
events surrounding the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman 
and the downfall of a man who was a hero to millions. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of catharsis -- along with a guarantee of fairness to the defendant 
-- are the traditional reasons why our system has always provided open, public 
trials. In this case, the cathartic function of the hearing has been enhanced 
by the unusual speed with which the case has come to court. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, months, sometimes years, elapse between the crime and the 
giving of public testimony. Most preliminary hearings consist of little more 
than a low-ranking police officer reading someone else's report. And even that 
seldom begins, as this hearing did, barely three weeks after the criminal act. 
To the public, that delay often frustrates the desire for a trial to provide 
closure for an awful event. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, the testimony took place while the underlying events are 
still fresh, intensively so, in the public mind. The freshness of the testimony 
could be seen in the court proceedings, particularly the sometimes fumbling 
testimony of key witnesses. Prosecutors clearly did not have time to coach 
witnesses on how best to provide their recollections. The testimony, at times, 
had a note of spontaneity usually missing from trials. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who sat glued to their television screens watching this hearing 
unfold should not mistake this case -- or other high-profile courtroom dramas 
such as the recent Menendez brothers' trial -- for what normally goes on in the 
nation's courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-eight years ago, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that "there can 
be no equal justice when the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of 
money he has." But Black's admonition remains a hope, not a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider for a moment the case of People vs. Mayfield, tried a few years ago 
in San Bernardino and recently upheld by the state's highest court. Like 
Simpson, Demetrie L. Mayfield was a black defendant accused of killing a woman 
he knew well and a man who appears to have been in the wrong place at the wrong 
time. And like Simpson, he faced the possibility of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about where the similarity ends. Simpson's lead attorney, Robert L. 
Shapiro, has assembled a team of half a dozen lawyers plus forensic 
pathologists, criminal investigators, analysts and paralegals to defend his 
client. Already, the attorneys have spent hundreds of hours in preparing the 
case, and the bill is expected to run into the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayfield's attorney, by contrast, practiced alone. According to court records, 
his entire preparation for the case encompassed 40 hours. The attorney 
conducted only one substantive interview with his client -- on the morning the 
trial began. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who appealed Mayfield's conviction argued, as is often done in capital 
cases, that the low level of representation Mayfield got violated his right, 
under the Constitution's 6th Amendment, to have the "effective assistance of 
counsel." Because of a series of Supreme Court decisions that have lowered the 
standard for what "effective assistance" means, those claims are increasingly 
difficult to make. In Mayfield's case, appellate judges conceded that the 
defense was less than zealous but concluded that no harm had been done. The 
evidence was so overwhelming that no defense would have helped much anyway, the 
courts ruled. Mayfield now sits on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayfield's case is hardly the worst. After all, his conviction has withstood 
attack. Despite the Supreme Court's lowered standards, the level of criminal 
defense remains so poor, particularly in Southern states, but at times in 
California as well, that appellate judges in some cases have no choice but to 
overturn convictions and death penalties on grounds that the lawyers were 
simply incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, our entire system, with its understaffed prosecutors' offices, 
overcrowded court dockets and harried public defenders, survives only because 
of a seldom-acknowledged bargain: We provide extensive rights to criminal 
defendants in theory, but do so in a system that usually allows only the 
affluent to employ those rights in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 If every accused defended himself as Simpson has done, the criminal justice 
system would rapidly collapse under the strain. Although Simpson's case shows 
what money can get a defendant, it also has so far demonstrated the limits to 
what money can buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson sat, day after day, at the defense table with the dulled, vacant 
expression so common to men caught up in the toils of the law. Television 
viewers could see an occasional tensing of his jaw muscles as the testimony 
rolled on, but as a defendant, he must remain passive in the face of the 
accusations against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys realize the danger -- that passivity begins to turn a 
defendant into an object. So Simpson's lawyers eventually provided him with 
paper and a pen to take notes, giving him at least some activity to pursue. 
Although the defense lawyers could do that, they were unable to do much else to 
slow the steady development of the state's case during the six-day preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing shredded Simpson's alibi, provided damaging physical evidence 
linking him to the crime scene -- the bloodstained glove, for example -- and, 
most important, revealed blood test results that strongly, although not 
conclusively, tie him to the murders. When Municipal Judge Kathleen 
Kennedy-Powell on Friday bound Simpson over for trial, she said there was 
"ample evidence to establish the strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, as we live with this case for months, we may well find that this 
hearing was the real trial on the issue of guilt and that the only questions 
left will concern Simpson's mental state and whether with so famous and 
well-liked a defendant, a jury will be inclined to grant mercy.

</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when a library patron could find a book by thumbing through 
a file drawer crammed with 3x5 index cards categorized by author, title or 
subject. Now easy-to-use computers store all of a library's holdings as part of 
a more efficient way to search for library materials. Two examples of how the 
library can work: 
</P>
<P>
 Great Mousse Hunt 
</P>
<P>
 John Smith hasn't visited his neighborhood library in a while, but he is 
confident he can find a recipe for the perfect salmon mousse. All he needs to 
know is his Dewey Decimal System, right? Wrong! Here's John's search: 
</P>
<P>
 1. John uses on-line computer to search by subject; follows instructions 
leading him to cookbook section. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Looks at fish recipes in cookbooks, remembers recipe was in newspaper 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Info-Trac computer contains back newspaper issues; he finds recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 4. John prints article with recipe. He's ready to whip up a beautiful salmon 
mousse. Job Search 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of working at the corner coffee shop, Mary Jones knows what she really 
wants is to sell real estate. Not knowing the first thing about it, she goes to 
the nearest library. Steps she takes using the library's on-line computer: 
</P>
<P>
 1. * Following instructions, she conducts subject search. Computer lists 
materials available at the Garden Grove Library. 
</P>
<P>
 2. * She reserves materials from the library via computer and gets them the 
following day at her neighborhood branch. 
</P>
<P>
 3. * Computer also directs her to microfilm collection where all magazine 
articles are kept. 
</P>
<P>
 4. * Computer supplies reel and frame number of article; she prints copy of 
article. There to Serve 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the free programs and services offered by city and county libraries: 
</P>
<P>
 * Book delivery to the homebound * Adult lecture series * Storytelling for 
children * Bookmobiles * Literacy volunteer training and tutoring * On-line 
access to county recorder for purchasing birth, death and marriage documents * 
Multicultural performing arts programs * Community rooms for group meetings * 
Electronic catalogue accessible via home computer to search and reserve 
holdings * "Grandparents and Books" program in which older people read stories 
to children Privileges and Pitfalls 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining a card for the county library system is relatively simple. Details 
vary slightly among city libraries: 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide photo I.D. proving Orange County residence and complete an 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 * If 17 or younger, a parent or guardian must sign application assuming 
responsibility for non-returned or late materials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cards must be renewed every three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * County card works at any branch of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * For substantially overdue items, borrower's name is submitted to a 
collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * If item is not returned, borrower must pay the cost plus any fines. 
</P>
<P>
 * If unreturned item is never paid for, borrower's name is submitted to TRW 
credit bureau. Inquiring Minds 
</P>

VALLEY BRIEFING: SILVER CITIZENS; A STATISTICAL PORTRAIT OF THE VALLEY'S SENIOR 
POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing older in the Valley means becoming part of a diverse and expanding 
segment of the population. Nearly 10 % of all residents in the Valley are 65 
and older, according to a Times analysis based on the 1990 census. Although the 
186,273 older residents are fairly evenly distributed throughout Valley 
communities, some areas are much grayer than others. 
</P>
<P>
 In part of Sherman Oaks, Studio City, and Toluca Lake--communities that were 
grouped together and counted as one--people 65 and older make up 15.6 % of the 
total population.  
</P>
<P>
 Cities surrounding the Valley are also home to significant populations of 
older people. In Burbank, 14.6 % of all residents are 65 and older. In 
Glendale, people 65 and older are 13.3% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 These numbers come as no surprise to advocacy groups and social service 
agencies that assist older people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known that the numbers are growing and they're going to continue to 
grow," said Marilyn Fried, acting executive director of Organization for the 
Needs of the Elderly, ONE, in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Women outnumber men in every community and every sub-category of the 65 and 
older age group, but beyond this generality, the older population is difficult 
to characterize. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can no longer consider the aged, or 65 and older as a homogeneous group," 
Fried said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are 65 tend to be more educated and of a higher economic status than 
those 85 and older, a group that is overwhelming female, Fried said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the population of older people grows, their needs are changing, Fried said. 
Senior centers and other service providers will have to re-evaluate programs 
and services to insure that they address the needs of all types of older 
people. "We're in a transition period now," she said.

FOR YOUTHS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL, A HAVEN TO CALL HOME; DAY CARE: BLAZERS 'SAFE' 
HOUSE PROVIDES CHILDREN A PLACE TO GO AFTER SCHOOL, AWAY FROM THE HAZARDS OF 
THE STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gated door of the small, one-family house swings open and two wide-eyed 
boys stand inquisitively at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 One asks, "Is this the Blazers home?" An employee then ushers them into a 
converted garage behind the Blazers Safe Haven house, where they join about a 
dozen other children, some playing basketball, others lying on exercise mats. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the front room of the home, Bennie Davenport and Gwen Bolden are 
talking about their vision -- to create a "safe haven" in every neighborhood 
where children can grow and learn, be challenged and gain confidence in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every child should be able to have someplace . . . they can walk into and 
feel safe, and feel like they can ask all these questions and play with all 
these things and leave feeling like they discovered something new," said 
Bolden, 68. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all about relationships at the Blazers Safe Haven house. The relationship 
between co-founders and directors Davenport and Bolden. Relationships between 
the kids and the instructors. And relationships the youths have with each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, Blazers Safe Haven house on West 48th Street in South-Central 
has provided youths 8 to 18 a place to go after school, away from hazards of 
the streets. The facility, open from 3 to 8 p.m. weekdays, exposes children to 
a learning environment that includes everything from lessons on agriculture, 
animal care, computer training and video projection, among other subjects, to 
basketball and academic tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep telling kids to say 'no' to drugs, say 'no' to gangs, and they want 
to know what they can say 'yes' to," said Eric White, regional trainer for 
Cities and Schools Inc., a national drop-out prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (safe haven) represents the 'yes.' They can say 'yes' to education and 
computers and agriculture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths served by Blazers Safe Haven come from a variety of backgrounds. 
Some come from broken homes or overcrowded living conditions. Some have been in 
juvenile detention centers. And others are simply looking for a constructive 
and enjoyable way to fill their free time.

 "I liked that we're learning math and karate and about respecting people's 
property," said 9-year-old Audrey Gainer, a fourth-grader at Normandie 
Elementary School. "My grandma likes that I'm here too, because if I wasn't I'd 
just be home playing by myself and being bored." 
</P>
<P>
 The safe haven operation is part of the Weed and Seed program proposed by the 
Bush Administration. While anti-drug and anti-gang initiatives make up the 
"weed" part, safe havens are the "seed" component, White said. Blazers Safe 
Haven is one of three safe havens in the state and the only one in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is funded by a $95,000 grant from the U.S. Departments of Justice, 
Education and Housing and Urban Development. The grant is doled out through 
Cities in Schools, which has opened about 20 safe havens nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 The collaborative venture brought together Davenport and Bolden, who have 
spent the past 25 and 15 years, respectively, working with youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1969, Davenport, 52, has run Blazers Youth Services Inc., an 
organization that stresses academics through an athletic program. Bolden, a 
former teacher, has been helping tutor students from South-Central schools 
since 1979 through her organization, the Gwen Bolden Youth Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolden's organization had received the funding and contract to operate a safe 
haven, but needed to find a facility. Davenport was planning to open a learning 
center in a one-family home he bought on West 48th Street. Instead, he 
remodeled the house into an 1,800-square-foot community center that houses the 
safe haven downstairs. Davenport lives upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration of Davenport and Bolden's programs allows each of the 
individual organizations to broaden the circle of youths served as well as the 
types of programs offered. 
</P>
<P>
 For 14-year-old Kinney Holley, the Blazers Safe Haven house is a place to play 
basketball and receive help in math. 
</P>
<P>
 "They taught us about the video cameras and we learned about peer pressure and 
not to do what you don't want to," Kinney explained.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization is also sponsoring a youth leadership program that allows 
teen-agers to learn about various occupations through interviews with leaders 
in the private and public sectors.  
</P>
<P>
 What makes the Blazers Safe Haven different, says Bolden, is that it is 
located in a home rather than in a school, church or public recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the smell of something cooking in the kitchen," she said. "And when 
they see Mister D (Davenport), the papa, they feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The house has been designed to provide different experiences for the youths. 
Out front, they will learn agriculture by planting on what are now barren 
patches of soil. The basement, home to three iguanas, will be the animal lab.  
</P>
<P>
 Davenport also bought the house next door and plans to expand the animal lab 
into its back yard and use the home for a think tank on youth issues.

4 PAPERS THAT FOLDED RESTART THEIR PRESSES; JOURNALISM: COMMUNITY PRESSURE AND 
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT HELP RESCUE SOUTHEAST NEWSPAPERS. THEY BEGIN PUBLISHING 
THURSDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Through an unusual combination of government support, community pressure and 
business maneuvers, the presses are ready to roll again on four weekly 
Southeast papers that folded 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers, scheduled to hit the streets Thursday, will be published by the 
Los Angeles-based Wave Newspaper Group, which entered into a joint operating 
agreement between California's two largest community newspapers in March, said 
Publisher Ric Trent. The agreement combined Urban Newspapers -- formerly 
Southern California Community Newspapers -- Northeast Newspapers and Central 
News-Wave Publications, a presence in South-Central for 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement has created a 31-paper chain serving more than 635,000 
households from Eagle Rock to Norwalk and Carson to Culver City, making it the 
nation's second-largest weekly group after the St. Louis Suburban Journals, 
said Brian Hews, chief executive officer of the Wave group. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers should recognize the familiar Bell-Maywood, Cudahy Industrial Post, 
the Huntington Park Bulletin, the Bell Gardens Review and the South Gate Press 
when the free papers land on their doorsteps this week. The papers will begin 
much where they left off on Jan. 13, 1993, their publishers said, with their 
mastheads and missions intact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast papers are the last in the chain to resume publication after a 
bank foreclosed on Southern California Community Newspapers in January, 1993. 
While the joint operating agreement has made it financially feasible for the 
papers to return, an outpouring of community and government support 
demonstrated a need for the papers. This reinforced Executive Editor and 
Publisher Art Aguilar and Publisher Trent in their efforts to bring the papers 
back.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're (the communities') only source for news that affects them," Aguilar 
said. "That's a huge responsibility. You've got to get this information out to 
these people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks after publication ceased, readers were asking their elected 
leaders to intervene to bring the papers back, demonstrating a sense of 
ownership and loyalty that illustrates the integral role the local paper plays 
in smaller towns, said Bryce Nelson, director of graduate studies at the USC 
School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It exemplifies that newspapers are terribly important to building a sense of 
political and social community and that communities that don't have them suffer 
a feeling of loss," Nelson said. "Television and radio can't fill that same 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipated comeback is a relief to area residents who, though served by 
several larger newspapers, say they miss the focus of local coverage provided 
by hometown papers. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate High School teacher Victorio Gutierrez had made a ritual of asking 
the City Council to bring a publisher to town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked them seven or eight times," he recalled. "We told them that it was 
of vital importance to have a means of communication between city leaders and 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 What Gutierrez and other residents didn't know was that after the papers shut 
down, Trent and Aguilar scrambled to hold together what was left of their 
company until they could publish again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhode Island Hospital Trust bank had foreclosed on Trent's 20 area papers 
after Trent filed for bankruptcy to protect the chain from a lawsuit over a 
classified ad for housing that read "adults preferred." After months of 
negotiation, Trent and Aguilar had believed the bank would accept an offer to 
purchase the chain for $1 million to be paid over a 13-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer fell through and within hours, the locks on their offices were 
changed and 125 employees were on the street in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bank took over, the Wave offered to help Trent's papers get financing 
if he consented to a joint operating agreement. Meanwhile, Trent and Aguilar 
rented computers and set up card tables in the offices of Northeast Newspapers, 
a separate company managed by SCCN. 
</P>
<P>
 While the chain's newspapers in Alhambra, Downey and other cities came back 
within six weeks, the company lacked the financing to immediately bring back 
the Southeast papers. City leaders felt pressured to fill an information 
vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities launched newsletters, some budgeting $12,000 annually. 
Huntington Park began the bimonthly Spectrum last August and the city of Bell 
started its Bulletin in February. In South Gate, newly elected Councilman Henry 
Gonzalez had planned to make good on a campaign promise to personally fund the 
city to print a newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 In smaller Southeast cities, however, the information gap has remained. City 
newsletters in Maywood and Cudahy became budget casualties years ago and 
getting simple information to the public became a chore. To inform city 
children of park programs, Cudahy City Manager Jack Joseph resorted to sending 
flyers to school sites for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in South Gate and Bell Gardens pressured city officials so much 
about the lack of information that the cities sent emissaries to encourage the 
papers to publish again. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar and Trent proposed that the cities, which traditionally take ads to 
publish legal notices and public service announcements, pay for advertising in 
advance to aid the papers with start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The publishers asked for a guarantee of $20,000 in advance payments for 
advertising from each city. The Bell Gardens council rejected the proposal, 
saying its members didn't like the coverage they received from the former Bell 
Gardens Review. But the South Gate council voted to immediately pay $20,000 now 
to cover advertising in the South Gate Press for the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 While the newspapers would eventually have returned without the cities' money, 
the support was critical, Hews said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; CLEANUP DIMINISHES BLIGHT ON BROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former drug and alcohol addict, Cleo Cooper used to wander around Skid Row 
streets and contribute to the blight that has given the area such a poor image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to throw down a lot of paper and stuff and thought nothing of it," 
said Cooper, 49, who lives in a homeless shelter on Winston Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But since sobering up four months ago, Cooper has taken pride in keeping 
Downtown clean through a new job program run by the Chrysalis 
homeless-assistance agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of 28 people who have been hired for the 2-month-old Broadway 
business district cleanup project, which covers a stretch of the boulevard from 
2nd to 9th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven days a week, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., an eight-member crew dressed in 
green Polo-type shirts and black pants combs Broadway with brooms, trash cans 
on wheels and walkie-talkies that are also connected to Los Angeles and 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority police. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's first day on the job was July 1. He remembered that when he was on 
Skid Row, he "used to be kind of leery about walking down Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought people down here was better than me. (Now) I find that they 
are just people, and I'm just a person. . . . For some reason when you're 
working and making a living, you feel productive." 
</P>
<P>
 Other crew members like Janice Brown, 32, are just grateful for the 
opportunity to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it. It's a very nice job," said Brown, a single mother of two boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program started in May, merchants on Broadway and passersby have 
noticed a considerable difference in the street's appearance. The crew's 
visibility has also helped ease the community's concern about safety, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them recall the unattractive street as covered with litter. 
Overflowing garbage cans at the intersections produced a foul smell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown looked like a trash camp," said Gildardo Mota, a salesman at Shoe 
Fantasy. "Now it's better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mota estimated that between May and June, business increased 60% at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 John Efferson, 37, one of the supervisors on the Broadway cleanup project, 
believes more tourists and shoppers are returning to the area because they also 
view the street-cleaning crews as citizen patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main job is trash, but we're not going to turn our backs if we see 
someone raped or robbed," Efferson said. "It's not our job to arrest people, 
but we'll report it." 
</P>
<P>
 In early June, for example, Efferson spotted a stabbing victim and contacted 
police. Paramedics were able to treat the wounded man and save his life, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup efforts have gone far beyond the expectations of those who came up 
with the idea of sweeping up Broadway's grime and litter. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was first supported in May through a $14,000 fund-raising effort 
by Lisa Schwartz, network manager for the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & 
Co.  
</P>
<P>
 "So many times, we contribute money to charitable projects and we don't get to 
see the results," Schwartz said. "It was really moving to see that everybody 
together can make an incredible difference in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Community Redevelopment Agency funded the program, and funds from 
Miracle on Broadway, a merchants association, will pay for it this month, 
officials said. Board members of the Broadway Improvement Business District, 
which represents 1,300 merchants, will vote July 20 on whether to keep 
Chrysalis on contract for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Harris, a 33-year-old former drug addict who has been on the job since 
the beginning, hopes the program will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though (the street) doesn't belong to me, I just like to see things 
clean," Harris said. "I feel proud about it. . . . I feel like I'm part of the 
city." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; SAFETY IS GOAL OF CITIZEN PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to change the perception of Chinatown as a high-crime area, a 
community group is seeking volunteers to form a citizens safety patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Chinatown Public Safety Assn., which houses a Police Department 
substation at its North Hill Street building, want the patrol program to assist 
the six officers who are regularly assigned to cover Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a lot of robberies, purse snatchings," said Bonnie Louie, the 
association's office manager. "I guess that's what's given us a bad image. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police can't do it all, (but) if we have people out there who are the 
eyes and ears of the LAPD, that alone will help deter crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Association members envision a program similar to that of Little Tokyo's 
Public Safety Patrol. A band of uniformed volunteers would walk Chinatown's 
streets on day and evening shifts with flashlights, walkie-talkies and a mobile 
phone to make 911 calls. The group is also looking for donations to help pay 
for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to meet with the Greater Little Tokyo Anti-Crime Assn., which 
runs its citizens patrol, Louie said, and "go on one of their walk-alongs and 
learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Marie Tafoya said one advantage of a safety program is visibility in 
the community, pointing to the success of the Little Tokyo citizens patrol: "It 
has been very effective in reducing some of the crime in the area. A lot of the 
transients are used to seeing these people walk the area and they don't camp 
out because they are asked to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The police will also offer volunteers training on identifying suspicious 
behavior, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie believes that local crimes are underreported because of language and 
cultural reasons. Of the six officers assigned to the Chinatown substation, 
only one can speak Chinese and the safety association's staff members are not 
trained to take crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-English-speaking crime victims often don't bother finding a translator to 
report an incident or will keep the problem to themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But such attitudes could change by having more Asians watching out for crime, 
Louie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers do not have to be bilingual. Organizers hope to start the patrol by 
August.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; ST. MARY'S TO REOPEN AS REPAIRS WRAP UP 
</P>

<P>
 St. Mary's Catholic Church, which has been closed to parishioners since the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, will reopen, possibly as soon as next weekend, 
after $250,000 in cosmetic repairs are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaffolding now reaches to the top of the arched ceiling of the church, which 
was built in 1926, as workers plaster over cracks, paint over damage and 
rebuild some of the intricate moldings that fell during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners have endured months of services in cramped, inelegant quarters in 
the church hall, but they will be treated to a special celebration when the 
church reopens, said Father Avelino Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to come back," Lorenzo said, adding that some parishioners have 
been going to other churches while the restoration work is being done. "They 
will come back because they love the church." 
</P>
<P>
 With tapered columns inside and out, the church has Oriental and Corinthian 
influences similar to other structures built in Los Angeles in the late 1920s, 
said restorer Eddie Sosa of United Staff and Stone Co. of Los Angeles. He has 
created new molds from pieces of moldings that fell from columns and corners of 
the church in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 7, workers began building eight stages of scaffolding with six feet 
between each stage. It reaches through the middle aisle and around each wall to 
give workers access to broken plaster, cracks and other damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Statues, paintings, floors and the intricate lighting fixtures inside have 
been covered with protective plastic sheets.  
</P>
<P>
 Sosa, who worked on the retrofitting and restoration of St. Mary's after the 
Whittier-Narrows earthquake in 1987, is also doing restoration work on churches 
in Pasadena and other parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This church is so old it seems we do restoration over and over," Sosa said. 
"But this church is handling it better than some of the older churches in 
Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the church had undergone a two-year, $1-million retrofit after the 
Whittier-Narrows quake, it resisted structural harm and suffered only cosmetic 
damage this time, said Robert Tabarango, who supervises work done by Driver 
Eddy, a general contractor from Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did what it's supposed to do," Tabarango said. 
</P>
<P>
 More extensive work will need to be done on the church steeple, which 
sustained deep cracks. That work should be completed by the end of August, 
Lorenzo said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; ESTRADA COURTS TO GET COMMUNITY CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Housing Authority Board of Directors has approved plans to build a 
$1.9-million community center at the Estrada Courts housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on the 13,600-square-foot center, which will include a gymnasium, 
classrooms and preschool, will probably begin within months, said Estrada 
Courts manager Phillip Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estrada Courts Resident Management Corp., a company run by residents to 
provide work at the site for residents, will not compete for the job because of 
the scope of the project, said director Abraham Paez. 
</P>
<P>
 But plans will include a provision to hire local workers, Chavez said. "The 
Housing Authority has emphasized and re-emphasized that there be all kinds of 
requirements that they hire from among residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The work should take about six months to complete. "It's imminent," said 
Chavez, "especially when you think about the fact that we've been working on it 
for four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the center include an 8,000-square-foot gym and rooms for job 
training, child care, senior citizen programs and a stage. 
</P>
<P>
 After the project is completed, residents hope to hire a job developer and 
offer employment clinics, sports and youth programs, and more resources for 
senior citizens. The center will provide residents with job opportunities as 
tutors, recreation leaders, child-care workers and computer lab technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The 143-unit complex, at 3232 Estrada St., was built 50 years ago and has 
become known in the community for its bright and numerous murals on the ends of 
each building. The center will be built in the middle of the housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the funding has come from the federal Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. An additional $200,000 will be paid by the city 
Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been involved in the planning process and will oversee the work 
as it progresses, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're involved all the way through it. At each community meeting, there's a 
tremendous amount of participation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when the providers are identified, they will come to the community and 
show their wares on what they plan to do and the residents will have the final 
say on how this goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing Authority officials expected to award a bid to a contractor on Friday. 
Executive Director Donald Smith said he hope construction will start within 30 
days after the contract is awarded. MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
 A free business-training class sponsored by the city and private companies 
aims to lower the failure rate of first-time business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Entrepreneurial Training Program run by Charo Community Development Corp. 
held a graduation ceremony June 30 for 44 of its students, among them business 
owners and people who had not yet started their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-week program discusses permits, taxes, securing a business loan, 
employee guidelines, record keeping, marketing and business law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making the learning curve much shorter," said Cynthia Flores, vice 
president of Charo and a designer of the program that has enrolled 57 so far. 
"You don't have to learn everything through the school of hard knocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Specialists in different fields, such as marketing, business law and banking, 
bring their expertise to the class from time to time.  
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Diaz, 23, who lives in El Sereno, took the course with her boyfriend 
Luis Uridiales, 24, of East Los Angeles. They are starting a lingerie business 
called Cupid's Closet. 
</P>
<P>
 The course taught them the hands-on, step-by-step process of researching 
business names and filing a petition for their own. Now they are working on the 
design of their business cards and stationery, and hope to start making 
contacts for buyers of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The course taught them to plan ahead for economic hard times and dissuaded 
them from opening a store because they cannot afford it right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know where to begin or how to get my petitions in," Diaz said. "I 
was going crazy about those things and didn't know who to ask about it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the summer, they plan to assess their business and make any 
necessary changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Luz Granados, 34, had started her International Travel agency three months 
before she learned of the course, but signed up when she decided she could 
learn from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most valuable information she found concerned low-interest 
business loans available for minorities. "I had no idea they were out there," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has learned how to make contacts with organizations that steer 
business her way. 
</P>
<P>
 Other people learn that the business world is not for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will go through the class and say, 'Wow, this is more than I want 
to do right now.' And that's important because they might find out there's no 
market for (their product)," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores is evaluating the program and wants to start an alumni group that will 
be offered training in legal issues, marketing and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The program costs $150,000 annually to operate and is offered to people living 
in the Eastside regardless of income. 
</P>
<P>
 The next 10-week session will begin in late July or mid-August, Flores said. 
The sessions take three hours per week.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; TOILET TRADE-IN AIMS TO CONSERVE WATER

 Standing beside the warehouse ramp waiting for new goods to be loaded into her 
car, Gloria Guillory admitted that her initial misgivings about getting 
low-flush toilets proved a washout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have one, and it works great," said Guillory, a Crenshaw resident who owns 
a home and an apartment building. "I wasn't sure at first if they were very 
efficient. . . . I'm getting four more. This sure beats buying them." 
</P>
<P>
 Other property owners have discovered the Water Conservation Project operated 
by FAME Renaissance, the nonprofit economic development agency run by First AME 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Metropolitan Water District and the Department of Water and Power, 
the agency has set up a center and warehouse in South-Central where customers 
can trade in their old toilets for new low-flush models that typically save DWP 
customers about 40% on water bills. Any DWP customer who brings in a water bill 
less than two months old is eligible for the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD and DWP rebates $100 on each old toilet FAME turns in. FAME buys new 
models, which usually retail for about $150, for roughly $80 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's Water Conservation Project is the busiest of the six exchange 
centers in Southern California, purchasing toilets at the rate of about 10,000 
a month since opening a Western Avenue office and warehouse 1 1/2 years ago. 
About 42,000 toilets have been given away thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 April Stokes, an account executive with the project who targets residential 
property owners, said the water agencies turned to FAME to help spread the word 
in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just weren't responding to the notices that the MWD was putting out at 
first," she said. "We're aggressive -- we send letters, flyers, make sales 
appointments and presentations. We're successful because we run this like a 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to saving countless gallons of water -- about 1 billion thus far 
-- in a city still in the throes of a drought, FAME Renaissance director Mark 
Whitlock says profits from the project help support other FAME programs, fund 
scholarships and provide jobs for residents. The center at 11100 Western Ave. 
employs about 30 clerical, computer, sales and warehouse workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job pretty much saved my bacon," said warehouse worker T'Roshia 
Blessingame. "I hadn't worked for a year and a half before I got this." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Devlugt, 27, said working as assistant project manager at the center has 
helped him develop managerial skills.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came to FAME, I didn't really know what I wanted to do 
ultimately," said Devlugt, who ran a youth program before starting at the 
center. "But I knew I was tired of standing in long employment lines. . . . 
Here I've learned a lot, from computer operation to people skills." 
</P>
<P>
 At the brisk clip that toilets are moving out of the warehouse and old ones 
are being turned in for recycling, Whitlock says the program will probably go 
another three years. But, for now, customers such as Bryant Sanders are gladly 
taking FAME's offer of exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things are pretty expensive," said Sanders, a Los Angeles homeowner who 
filled out paperwork at the center and was whisked to the warehouse in about 
six minutes. "It's a good deal." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; ARSENIO HALL OFFERS WEAPON TURN-IN DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a small step, says Arsenio Hall, but a crucial one in turning the tide 
against violence in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian and former talk-show host is sponsoring a "gun drive," a day in 
which he is calling upon anyone who has illegal firearms to turn in their 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday, Hall and police officials will be at First AME 
Church at 2270 S. Harvard Blvd. to collect guns and steer people to the 
church's employment training and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said police have agreed to ask no questions and request no paperwork from 
those who show up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one element in a campaign to pay attention to young people all 
the time, to give them positive alternatives," said Hall, who joined First AME 
10 years ago and has long been involved in its community programs, most 
recently a joint effort with several computer companies to donate computers and 
computer programs to South-Central area schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to act as a catalyst for involvement," he said. "If I can use my name 
to get the job done, spur other Hollywood or corporate people to create 
something, I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall is relying on local press, radio and television to get the word out about 
his effort. He has done numerous spots on KKBT-FM (92.3) and KJLH-FM (102.3) 
radio stations, as well as locally aired ads for the cable channel Black 
Entertainment Television. 
</P>
<P>
 Romie Lilly, executive director of the Southern Area Clergy Council, lauded 
Hall's effort but said that what is needed is improved communication among all 
grass-roots organizations working toward the same goal of nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which represents 75 Los Angeles-area churches, launched a media 
campaign last month called "Stop the Violence: Keep It Good in the Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all see violence as the problem," Lilly said. "To maximize our 
effectiveness, to change people's behavior, we need to join forces and send a 
strong, unified message." 
</P>
<P>
 Chilton Alphonse, director of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation 
in the Crenshaw district, was more critical of what he called a noble but 
largely symbolic gesture.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anything people can do to stop the violence is good, but why should people 
want to turn in guns? Not just because it's Arsenio," said Alphonse, who is 
meeting with gang members each week to help them form a nonprofit employment 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "This needs to be more thought out," Alphonse said. "If he was offering people 
a job in exchange for a gun, he might be successful with this. To effect real 
change, you have to go deeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said that though the one-day drive alone will do little to stop violence, 
it will at least serve to keep the message of peace alive in South-Central.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a way I can keep one kid from ending up dead, I'll do it." ERIN J.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: ATHENS; SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS PLANNING CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by increasing problems with gangs and violence, the County Sheriff's 
Department is working on plans to institute a curfew in the unincorporated 
Athens neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which sheriff's officials said will be worked out with additional 
community input, was proposed in April after officials monitored similar 
programs in cities such as Inglewood, Walnut Park and Huntington Beach, said 
Sheriff's Lt. Rodney Lyons. It could be in place in Athens as soon as next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curfews are being used successfully by other cities and that's why we were 
considering using it," Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jack Scully of the Lennox Station has been meeting with residents, 
church leaders and community leaders to work out which days the curfew will be 
in effect, as well as draw up a youth and gang intervention program. Currently, 
county codes allow unincorporated areas to impose curfews for minors from 10 
p.m. to dawn, with violators subject to a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan targets an area roughly bounded by El Segundo Boulevard on the south, 
Manchester Boulevard on the north, Vermont Avenue on the east and Van Ness 
Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violence in this area is terrible," Scully said, noting that this year's 
homicide rate in the area is expected to surpass that of 1993. "We're not 
trying to criminalize kids. What we'll do is bring the kids in and turn them 
over to the community and they will deal with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed curfew, however, has prompted concern from some who say it may 
add to problems in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in favor of the curfew, but I still have concerns that this just 
criminalizes young people because they're out past the curfew," said the Rev. 
M. Andrew Robinson-Gaither, pastor of Faith United Methodist Church and a 
member of the advisory board working on the curfew plan. "There ought to be 
some creative ways of dealing with these problems that impact community safety 
other than randomly arresting young people and giving them a record." 
</P>
<P>
 Scully said the curfew is not expected to require additional funding, adding 
the station would use reserve and explorer units to enforce the curfew.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; LAWYERS MAKE CASE FOR THE WORKING-CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ricardo A. Torres begins his day like most high-powered lawyers, discussing 
new cases, reviewing briefs and preparing for court dates. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike attorneys who charge hundreds or thousands of dollars in fees, 
Torres is busy preparing cases for clients whose incomes are slightly above the 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres is co-founder of Legal Corps of Los Angeles, a nonprofit group of 
attorneys and law students who provide low cost legal assistance to residents 
who make $13,069 to $20,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something meaningful with my law degree while I still had the 
interest and idealism to do it, so I helped start the group," said Torres, 29. 
"And in South-Central there is no legal assistance to help working-class 
people."  
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, Torres and Robin J. Lozoya founded the group that now includes 
eight law students from various law schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed at the Florence-Firestone Neighborhood Service Center, 7807 Compton 
Ave., the Legal Corps provides clients with legal help in housing, employment, 
family and disability law, and consumer law. 
</P>
<P>
 While Torres said the group is prepared to take on a wide array of issues, 
most cases involve elderly residents and consumer fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "There doesn't seem to be a great level of sophistication," he said. "So 
you'll see bad contracts drawn up where the person will pay the contractor but 
never have any repairs done to their home and the contract doesn't specify what 
type of repairs were supposed to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the group's clients are a couple who face foreclosure after unknowingly 
signing a $5,700 lien on their home. Their case is expected to go to trial this 
fall, Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases are all too common in South-Central, according to Torres and Robert 
Crockett, director of the Florence-Firestone center that refers clients to the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a common occurrence in this area and I try desperately to tell my 
seniors here not to sign anything," Crockett said. "From what I hear from my 
seniors, it's common for different types of salespeople to come out offering 
loans or paint jobs to people's homes. We've had incidents here where people 
will sign things because they are badgered by the salesperson once they get in 
the home."  
</P>
<P>
 While the Legal Corps has drawn praise from attorneys and community groups, 
including Crockett, who praised the group for providing badly needed legal 
assistance to the community, the group is struggling to raise funds. An initial 
fund-raising drive only netted $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres takes on private cases in addition to his work with Legal Corps to 
supplement the organization as well as meet his own living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the group is focusing on getting through the more than 60 cases, 
building links with area organizations to provide low-cost legal help, and 
training for law students like Deanna Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has exposed me to hands-on work dealing with clients rather than just 
researching in libraries," said Ellis, a third-year student at Loyola Law 
School. "And there is a joy in helping someone who has been victimized by a 
system that isn't always protecting some of their basic rights."

ILLEGAL IDS

<P>
 A two-week police stakeout of a busy corner in the Pacific Boulevard business 
district has led to 29 arrests in a crackdown on the city's burgeoning trade in 
illegal identification documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police videotaped sidewalk hawkers of $100 kits of illegal documents. Police 
raided a pharmacy June 9 in the 6900 block of Pacific Boulevard and a nearby 
bar said to be a hangout for illegal-document traders and made the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real good raid," said Officer Danny Dominguez, who videotaped hours 
of foot traffic in front of the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also recovered a laminating machine, photo equipment and fraudulent 
California driver's licenses and resident alien, Social Security and state 
identification cards. That evidence is in the hands of the district attorney's 
office, which is attempting to lift fingerprints from them, said Lt. Carl 
Heintz of the Huntington Park Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five of those arrested, believed to be low-level workers in the trade, 
were deported to Mexico by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The 
remaining four, police said, were managing the voluminous trade and will be 
held for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park police said that the INS considers the local fake document 
trade to be second only to Los Angeles in the county.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is sold here," said Dominguez, adding that local sellers are so 
aggressive that they once tried selling to city employees and got into a 
dispute when employees turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief William Reed said the city would like to rid itself of the 
under-the-counter trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a big business. No doubt about it," Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez, a six-year officer with the department on bike patrol along the 
boulevard, said that eradication is difficult because police suspect the 
illegal cards are printed in Mexico and shipped to Huntington Park, where they 
are distributed to individual rings of sellers who pass them on to the 
street-level dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those dealers, in turn, have sellers who solicit customers on the street and 
bring them to an "office" where pictures are made and cards are laminated. Most 
document traders can produce a kit in about 30 minutes, police said. BOB ELSTON

 Reactions among local store owners varied last week after the cordoning off of 
Pacific Boulevard during and after the World Cup match between Mexico and 
Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 police officers from Huntington Park and several other Southeast 
cities closed Pacific Boulevard from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday, hoping to 
prevent a replay of the previous week's confrontation between revelers and 
local police. After Mexico's 1-1 tie with Italy that assured the team a berth 
in the ensuing round, more than 300 officers used rubber bullets and pepper 
spray to control a crowd of 5,000 elated fans. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tepid reactions to Mexico's loss, Salvador Salcedo, the owner of 
Marina Tours travel agency just off Pacific Boulevard, claimed police concern 
over fans' behavior was unjustifiably inflated. "The large police presence here 
isn't justified," Salcedo said. "The American just isn't accustomed to what we 
call futbol. " 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan Mattar of La Sorpresa clothing store called the entire day bad for 
business owners. Mattar, who said he probably lost $500 to $1,000 in receipts 
with the street's closure, said he didn't care about the police presence or the 
results of the day's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to my customers, but not to me, since it doesn't pertain to my 
country," Mattar said in Spanish. "I'm not Mexican but Lebanese." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mattar's neighbors on the other side of Pacific Boulevard, Ibrahim 
Karim of California Sports Wear, said he was quite pleased with the police 
turnout, especially after the previous week's outpouring of exuberance among 
Mexico's fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to lose a little money while maintaining security," Karim stated, 
while loudly welcoming browsing customers into his store. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's 150-strong joint operation among forces from Huntington Park, the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and several Southeast cities resulted 
in 15 arrests. Six of those arrested were charged with assault with a deadly 
weapon on an officer, after rocks were thrown at police.  
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park's overall costs are expected to exceed $20,000. Overtime costs 
alone for the afternoon's operation were about $13,000, according to Lt. Steve 
Peeley of the Huntington Park Police Department. Several thousand dollars in 
regular pay and equipment costs are expected to be added to that amount, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other law enforcement costs are unknown, although Capt. Gary Kennedy of South 
Gate said his city's final figure would be "a bundle." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: MAYWOOD; HE PUTS THE BRAKE ON CAR THEFTS

 While cruising the city streets, Officer Sean Richardson once bet his patrol 
partner $5 that the car they had just passed was stolen. Within 20 seconds, 
they had run a license plate check and Richardson was $5 richer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt it," he said later. The driver of the stolen car "just gave me 
that look." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year officer's gut feelings have served him well 29 times in the past 
year: He recentlywon the 10851 Award from the Southern California Automobile 
Club and the California Highway Patrol. (The state penal code label for a 
stolen car is 10851.) The award is given to police officers who recover at 
least 12 stolen cars in a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think it is my skill," Richardson said. "But there is 
probably some luck involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson's success rate is impressive given that he works in one of the 
smallest cities in the state. Of his 29 recoveries, 23 had been stolen, parked 
and abandoned, and six were "rolling recoveries." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson has developed a technique that has earned him a reputation as a car 
thief's worst enemy. "I have what I call mind tricks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While out on patrol, he looks for American-made cars that are popular with 
thieves and easiest to steal. He will drive up next to the passenger window and 
look in at the ignition to see if it has been punched, and, at the same time, 
glance at the driver's expression.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, he'll drop back well behind the car and turn on his flashing lights. If 
the driver runs, it's most likely stolen. If the driver doesn't attempt to 
escape, Richardson will often take the next turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said an auto owner's best defense is a security system with a 
homing device. Most police cruisers can receive signals from such devices, 
which make it simple to locate a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no perfect defense, he said. "If a criminal wants your car, he 
will get it." BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; HOTEL CALIFORNIAN ORDERED CLOSED

<P>
 City inspectors have ordered the owners of the Hotel Californian to shut down 
the single-room occupancy hotel, citing extensive hazardous conditions brought 
about in part by a June 25 blaze that caused $90,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners on Tuesday were given 48 hours by the city Department of Building 
and Safety to shut down the building while officials tried to relocate some of 
the residents.Many of the 60 or so residents of the five-story building were 
not paying rent, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-room hotel at 1907 W. 6th St. had been cited for about 20 safety 
violations by officials from the city's Housing Slum Task Force. The fire 
damaged one wing of the building's top floor and made the hotel unsafe for 
occupancy, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Richard Bobb, who heads the slum task force, said the city 
attorney's office plans to prosecute the five listed owners of the building for 
failure to comply with safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobb said no one has taken responsibility for the property or is taking proper 
care of the building, which is infested with rodents and roaches and has rooms 
with gaping holes in the ceilings and walls. LUCILLE RENWICK

<P>
 A $25,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of two men who assaulted, raped and robbed five women during a home 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, armed with handguns, broke into the house in the 800 block of South 
Norton Avenue about 8:30 p.m. May 29, police said.The assailants filled 
pillowcases with household items and stole two cars from the driveway after 
sexually assaulting and beating the five women. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward was established Tuesday by the City Council. Police Detective Mike 
Buttitta said friends of victims are gathering resources and hope to double 
that reward. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the stolen cars was abandoned and set on fire in the 4300 block of 
Exposition Boulevard the morning after the incident, and the second was 
discovered abandoned June 3 in a vacant lot near Washington and Crenshaw 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Police describe one suspect as a 20- to 24-year-old black male, about 6 feet 
tall and weighing 180 to 200 pounds. Witnesses said he wore black pants and a 
Los Angeles Raiders jacket during the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The second suspect was described as a thin 17- to 20-year-old black male, 
about 5-feet-9. Witnesses said he was wearing black pants and a black jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the incident or suspects should call Buttitta at 
(213) 485-2921, or, after-hours and on weekends, the tip hot line at (213) 
485-2504. Tipsters may remain anonymous. GEOFF BOUCHER

<P>
 Renovation work is under way at the historic Memorial Branch of the Los 
Angeles Public Library at 4625 W. Olympic Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, first opened in 1930 but closed in 1990 after it failed to meet 
earthquake safety standards, will be reinforced to comply with seismic codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation project will also include the building of a small addition, 
installation of air conditioning and carpeting, electrical improvements and an 
effort to make the library more accessible to disabled patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.8-million project is funded by Proposition 1, the 1989 library bond 
issue, and the city's Capital Improvement Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary branch at 4801 Wilshire Blvd. will remain open until the 
original branch is reopened in early 1996, library spokesman Peter Persic said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: CIRCUS VISITS PERSHING SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come and see a man juggle a 140-pound table -- with his feet -- a woman dangle 
in the air from a trapeze and clowns mime a Ping-Pong match. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just some of the highlights when the L.A. Circus visits Pershing 
Square this weekend, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Barnum and Bailey's "Greatest Show on Earth," but event organizers 
say their 80-foot by 80-foot makeshift circus ring will offer a more "intimate" 
experience for the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one sits more than 30 feet from the ring," said Dick Monday, artistic 
director. "It makes it a lot more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 The shows -- noon and 5:30 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m. and noon Saturday -- will 
also feature a female rope artist, a six-piece live band, three clowns and a 
Boston terrier named Genki, derived from part of the Japanese phrase for "How 
are you?" Monday said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Barnhill, executive director of the Downtown Marketing Council, said the 
circus shows will be the last CeLAbrate Downtown promotional event this summer. 
They are geared to tourists and families as well as Downtown employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost per ticket is $6. Information: (213) 482-3733.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; JANITORS PRESS FOR $150,000 IN PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Korean and Latino janitors gathered last week at a U.S. Department of Labor 
office to call for a federal investigation of a Koreatown-based cleaning 
company they accuse of defrauding employees and subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The janitors and a workers' advocacy group gathered Thursday at federal 
offices in Glendale to publicize their campaign to recover more than $150,000 
in unpaid back wages they say are due them from the Koreatown-based A-1 
Building Maintenance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been deceived," said Thomas Argumedo, a former A-1 employee who 
claims he is owed for months of work. "We want justice." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates, a group that has 
organized the effort against A-1 and its owner, Jin Yang, said the two-dozen 
janitors would also be asking the district attorney's office to investigate the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Thomas Bleau, who represents Yang, could not be reached for comment. 
Bleau has maintained that his client is an honest businessman who has been 
victimized by a bad economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The advocacy group claims that A-1 purchased contracts from building owners 
and then found subcontractors to do the work, a common industry practice. But 
some of those subcontractors say their paychecks from A-1 slowed or even 
stopped as time went on, and they turned to the advocacy group a few months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Those subcontractors, all from the Korean community, were joined in their 
complaints last month by several Latino janitors, all of them direct employees 
of A-1. Lee said the claims by those employees has placed the dispute within 
the purview of the Department of Labor. The employees filed wage claims with 
the federal agency last week. GEOFF BOUCHER

CULTURE CLASH; AFRICAN AMERICANS AND AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS SEEK A PATH TO COMMON 
GROUND, BUT MISCONCEPTIONS, STEREOTYPES CLUTTER THE WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up in Senegal in the 1960s, Ousmane Drame envisioned America as a hip, 
socially enlightened land of plenty where black people enjoyed the wealth and 
social prominence of pop stars such as Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Drame, 42, and his friends dreamed of the day they would cross the Atlantic 
and meet up with their American counterparts, who would no doubt greet them 
with black power salutes, discuss the philosophies of their mutual hero, 
Malcolm X, sport the same Afro hairstyles they had adopted and embrace them as 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Drame finally came to Los Angeles in 1979 to pursue an education in 
flight instruction, he was rudely awakened. Not only was he not wholly embraced 
by black Americans, he was frequently stung by remarks about his French accent 
and inane questions about whether he carried a spear or if the town he grew up 
in had plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are brought up with a great ignorance of Africa," said Drame, who 
lives with his sister in the Mid-City area. "The things some black people say 
about it -- even educated, professional people -- upset me at one time. But not 
any more. I'm used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Drame's experiences are shared by many African immigrants in Los Angeles' 
black community. Despite the popularity of African hairstyles, dress, art and 
music on the streets and in the shops of Crenshaw and South-Central, Africans 
and black Americans remain divided by vastly different cultures, history and 
persistent misconceptions about each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a growing number of groups are working to bridge the gap, Africans say 
most Americans either romanticize Africa as a monolithic motherland or -- more 
commonly -- think of it as an interesting but faraway place too physically and 
culturally remote to relate to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could it be otherwise?" said Earl Ofari Hutchinson, an author and 
lecturer on the socioeconomic conditions of blacks in America. "Other than the 
basic trappings -- the kente cloth, kufi hats and hairstyles -- we're American. 
In spite of the mystical thing a lot of black people have about Africa, there 
really is no connection." 
</P>
<P>
 Drame, though he says he enjoys good relationships with his American neighbors 
and acquaintances, agrees. "Many blacks here don't want to admit it, but they 
are much more American than they are African," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try and take (African culture) on, but it doesn't work," he says. "I see 
a lot of things that are different, not African at all. Here, there is too much 
pressure to achieve money -- the American Dream. . . . People are too concerned 
about selling themselves, about image."  
</P>
<P>
 Drame and other immigrants say that at the root of the misperceptions is 
geographical and historical ignorance. Too many Americans think of Africa as 
one country, rather than the world's largest continent containing 52 nations 
and thousands of ethnic groups and languages. Even West Africa, the region 
where most black Americans can trace their roots, boasts more than 20 countries 
and a vast array of peoples, languages and customs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their symbolic importance to black Americans, Africans are a 
relatively small percentage of the total immigrant population countywide. 
According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 28,850 Africans from all nations live in Los 
Angeles County; by contrast, the number of immigrants from Mexico is 1.2 
million. Among the immigrants from Africa, Egyptians make up the largest group 
at 10,271, followed by 3,363 South Africans, 2,900 Nigerians and 2,890 
Ethiopians. 
</P>
<P>
 Africans are scattered all over the region, from South-Central to suburbs as 
far-flung as Riverside. And though an African business community is thriving in 
the predominantly black Crenshaw district, few African merchants are members of 
the local Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're sometimes reluctant to join because of language differences," said 
Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce President Ted Fortier. "And it may be cultural. 
Whatever the case, they don't speak up." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a quick tour of Crenshaw and nearby Leimert Park reveals a strong 
African presence, from hair salons to record shops to boutiques offering 
custom-made sandals and African garb. The highest concentration is on a short 
stretch of Degnan Boulevard in Leimert, where galleries, studios and shops 
offer the widest selection of African-themed goods in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this visual feast, says Crenshaw merchant Elizabeth Yiaba, is for the most 
part just that -- on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some black people here who are curious to find out what Africa is 
all about, but I've found many more differences than parallels," said the 
30-year-old Sierra Leone native, who owns an African goods boutique called 
Yaba's Collection. "What some people may think is that skin color is enough to 
bind us together. But it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Yiaba began a local cable talk show a year and half ago that strives to 
demystify Africa for Americans, and vice versa. For all their talk about black 
pride, she says, Americans harbor negative views about Africa, views that are 
fed by constant media images of floods, famine, tribal wars and political 
turmoil.  
</P>
<P>
 "Americans don't want to say it, but they are still ashamed of Africa. Many of 
them think of it as primitive," she said. "My 5-year-old daughter, who was born 
here, came home one day from school and told me she had told other children she 
was African. They laughed at her, teased her. She told me, 'Mommy, I'm not 
telling them that any more. I'm telling them I'm American.' Already, she wants 
to hide her identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Dieynaba Gaye, 33, said that when she came to America from Senegal in 1984, 
her elaborate braids and traditional brocade and damask dresses were considered 
an oddity. Though she sees them on every street corner now, she wonders if 
their popularity is simply a passing fad. Still, she is glad that blacks from 
Jesse Jackson to high school students are embracing something about Africa 
"even if they don't understand its significance." 
</P>
<P>
 Deeper, socioeconomic issues separate the two groups, Gaye said. Like other 
immigrant groups, most Africans come to America seeking college educations and 
business opportunities, and some are disdainful of black Americans, whom they 
perceive as mired in poverty because of laziness or lack of initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are cultural stereotypes on both sides," she said. "I always thought 
black Americans were light-skinned, had long hair, drove nice cars -- the Ebony 
and Essence magazine images. I thought American streets were paved with gold.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got here, to Washington D.C., I saw an old black woman begging 
for food in the dead of winter. I said to my friend, 'What, in America?' I 
couldn't believe my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Anyiam, publisher of the African Times, a community newspaper for 
Africans living in Los Angeles, says the hard-work ethic that Africans share 
with other immigrants fosters resentment among some black Americans, who see 
black foreigners succeeding while they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the same immigrant mentality as everyone else. We don't really work 
any harder than we do in our own countries," said Anyiam, who is Nigerian. "But 
you have to realize, 80% of African immigrants here came because of education. 
They don't represent the masses, the poor. But the elite stereotype adds to the 
mutual distrust that's already there." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there are, and for many years have been, efforts to bring Africans and 
African Americans together in more meaningful and lasting ways than weekend 
festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a wealth of shops and galleries, the Crenshaw district boasts the 
African American Cultural Center, where prominent Africans frequently host 
public forums; the Marcus Garvey School, an institution that steeps its 
curriculum in African history; and Degnan Boulevard's Museum in Black, filled 
with artifacts that stunningly detail both African and American histories: 
ebony masks, spears, tools, rusted slave manacles, documents announcing public 
slave auctions in the early 1800s, grinning Aunt Jemima figurines. 
</P>
<P>
 That persistent American longing to connect to a heritage nearly dismantled by 
generations of slavery and institutionalized oppression is what fuels the 
effort to reach out to Africans, says Museum in Black owner Brian Breye. With 
the whirlwind decline of South African apartheid and the ascendancy of Nelson 
Mandela to the presidency of the country, Breye said, the interest in Africa 
among black Americans is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had negative or semi-negative views of Africa, but that's 
changing," he said. "Africa is becoming the 'in' thing now. I don't think it's 
a fad this time. Now that blacks are moving up on the world scene, there are 
real possibilities for developing economic ties." 
</P>
<P>
 Nikki Tesfai, director of the African Community Refugee Center in 
Mid-Wilshire, which serves chiefly Somali and Sudanese immigrants, shares some 
of Breye's optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been a point where I could just pick up the phone and call an 
American to take in a (refugee African) family. It's not an automatic 
relationship between Americans and Africans," said Tesfai, an East African 
native. "But things have gotten much better in the last 10 to 15 years. There 
is more awareness, more communication." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ghanaian-born actress Akuyoe Graham has been breaking down biases for the past 
several years with the universal language of art. Graham says she consistently 
gets cathartic responses from American audiences to her one-woman show, "Spirit 
Awakening," which chronicles her own struggle to establish her ethnic identity 
in Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids cry, teachers cry after seeing the show," said Graham, who tours and 
conducts autobiography workshops at inner-city schools and juvenile halls. 
"They suddenly realize that Africa is not what they see in newspapers. They see 
that they are much more than former slaves. . . . In my view, all black people 
are Africans. We're beginning to accept that as truth." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a truth that Melva Parhams believes in so strongly that she is leading a 
campaign to officially declare the Crenshaw district the African International 
Village. Working with Africans and black Americans, Parhams and the African 
International Village Assn. have lobbied local politicians and others to 
designate Crenshaw as a black business and cultural enclave much like Chinatown 
and Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to go past all that Tarzan, headhunting, cannibal mentality," 
Parhams said in AIVA's Crenshaw Boulevard office, outfitted with computers and 
drafting boards. "We need to acknowledge our proud history of pharaohs, queens, 
chiefs. In this country, we're all just kidnaped Africans." 
</P>
<P>
 Civil engineer Ken Eke says he and other AIVA members believe that Americans 
can profit both culturally and economically by joining forces with African 
business people and professionals like himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Africa, we create welfare for each other. You are taught to strive for 
education, do whatever you can to benefit your family and community of 
friends," said Eke, who is Nigerian. "We don't have government social security 
or welfare, we do for ourselves. There is much that Americans can learn from 
us." 
</P>

 Michael Williams is one American who is trying to do just that. Williams, 
owner of Leimert Park's Comedy Act Theater, has been hosting cultural-exchange 
gatherings of Africans and Americans at his Inglewood home to help bridge the 
gap. He made a vow to himself while recovering from cancer that he would try to 
extend his lifetime admiration of African cultures to other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt Africa was my home, ever since I was a kid," Williams said 
at a recent get-together, dressed in a dashiki emblazoned with the words, 
"Afrika Spirit." "It's really all on us as Americans to learn about Africa. I 
wanted to create a forum where Americans could meet as many Africans as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 During the party, impassioned responses to questions -- Is Liberia still 
considered an American homeland? To what extent are women repressed? -- filled 
the high-ceilinged living room packed with Nigerians, Senegalese, Ghanaians, 
Cameroonians, Swazis and a contingent of curious Americans. The afternoon event 
lasted well into the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 The exchanges left Sissoko Aboubacar, a Senegalese businessman, determined to 
keep trying to bring Africans and African Americans together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make changes ourselves, as people of African descent," he said. 
"There are many things we could do together, that we could do tomorrow, but we 
don't. The bottom line is, we have to get with each other." AFRICAN IMMIGRATION 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 28,850 African immigrants live in Los Angeles County, according to 
1990 U.S. Census figures. More than half that number -- 15,238 -- immigrated 
here between 1980 and 1990.

 There is small chance that doll lover Carole Kaye will ever forget to thank 
the little people. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaye has turned a personal fascination with dolls and dollhouses into the 
Carole and Barry Kaye Museum of Miniatures, a 14,000-square-foot showroom 
featuring intricately detailed replicas of people, places and periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Ella Fitzgerald and a beaming Louis Armstrong play in a Hollywood Bowl the 
size of a television. A Japanese empress no taller than a pencil strolls past 
an 18th-Century teahouse and a pond full of colorful koi. And rawhide drifters 
amble down the dusty streets of a Lilliputian-size Old West frontier town. 
</P>
<P>
 Other famous shrunken faces include designer Galia Bazylko's collection of 
American First Ladies, from Martha Washington through Nancy Reagan, decked out 
in their inaugural gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, which includes a gift shop that sells miniatures and a video tour 
of the Kaye collection, opened last month after moving from a smaller Century 
City location. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kaye Museum of Miniatures, 5900 Wilshire Blvd., is located across from the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art; 10 a.m. through 5 p.m. Tuesday through 
Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday; $7.50 for adults, $6.50 for those 60 
and older, $5 for students, $3 for children younger than 12; (213) 937-6464.

CITY'S BEST MUST PROVE THEMSELVES ALL OVER AGAIN

 The time has come for the area's Great Eight to conquer new basketball 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving indelible marks in Central City high school basketball, Toby 
Bailey, Tommie Davis, Tremaine Fowlkes, Dayron Harris, Kris Johnson, Reggie 
McFerren, Andre Miller and David Rickenbacker seek to do the same at the 
Division I college level. 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition is not always an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes high school heroes find themselves sitting on college benches. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowds grow larger and the stakes higher, these players must expand 
their games to compete with the increase in talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is armed with a formidable weapon, which makes his game stand out: 
</P>
<P>
 * McFerren is a marksman from the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harris and Johnson are "wide bodies" who dominate around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bailey, Fowlkes and Rickenbacker run the floor like track stars and finish 
off fast breaks with highlight-reel slam dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Davis' quickness allows him to blow past defenders with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 * Miller can break down a defense with his offensive arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as talented as these players are, they all will have to become even 
better to receive the same recognition in college. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Bailey -- 6-5 swingman, UCLA. Bailey is a tremendous athlete and 
tenacious offensive rebounder. He was the area's best at changing ends -- 
switching from offense to defense -- and can guard point guards, shooting 
guards, small forwards and some power forwards. Bailey needs to be more 
consistent with the jump shot to open up his slashing drives to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommie Davis -- 5-9 point guard, Houston. Davis' blend of great upper-body 
strength, quick hands and low center of gravity makes him an explosive ball 
handler. Despite his size, Davis has excellent court vision and outstanding 
passing ability. Although Davis is great at making steals, many competing point 
guards will be able to shoot over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremaine Fowlkes -- 6-7 forward, Cal. Fowlkes was the area's version of the 
human highlight film. No Crenshaw game was complete without Fowlkes slamming 
home an alley-oop lob pass from Davis. Fowlkes has great hands and will finish 
anything around the basket with a dunk. He runs the floor as well as any big 
man and can rebound at either end. Because of his dominance in close, Fowlkes' 
jump-shot range remains a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayron Harris -- 6-4 forward, Long Beach State. When Harris wants a rebound, 
he gets it. Harris can play a post-up game and then step out and hit the 
medium-range jump shot. He runs the floor extremely well and knows how to wear 
down a defender with his body. Harris is foul-prone and sometimes allows 
himself to be taken out of the game by bad play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Johnson -- 6-5 forward, UCLA. Johnson has great post moves, including a 
turnaround jump shot and a fade-away. Johnson is excellent at using his body to 
get off shots and get rebounds. He's a good dribbler and can score from 18 
feet. Johnson has exhibited problems passing out of the double team and foot 
speed makes him a poor one-on-one defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie McFerren -- 6-6 guard, Kansas State. McFerren was the area's best pure 
shooter. More consistent than he is streaky, McFerren's height and long limbs 
make him an ideal shooting guard. His ability to create shots will be tested 
and he needs to work on his ballhandling skills. He will need to add weight or 
else physical defensive play will wear him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Miller -- 6-2 guard, Utah. Miller is a scoring threat from anywhere on 
the floor. He can take defenders who play him close to the basket and will 
knock down the three-point shot when given room. Miller's quickness will help 
him to shed the bigger guards he will be matched up against. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rickenbacker -- 6-4 forward, San Diego State. Rickenbacker is a 
versatile inside-outside forward. He is a great man-to-man defender and also 
does a good job helping out. Next to Bailey, Rickenbacker was the area's best 
offensive-defensive player. Rickenbacker will need to increase his jump-shot 
range.

THIS TIME, DE LA HOYA HAS TO SHARE SPOTLIGHT; BOXING: ANOTHER CROWD FAVORITE, 
JORGE PAEZ OF MEXICO, WILL TEST THE FORMER OLYMPIAN'S RING SKILLS AND THE 
LOYALTY OF HIS HOMETOWN FANS.

 The chants began even before Oscar De La Hoya entered the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "East L.A.! East L.A.!" a partisan crowd chanted during the reopening of the 
Grand Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "USA! USA! USA!" another group of fans yelled. "Mexico! Mexico! Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 As he ascended through the amateur ranks, won the United States' only gold 
medal in the 1992 Olympics and went undefeated in his first 13 professional 
fights, there was reason to cheer for De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But now that De La Hoya (13-0, 12 knockouts) is fighting for bigger purses, 
his support group is starting to erode. Not because De La Hoya did anything to 
displease his fans but because he is beginning to meet other crowd favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 29, De La Hoya, a 21-year-old East Los Angeles native and a graduate 
of Garfield High School, will fight Jorge Paez of Mexico for the vacant World 
Boxing Organization lightweight title at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be De La Hoya's toughest test mentally and professionally as a 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand Paez has a lot of support here," De La Hoya said in a news 
conference Wednesday at the Forum. "He has been one of the top attractions at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I believe my really true fans will stick with me. After July 29, the rest 
of my fans will flock back to me because they will see who the better fighter 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond his flamboyant clown outfits and his back flips in the ring, Paez has 
won the support of fans with his flashy combinations. In his 10-year 
professional career, Paez, 28, has compiled a 53-6-4 record with 35 knockouts. 
The former International Boxing Federation featherweight champion has fought in 
11 world-title bouts, two fewer than the number of fights De La Hoya has had as 
a pro. Paez's most stunning victory came in a rematch against Louie Espinoza 
when he added a WBO belt to his IBF title in 1990. His worst loss came a year 
later against Pernell Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that Oscar is meeting an accomplished opponent," 
promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank said. "This is the best fighter he has ever 
fought in the professional ranks. This is a real test for Oscar." 
</P>
<P>
 But De La Hoya is not concerned. He views Paez as just another name on a long 
list of opponents that will carry him to the top of the boxing ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paez is another steppingstone," said De La Hoya, nicknamed the Golden Boy. 
"When people heard I was going to fight Paez, they said he was going to beat 
me. They tell me that I haven't fought anyone yet. But those people booing me 
will be rooting for me."
